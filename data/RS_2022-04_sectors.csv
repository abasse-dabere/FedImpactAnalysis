investing,Why the tanking Japanese yen should concern investors,"[***This article***](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-tanking-japanese-yen-should-concern-stock-investors-morning-brief-090923267.html) ***first appeared in the Morning Brief.***

&gt;Thursday, March 31, 2022  
&gt;  
&gt;The Bank of Japan (BOJ) was in a bind on Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its currency, the yen, was crashing while yields on their government bonds were surging. The solution — [four days of unbridled bond buying](https://www.yahoo.com/video/forex-dollar-hits-6-high-194529413.html) by the BOJ to stem the hemorrhaging and contain interest rates. While the gambit worked (for now), Wall Street is waking up to this potential canary in the coal mine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Big moves in the yen are rare, but traders pay attention when the currency starts moving. It's the third most heavily-traded currency, and it's involved in trillions of dollars worth of highly levered trades. Hedge funds try to arbitrage differences in interest rates around the world by borrowing in ""cheap"" currencies (like the yen) and investing in bonds in higher-yielding countries — the so-called [carry trade](https://www.investopedia.com/carry-trade-definition-4682656).  
&gt;  
&gt;For instance, if 10-year Australian bonds yield 5% while similar Japanese bonds are paying close to nothing, investors can sell the yen, buy the Australian dollar, and use the proceeds to buy Australian bonds. There are lots of moving parts and wonky details, but that's the gist of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;But because traders are essentially picking up dimes in front of a bulldozer, these bets are highly levered to maximize returns — which means they can fall apart quickly and cause systemic risk if enough traders are effected.  
&gt;  
&gt;So when the yen starts making big upward or downward moves, traders face tough decisions. Hedge funds staring down the barrel of multiple margin calls will liquidate good bets — even safe haven assets like gold — to cover their bad bets. This is how contagion works.  
&gt;  
&gt;For now, the BOJ's bond buying — effectively printing more money, in this case yen — is supporting easy financial conditions. But if the bank's hand is forced and it abandons the buying, a massive unwinding will likely follow. And no one is currently pricing in this risk.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since the yen is being used as a cheap source of funds to leverage the carry trade, it's a risky bet, points out [Bloomberg's John Authers](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-28/japan-and-the-yen-find-a-new-way-to-market-relevancy-in-era-of-war-and-inflation?sref=eeq6exxF). Everyone is piling on the same side of the trade such that it becomes self-fulfilling. But the yen has also historically functioned as a flight-to-safety haven during times of stress. If that relationship reasserts and the yen strengthens materially, it's game over for those playing the carry.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Far from offering sanctuary from the world’s strife, Japan is being treated once more as an ATM to fund risk-taking elsewhere,"" Authers wrote.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the yen and Japanese bond market have cooled for now, the BOJ will have a big decision to make. Further pressure could lead Japanese authorities to intervene in the yen. Japan has a long and storied history of weakening the yen to favor their exports. But this would be the first time since 1998 that the bank would [intervene to strengthen the currency](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/japan-weaker-yen-may-not-be-blessing-it-once-was-2021-11-26/).  
&gt;  
&gt;Surging commodity costs is currently the biggest factor. Japan is a huge energy importer, which depresses its currency as the yen is sold to buy oil and gas (and food and everything else) at higher prices. This outweighs the benefit of boosting their exports as their goods become cheaper abroad — especially as Japan has offshored a lot of its manufacturing over the last decade.

&gt;  
&gt;A plummeting yen also puts upward pressure on interest rates, which is at odds with the BOJ's policy of controlling the entire yield curve. (By way of reference, the Federal Reserve only seeks to influence short-term U.S. rates.) If the BOJ is forced to abandon its yield curve control strategy, that brings the yen devaluation option to the forefront.  
&gt;  
&gt;The other dynamic at play is the strengthening Chinese yuan, or renminbi, which is dangerously close to approaching the very level versus the yen that caused authorities in China to [devalue its currency by 3% in 2015](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/chinese-devaluation-yuan/). That surprise move upended global risk markets and sent many stock markets around the world plunging into bear territory.  
&gt;  
&gt;Today, add a pandemic and a war in Europe to the mix — not to mention a Federal Reserve that's the most hawkish in at least two decades — and markets may not bounce back so quickly as they eventually did in early 2016.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jens Nordvig, founder and CEO at Exante Data, recently remarked how different the current situation is from prior times of global gyrations in the currency markets, [tweeting](https://twitter.com/jnordvig/status/1507006087643508736?s=20&amp;t=S23lXKLsAAa4XBrkGev6Sw), ""\[Y\]ou can only reach the conclusion that the regime is now totally different.

personalfinance,Is there ever a time when Federal Income Tax will not be taken out of a check because it is based off of my gross income?,"I just realized my employer did not take out any Federal Income Tax for the majority of my checks. Some checks have FIT taken out, most don't. I've never experienced this before, its always been based off of a certain percentage. I have a normal w-4 with 1 dependent, and file jointly. No matter what tax bracket I'm in, I'm under the impression that I should at least get something taken out with every check. Am I missing something here? 

The response I got from our payroll company said ""There are times when based off of your gross amount and tax withholding selections that a paycheck may not be liable for FIT"" . Does this make sense?",finance,1648772770.0
investing,Bond ETFs look like a great opportunity.,"Many people are talking about how bonds are a terrible investment right now, but looking at the NAV drops on bond etfs make it seem like these are great long-term opportunities. I'm still very new to this so I'm hoping someone smarter than me can explain why my thinking is wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

**Increasing rates causes decreasing bond prices**

New treasury bonds are giving better interest rates so it obviously makes sense, for right now, to park money here instead of the lower interest existing bonds. The value of the existing bonds drop until the existing coupon payments *roughly* translate to the same yield as the newer treasuries.

&amp;nbsp;

**Bond ETFs eventually catch up**

So with an etf like BND where the average duration is ~6 years, that means the older bonds are routinely getting removed while the newer (and higher yielding) bonds are coming in. Eventually, BND's dividend will start to increase (from higher coupons). This should also mean that BND's NAV price would start to increase alongside the increased dividends.

&amp;nbsp;

A super basic formula would be:

    P(BND) * Div(BND) = Y(BND) = Y(NT)
   

&amp;nbsp;

*where Y(NT) is yield of new treasuries, P(BND) is the BND etf NAV, Div(BND) is the current BND dividend/coupon, and Y(BND) is the current BND yield*

&amp;nbsp;

**Interest rate increases are already baked in**

So with BND, when the yield of new treasuries goes up (*Y(NT)*) then an efficient market will ensure BND's yield matches that. I could put $100 towards new treasuries and earn 2.5% yield or put $100 towards BND earning a 2.0% dividend. I'd obviously choose the former and therefore the market responds by lowering the BND price to $80. Now I can buy roughly 1.2 shares of the BND etf (with my $100) with a 2.0% dividend, which gives me a total 2.5% yield.


Knowing what I just stated above, **I'd obviously buy the discounted BND price** because I know those higher coupon treasuries will make it into the etf and increase dividends. If the Fed keeps interest rates steady, then 6 years later the BND etf will hold all treasuries with that newer interest rate and return 2.5% dividends. This pushes the NAV back up to $100. When people say existing bonds and etfs like BNDs will drop further due to interest rate hikes, wouldn't the market already be taking that into account? I assume it would be and therefore the decrease in NAV will eventually reverse long term.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion** 

Bond etfs lag behind on their relative yield when interest rates increase, but for long term investing you can buy the discounted NAV price knowing that eventually the interest rates will stop increasing. You get a double benefit: increased dividends over time and increased NAV. 

I'm likely very misinformed or making bad assumptions. Sometimes when I see comments talk about how bonds are, there is this natural inclination to think *so this must mean it's a good time to buy*.",finance,1648777539.0

ethereum,Introducing OBFC – Wire Money Over Ethereum,"We just built something really special.

**Intro**

OBFC provides a standard protocol to perform a SWIFT/Fed based wire transfer using stablecoins on Ethereum, by simply interacting with a smart-contract, rather than a traditional custodian or escrow service.

No more passwords, phone verifications or emails, OBFC requires only one authorized on-chain transaction to initiate real-time wire transfers to bank accounts almost anywhere in the world.

The protocol allows individuals to send digital dollars directly from individually owned and controlled Ethereum accounts to bank accounts seamlessly. OBFC takes bank details, such as ABA routing numbers, IBANs, and other bank codes in the form of a standardized unique OBFC code, which is used as input for a blockchain transaction to facilitate a token transfer, which corresponds to an outgoing electronic bank transfer.

**Things You Can Do With OBFC:**

· Send a wire transfer to a friend via your Ledger.

· Offramp USDC to $$$ directly from MetaMask.

· Pay your rent on Ethereum by using OBFC to wire money to your landlord!

**Give us feedback!!**

Check out the app, at [obfc.finance](https://obfc.finance/)

We are at a really early stage in developing this system, so if you are interested in helping us or giving us initial feedback please do reach out.

We think this is a pretty interesting example of how you can use Ethereum to interact with traditional banking infrastructure.

Please be advised, this is highly experimental right now and you should reach out to us if you are interested in trying it out. (read the [transparency](https://forum.obfc.finance/c/transparency/5) tab for more information).

Thank you,

personalfinance,"Which is the better choice: Hurrying and getting ourselves into any house, or moving in with my in-laws for a few months and saving money on rent?","My husband and I, after taxes &amp; expenses, have about $3600 to save at the end of the month.  We spoke with loan officer a few days ago, and were told that a down payment for a house we’d be interested in is \~$31,000 with a 4.75% interest rate. However, smaller less desirable houses have a down payment of \~$18,000 (We do not qualify for down payment assistance). Both of those are fairly steep for our incomes (gross \~$82,000), but we can most likely save up enough for the lower house down payment by the time our lease is up in 4 months, though I understand that it will likely be higher by that time as well – not only house prices, but also interest rates. Housing prices are going up 10% a year in our area and the interest rates changed in the hour that we were talking with the loan officer.

Our other option would be to move into my in-law’s place (shared space, only a bedroom to ourselves) which would, after our estimates, save us roughly $1,650 extra a month in rent/groceries. 

Do you think it would be worth saving up longer to get a better down payment for a better home? Or should we jump at something we can afford pretty much when our lease is up? We have to give 60 day notice to vacate our apartment.

personalfinance,401K loan. What would you do in my situation.,"30 years old. 91.5k in 401k. 18k in CC Debt.

Credit card minimum payments are $455/month. APR’s range from 21%-28% and my credit score has now dropped below 600.

401k loan would be 18k over 5 years, 3.5% Interest rate, with $300 out of my monthly pay. I also have the option to pay it off in a lump sum. 

I am in good standing at my job and have a fantastic relationship with my boss. I plan on retiring at my company, lord willing.

I realize the risk of losing the compound interest and growth on the 18k… BUT credit card debt at 18k at 25% average APR and a sub 600 credit score is really weighing heavily on me.

personalfinance,"Just filed our taxes, and we have to pay $1,099 in taxes from 2020 unemployment","A bit of a long story, but I'll try to summarize.

In 2020, when all of the chaos of COVID hit, my wife's work had to close for a few months. We were in the middle of a move, so when she submitted for unemployment, they basically only gave her a week and told her she didn't qualify because of the move. We appealed, because she definitely did qualify. It took forever and she had to get it cleared with a judge, but eventually they did agree she qualified and paid her the unemployment in January 2021 that should have been paid out around July 2020.

Well, the government didn't tax unemployment in 2020 due to the pandemic. They resumed taxes on unemployment in 2021. My wife didn't receive her 2020 unemployment until 2021, due to no fault of her own, and now they want us to pay an extra $1,099+ in taxes (federal alone) from her unemployment alone just because they got it to us late, a few weeks after the new year.

Any advice on how we can appeal this or anything? I can't imagine it will be easy to get something adjusted by the IRS.",finance,1648782022.0
investing,"Let's peel apart the February 2022 7.9% CPI measurement to figure out if the data shows ""it's because the fed printed money""","Stuff in 2021 cost 7.9% less than it did in 2022. Let's investigate:

&gt; The CPI-U is a more general index and seeks to track retail prices as they affect all urban consumers. It encompasses about 87 percent of the United States' population. The CPI-W is a more specialized index and seeks to track retail prices as they affect urban hourly wage earners and clerical workers.

&gt; The three largest components of the CPI are housing, transportation, and food/beverages in that order.

&gt; They are weighted this way: housing 41.4%; food and beverages 17.4%; transport 17.0%; medical care 6.9%; apparel 6.0%; recreation 4.4%; other 6.9%. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index

How much is each category up?

    Housing (CPIHOSNS): 275.13 -&gt; 291.50 (5.95%)
    Food and beverages (CPIUFDSL): 271.42 -&gt; 292.91 (7.9%)
    Transport (CPITRNSL): 211.47 -&gt; 256.02 (21.06%)
    Medical care (CPIMEDSL): 523.03 -&gt; 535.73 (2.43%)
    Apparel (CPIAPPSL): 118.53 -&gt; 126.34 (6.59%)
    Recreation (CPIRECSL): 122.89 -&gt; 128.97 (4.97%)
    Other (CPIOGSSL): 469.88 -&gt; 496.04 (5.57%)

2021: (41.4×275.13+17.4×271.42+17×211.47+6.9×523.03+6×118.53+4.4×122.89+6.9×469.88) / (41.4+17.4+17+6.9+6+4.4+6.9) = 278.11055

2022: (41.4×291.50+17.4×292.91+17×256.02+6.9×535.73+6×126.34+4.4×128.97+6.9×496.04) / (41.4+17.4+17+6.9+6+4.4+6.9) = 299.61795

My weights are a little outdated/off but the math checks out: about 7.7% increase 2021 -&gt; 2022

Now let's dive into some of the categories. A lot of people say CPI is a shitty metric that doesn't capture the ""true"" inflation Americans are experiencing. I've read countless times on Reddit how the entire formula is set up in a way to hide ""real inflation"" from the American people.

Here are the same categories, sorted by how much they are up year over year:

    (21.06%) Transport (CPITRNSL): 211.47 -&gt; 256.02 
    (7.9%) Food and beverages (CPIUFDSL): 271.42 -&gt; 292.91  
    (6.59%) Apparel (CPIAPPSL): 118.53 -&gt; 126.34  
    (5.95%) Housing (CPIHOSNS): 275.13 -&gt; 291.50  
    (5.57%) Other (CPIOGSSL): 469.88 -&gt; 496.04 
    (4.97%) Recreation (CPIRECSL): 122.89 -&gt; 128.97  
    (2.43%) Medical care (CPIMEDSL): 523.03 -&gt; 535.73  

Obviously, housing matters more to people than apparel. Keep in mind the transport category is what holds gasoline prices, and this was a reading before the Ukraine-Russia conflict if I remember correctly.

March 2022 CPI will be released Apr. 12, 2022.

Drilling in a bit more, here are some categories. The weights might be slightly out of date, since the page says it is from 2020. https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2020.htm The categories are up to 8 tiers nested.

cybersecurity,Maybe it's not just the stupid employees.,"I keep seeing this user-blaming idea [come up](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/tsu6m7/25_of_workers_lost_their_jobs_in_the_past_12/) in comments on every info sec community. Every time there's a phishing attack, it's the stupid employees again. Years later, a decade later, still a problem, still the stupid employees, not *our* fault. Go ahead and tell me why I'm wrong on this rant. I'll admit, I'm brand new to working in this industry. But if this take is bad, I need to know it. /beginrant

There are some damn good attacks, company letterhead and all. I dislike this whole user-blaming approach.

If you hire a team of security guards paid six figures to secure your premise, and they let the mafia drive in disguised as a food truck, and some employee gets taken for ransom, you're not blaming the employee. Maybe the kidnappers had tags on their collars that said ""mafia"", so it's the employees fault, right? We fire the ransomed employee for not noticing that obvious detail?

Hell no, it's not the employee's job to look for those details, we fire the security team who let the threat reach the employee.

Yes it's hard, yes, we might have to convince the business to allocate a few more resources toward getting the premise secure, but the buck stops here, and security pros will be the ones to solve this problem, not some phishing training. I think we have enough data on this issue by now to confirm that it's not working.

So isolate the email. We have great containerization tech these days. Two cloud networks. Personal web browsing and email travels on its own virtually isolated container and infrastructure. It's no longer necessary to set up some expensive physical intranet, we have isolated cloud infrastructure that makes this doable in a much more cost effective way today. If a user touches an email with an internet facing source, it's assumed malicious, and we're prepared to burn and refresh that infra in a heartbeat when a phishing campaign inevitably succeeds.

Just one take from an inexperienced host analyst working for the federal government, where these ideas already exist in practice. (Not saying that's the end of the story, there's plenty of other ways the government slacks on infosec in ways that make my skin crawl, but where it counts, that approach is tried and tested.)

/endrant

Edit: To clarify, I agree with spending whatever dollar figure is cost effective on phishing training. But the mistake people are making is thinking ""and if that doesn't work, well people are stupid, fuck it"". But human error is a constant. I argue here that `&lt;if they still ignore good training&gt;` isn't a matter of fault. It's a very real variable in an equation of risk, and our job to find cost effective ways to mitigate that inevitable outcome.",technology,1648784190.0

* Credit risk will veto the Fed,’ Larry McDonald says
* ETF tracking CMBS mired in second-worst drawdown ever

&gt;If  you’re wondering what the Federal Reserve will actually end up doing  with interest rates this year, Larry McDonald advises ignoring what  economists say.   
&gt;  
&gt;Instead,  it’s best to focus on credit risk, according to the founder of the Bear  Traps Report and former head of macro strategy at Societe Generale.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even  after just one increase to the target for the Federal funds rate,  credit markets are signaling that it’s “highly suspect” that the central  bank will lift rates by the equivalent of seven 25-basis point hikes  this year, let alone the eight or nine increases that some economists  are predicting, McDonald said in a recent Bear Traps Report [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmoC_3-B-rA).   
&gt;  
&gt;McDonald pointed to the [iShares CMBS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMBS)  exchange-traded fund to make his case. The $753 million ETF tracks  commercial mortgage-backed securities, a critical lending tool for  banks. The 10-year-old ETF is experiencing the second-largest ever  drawdown, behind only the 2020 Covid-19 market crash. It remains mired  in weakness even as benchmark equity indexes have recovered much of  their year-to-date losses.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Economists  are looking at economic data, they’re not looking at credit risk,”  McDonald said. “And at the end of the day, as we’ve seen over the last  10 years, credit risk will veto the Fed, will veto the economists.  That’s why you have to spend more time looking at credit risk and not  listening to economists.”  
&gt;  
&gt;When  it comes to what areas of commercial real estate are riskiest, Bear  Traps suspects that it’s the CMBS tranches that are most-exposed to  major U.S. cities --- risk that is also being flagged by the municipal  bond market, McDonald added in an email Thursday.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We  are seeing a corresponding surge in muni credit risk in some of the  large U.S. cities,” he said. “NYC spread vs. Austin and Miami widening a  lot.”",finance,1648785725.0

28. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14).

Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

personalfinance,Is this strange for an employer?,Was recently discussing taxes with some friends and they owed around 2000 in taxes. I'm an accountant so they asked me to take a look. Their employer is only taking out around 4% in federal per check despite them claiming 0 and having an extra $25 taken out per check. That seems really off to me.... What am I missing here?

personalfinance,Investing a Down Payment,"When my husband and I had saved up a down payment for our first home, my parents surprised us and offered to help us out extra and buy the home in cash through their LLC. Instead of having a mortgage through a bank, we signed a mortgage agreement with the LLC that is interest only with the principal being due in full at the end of the 30 year term. The intent behind this move was to allow us to invest the down payment to gain higher returns than the mortgage interest rate. The home cost was $300,000 and the mortgage interest rate is 3.5%.

We used a little bit of the money to do some critical fixes on the house. I have $40k that I'd like to put in a ""mortgage investment account"" but I'm not sure what type of fund would be best in this case. I have a Vanguard account already for IRA stuff, so I'd like to go through their services if possible, but I'm open to other service providers if it there's reason enough.

My mortgage, insurance and tax is about $2,200 and I’ll put in an extra $800 for principal.

personalfinance,"Buying House in a ""fine"" Area or Wait","Hi All,

Please advise on whether I (M, 30) and my wife (F, 28) should buy a house in a ""fine"" area now or should we wait for couple of years to move to a more desirable area. Details below.

My wife received an offer a couple of months so we relocated to a new apartment in another state near her company. I'm working from home and expect to continue to work remotely for a while. My daughter (2 years old) recently enrolled in a childcare, the best one around our area, which is 30-minute drive from where we live so it's 2-hour commute everyday for me. My wife is driving 20 minutes to work. Because 2-hour commute becomes very challenging to me so we are considering buying a house (I would say MCOL) near our daughter's childcare center. The area is okay, and just like everywhere else, there are some nice neighborhoods, and some okay neighborhoods but in general we can see ourselves living there for at least a couple of years. Our ultimate goal is to move to an area 1-hour away where there are more job opportunities and much better colleges/universities for our children in the future. Below are the details on our current financial situation and other additional things for your suggestions.

**Current financial situations**

* We are making $170K gross (not including 401k match and bonuses)
* Contributing to 401K and Roth IRAs
* We have $100,000 to put down for down payment and closing cost
* We have 2 cars, one paid off and another we are financing for $650 per month, **no other debts**
* We are spending $5,000+ per month (including $1,400 rent) and saving couple of thousands.
* We have supportive parents who can gift us $100K+ for down payment if ever needed

**Additional info**

* We are looking for a place with at least 3 bedrooms.
* We are planning to buy a house (4 brs, 3 brs, 2 car garages) in $300K - $350K range and with current interest rate, we expect to pay about $1,600 - $2000/month.
* For us, our children's eduction is the most important thing. The area we are considering has an elementary school rating 9/10 on [GreatSchools.org](https://GreatSchools.org) but middle and high schools aren't great that's why we are considering move to somewhere else in the future.
* A nice 3-bedroom, 2 bath apartment in the area cost $1,700-$1,800/month.
* The similar house in the desirable area I mentioned above is asking for $600k-$700k (could potentially cost higher due to bidding war in that area).
* I can relocate anywhere but there is no guarantee my wife could get a job in that ""desirable"" area in the near future.
* If we buy a house in my daughter's area, my commute will be few minutes but my wife will increase from 20 mins to 35 mins

With all things considered, does this make sense to buy a house in ""fine"" area for couple of years or even longer till my daughter finishes elementary (She is 2 so 9 years from now) and move to more ""desirable"" area?

Thread 1 month ago when the price of BCH was around $300: https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/sudgcp/when_you_short_bch_but_then_the_lenders_want/

At $380 , the shorters may be down at least 27% compared to 1 month ago. Instead of closing they may be doubling down and trying to pay more interest to get their hands on more BCH.

Why else are they paying 5x the interest rate for BCH, compared to the BTC/ETH/LTC rates?

If they dont close their shorts, they will probably try raise the interest rates over and over. 

If they close their positions, we might expect BCH to rocket up a decent amount. These guys are trying to borrow as much BCH as possible, and then still raising rates to try get even more BCH, so their positions might be huge.

2) I haven't yet sold any stocks in my Roth IRA, so don't have any liquidity there, so how do I calculate the federal tax on the gains? In the form that I'm submitting for Excess Contribution, it needs me to enter a % for how much federal tax my brokerage should withhold. 

Am I missing a step, or should I just enter 10% for now, then wait for them to remove the funds and then I have to do the rest of the calculation myself?

And if so, how is that calculated, and do I need to file any extra tax forms? This is for the current year 2022. I'm using FreeTaxUSA, so just wondering whether entering the excess that was removed is enough.",finance,1648850300.0
personalfinance,Standard Deduction and TurboTax,"For the first time in long time TurboxTax is recommending that I take the Standard Deduction instead of the Itemized Deduction, which I normally do for my house.

I flunked economics class, so I don't understand what happens to the funny money that was printed, and does that funny money just stay in the system? or does it get removed or offset somehow? You see how a lot of stocks were pumped to the sky, and then they pulled the rug. Where did that money go?

personalfinance,1098-T form says I owe taxes. A few concerns I have...,"Hello all,

first-time tax filer here. I've read up on a ton of posts here mentioning the 1098-T and scholarships and have concluded that I will more than likely need to pay taxes on room and board. But I just want to make sure my conclusions are correct. Last year, I made around 9k in income which I paid federal taxes on, paid 54k in tuition (box 1 1098-T), and received around 76K (box 5 1098-T in scholarships. Here are some questions I have:

&amp;#x200B;

* My college requires me to be full-time, on campus, and use the meal plan. Will this affect the taxability of that money used for room and board?
* I have a Questbridge scholarship. If anyone has any specific information on how taxes relate to QB that would be fantastic. I know it's a long shot but it's still worth asking.
* I've read online that you don't need to report your 1098T if you are not claiming an education credit. Is that correct?
* Finally, if anyone has any general tips or resources to reduce my tax liability in some way, that would be great. I'm an independent student who gets zero support from my family so getting hit with a 1000 dollar bill is troubling to say the least. 

Thanks, everyone! And I apologize for adding another 1098-T post to the subreddit but I still had tons of questions after looking over as many 1098-T posts as I could

On an unrelated note for other students doing their taxes: do not use TurboTax if you can. it's not very robust for unique situations and tries to nickel and dime any chance it gets. I had a good result with freetaxusa. I'm not associated with them at all just upset with TurboTax lol.",finance,1648860517.0
personalfinance,Inherited Retirement Plans From My Long-Dead Father,"Update: likely all I can do is cash out based on the advice of a CPA, a fiduciary, and a retirement financial advisor who all gave me consultations. Fidelity gave me conflicting information multiple times, so I’m trusting the experts, though they all were a little baffled too. Normal federal, state, and income taxes apply. The accounts were in what Fidelity called a “workplace beneficiary” account, not a traditional Inherited IRA. I may or may not be hit with a penalty, but if I am, I can fill out a form to petition the IRS to forgive me because of the odd circumstances. 

Deleting the original post for privacy’s sake. The gist of it was that I was contacted by Fidelity about inheriting two retirement plans from my widowed father who died in 2002. I was a minor and had no knowledge of the accounts. I don’t know why the executor of the estate did not know or inform me, and I have no contact with them to ask. RMDs were set to start as my dad would have turned 70.5 last year. At that point Fidelity realized he was dead and tracked me down as beneficiary. Once I received the funds in the workplace beneficiary account, I had a 60-day mandatory cash out on them, but was hoping to find a way to rollover without taxes or fees, at least to be able to take RMDs over time for less of a tax bracket hit. 

The 60-days is almost up for one of the accounts, so I’m cashing it out. For whatever reason the other one took longer to process, so I have a bit more time. The CPA is actually trying to get fidelity to put a hold on the cut-off date to see if we can figure out a better option than a cash-out - I guess he still has hope.",finance,1648860934.0
personalfinance,shares software (solium shareworks) over-withholding tax shares?,"A company I used to work for is having a ""recurring liquidity option"", aka all my monopoly money shares vest suddenly for a price they set even though they have not IPO'd yet.

This counts as income for the year so my income will more than double for 2022, and of course the tax man cometh for that.

The system will essentially sell shares automatically to cover the tax cost if you let it, which should be fine, but **the calculations they're using are really suspect and I want to know what I'm missing**

They're saying they will withhold essentially 58% of my shares, by total vest value, to pay taxes....(I can't specify a custom withhold, it's all or nothing)

 but I calculated my total tax burden (federal, state, medicare, SS), including this extra income, to be like 36%? I'm not sure where this extra 22% is coming from and frankly I'm tempted to just keep all the cash and pay whatever the calculated burden is next tax season.

# **Markets will be looking for clues from the Fed ahead, as historically strong month gets underway - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/01/markets-will-be-looking-for-clues-from-the-fed-ahead-as-historically-strong-month-gets-underway.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market is heading into what promises to be a volatile second quarter, but April is traditionally the best month of the year for stocks.
*****
&gt; The major indices were higher in March, but they turned in a weak performance for the first quarter, the worst since the pandemic. Investors have been worried about rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and inflation, which was made even worse by disruptions in commodities exports from both Russia and Ukraine.
*****
&gt; Stocks are typically higher in April, and it is historically the best month of the year for the S&amp;P 500. The S&amp;P has been higher 70% of the time and has gained an average 1.7% in all Aprils since World War II, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. For all months, the S&amp;P averaged a gain of 0.7%.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.6% in March, and Stovall said the rally could continue. “I think we get back to breakeven, but then I wouldn’t be surprised if we go through another pullback or correction before we have an end of year rally,” he said.
*****
&gt; Market focus in the week ahead will remain squarely on developments around the Ukraine war and on the Federal Reserve. The Fed on Wednesday is scheduled to release minutes from its March meeting, where it raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.
*****
&gt; There are also a handful of Fed speakers, including Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who speaks Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Greg Faranello, AmeriVet Securities head of U.S. rates, said the Fed minutes could be the highlight of the week since the central bank is likely to provide more detail on its plans to shrink its balance sheet. The Fed has nearly $9 trillion in securities on its balance sheet, and a reduction of those holdings would be another step to tighten policy.
*****
&gt; “The market is curious. They’re going to be looking for some clues in terms of how quickly, how big, what the caps look like,” said Faranello.
*****
&gt; The economic data calendar is light, with factory orders Monday, international trade and ISM services Tuesday and wholesale trade Friday.
*****
&gt; Traders will also be watching for any comments from companies ahead of the first-quarter earnings reporting season, which starts in mid-April.
*****
&gt; “The first-quarter earnings have actually been improving in the last month, so that’s encouraging,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; # Farewell to first quarter
&gt; The Dow was off 4.6% for the first quarter, while the S&amp;P 500 was down 5%. The worst performer by far was the Nasdaq, down 9.1%. In the past week, stocks were barely changed. The Dow was down 0.1%, while the S&amp;P was up 0.1%. The Nasdaq was up 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Interest rates also moved dramatically during the quarter, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield temporarily touching a high of 2.55% in the past week, after starting the quarter at 1.51%.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the 10-year was yielding 2.37%, while the two-year yield, which most reflects Fed policy, was at 2.45%. The two-year was yielding 0.73% at the beginning of the year.
*****
&gt; Faranello said bond yields can keep going higher on inflation concerns, but they could consolidate before another big move.
*****
&gt; “I think the market is looking for a new catalyst here,” he said. “I just think the first quarter has been about repricing the market, and we’ve done that...The Fed came out very hawkish. We made made a dramatic repricing. Now, we need to see more data to see how this is going to evolve in the second quarter.”
*****
&gt; Stovall said the S&amp;P 500′s first-quarter performance is one of the 15 worst first quarters, going back to 1945. After those weak quarters, down 3.8% or more, the second quarter was better on average. This year’s first-quarter decline was tied with 1994, which had the 12th worst first quarter.
*****
&gt; After those 15 weak first quarters, “we actually climbed 4.8% in the second quarter and rose in price two out of every three times,” he said. But for the full year, the S&amp;P 500 gained just 40% of the time, and was down an average 2% in those years.
*****
&gt; But this year is a midterm election year, and in those years the second and third quarters are typically the weakest. “Of those 15 worst quarters, five of them were midterm election years, and of those five, the second quarter was up an average 1%, and it rose in price only 40% of the time,” Stovall said.
*****
&gt; Stovall said the market could be higher in the second quarter, but it will face headwinds. “Oil prices are likely to remain up. Interest rates are certainly not coming down,” he said, adding geopolitical pressures are likely to remain. “I see the possibility of a 1% gain. We could probably eke out something good.”
*****
&gt; Stocks were held hostage by rising and volatile oil prices in the first quarter, as the world scrambled to make up for Russia’s export barrels. Many customers refused to buy Russian oil for fear of running afoul of financial sanctions on Russia’s financial system.
*****
&gt; After wild swings both higher and lower, West Texas Intermediate oil futures gained 39% in the first quarter, the eighth positive quarter in a row and its best first quarter since 1999. WTI was just under $100 per barrel Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; # Choppy, volatile market
&gt; Joe Quinlan, head of CIO Market Strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, said he is constructive on the market heading into the second quarter, but he sees some rough spots ahead.
*****
&gt; “We’ve got to work through the inflation problem, and the Fed catching up to the expectations of the market,” Quinlan said. “We’ve got to re-anchor inflation. It’s going to be a choppy, volatile year. We’re tilting more toward hard assets, whether it’s commodities, energy and natural gas.”
*****
&gt; Quinlan said he leans towards equities over fixed income, which has also been unusually volatile. “We’re using equities as a hedge against inflation,” he said. “Within that framework is more hard assets, fuels, agriculture complex in general and metals and minerals.”
*****
&gt; In the second quarter, the stock market will continue to adjust to an aggressive Federal Reserve against the backdrop of what should have been a solid economy. With 431,000 payrolls added in March, jobs data continues to be strong, but there is a fear the Fed will raise interest rates too quickly, derailing the economy and spinning it into recession.
*****
&gt; Traders in the futures market expect the Fed will increase its fire power at its next meeting in early May, hiking interest rates by 50 basis points, or a half-percent. The Fed’s first rate increase was a quarter-point at its March meeting.
*****
&gt; The market is pricing in the equivalent of eight quarter-point hikes, and Treasury yields have moved higher with stunning speed as market expectations for interest rates shifted. The two-year Treasury yield rose above the 10-year yield, or inverted this past week, for the first time since 2019. That is viewed by the market as a warning sign for a recession.
*****
&gt; Fed officials have signaled they want to move to trim the balance sheet soon. Kansas City Fed President Esther George this past week said the Fed’s balance sheet will need to decline significantly. She said the Fed’s holdings of Treasurys may have depressed the 10-year yield, causing the yield curve to invert.
*****
&gt; Faranello said interest rates could still head higher on inflation worries, but rates could consolidate after their recent run higher. The yield curve could also remain inverted.
*****
&gt; “We can stay like this for a year-and-a-half. Everyone’s screaming a recession is coming...I don’t think the yield curve is telling us a recession is just about to happen,” Faranello said.

&gt; # Here Comes the Best Month of the Year

&gt; After one of the worst starts to a year ever for stocks, March has seen a huge bounce. Incredibly, the S&amp;P 500 Index is only about 4% away from new all-time highs. The big question is can the near-term strength continue?

&gt; “The good news is stocks really appear to love April. Not only is it the best month on average since 1950, but it has also been higher an incredible 15 of the past 16 years as well,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has indeed closed green in April in 15 of the past 16 years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Blog-3.30.22.png))**

&gt; Taking a deeper look at April reveals that it’s not just the best month for stocks since 1950—it’s also the best month in the past 20 years and the second best month in the past decade. If there is one flaw, it is that in a midterm year it ranks only seventh and is barely positive.

&gt; # Asset Class Performance by Weekday

&gt; As Vladimir Lenin once wrote ""There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen."" For investors, each passing day of late has felt like a month, as Powell's Pivot, the Ukrainian conflict, rampant inflation, supply chain constraints, and COVID have caused rapid shifts in investor sentiment, leading to heightened volatility. With each day feeling like an eternity, we decided to look into the average performance by weekday to provide you with insights into trading patterns based on the day of the week.

&gt; The last twelve months have seen a divergence in performance from the norms of the last 30 years. On a trailing 12-month basis, the S&amp;P 500 has performed poorly on Mondays and Tuesdays before gaining steam from Wednesday through Friday. This diverges from the patterns seen over the last thirty years, in which Thursday and Friday struggled relative to the performance over the first three trading days of the week. This year, oil has averaged gains on every day of the week, but the strongest performance has occurred early in the week, which is interesting as Monday and Tuesday have tended to be the worst days of the week for oil over the last 30 years. Bonds have performed poorly in the beginning of the week over the last twelve months but have partially recovered in the last two trading days. Over the long run, the safe asset has traded narrowly with only Wednesdays averaging a loss. Tuesdays and Thursdays have been strong days for the US Dollar over the last twelve months, but these days tend to result in flat to negative performance when looked at over the last 30 years.

&gt; Below we summarize the cumulative performance by weekday for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 30 years. As you can see, Tuesday has been the best performing day by far, booking performance gains of 160.5%. Wednesday has posted a cumulative gain of 83.6%, which lands the day in second place. Friday and Thursday have been the weakest days, booking a cumulative gain of just 27.4% and 28.2%, respectively. Monday lands in the middle, recording a cumulative gain of 41.3%. As outlined above, the recent shift in weekday performance deviates from the norms of the last 30 years as investors have come out of the weekend with fears but concluded the week with optimism.

&gt; # Strong Performance at the Tail Ends of Breadth

&gt; While the index turned lower today on weaker breadth, the recent rally for the S&amp;P 500 has come on strong breadth resulting in the 10-day advance/decline line to surge to some of the highest readings on record. Monday and Tuesday saw 99th percentile readings in the 10-day A/D line and even after the decline today, the current reading remains in the 96th percentile. At Monday's high, the 10-day AD line reached the most elevated level since October 2020. On a sector level, in the past week Financials, Health Care, Materials, Real Estate, and Tech also all saw 99th percentile readings in their own 10-day advance-decline lines.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033022-SP-500-AD-Line.png))**

&gt; In the matrix below, we show the average forward performance of the S&amp;P 500 broken down by the percentile range that the index's 10-day AD line is in. Generally, lower readings in the 10-day AD line have been followed by stronger returns whereas higher readings have been followed by weaker returns. That is, except for the most elevated readings. Readings in the upper decile have actually been followed by more consistently positive and stronger than normal average returns for the S&amp;P 500. In other words, strong breadth is typically a more negative signal for the S&amp;P 500 going forward, but an extremely strong breadth reading has actually been positive.

&gt; # Down Q1 Midterm Years &amp; Bear Market Bottoms

&gt; As we enter the last month of the Best Six Months, the market logged its first down quarter in two years since the beginning of the pandemic. Going back to 1930 when our S&amp;P 500 data begins Q1 was positive 55 years and negative 37 times over the 92-year span. Overall, years that advanced in Q1 were up 46 of the 55 years or 83.6% of the time with an average gain of 13.2% for S&amp;P 500. Years when Q1 was down, were positive only 16 of the 37 years or 43.2% of the time for an average loss of -0.1%.

&gt; What jumped out at us were the midterm years that had losing first quarters. In the table we compiled here, the events during these years have an eerie resonance to what’s happening today in 2022. War, conflict, inflation, recession, and rate hikes were common themes in these midterm years. Only three of these 10 midterm years had sizable gains: 1938 (War in Europe), 1942 (WWII) and 1982 (Secular Bull). Losses carried over into Q2 in all but 3 years: 1938, 1942 and 2018. Third quarters rebounded in all but three years: 1966 (Vietnam), 1974 (Oil Embargo/Watergate) and 2002 (Iraq). The only real Q4 blemish was 2018 when the Fed hiked rates too briskly.

&gt; In general, after a down midterm Q1, losses tended to carry over into Q2 and the market began to find its footing in Q3 and rally into Q4. Protracted crises in 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, and 2002 delivered the most negative results though all had significant bear market bottoms. At the Q1 crossroads in 2022 we are faced with similar conditions. Persistent hyperinflation (Jeff’s large iced black coffee is up 29% in the last month from $3.02 to $3.89), a rising rate environment that’s stoking inverted yield curve/recession fears, the brutal war in Ukraine and the new Cold War 2.0 with Russia are threatening a bear market on the backdrop of the heightened volatility we have been warning of since our Annual Forecast in December.

&gt; # Bears Go Back Into Hibernation

&gt; The last couple weeks of the first quarter have seen equities reverse a sizable portion of this year's losses and sentiment has rebounded in sync, though, bullish sentiment turned slightly lower this week in spite of the S&amp;P 500's move higher. From the weekly AAII sentiment survey, bullish sentiment shed 0.9 percentage points coming in at 31.9%. Even after that decline, the current level of reported optimism remains above all others (outside of last week) since early January, but bullish sentiment still would need to rise another 6 percentage points to move back up to its historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; While more investors are not reporting much optimism, fewer are outright bearish. Bearish sentiment fell for a second week in a row falling another 7.9 percentage points to 27.5%. With a little over a quarter of respondents reporting as bearish, this sentiment reading is at the lowest level since November. That is also now the biggest two-week decline in bearish sentiment (22.3 percentage points) since November 2009 when it had fallen 23.74 percentage points in a two-week span.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Finally, we would note that given bearish sentiment has plummeted at a historic rate without much of an increase in bullish sentiment, neutral sentiment has picked up the difference. That reading clipped above 40% this week for the highest level since January 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; Other sentiment surveys like the Investors Intelligence one and NAAIM's Exposure Index have also pivoted more bullish this week. As a result, our sentiment composite is close to zero meaning across these three indicators, sentiment is now only just slightly below the historical average.

personalfinance,How can I best take advantage of my situation? Roth IRA? Stocks or crypto?,"Hi all,

I've been thinking a lot about my present and future financials, and I really don't want to fall behind.

I'm currently 20 years old, making about $81k/yr. Student loans are my main source of debt, I've been paying them off since I got my fist job out of college last November. It's about $95k in debt, and the majority is a parent PLUS loan that I'm paying my parents back for (which is fine, it's my schooling after all).

\~$15k of the debt is my own, which I'm paying $500/month towards, and the rest is the PLUS loan, which I'm paying $1000/month towards.

I have great credit, never missed a payment, and only use my credit card for big purchases when I can afford to pay it off with little to no interest accrued.

Also, I'm contributing 6% pre-tax to my 401k through my employer, and putting away about $400/month directly into savings, mostly as an emergency fund. After that and my essentials (rent, student loans, food, etc.), I take home about $300-$400 per month, mostly depending on how much I spend on groceries.

I did open a brokerage account with Fidelity not too long ago, but I haven't done much investing with it.

I am living pretty comfortably, but recently I've been worried about losing the advantage of having a pretty good income when I'm still fairly young. Also, I've really been thinking about how long it's going to take to pay off my student loans, which is somewhat discouraging, especially since the interest rate goes back up in about 2 months.

So, here are some of my main questions:

Should I start a Roth IRA or some other type of retirement account, even though I'm already contributing to my 401k?

Any other types of long-term (not necessarily retirement) investments that I should research?

Is there anything I could do now to help pay off my student loans sooner?

This might be a very situational question, but I can't really seem to find a concrete answer to it. How often is interest rate accrued on my student loans?

&amp;#x200B;

If there is anything else you guys think would be beneficial for me to research, I'm happy to hear about it! Thanks!",finance,1648862025.0

personalfinance,Prime line of credit?,Talking with a lender at the bank before applying for an unsecured loan for home improvement (no equity to speak of) She told me I could do a personal loan at 7% over 60 months. The other option was a prime line of credit (prime rate plus 1%) with a minimum payment. Right now the PLOC is a lower interest rate but of course can go up. Honestly this is the first time I've heard of a PLOC. What am I not considering? Either option works for me as far as monthly payments and length of term fitting in my budget so the lower interest rate has me leaning towards the PLOC.,finance,1648867127.0
personalfinance,Tax on Inherited Real Estate in WA,"My FIL is trying to sell me and my wife the house where his mother lived until she died a few years ago and where we currently reside. He claims that we must do it soon or else the house will pass to him as inheritance, at which point he will face a big tax bill.  


But WA estate tax only applies to assets &gt; $2.2 million and federal tax is assets &gt;$11.7 million. The house is worth about $0.5 million and I can't think of anything else that could push total assets over the WA threshold. Am I missing something about taxes on inherited real estate?

personalfinance,Should I apply for mortgage refinance now or wait?,"In December of 2019 I acquired a 4.25% FHA loan with MIP on a $200k loan for 30 years. At the time of the loan my yearly income was $50k. I had roughly $5k in student loans, $2k in personal loans, and $9k in vehicle loans. 

In the summer of 2021 I took on a new job and increased my income to $65k. My student loan and personal loan is completely paid off with around $2k left on the auto loan. My credit score is right around 700 (depending on the bureau that checks according to the ""free"" apps - I take these scores with a a grain of salt). My current credit utilization is 40% however I paid down a credit card which should get me right at or below the 30% threshold. As with most homes these days, my estimated equity has increased to roughly 38% (according to various real estate sites - I know this is not the actual estimate until I get the home appraised).

In my past I made several late payments to student loans which (according to one of my credit reports) is expected to fall off in May and June of this year.

I am wonder what my options are as far as refinancing my home goes. I know that rates are way up compared to where they were a year ago but my credit and financial situation has dramatically improved since then. My initial plan was to wait until June/July this year to refi but with rates the way they are I have a feeling that it would be all for nothing.

I have yet to apply for any refinancing yet as I don't want the hard credit pulls until I'm ready. My CU is advertising rates as low as 4.125% (4.293% APR) with 1.125% in points and 0.0% origination fee (of course all subject to credit approval and what not).

Does it make sense to wait until this summer to refinance just for a few late payments to drop off? If I were to keep the same interest rate but lose MIP, I would be saving $1550 a year ($129/mo).

Is there anything else I need to consider that I have not mentioned so far?

stocks,Selling my AAPL shares Monday. More downside risk vs. upside,"I've decided to sell my 6.5% position in AAPL.  Its in my ROTH so no taxes and I'm up 68% right now from a little over a year I think or maybe 1.5 years.

Anyways how much upside is really left in AAPL short term? Maybe $200 if we're REALLY lucky.  And then it won't stay there all year!

So I've decided to sell all my shares and buy them back after we correct another 25 to 50% after fed hits the brakes on balance sheet.

Someone said once FED starts reducing balance sheet we're gonna fall maybe 25 to 50%.  Some people are saying the sp500 will go down maybe 90% ..... Dan Niles I think said it.

Today Dan said that we should be 100% cash. I'm 30% cash and hopefully can get to maybe 50% or a little more for the Fed correction.

Anyways I like AAPL long term but if its gonna go to $100 or lower .... Someone online said AAPL may hit $50 a share this summer.... Then id rather cash out tax free now and buy back in for more shares at $100 or even $50 if I'm really lucky!

How's my plan? Monday hopefully I can start selling AAPL.

personalfinance,Recovering from being homeless and need advice,"Pertinent info, I'm 29 and in the USA and I was homeless for a few months living out of my car, lost my job due to medical reasons and just recently got back on my feet somewhat. I got a job that pays a bit more that liveable wage in my area but I'm massively in debt. I have roughly 7k in credit card debt and around 3-4k left on a car loan where i no longer have the vehicle. (I'm unsure of the exact amount since i can't look at the car account anymore)

A bit before i became homeless i stopped making payments on the car and credit in attempt to keep my own apartment and myself fed. Due to me not making payments in so long the loan providers taking me to court and im unsure of what to do.

Now on to my actual question i have a 401k through a previous employer that amounts to roughtly 16k, would it be a wise move to just accept the 10% lose + tax on cashing it out early to try to settle the loan debt and use what's left over on the credit cards?

My main worry is with the loan i make enough at the moment that I'm eventually going to dig myself out of the cc mess(already managed to pay one of them off). Also the reason i didn't use the 401k earlier was because i wasn't really aware of it. I knew i had one from that employer but i wrote it off after that job ended, received a statement about it and figured out how to check on it after the whole homeless debacle.",finance,1648891455.0

Checking the history, it says this money put in there as a result of a ""Sweep In"". I'm a little unsure of what this is, because it wasn't my action. I simply contribute to the IRA directly from my bank account and never touch it. I've seen some previous ""Sweep In"" actions but they always have a corresponding ""Sweep Out"" a few days later. This particular ""Sweep In"" was a few months ago and has not been swept out yet.

personalfinance,Cash out refinance with no job?,"Hello world. I’m in a bit of a pickle and I’m wondering if you all can help me open my eyes on my problem. 

So I’m a new small business owner which I’m under the standard 2 years with w2s etc. I bought my house in 2018 for 205,000 and at the moment it’s worth around 340,000. I’m planning on selling my house to move back to my hometown to spend more time with my family since Covid started 2 years ago I haven’t really seen them. My grandparents own couple business offices and an extra home that just sits there so I got offered a free old home that I’ll need to fix up myself and a business building of my choice free of rent.

My question is is there a way for me to keep my house without selling it so maybe I can rent it but pull out some equity and help me with the move or would I have to sell it since I technically wouldn’t qualify for anything since I’m under the 2 years of being a business owner? I currently have around 150-170k equity in the home. My mom is telling me to try and keep the house just in case I don’t like living back in my hometown but I’m not sure. I know for a fact I’ll never be able to afford another house like this with the prices or houses now a days. My interest rate is locked in at a 2.75 at the moment. 

My idea option would be to pull out like 50k cash, keep the house to rent it out and move to my hometown. 

My other option would be to sell the house and move to my hometown with 150-170k cash in my savings and live rent free with a old home and store front for my business. Obviously I’d be paying the bills but. 

My debt is well I don’t have any. My cars are paid off and I don’t have any credit cards. 

My credit is like a 640 at the moment. When I bought my house I was like a 680. Bought my truck 45k cash. Only bills I have are just living costs.

personalfinance,Cash Out Refi Pros &amp; Cons???,"Looking for opinions on the pros &amp; cons of doing two cash out re-finances for rental properties in LCOL areas in order to have down payment for primary home in a HCOL area.

&amp;#x200B;

What: Looking to take $100K from one house (out of possible $225k equity / 3.99% interest rate) and $200k from another house (out of possible 300K equity / 3.5% interest rate) in order to have 20-30% down for a 800-900K house in a HCOL area. Both houses are currently rented and bring in passive income each month. The refis would be 30-year fixed and would lower the monthly PITI, but would come with a higher interest rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background: Early 40s male with non-working spouse and 2 smaller kids.  Have a military pension with health care and a job making low 6 figures with benefits. Likely staying in the HCOL area and we're tired of renting and want to lock in a monthly housing cost by owning vice being subject to rising rents. Have about $160k liquid (cash + brokerage account) that we can use for emergency funds, but do not want to liquidate for a down payment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros that I see:

\- Re-allocate equity from rental homes into new primary home.

\- Maintain emergency funds / brokerage account.

\- Lock in monthly housing cost vice being subject to rising rents.

\- Lower monthly PITI for rental homes.

Cons:

\- Increase interest rate.

\- Increase total interest paid to mortgage company.

\- Closing costs.

personalfinance,Best path forward for targeting ~70k in federal student loans in May?,"Hi Everyone, I hope I can gain some guidance for what to do with my large amount of student debt. I've ignored it for a long time which I know isn't the smartest idea, and with May coming up I'm not anticipating anything to change in my favor so I want to be prepared.

This past year I secured a comfortable salary (~68k), but my federal loans have been in forbearance ever since COVID sprung up ~2 years ago. Before that, I had them based on Income Driven Repayment (which at the time I made minimum wage, so I did not have to make any payments) and ignored them because I was overwhelmed and trying to target 2 private loans (3k all paid, and 9k) I had first. 

In the past year I refinanced my last private loan (originally 9k, now at 7.8k with 3% interest) and I'm making payments of 142/mo on that at the moment.

I don't know how to look at the interest on these loans because they all show 0% for the emergency COVID forbearance and my servicer changed recently so I can't look at the original history. I imagine they were standard for my state, CT (probably around 5%?).

Right now I've saved up a decent amount of money (~25k) but it still feels like a drop compared to my loan amount. If I want to save for a house in the future and not live paycheck-to-paycheck, what's my best plan? 

Other details that may help: Graduated in 2018. I've paid off my car which is in decent shape, paying ~300/mo to my retirement through my employer, current rent I'm splitting with a family member and contributing 660/mo with utilities, other monthly expenses around probably an extra 700, and my credit score is around 760.",finance,1648916798.0

stocks,European Inflation Soars to Record 7.5% in March,"*Source:* [*https://uk.news.yahoo.com/charting-global-economy-european-inflation-090000565.html*](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/charting-global-economy-european-inflation-090000565.html)

Euro-zone inflation surged to a record 7.5% in March from a year ago as Russia’s war in Ukraine further boosted already soaring energy costs.

While that’ll cost consumers about 230 billion euros ($254 billion) this year, household savings should help cushion the blow. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge rose to a fresh four-decade high, and China’s Covid lockdowns threaten to disrupt supply chains and push up prices even more.

Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy:

**Europe**

Euro-zone inflation accelerated to a fresh record high as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiled global supply chains and provided a fresh driver for already-soaring energy costs. Combined with inflation overshoots this week from Spain and Germany, the data prompted investors to bring forward bets on when the European Central Bank will end almost eight years of negative interest rates.

The energy crisis gripping the euro area will inflict an extra bill on consumers equivalent to 1.8% of its gross domestic product, according to analysis by Bloomberg Economics. Increased heating and electricity costs, along with higher prices of fuel for motorists, will combine to add 230 billion euros ($255 billion) to households’ expenses, Jamie Rush and Maeva Cousin estimate.

U.K. households saved less of their income in the final quarter of last year to maintain living standards in an early sign of the pressures they face from runaway inflation.

**U.S.**

The U.S. added close to half a million jobs in March and the unemployment rate fell by more than expected, highlighting a robust labor market that’s likely to support aggressive Fed tightening in the coming months.

Inflation-adjusted consumer spending declined in February, suggesting the fastest pace of price increases in four decades is starting to temper demand. Spending on goods settled back after the prior month’s surge, while a decline in Covid-19 cases supported a pickup in outlays for services.

U.S. business profits surged 35% last year, the most since 1950, driven by strong household demand as the economy bounced back from the pandemic. In all four quarters of the year, the overall profit margin stayed above 13%, a level reached in just one other three-month period during the past 70 years, Commerce Department data show.

**Asia**

China’s Covid lockdowns are putting the economy under strain and threatening to disrupt global supply chains, prompting Beijing to call for more contingency plans to deal with the risks. Purchasing managers’ indexes for March showed lockdowns in the technology and trade center Shenzhen and automotive city Changchun cut factory activity in the month. Services have also been hit hard.

Japan’s factory output in February eked out the first gain in three months, offering only a tepid sign of resilience amid fears the economy has slipped back into reverse. The fractional gain comes at a time when the Japanese economy needs strong manufacturing to help the economy avoid a contraction this quarter and to power a recovery going ahead.

**Emerging Markets**

Colombia surprised markets with a smaller-than-expected interest rate increase after the central bank was criticized by senior politicians. Analysts had expected a bigger boost given recent inflation shocks and an economy that is now operating close to full capacity.

personalfinance,"I bought my first new car, but I’m not sure if I should continue to cut my finances short for the vehicle.","Roughly three months ago, my 2014 Ford Taurus started causing me tons of issues. I gave myself a couple weeks to do some research on my next car. I wanted to make an investment, looking for something more reliable with better gas mileage.

After thorough research, I kept my eyes on a 2017 Chevy Malibu Premier. I wanted the specific trim level. If I was spending more than $15k, I wanted to make sure it was something I found aesthetically/visually pleasing. After searching my local city and neighboring cities, I found many options but nothing that fitted my criteria. I decided to expand my search outer-state. I found an amazing deal but it was in Chicago. It was listed at $22,000, so I called the dealership to check its availability. They said it’s available, so I asked for more details. After about 10 minutes on the phone, I let them know I wanted to make sure the car is 100% ready for me before I left and same with the paperwork since we are driving 8.5 hrs. Everything came back good, including the credit check. I sat at a different dealership for 6 hrs prior and wasn’t willing to do it again😂 

They told me they had a green light and everything was ready. Next day, my dad and I drove to Chicago for the 1:15pm appointment we had set. When we showed up, we didn’t have an assigned sales rep or anything. A top rep they had, then welcomed us and sat us down. I explained our situation and he started moving asap. The car wasn’t near ready, not detailed, washed, or prep’d for sale at all. No paperwork was ready either. After he got it washed and he came back to start paperwork. They then came back to say I wasn’t eligible for the purchase. After everything was confirmed over the phone before we drove up, this frustrated me and he did his best to drop some unwanted add-ons to the totaled price. From the advertised price at $22k, the dealership had added an additional $12k to the total.. The car was at $34k at this point and later told me they couldn’t find a lender for my loan. He seen my frustration and He tried again and managed to get ONE lender. At this point I didn’t even want to leave without the car.

Thing after thing, everything sort of snowballed in my mind. I’m 20, did so much research, took a ton of effort and time to try and lock in a good vehicle.

I finished up the paperwork and the purchase was complete after 5 hrs of being here. I drove home and since I’ve had a bit of buyers remorse. Some of my own thoughts being pretty logical too. Knowing the prices ($691 a month) and interest rate (17%). I originally was going to refinance through a credit union after 6 months of on time payments, but right now I don’t think that’s my safest bet. 

The car has a warranty till 70k miles (39xxx as of now). I also believe I can still return it, but I’m looking for some perspectives!

personalfinance,Company Pension or 401k contribution,"My company is asking us to choose between two retirement benefits: one is a pension and one is an additional 401k contribution, and I'd like to hear personal finance's opinion or anything I'm missing.

Pension: 1.1% x (final) salary x #years at the company
401k: an extra 4% (of current salary) that increases by 1% every 5 years until it maxes out at 7%

I'm already vested in the pension, but what I've been told is that even if I pick the 401k option, I'll still be able to take the years I'm currently vested in the pension.

Other items to consider: keeping track of the pension, especially if I leave the company and work somewhere else for 20 years, would be a bit of a pain. However, it's possible the company moves away from the pension altogether in the future, especially since they're no longer offering the pension option to new employees and giving existing employees the option to switch.

The 401k option, I'd have more control over the money. The pension pays out for many years after 65, especially if you live a while, while the 401k is more money upfront.

In case it matters, I'm still young in my career (early 30s) and should have a couple more promotions (increase in pay of 5-7%) and typically my annual increase is around 2-3% to give an idea of how I expect my salary to grow.

Open world games have moved in this direction over the last few years and I am wondering if video game designers aren't going to start thinking, hopefully soon, about proper pacing in these games.

I don't want this game to go the way of AC, where by the end I am so sick of it I just stop. I also want to be able to STOP PLAYING after a reasonable amount of time in one sitting. It's a weird complaint to have, being too entertained to do anything else, but after nearly a decade of these games I am starting to notice the pattern. It starts incredible, I tell myself I am going to do everything possible, go everywhere, I start playing for hours and hours, and then two/three weeks later, with still no end in sight, I start to get antsy, and by the end I am actively fed up with the experience.

Less than 2 years ago I bought a new house at a phenomenal price and interest rate at 2.3% with my VA loan. I love the neighborhood but with new development and lots more houses my street is now pretty busy with LOTS of speeding cars. I have 4 little ones who love to play out front. I have tried everything to slow down traffic like post slow down signs, cones, police monitoring, speed monitor etc. I am always stressed about the kids getting hit by a car. 

My current home was purchased at $447,000 and I now owe $427,000. I can sell for around $580,000. I would take the profit and use it towards the new home build also around $580,000. I would end up with a similar house, similar mortgage payment, maybe a few hundred more depending on how far interest rates go up (currently quoted 3.5 for another VA loan). I feel like I am kinda swapping out. My current house is not my forever home. The new one could possibly be, no guarantee either. Not only is the location safer but I would be happy to upgrade to new features and design the home to my taste. The current house was only 1 year old when I purchased it but not really my style. 

Building is my only option as the builder is willing to do a contingency on the sale of mine. I would place it on the market 2 months from completion and hopefully close on both houses in the same day. 

Note, it’s extremely hard to get a cul de sac or prime lot in this neighborhood. I have been on the wait list since before I bought here. Over the last few months I have been stopping in the model home asking if any cul de sacs lots have fallen through. Well one did, and they contacted me immediately.

algorand,It recently occurred to me: Serialized Equipment &amp; Items,"Correct me where needed: 

It only recently occurred to me that serialized equipment &amp; items are in effect the physical version of NFT's, except any surface not contiguous with the serial number can be replaced - thus not *completely original* to the serial number. I could use vehicles or machinery equipment as an example, but there's many reasons (mostly replacement &amp; maintenance) around why certain parts aren't stamped, bothered being serialized, etc...  Serialized items come from the manufacturer with a record of being created, and more importantly ownership (more or less) can be tracked with this serial number; but with physical items, proof of ownership is largely relegated to what has been physically recorded. 

Blockchain use can prove ownership of ""*serialized""* data (i.e. NFT's), but it only recently occurred to me an actual real world use case. In America, we have a national requirement for keeping track of certain serialized items, keeping track of their transfer, with the intent to control their distribution to *trusted* parties only... **NFA items** (i.e. suppressors). Ya you thought I was gonna say firearms, them too but that's not the main use case. 

In the USA, there's a lengthy process involving the purchase of suppressors (yes New Zealand we know how easy it is for you), which involves submitting fingerprints, name, contact information, height, weight, etc.. known as a **Form 4**. If the US Gov't adopted a blockchain (Algorand IMO but I may be biased), the ATF could use wallet addresses for serialized ownership, and proof of trust. Transfer history would be proven, publicly available, and sales/purchases could be tokenized, trustless but trusted.

Purchase of the *ATF* token (just an example) would be controlled by the issuer - the ATF, Personally Identifiable Information (PID) would be on their end only, so publicly only the serial number and wallet addresses would be visible, with ownership provable at any point (i.e. your papers to keep with you). The Form 4's could serve as the basis of authorization (as they already are) to acquire said asset ID, maybe even with personalized opt-in links? The identity of the receiver would of course have to be verified, if only the US already had a vast network of businesses that serve to validate identity for the purchase of firearms... FFL's (Federal Firearms License, Gun Shops) already serve as a physical *validator* for purchasing items, validating identity, and point-of-sale transactions. 

FFL's could readily validate the ID of the person for any correspondence w/the ATF for adoption, and from then on the wallet &amp; tokenized purchases would serve as a background check for every purchase (currently required), reducing paperwork and lead times, and freeing up resources to use elsewhere other than processing requests. 

Obviously theres a lot more to work out, but the technology and availability is here **today**. Blockchain use can work for any serialized equipment or items - not just NFA items in America, where transfer history and ownership can be readily proven and controlled. Has this been realized before? Am I just *that late* to the party?

*Ukraine burns, bludgeoned by the invading Russian...*

In 2-3 years, the global monetary system will look nothing like it does today, and not enough people are considering the details of such a rapid disintegration:

Commodities are collateral, and collateral is money. Russia’s commodities are considered sub-prime, while the rest of the world’s are considered prime. This means that the price of commodities are falling inside sanctioned countries like Russia, but are rising outside of sanctioned countries. Commodities traders outside Russia have to borrow more money because of the collateral mismatch. But both the commodity traders inside and outside sanctioned countries are getting margin called while commodities basis soars.

Fertilizer price outside Russia for example:

[Green candle through heaven's floorboards](https://preview.redd.it/jq29gqddyar81.jpg?width=920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c90f0423be09608dd8406615baad3dbd3fb41ac)

Here’s a quick list of major Russian commodities as world percentages:

* 10% oil
* 45% of potash (needed for fertilizer, most beauty products, manufacturing, etc)
* 5% Wheat
* 5% Nickel
* 4% Aluminum
* 4% Copper

So the spread difference in this commodity pricing inside and outside Russia can be taken advantage of by China, who will effectively benefit by whatever the spread amount is. They can then control their own currency’s inflation by selling US Treasuries to buy Russian commodities. And because China is NOT a sanctioned country, that means they can then sell these Russian commodities to Europe, the US, or any other country putting sanctions on Russia. If they don’t have enough mainland space, they’ll put them on the ocean, driving up logistics costs for the rest of the world but ultimately stabilizing the basis. This means commodity shortages in the West, especially Europe. All this will put enormous pressure on western currencies and spike inflation further.

Then there’s the refugee crisis. The last one in Europe (circa 2007-2015) brought 5M people over those 8 years. Ukraine could bring 2x that in a fraction of the time. Then because of the coming food crisis thanks to much of Ukraine’s resources going offline, the Middle-East and Northern Africa will bring another huge wave. The last immigration crisis brought Brexit and an entirely new European political class. This will do the same, and will put more pressure on the Euro if their money printer’s heat doesn’t burn down their treasury first.

Here’s a quick list of major Ukraine commodities as world percentages:

* 11% wheat
* 13% maize
* 10% potatoes
* 10% potash

This is all beyond any western Central Bank’s ability to backstop or fix, because it’s not a liquidity crisis. The inflation from the soaring basis will have to be cooled with rate hikes. But if that’s the case, where does money turn to for safety if the stock market is tumbling, Treasury demand has fallen off a cliff, USD/EURO is inflating away, and commodities are volatile? Real estate? Probably not because although interest rates will still be too low for savers at say 3% (because inflation is 10% or more) these rates will start to be too high for the easy money real estate borrowers are drunk on.

Many countries, companies, and players (especially in the East), will turn to the Yuan as a larger percentage of their cash holdings seeing it no less dangerously than they do the USD after G7 nations foolishly seized a sovereign country’s (Russia’s) foreign reserves, and because it's not inflating as rapidly, and most importantly, because they're buying those re-routed Russian commodities with it. This is where the petrodollar can start to really breakdown, adding more inflationary pressure on the USD. Many country's will turn to gold as well.

I won’t get into the Triffin Dilemma here, but its doom vortex is churning the USD into an impending disaster as early as winter this year and into the next couple years. Triffin predicted eventually the USD would collapse like this after it had backed itself into a corner.

And this is why 2022 is an important year for bitcoin accumulation, because more than anything, many large players will choose to hedge and save their buying power in bitcoin, and buying power is the most powerful tool for investors and traders.

Sanctions serve absolutely no purpose other than SYMBOLISM, because they erode supply chains further, benefit China, strengthen their currency, and make you and I pay for it with ours. YOU are the one financing this conflict and these sanctions, which is why I needed to write this post, to give some perspective. This is why you have to make the asymmetric trade for bitcoin every time you touch US dollars THIS YEAR. There’s a disaster coming and we’re sleepwalking into it. You have to ask a very hard question: did Putin actually miscalculate anything with his invasion in terms of larger goals?

Lastly, you have to consider the fact that the CBDC does not fix any of the USD’s larger global problems. None. In fact, they make them worse because a CBDC is not actually fungible money. My view is that CBDC’s will be used to pay entitlements and be either spent quickly, or converted into what people save their wealth in at a small premium: bitcoin, a network which will simply be the base layer that the new monetary system builds around--and this dear reader, is a base layer that’s been missing for quite some time.",cryptocurrency,1648987103.0

personalfinance,Options for Proceeds from House Sale,"Offers are coming in on our house.  We have some options about what to do with the proceeds. I'm not sure which is best.  
Information:  
Proceeds from house (net): 70k (so far- we may get another offer that increases this number)  
New home mortgage is 342k. PMI is $54/month.  We put 5% down on a conventional loan (4% interest rate).  
Our only other debt is two cars (\~$17,000 remaining on both) with &lt;4.5% interest rates.

**Option A**: Replenish our emergency fund.  We currently have about 2 months of funds.  I'd like to work back up to 6 (which we had prior to buying the house). To get back up to 6 months we would need $14,000.   
**Option B**: Pay down the house to 20% of its original price (so 15% down- $51,300).   We want this to be our forever home.  Doing this will reduce the length of our loan by 8 years, reduce the amount of interest paid over time, and knock off the PMI (which, while low, is still \~$600/year that is just gone).  
**Option C**: Pay off the cars (\~$17,000), or at least paying them down.  Monthly payments for both is $550.  
**Option D**: Max out our Roth IRAs ($12,000) and invest other proceeds into our taxable account.

Obviously, we could mix and match some of those options.  I'm really torn as to what to do.  Insights are appreciated.

personalfinance,"Paying down student debt, investing, and saving?","Hello! 

I am 26 and two years out of school and have had about $100,000 at approx 6% in student loans deferred since graduating from school. I've banked my monthly payment since then  plus some, and have ~30k saved. (I recently moved jobs to a significantly higher salary.) I'm looking for some general advice on the following with regards to paying off my loans, saving, and investing. 

My employer recently gave us market adjustment raises, which leaves me at about $2400/mo extra out of my budget (we have 26 pay periods, but I budget as if i have 24 and plan to just put the 2 ""extra"" straight in to savings for about $6000 in extra savings per year). My employer also contributes 10% of my salary each year to my 401k (regardless what i put in), so I have not been adding much to my 401k at this point. I am also eligible for bonuses based on the number of ""extra"" hours I work. They will also loan up to $20,000 at a low interest rate towards the down-payment on a house I purchase.

In the next year or two I'd like to replace my car as it's still relatively low miles. Within the next 5 years, I'd like to have a house. I'd also like to start investing more, but I haven't much due to my student loan debt. 

I know eventually, loans won't be deferred anymore. My dilemma comes once payments have to resume. My plan is to make a $20,000 lump sum payment in to the loans and then make larger payments each month until paid off while saving a little less over the next 5 years. With discretionary bonuses that i plan to put straight in to loans, I think I'll be able to pay them off in 5 years or less. 

My primary concern with this is that I am not saving/investing enough; but at the same time, I feel as if the interest rate makes it difficult to justify putting money in to other investments. However, I also don't want to neglect saving for a house or leave my emergency fund savings lacking.

Looking for some opinions - thank you!

personalfinance,How does a Backdoor ROTH IRA work if I've already made some non-qualified contributions to my existing ROTH IRA?,"My wife and I file taxes as ""married separate"" due to income on my side being particularly high. So, for 2022 (emphasizing this is for the current tax year, so this is all for when we file in 2023) while she's able to contribute the full yearly amount to her ROTH IRA, I on the other hand am not able to contribute anything (through the usual way).

That being said, I opened a traditional IRA in Vanguard as preparation for a backdoor ROTH IRA; throughout the year, I'd be contributing monthly up to the $6000 max. First question: for backdoor ROTH IRA purposes, is the following correct?

1. Contribute throughout the year to the traditional IRA, either monthly or in one lump sum at some point
2. Leave such contributions ""as cash"" (or in Vanguard's case, ""Federal Money Market Fund"")
3. Come January 2023, convert that traditional IRA to a ROTH IRA
4. Rollover from that ROTH IRA to my old ROTH IRA
5. Reconvert the new ROTH IRA back to traditional IRA
6. Rinse and repeat for 2024, 2025, etc.

And, second question: I've already contributed $600 this year to my old/existing ROTH IRA, which almost certainly is non-qualified because of my income. What should I do with this? It doesn't seem I can move that over to my traditional IRA account without incurring tax, but maybe that's the way it is unless there's another way I should be going about it?

personalfinance,Defer law school to raise credit score?,"WAY tl;dr: I am not eligible for any federal or university aid, and my credit score is a 540. I’m doing loan rehab for my student loans, and they will come out of default in 9 months. Should I defer my law school enrollment for a year to work on financial health and loan eligibility? 


Hi personal finance! I don’t have a ton of sources for advice. I (30 years old) am finishing up my law school application cycle, and I’m happy with my results. Now that I am receiving scholarship information, I’m facing the reality of affording law school. I am fortunate to have multiple full-tuition offers, but even with those I would probably need to take a loan out for cost of living, etc. 

Because of this, I’m considering deferring my enrollment by one year to work on my credit score. Some background/reasons are below:

My mother passed from cancer in my mid-twenties. During her illness and in the years following, I was too overwhelmed and let my finances go. I was also in a physically abusive relationship for 3 years in which he had control over my finances. I didn’t even have a bank account during our relationship. During that time, my student loans and credit cards went into collections, and I allowed my boyfriend to convince me to sign for a car loan with 20.5% interest. In Feb of 2020 I was able to escape the situation and have spent the past two years working on putting all the pieces of life back together. Work, mental health, friendships, financial health, etc. 

Right now, my credit score is 540, and I am ineligible for fed or university loans. I have just recently been approved for loan rehabilitation on my fed student loans (which is 95% of my collection debt). In 9 months they will come out of default, and I will be eligible for financial aid. I’ve had perfect payment history for the past two years, and I now have found several streams of reliable income (making 3500-5k a month, with occasional high paying opportunities that earn 15k in two weeks working as an elite test prep/academic tutor). 

As tuition deposits are coming up and I am considering moving costs and cost of living and any tuition I will pay…I am stressed the F out. I’m wondering if accepting an offer but deferring my enrollment by one year would make a huge difference in my law school experience. I don’t want to be stressed about money while in school, and it’s going to take a lot of money to both improve my score and move at the same time. I don’t have anyone to ask to be a co-signer, either. I haven’t found one option for a loan with the credit score I have now. I will be applying to many many outside scholarships, but there are no guarantees. 

Would it make sense for me to defer a year? I hate the idea of putting my life on hold another year, but I also think I owe it to my future self to make a smart decision with good long-term outcomes. I’m really torn, and just want to be sure I don’t miss any pros or cons to consider as I make my decision. Thank you!!!!",finance,1649000188.0
investing,Inflation and its effect on the stock market,"While reading a bit on the ideas to protect money from inflation, I noticed many people have the idea to move their money into the  general stockmarket (e.g. indexes, managed-funds, S&amp;P, NASDAQ). The idea behind this is that the money is ""save"" in the market due to companies in general profiting from increasing prices and therefor increasing in value. 

I do not comprehend how this would work, for the following reasons:

1. As long as the stockmarket value does not increase as much as inflation, you still lose value. 
2. As long as salaries do not incease as much as inflation (which currently does not seem the case), this would cause consumers to lose buying power. Anything consumer related thus would start making less profits and drop in value. Any money invested in related stocks would thus lose to inflation and to the stock dropping in value.

Putting your money in indexes/funds might thus work countereffective as you are hit by inflation and the stock market dropping/being stagnant due to consequences of inflation. Looking at the inflationary period from the 1965-83, the S&amp;P was more or less stagnant over this timeframe. You would thus mainly have lost money to &gt;5% y/y inflation in that period in the market (I am not sure how much stocks have paid dividends in those times, that might have compensated for this). Market growth only continued after 1983 (after the insane rate hikes put trough by the FED, putting inflation down). Based on this it, seems that buying the general market is not a good strategy if inflation rages. 

I could not really find individual stock prices of companies that might have performed well in 70/80s (if anyone has a source, I am interested). However, judging from commoditiy prices in the timeframe of 1965 to 1985, oil, gold, iron etc (so basically commodities) would have been great investments over that timeframe. 

Do you guys think picking investments (e.g. commodities/related stocks) might allow you to outrun inflation, are you sticking with a general market DCA strategy or do you have another strategy?",finance,1649000921.0

I (35, single, renter in NYC) am finishing grad school in May and started working full time again a month ago. I have a few financial goals that I have questions about now that I am making money again.
Info:
- $200k salary
- After healthcare, maxing out 401k, taxes, other things take home is a little over $10k a month.
- $30k potential bonus (prorated based on start date for the first year so around $22k, paid out at the end of the fiscal)
- ~$5k monthly expenses when not living frugally so $5k/month for savings/ investment.
- $23k in emergency fund currently in a money market 0.3% APR
- $7k in checking for covering daily expenses, generally don't dip below $5k 
- $115k in 401k from previous employer (index funds)
- $11k in personal Roth IRA (index funds)
- $90k student loan debt, currently no payments required, no interest under current federal student loan rules which are supposed to expire in May (right?). ~4.8%-5.2% interest when it resumes.
- No other debt, car paid off and knock on wood in good shape.

Financial goals:
- Save $2k more for emergency fund ($25k total)
- Save for a cross country move within the next year from HCOL area to HCOL area. $20k-$25k goal includes moving costs, deposit, new furniture etc. Work remotely so salary will stay the same although taxes may go up NYC&gt;LA.
- Longer term, saving for a house in a HCOL area
- Pay off student loans 

Questions:
1) I made $13k in 2021 $10k as a W2 (tax taken out) and $3k  (no tax taken out) on 1099 from consulting work. Can I put the untaxed $3k directly into a traditional IRA if I do it before the deadline? Then another $3k through a backdoor IRA? Or can I put $3k right into a Roth IRA since I had no 401k contributions and a low income in 2021? 
2) I made another $1.6k on consulting (no taxes taken out) in January 2022, can that go into a traditional IRA or do I have to use a backdoor IRA  to a Roth for 2022 because of income limits? Generally a little confused as to why I used to do the backdoor before, this is for income limits right?
3) My money market account is with Capital One and when I first opened it a few years ago it was 1.9% APR but has dropped to 0.3%. Is there a better place to keep my emergency fund now?
4) Same question but for the money I am saving for moving? 
5) I am not a fan of having student loan debt so want to aggressively pay it down. Am I better off paying the minimum though? If feels like at 5.2% it's on the cusp of being a matter of preference or are returns that much higher for index funds right now?
6) Since I am going to look to buy in a HCOL area it will take longer to save for a down payment. Should I put it in index funds? Or split it into multiple savings methods?
7) Should I also be designating other savings for retirement that I don't plan on touching while saving for a house/paying off loans?

Short story long, I'm 30M (turning 31 this month), attorney living and working in NYC. I finally found a firm that meets my expectations in terms of work/life harmony in the past yr relatively speaking, after struggling with this the previous 4 yrs. I also have a live-in girlfriend and we have a fantastic healthy relationship. We are physically/mentally well and happy. We live in a nice building I signed onto during the pandemic in March 2021, paying currently about $2200 per month in the 2nd yr of the lease (utilities included - rent is $1995). NYC real estate is very expensive and where I live this is considered well under market for what we receive in return (albeit only a studio apt). I currently pay about about $1600 of that, and she pays $600. It's the arrangement we have for now because she's 25 and in the first yr of a sales career at a great corporate job, making about $60k. I make $95k. We have big aspirations and want to do well in life and come from good supportive families. We are fortunate for those reasons described.

Now comes the hard personal stuff. For personal life/health reasons that are sort of irrelevant to my seeking of advice here, I was unable to in the past 5 yrs to really save money. It's just what happened, and obviously things need to change. Other than a couple thousand in my personal bank account, a thousand in a Roth IRA, $300 in a fidelity brokerage account, and $800 in Coinbase, I am financially limited at this time and my gf herself is pretty much in the same boat there as well. The events of the past 5 yrs, however, are in the past, I've turned things around substantially in the past year (my gf wasn't around for any of that stuff) and am looking for real advice to ensure I get on a good track. Please no admonishment in this sub, I'm just giving honest background.

For more personal background, I understand the concepts of an emergency fund, retirement vehicles and generally how they work, brokerage accounts, the value of investing in ETFs, and I know there will be a number of you who will comment stuff like "" take that money out of your Coinbase, you need it to break the paycheck to paycheck cycle"" and you'd all be right. This is why I'm here - I need to put principles into practice.

As far as my income from my job I bring in about $4800 per month. My debts are as follows: $8k in credit card debt; $15k in medical debt; $2200 in state tax debt from 2018 that NJ just randomly hit me with from a mistake when I tried to do my taxes myself then, $135k in student loans (law school - graduated when I was 25). No car (I've lived in the NYC area the past 2 yrs and gave it up in 2020, after living in NJ/Philly my whole life driving cars).

Before anybody gives me advice about my student loans, I've resolved to paying the minimum on them, because I've done my research and if you make every payment then 20+ yrs from now they can potentially (barring a number of scenarios) be forgiven with a tax bomb. I have one life to live and being that they're federal loans, I'm better served saving, investing, and building my life than dropping half my check paying them off and eating lentil stew for 10 yrs straight. Accordingly, I'm not asking for advice on this (sorry Dave Ramsey :) ). I just want to have it known that I'll be paying $300-$400 per month again probably when the debt payments resume in May I imagine.

The other issue is I am not content in my career choice at all and haven't been since the beginning. Without making this a longer story than it already is, I intend on doing more and more transactional work as an attorney long term, getting my real estate license and switching to that as a career choice (and eventually broker) in a more booming lower cost of living environ than my current one in NYC (South Florida or Phoenix area perhaps - I can't do cold weather life anymore!). My choice for this is deeply rooted in not wanting to do billable hrs, not wanting to be a litigator, and generally just wanting a life that's more on my own terms and conducive to better health. I'm good with people and a resource of knowledge in certain areas pertaining to real estate and I think it would be a better fit for me, even though operating a life off of a commission structure would take many adjustments.

I could go on, but I need to wrap this up and I can add more if asked. I would really appreciate the help Reddit. Thank you :)",finance,1649015903.0

* **Debt:**
   * **Student Loan Debt (Federal) -** $25,000 balance (Interest rates ranging from 3.86% to 4.66%. In forbearance - not currently making payments. Standard monthly payment of $282 - finish by 04/2029)

Currently living rent-free with parents in an extremely high COL area (moved back in late 2019). Prior to that I was living paycheck-to-paycheck out of college. Been dealing with mental health stuff the past few years and haven’t been paying attention to my finances much at all - starting to change that this year. And I know my income is quite meager - it's a dead-end admin job and I only work 64 hours a week. I do plan on making a career change in the near future. 

***1) What to do with excess $ currently in bank accounts?***

So my monthly expenses are pretty low right now and quite honestly I don’t have anything in particular to save up for in the immediate future. At my current salary, I have no shot at owning a home anytime soon - at least not in the area I live in. Will likely rent whenever I move out in the next few years. Maybe consider buying property as I get closer to my mid 30s / once I have a higher paying job. 

With that said, I know there’s got to be a better way to put this money to use rather than having it parked in a checking account / HYSA. As stated, I’ve already maxed out a Roth IRA for 2021 and 2022. Additionally, $10k-15k of that $33k in savings is reserved as an emergency fund. I have a few ideas for the remaining cash I have saved up:

* ***Idea 1*** *-* Large payment(s) towards student loan debt. I have enough saved up to pay it off entirely or in large chunks, but not sure if that would be the smarter thing to do over just sticking with the payment plan. Interest rates aren’t terrible. Admittedly, I’ve been a bit hesitant to pay it off in large amounts due to the talks of possible student debt cancellation. Not getting my hopes up though. 
* ***Idea 2*** *-* Brokerage Account. Move the excess cash (excluding the emergency fund) over to a brokerage account and invest in index funds. In the future, I would invest all (or a portion of) my excess cash each month to keep building it up. I do have one question on this - is it generally frowned upon to use a brokerage account as a quasi-savings account if I already have an emergency fund set up?

***2) What should my general savings strategy be going forward?*** 

Right now on average I save about 70% of my take home pay - about $1900 a month. More like $1600 a month if you include the standard student loan payment. 

It also seems like I should be contributing more to my 401k since I'm in a position to do so. Planning on raising my contribution rate to 20% - sound reasonable?

Lastly, what would be a good plan for splitting up the excess cash each month between say investing in the brokerage account vs. additional student loan payments? Say 75% into the brokerage account and 25% as an extra payment towards student loans?

Thanks in advance everyone.",finance,1649025856.0

Card 1: 5,805.08, interest rate 14.99($72 a month) make payments of at least 300 a month

Card 2: 5086.07, interest rate 9.65 but i believe this will go up soon.. (I had done a BT from cap one to this card, initially 1500 and got the limit up). Make payments of at least 150 a month

I don't plan on using the cards again and have made arrangements to put the cards away. However, using a BT, didn't work for me with card 2. When I did a BT for card 2, they initially gave me a limit of 30k and had that HEAVILY reduced to 6k. I didn't want to fall in to a trap.

I make my payments on time each month. But having a hard time deciding if a BT is still better than a personal loan from lending club, for example. I can ask for how much the limit is with the loan, but a BT differs. Plus my cards have lower interest rates compared to others. I've picked up a lot of overtime at work to help costs.

I am doing my taxes on turbotax and I have a 1099 form from fidelity. The 1099 form is stocks I sold, but it was a sell-to-cover for other, which is supposed to cover tax expenses.

My vested RSU are included in box 1 of my w2. I really don't want to screw this up and have the IRS double dip here. But something is definitely wrong. Should I be getting taxes on the sell-to-cover stocks, when the purpose is to cover tax expenses of the original vested shares?

personalfinance,Pay down mortgage or have more cash on hand for next home purchase,"We purchased our first house about 10 years ago and have been paying a little extra toward principal each month (averaging \~+5-10% extra in payment).   We are now at the point where we've out grown our current home and are starting to look into purchasing a larger house out of state \[would sell our current residence\].  We have been looking for several months and since the housing market is pretty crazy right now and us not being in a rush to move - I anticipate this process taking at least another year or so.

My question is, if I plan to buckle down and save additional money each month - \~$300-500 a month for the next 6 months to a year - does it make sense to apply that additional cash to my current mortgage via additional principal payments or just put that money in a saving account if we definitely won't pay the house off entirely?

personalfinance,Sell or keep rental property,"I have a condo that I currently rent out, and I'm trying to decide if I should sell it. The monthly payments I make for principle, interest, taxes, insurance, management fee, and HOA is $1,500. I currently rent it for $1,600. In 2020 when interest rates dropped I refinanced on a 30-year fixed mortgage at 3.125 percent interest. I currently have about $95,000 in equity in the property (Redfin estimate - loan balance). So the question I have is whether I should sell the property and invest the money or continue renting it. Here are my reasons for and against selling:

Against:

* Diversified assets, not putting everything in the stock market
* The ROI will improve over time as the mortgage amortizes and I am paying more towards principle instead of interest
* I am making about $100 cash every month after expenses from the property. This will likely go up to about $200 when the current lease expires in a few months.
* I just paid $8,000 in closing costs to refinance in 2020. I know this is a sunk cost but selling now will mean I paid this money for almost nothing.

For: 

* I have an upcoming wedding in July. If I sell I can pay for this in cash instead of taking an estimated $10,000 loan that I will need to take out to pay for the wedding. My partner and I believe we could pay the loan off fairly quickly since she is about the start working which will give us a second income, but we will be paying 7 percent interest for as long as it takes us.
* I can invest the estimated $80,000 that will be left over in mutual funds.
* Every time the tenant changes, I have to pay a fee of 80 percent of one month's rent to the management company. So if a tenant only stays one year, this wipes out pretty much all the monthly gains I got throughout the year.
* Eventually there will be significant replacement costs for major appliances. The property was built in 2015 so I expect these will start in about 5-8 years.

personalfinance,TaxAct says $16k owed in a state I've never been to,"# TL;DR

I worked for &lt; 2 weeks for a new company in 2021. Their W2 shows me paying taxes in their HQ state where I don't live or work, and now TaxAct says I owe $16k to that state.

# Back Story

I started a new job on December 20th, 2021. The company is HQ'd in Idaho, and I am remote employee working 100% from Oregon. Working for the new company in those final 11 days of 2021, I made less than $2,600, and I paid state income taxes in Oregon of $208. Interestingly, my W2 also shows that I paid $128 to Idaho. I don't live in Idaho, and I've never worked or visited there (technically drove through it years ago).

# Unexpected Tax Bill

Since someone on r/personalfinance recommended TaxAct a few years ago, it's been my go-to tax-filing software. Today I was filing my 2021 taxes with it, and everything appeared fine until I entered my rather innocuous end-of-year W2 from the new company. Because Idaho appeared in the state tax section of my W2 (boxes 15 - 17), TaxAct signed me up for 3 things:

* Federal return
* Oregon state return
* Idaho state return

After I entered the Idaho tax of $128, the state tax estimator at the top of the page skyrocketed from \~$1,000 owed to a whopping $16,000 owed!

# Investigating

Because I'm married and filing jointly, we entered a few W2s total. I didn't know what had happened to blow up our state amount until I got to the end of the filing and decided to delete the Idaho filing to see what would happen, since I thought it strange to file in a state where I don't live or work. I've previously worked remotely in Oregon for a company HQ'd in California, and I never paid California taxes before. Once I deleted the Idaho return, the amount dropped back to the normal, expected amount.

# Thoughts / Questions

I know I shouldn't take tax advice from strangers on the Internet, even if it *is* r/personalfinance where I've gotten some excellent advice. Still, I'd love some input if you have any suggestions for me. This is doubly true since virtually no CPAs would take my business this late in tax season. I'm planning to use the online tax expert support offered by TaxAct tomorrow, but I want to see if anyone else has experienced this.

Namely, I am wondering:

1. Has anyone else had this happen? What was the outcome?
2. Does it seem strange that I was taxed in Idaho when I've never lived or worked there?
3. Is this a problem with TaxAct itself? I'm thinking maybe TaxAct assumes that our *total* 2021 income was somehow related to Idaho, even though it was just that small amount.
4. If the $128 tax to Idaho is somehow legit, am I now expected to file an entire state return for Idaho?

My fiancée (primary breadwinner)'s credit score has increased quite a bit after paying down /most/ of our debt (795 FICO/Equifax, 785 TransUnion), so we'd like to really take advantage of that. We have about 10k left to go ($4500 CC debt @ 18% + $5500 Car loan @ 15%), which will be paid off completely with next year's tax return after continuing to pay the minimum payments. We have just recently solved the MOST important problem (our income being lower than our expenses) due to a job upgrade, and are no longer going further into debt or even needing to use credit cards at all (woohoo). All CC's are sock drawered and rewards are covered by Coinbase debit card's flat 4% cash back rate. However, we'd like to pay as little interest possible until all of the debt is paid off from tax time in about 1 year from now. Right now, the plan is to apply for 1-2 credit cards with a 0% interest period to transfer the $4500 in high interest CC debt (considering Chase Freedom Unlimited + Citi Custom Cash).

28. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14). There is a report that crypto assets ""shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union."" Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

Part of my stipulations for the loans being approved is credit accounts being paid off. When the bank pulled my credit, the payoff amounts were not reflective of actual amount owed from some cards. A couple of payoffs were lower on the credit report than the actual balance cause the latest statement hadnt reported yet. The loan processor assured me the actual payoff would be calculated at closing and since I had extra proceeds coming back to me, the amount could be adjusted. At closing, the payoff amounts had not been adjusted, but again I was told not to worry cause there is enough proceeds to cover the difference.

personalfinance,Needing Some Reassurance/Help,"Good morning 
r/personalfinance. Over the last couple of years, my life has really started to settle down and I feel the most comfortable with money than I ever have but I’m still needing just a little reassurance that I’m doing everything right.

I’m an early 30s year old, have 2 children, own a home with my s/o in a LCOL area, and we both have very stable and secure careers making approx $50k a year each.

The only debt I have is $2.6k in medical debt at 0% for the next 2 years (working on having paid off in a year) and our mortgage. We financed roughly $130k and 2.8%.

I’m currently saving between 30-45% of my income. As far as assets go, I started contributing $500mo to my Roth in late 2020 which is split 65/35 between FZROX and FZILX. I have a 6 month emergency fund  (about $10k) that’s split 45% in I-Bonds, 50% HYSA, and 5% cash. Retirement wise, I have a vested pension with a previous employer and I’m almost vested with my current employers pension. I also have roughly $3k in a 457b plan that I no longer contribute too.

With my current employer, I’ll be eligible for retirement in about 30 years, my s/o in 15 (she’s A few years older and has a nice pension as well) Between my Roth and pensions, I’m fairly comfortable in the retirement area. So I guess my next big financial goal is to pay off the mortgage. I know with such a low interest rate a lot of people say not to worry about it but with my s/o retiring in 15 years, I’d like to have it paid off just for security reasons. My plan is to contribute my extra income into a taxable brokerage account and split it the same as my Roth but I’m concerned about taxes.

Is there anything else that I should be doing financially? Is my plan to pay off the mortgage early sufficient/right?",finance,1649072213.0
CryptoCurrency,Sam Bankman-Fried is the altruist billionaire crypto needs.,"The more I read about this guy, the more I love him. I initially scoffed, ""just another billionaire with an agenda,"" but his approach to being one of the wealthiest people on earth is refreshing. His pathway to capitalism doesn't come from the prominent and ruthless Ayn Rand methodology but more from a humanistic and altruistic view. His mentors throughout his education have been the likes of utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer, not Warren Buffet. 

Sam drives a Toyota Corolla and lives with ten other roommates. One of my favorite quotes of his is:

""You pretty quickly run out of really effective ways to make yourself happier by spending money, I don't want a yacht.""

When he worked as a trader, he gave away about half of his six-figure salary to animal-welfare groups and other effective-altruism-approved charities every year. Last year, he gave away $50 million, including pandemic relief in India and anti-global-warming initiatives. This year he says he'll donate at least a few hundred million and up to $1 billion, as much as the most significant foundations.

We can hate billionaires and CEXs all we want, but how many of us would dedicate our lives to ""effective altruism"" if we were in the same position? It's nice to see someone with his ideals and drive pushing the crypto space forward without uttering the words ""wen lambo?"".

Edit: just in case anyone doesn’t know who he is, he’s the founder of FTX.",cryptocurrency,1649073278.0

investing,Cash Alternatives in a Cash heavy portfolio,"I've created a chart that (I think) shows the relative purchasing power of US Dollars, Gold, and shares of STIP. I have a large cash allocation because much of my portfolio is leveraged. I'm trying to decide if some or all of my cash position should be in STIP shares. Obviously there's interest rate risk, but since that mostly seems linked to the Fed fighting higher than expected inflation, I'm having trouble deciding how much of an issue that is.

stocks,(4/4) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a frrrrrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, April 4th, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures are little changed to start the week](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were mostly flat Monday, as traders monitor the bond market’s warning signals about the economy.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded marginally higher. S&amp;P 500 futures were up about 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Twitter shares surged more than 25% after SEC filings revealed Elon Musk purchased a more than 9% passive stake in the social media company. It comes less than a week after Musk polled his followers, questioning whether the social media giant follows free speech principles. Based on Twitter’s Friday closing price, the stake is worth $2.89 billion.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares ticked higher by 1%, after the company reported on Saturday its latest quarterly electric vehicle delivery figures. The company delivered more than 310,000 EVs in the first quarter, up from 184,800 in the year-earlier period.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Starbucks shares dipped about 1% after the coffee chain suspended its share repurchase program.
*****
&gt; An often-cited recession signal was triggered Thursday evening when the the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields inverted for the first time since 2019. The 5-year note yield is also trading above its 30-year counterpart.
*****
&gt; “We think the current flattening is due to the concern that the Fed is behind the curve on hikes and will tighten policy beyond neutral, which will hurt growth,” TD Securities said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Investors are also monitoring the latest developments in Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that Western nations will impose additional sanctions on Russia in the coming days.
*****
&gt; “Equity and bond markets continued to send conflicting signals about the economic outlook,” UBS said in a recent note to clients. “We caution against over-interpreting either signal. Yield curve inversions have historically predicted recessions with a long and uncertain lag, while hopes over cease-fire talks have ebbed and flowed,” the firm added.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a winning session, with the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all posting gains Friday. The S&amp;P 500 also posted its third straight week of gains.
*****
&gt; Seasonally, April is generally one of the best months for stocks, edging higher in the last 20 years by 2.41% on average, MKM Partners’ JC O’Hara wrote in a note. Within 16 of the last 17 Aprils, the S&amp;P has also inched higher.
*****
&gt; Friday’s positive session came despite March’s employment report, which fell short of economists’ estimates. The U.S. economy added 431,000 jobs during the month, while estimates from Dow Jones called for 490,000.
*****
&gt; “Strong gains on the employment front continue to signal a green light for investors despite multi-decade highs in inflation and concerns over higher rates and Fed tightening,” noted Peter Essele, head of portfolio management for Commonwealth Financial Network. “The economy appears to be in exit velocity mode, with the only concern being the amount of labor supply available to fuel the robust recovery,” he added.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee will publish the minutes from the central bank’s March meeting, giving investors a deeper understanding into how the Fed views market conditions.

personalfinance,Understanding student loan options,"I’m helping a friend figure out if she should refinance her student loans. She’s currently on an income based repayment plan (PAYE). Some of the loans are subsidized, some are not. And it’s a mix of grad/undergrad loans. Her current repayment amount is $0, even after the pause ends in May. 

How do I calculate the repayment amount? My understanding is that it is 10% of income less 150% federal poverty limit, but her income is above that so why is it still $0 repayment?

Also, how do I take into account the subsidized vs unsubsidized? I assume this comes into play with the taxes owed for any interest forgiveness?

I’d really like to create an excel file where she can make different assumptions about income and interest rates to see if refinancing makes sense and what repayment amounts to include in her budget.",finance,1649078994.0

I'm just about to turn 68 years old and plan to work until I'm 70 or so since I'm in very good health and enjoy my job.   I accumulated debt (about 45K) several years ago to help get through a difficult divorce.  That debt is completely paid off and my credit scores (FICO 8) are in the 820 range (with over 100K in available credit on credit cards at near zero utilization) and rising as the age of accounts increases and inquiries disappear.  

I have a 401K at work which is partially matched by the company.  I will continue to pay into that until I leave in a couple years.  My living expenses are very low so I now have about $1000 or more a month to save.

Earlier this year I opened accounts with Fidelity.  One of them was an IRA (my first and only) which is already funded at about $3000 of the $7000 yearly limit.  Meanwhile I've been studying a bit more than I used to about investing (I'm sold on the Bobblehead approach) and now believe that a ROTH IRA would be better primarily because my current marginal tax rate is only 12% Federal and about 3% State.  My retirement income after age 70 with Social Security, 401K distributions and other income will almost certainly put me well into a higher marginal tax bracket

I've opened a Roth IRA at Fidelity and plan on putting the remaining $4000 of my yearly IRA contribution limit into that account.  Is there any problem with converting my existing $3000 of year 2022 contributions from my IRA account into a ROTH IRA?

(Crypto noob),"Hi guys, I've been using [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) in terms of their Earn program, however, they recently cut the Stablecoin rates, from 10% down to 6% in my case. I know interest rates on Stablecoins are being cut across the board, but I would like to know if there are any other places where I can maximise the interest I am getting. I've been looking at Nexo and it seems like they pay 8% interest on Stablecoins. Would that platform be good? Also, what is the best, cheapest way to transfer all my USDC out of [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) and into one of these exchanges that you guys will suggest. I am quite new to crypto, so I don't quite know the best way yet lol, but I am learning. I also heard of Anchor protocol is giving around 19.5% on Stablecoins held there, but I don't know how that is possible, so I am doubtful it is safe, but then again, I am quite new to this space.

Thanks for any replies guys!",cryptocurrency,1649089569.0
solar,"High Price??? Clt, NC","I am looking at installing solar in my 1176 sq ft, all electric, new construction 2022, one story, bungalow style house, near Charlotte, NC (a little North). Great roof for solar with minimal shade, no trees, perfect sun facing direction, etc. I am getting quotes to put solar on my house and I have some questions. 

I am being told somewhere between 5-6 kW systems should provide close to 100% coverage for my home. I haven't gotten an electric bill yet and Duke Energy's website is not working until the 6th so I can't see my daily energy usage until then. Trying to determine now if this is likely accurate? The only bill I have is from our old house which was very different: 1999, 2 story, only one inefficient A/C system, and gas heat, and there we used 9,500 Kwh in a 12 month period. 

We are a family of 2: mom and toddler, but might eventually add another child and/or another partner/adult. I run a smart home (smart lights, security system, electronics, air purifiers, etc) but am pretty good at conserving energy I would think (turning off lights when I leave the room, eliminating vampire power drain, Energy Star appliances, etc). 

So first question being how to size the system: installer says I can start smaller and add more later if needed, for only a $250 site visit cost, and then add those panels on to the remainder of the loan with no penalties or back interest or anything.

Installer 1 is LGCY Power, who I was referred to by AllConnect, who I was referred to when I called to set up Duke electricity. (Yeah, I'm a sucker and I stay on the line! I know I'm paying $$$ to let them sell me stuff, but it's the convenience factor for me). 

Their quote is 5.28 kW system, with a $2,500 energy efficiency rider added (so I can do a couple things I want to do to the house) for $34,950 and a $7,500 system rebate, which is a 1.98% loan for 25 years through GoodLeap. This is an 18 month interest only payment of $50 a month and then the fully amortized amount of $100 after (give or take ~$5). He says he'll pay my first year of payments because of a mistake he made earlier as well. Still; at over $6 per kW in the system, isn't this kind of outrageous?! He's telling me that cheaper companies sometimes ""smash and grab"" and won't be there to service warranties and etc for the next 30 years, do poor installs that can cause damage, etc. He says they're selling you the customer service, company reputation, WARRANTIES (including your actual roof for 25 years), etc. These are 440W, Aptos DNA 144 mf23 panels (12 of them) with 30 year warranty and IQ 7+ inverters. He also says a $12k Enphase battery is NOT worth it for us or cost effective, and to get a generator if I *need* something (I think I agree here even though it would be super cool), but that he can make my system battery ready for the future. 


Installer 2 is SunPro, and they are telling me to get 3 energy bills first and THEN they'll build me a quote, using LG 380W Neon 2 panels and same IQ 7+ inverters. (Installer 2 says these have great track record whereas Aptos have known; installer 1 rebuts and says LG is stopping making panels soon so he wouldn't buy those). 



Installer 3 is Tesla, and I'm getting an online quote for a 4.8kW system (10 panels) of $10,656 then the $2,771 federal rebate. Obviously this is a crazy low price??? Installer 1 says that is a cash price and no financing included, and that his buddy got Tesla and the installers messed up so badly that a wire touched another wire and caused a small fire (that Tesla paid for all repairs on). I also have an aunt with solar panels that she bought on her house, made by Tesla, and she said she had a roof damage issue and they argued with her over taking off and putting back on the panels and making her pay for it. 



So, who else do I look at/ what do I need to know? Obvioisly everyone is trying to sell me.... I'm making a HUGE, long-term investment and I want to get it right. Ideally, I'd love to pay around $20k for a 6kW battery-ready system with great warranties, a reputable company with a solid and long history, and no major fuss. I'd love to be around 2% financing too (perfect credit) and get this going asap before summer! Let me know opinions please!!!! Thanks all",energy,1649089635.0

**Tl;dr:** Mom informed me of a mutual fund in my name, and I'm filing 1099-DIV for the first time. I want to make sure I don't screw myself over tax-wise going forward.

I recently found out that my grandfather had invested in a mutual fund (it's an index fund) for me that I was not able to access until 21. My mom warned me when I transferred it to my name that anything I withdraw on it would be pretty highly taxed. This year on my taxes I am reporting income from my W-2 as well as the 1099-DIV my financial institution sent me. Turbotax (I know) says I owe about $1100 between State and Federal taxes this year (it's not ideal but the city I live in has very high tax rates), which I'm assuming is related to the dividends but could also be because my tax withholding at work was incorrect. I have not withdrawn any money from the account and I still have to submit the ""Custodial Beneficiary Conversion"" form to the bank in order to do so. What do I need to know before submitting that application? I am obviously reporting the dividends, but I don't want to go in uninformed and be screwed going forward.

personalfinance,Pay off student loans or invest?,"So I moved back to my parent's place in early 2020 after living paycheck to paycheck for awhile. I've saved up about $42k in cash during this time. Now I'm trying to decide whether I should use my savings to pay off my existing student loan debt, or put it in a brokerage account and passively invest in index funds.

I should also note that I don't have anything in particular to save up for right now, like buying property for example. I live in an extremely high COL area, so buying a home is out of the question for me in the near future, at least with my current dead-end job as a clerical worker.

* **Income** \- $2,679 monthly (take-home pay, after taxes and 401k contribution. 32 hours a week)

* **Bank Assets:**
   * **Checking Account** \- $9,000
   * **Savings Account (HYSA)** \- $33,000 ($10-15k of this reserved as emergency fund)
* **Retirement Assets:**
   * **Traditional 401k -** $15,000 (Current contribution rate of 12% personal + 3% employer. I plan to increase personal rate to 15-20%. Limited fund choices &amp; high management expense fee of 1%) 
   * **Roth IRA -** $12,300 (Opened this year, maxed out for 2021 and 2022.) 
* **Debt:**
   * **Student Loan Debt (Federal) -** $25,000 total balance (Interest rates ranging from 3.86% to 4.66%. In forbearance - not currently making payments. Standard monthly payment of $282 - finish by 04/2029)

I obviously have the money to pay off the student loan debt in full. But with the May 1st deadline coming up, I'm thinking about at least waiting until then to see if anything happens. Though I'm not getting my hopes up that they'll be cancelling student loan debt anytime soon.

I guess the real question is whether or not going the brokerage route and passively investing in index funds would net a greater return than the 3.86-4.66% student loan interest rate over the same amount of time...

CryptoCurrency,The Changes of World Order and Crypto,"So im going to do my best to articulate the information I have come across to paint the picture as to what is going on not just in the market/economy but in the world. 

This all piece together in my mind after being part of this community watching the DD put out, various events in not just the world economy but also in the crypto markets. 

After watching Ray Dalio’s [Principles of Dealing with the Changing World Order](https://youtu.be/xguam0TKMw8) (44 minute video) all the things I may detail will actually all get aligned with you as well. 

In the video Ray makes great points as to how in order to get a sense of what is going to happen in the future you have to look at the past and present not as completely different but as a road map to outline to see where we are. 

Taking into consideration the high amount of debt US and households are in with the increased borrowing through the pandemic and still. US interest rates being at near zero. Large levels of gov printing of money. Current polarizing political state. 

We are heading towards a huge shift in changing world powers, i.e. China becoming the new world power. With all of this in play big money and investors are scrambling to find where to put their money to keep it safe. This is where crypto comes into play. 

[China completely banned crypto](https://fortune.com/2022/01/04/crypto-banned-china-other-countries/) from its bothers as they saw the coming threat. The US as always has been slow to catch up so it has allowed the crypto market to boom as it has now grown to a power house. We thought the [executive order](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/president-biden-issues-executive-order-cryptocurrencies-taking-steps-toward#:~:text=On%20March%209%2C%202022%20President,2021%20and%20a%20survey%20suggesting) was going to crack down but in reality it is basically setting up the US to review Crypto for everything that it is. 

My speculation is that given the US and smart investors understand what is coming they are looking into moving their money and investment into Crypto/Bitcoin to keep China from becoming the new world currency. While doing this the US is poised to benefit by tying itself to crypto and becoming the reserve currency thus maintaining power as the fiat equivalent.",cryptocurrency,1649112810.0

When we sell our primary residence, we expect to have another $175k to use for down payment on ~$700k home in the state we’re moving to. 

Thinking below are our options.

1. Park 2nd home sale money in HYSA and combine both primary and vacation amounts for down payment on new house? That would be around a 50% down payment, which seems a little crazy but with interest rates appearing to be on the rise would help keep monthly payment down. This is what we’re leaning towards.

I'm definitely *way* below the poverty line, technically - I'm still living with family (paying rent, though not much) and make less than 200$ a week at work. I've managed to avoid heavy debt, but that might end up changing soon if I don't leverage my performance into something useful.

personalfinance,When do you pay a gift tax?,"My parents are lending me and my partner 20% for a down payment on a home. It is a $100k gift. My husband and I plan to sell our home immediately after closing and pay them back with part of the profit we will obtain from our house. We were approved to get a bridge loan but that was high in interest and seemed more complicated in terms of timing everything out. We also thought about financing 95% of the home and then recasting 15% once our home sells, but that would require us to pay mortgage insurance for a bit until the request to remove the recast is taken off.

My concern is how ""gifts"" are taxed. This isn't a gift since we are going to pay them back within a couple of months. However we don't need this money to qualify for our loan and were approved to get a loan from the bank for the same amount (so not worried about debt to income issues). 

We are located in North Carolina. I read that NC did away with gift taxes, but that the federal government only allows $15k per person to be gifted annually before reporting it on taxes. My question is, does reporting it equate to paying taxes on it? Or, is it just required to be reported?

I read that taxes don't kick in until you exceed the $14ish million maximum over a lifetime, but then I'm unsure why the IRS wants to see if you gifted over the annual amount (and why there is an annual limit if there are no repercussions to exceeding it?).

Also, in terms of paying back will I be subject to any taxes when I give them $100k back?",finance,1649121181.0

personalfinance,"Looking to refinance debt, don’t know where to start","Hello! Firstly, I apologize because I’m on mobile and I know the formatting is weird.

Exactly as the title says. I’m looking to refinance a large sum of debt, roughly $45,000. This is a combined personal loan ($12K) and credit card debt from when I was in college. I have a co-signer, and our joint income is about $135K+ a year, of which $45K is mine but I have reasonable access to his income as well for paying debts. 

I’m looking to refinance for a better interest rate (my personal loan right now is 16% and my credit cards are in the 20-23% range), as well as making it one payment so I’m not being spread so thin. Making the payments doesn’t worry me, I’ve never been late on a payment and our income supports the debt, I just feel as though I am having a difficult time breaking through the interest that accumulates and would like to actually be able to watch my debt diminish and get it paid off quicker. I’ve paid off roughly $40K debt in the last year or so, and I am ready to refinance and keep chipping.

That being said, are there providers I should specifically be looking at that would allow a joint owner/co signer for such a large balance? We have relationships with Chase (who I have read does not offer personal loans), Citizens (online it says they only go up to $15K), and Wells Fargo, but am open to other ideas. I have no problem with Wells Fargo, and wouldn’t mind going that route, but I don’t have a local branch anymore so would I be able to apply with a co-signer online? And is anyone able to tell me if they’d make me shut down all my credit cards (as I know some debt consolidation loans do)?

personalfinance,Student loans &amp; Marriage,"With the student loans payments resuming soon, I’ve been thinking about how we should go back filing our taxes for next year. We’re getting married this September

Me: 25, got my masters in May of 2020 with about 28k in fed loans. I make about 78k a year. Have not paid any off because of the forbearance. No other debt except for mortgage (see below). 

Him: Also 25, graduated with his bachelors in December of 2019 with 43k in fed loans and makes $36k a year. Also has not paid any off due to the forbearance. Has a $300 month car payment. 

I bought a house about 6 months ago (under my name only) and the mortgage is $1150 a month which we split 50/50. 

I myself do not qualify for any of the repayment plans because I make too much, so I’m looking at $300 a month on the standard repayment plan. My fiancé qualifies for a repayment plan that lowers his monthly payment to like $90. 

We both technically will qualify for PSLF (he works for the state and I work at for a non-profit hospital system). I’ve work for this hospital system for about a year and before that I worked for a place that does not qualify for the PSLF since it’s not a non-profit. Fiancé has worked for the state since he graduated in 2019. But he really does not want to stay at his place of work - he’s looking into getting into a trade apprenticeship through a local union but this means he won’t qualify for any sort of forgiveness, and that might not even work out (he’s on a waitlist right now, so his soonest start date would be September of 2033). I plan at staying at my place of work long term. 

We keep a lot of finances separate. I paid the down payment on our house (about $32k) and pay for most of our outings, but everything else we split. He pays his own car payment. 

Would It be worth it to file married separately next year so my fiancé can have a lower monthly payment? 

I don’t know if this matters because I have about $23k in savings, but about $10k will go towards the wedding and honeymoon. He does not have any savings.

personalfinance,(First Time Homebuyer) Can I use builder preferred lender incentive to buy points?,"Wife and I finally have a closing date for our new construction home. Our builder is offering to cover up at ~$12k in closing costs to use their preferred lender.

Lender wrote up an estimate today that is about 5/8ths percent higher than what I am getting when I shop around. Local lenders are telling me they can offer the same “no closing” deal by raising my interest rate (I’m thinking of this as negative points). To me, I’m not seeing the benefit of using the preferred lender.

However, my estimate shows they are covering about 8k in costs. That seems to me like I’m leaving 4k on the table. Can I use this “free” money to buy mortgage points? This would drop my rate in the ballpark of the local lenders without me coming out of pocket for closing. I haven’t found any fine print in my contract yet.

personalfinance,I think I got screwed trying to pay off car loan,"This may be a little long, but hopefully it's clear. So here's the deal. My girlfriend was in a bad spot 4.5 years ago and had to get a car. She ended up with one that has a terrible interest rate (14.5%). The total that she ended up owing Including interest after 7 years was just under $49000.

She is now 2.5 years out from the end of the loan and she still owed $17100.97 on the loan.

We called the bank and asked them how the payment was broken down and were told it was around $180 to principal and $98 to interest. We were also told that if we paid off the amount owing on the loan that we we would no longer have to pay the interest. She asked 3 seperate operators this for clarification. 

So we paid off the loan with my credit line because my interest rate is significantly lower than the car loan was.

I kept feeling like something was wrong, but went against my better judgement after asking the people at the banm.
We were told that the total loan would be finished in December 2024. Well... that's about 33 months from now...and that works out to $18480. 
If you take away their admin fee (which we didn't have to pay by paying it off early).... that's what we paid off. 

So if the loan is broken down into principal and interest....we just paid all that interest. Meaning we saved absolutely nothing and will actually pay a little more because of the interest on the credit line.

Are there any experts out there that can help me wrap my head around this? We were told multiple times that we would be paying of the principle and would not pay any more interest. Were they just playing semantic games with us? Is there anything we can do about this.",finance,1649127852.0
personalfinance,I-Bond Secrets/Hacks,"With the looming deadline to lock in 7.12% for 6 months followed by potentially higher rates for the following 6 months, I thought it would be nice to put together some I-Bond secrets/hacks. I will start it off:
1. Try to buy I-Bonds at the end of the month. You will still get the entire month of interest and you can pull the funds on the first day of the same month 11 months later (no need to be locked out for 12 months). 
2. Use a revocable trust to purchase another 10k. Don’t have one? You can create a cheap one online. 
3. Gift unlimited I-Bonds to a spouse (and vice versa) to lock in todays high rates. Take into consideration that a gift counts towards the annual limit of 10k. So if you gift 100k to your spouse today, the cash starts to accrue todays interest rates, but your spouse would need 10 years to have all the funds delivered into their account assuming they are not putting in any of their own cash. This is likely best for a smaller gift of 10k.

gaming,Heaven/Hell Mod Idea for Minecraft,"Dear Minecraft coders and/or modders, please consider this: Minecraft, but similarly to how you get kicked to spectator if you die in hardcore mode, if you die in heaven/hell mode, you get permanently sent to heaven or hell. This can be called good place / bad place, or whatever you prefer since heaven/hell may be overly religious for your tastes. However, I’m using these terms as shorthand for now. Heaven can be based off an end city, and hell, the nether.

So, what determines if you get sent to heaven or hell? My rough idea is that every block placed or animal fed is a point to heaven, and every non-agro mob (animals, villagers, etc.) killed is a point to hell. Depending on which side gets more points when you die, that’s where you go. If your points are tied, you go into limbo, or spectator mode (like in hardcore).

personalfinance,Conflicted about Financial Advisor,"Hi all,

2 years ago, at the age of 24, I was working for a tech company that blew up and found myself overwhelmed with stock decisions regarding my then very valuable ESPP &amp; RSU shares and what to do with the money from selling the shares. I was working long hours at the time and didn’t have the time to effectively manage this money myself so started working with a CFP, who has been my parents advisor for 20+ years.   

Over the last 2 years, my current advisor has done a pretty good job at managing my portfolio and helping me make decisions regarding my company stock. However, my non-retirement account and Roth IRA has only grown about 6.53% since June 2020. In addition, I feel as though they have struggled at times with tax guidance given that they maybe don’t have as much experience with tech stocks and tax decisions regarding ESPP.

I am now looking for a new CFP and landed on one that has stellar reviews and was referred to me by a few coworkers in a similar situation. I was immediately sold when he did a fee analysis of my current portfolio and said he can offer lower rates than what I currently pay, while offering more services. He came across as a genuine trustworthy advisor and I didn’t hesitate signing on as a client.

However, I am now at the point where it’s time to transfer over my current accounts and I have some concerns for sure. 

First and foremost, I searched my new advisor on BrokerCheck (just learned about this today) and he has one disclosure related to providing false insurance information for a client 7 years ago. Also, after reading through client documents very thoroughly I discovered that my advisor also seems to be incentivized to sell me insurance, which he is currently looking to do. I thought it was a little weird that I would need life/disability outside of my employer, but I do understand the potential benefits and why it could be good to lock in a low rate while I’m young and healthy. Still seems shady to me. I will mention, however, they do not seem to receive any commission for stock decisions, which is good.

I know that advice on Reddit typically seems to recommend to avoid advisors entirely and to invest yourself, which is also an option I’m considering. However, given that I am already overwhelmed at times with my company stock, I’m not sure I want to handle other investments.

So..am I overreacting to my discoveries to my new advisor and should I rely on outstanding reviews/referrals or is some of this stuff shady? Given that I signed on as a new client, I’m wondering if I’m on the hook for the quarterly free if I decide to terminate my contract",finance,1649130453.0

CryptoCurrency,"Unironically, DeFi is something worth FOMOing over","Do you know what banks do with your money? 

When you deposit, around 90% of your cash leaves reserves. Some become profit making activities for the bank like loans and investment, some pay expenses and some becomes spending on grants, advertising, political donations, lobbying etc.

What do you get in return? Perhaps 0.1% interest at best, but more realistically, negative interest rates, especially if you count the charges and premiums. 

Literally banks use your money to make money while charging you to even hold it. 

But DeFi is here to change that. With decentralized platforms, profits can end up back to the users. These incentives make for a more vibrant and fair financial standard. And this is exactly why decentralization is revolutionary. First if all let me clarify that I am not talking about a single token or platform but rather about the whole decentralized economy. And I mean actually decentralized platforms, not stuff like ""DeFi earning"" in binance.com. 

With DeFi you can manage your wealth with freedok. Money ends up where users deem more worthy, not where the status quo decides. No more monopolies. Infinite competition. Open technologies, trustlessness... With DeFi, code is law. No need to trust your government on monetary policy and your money deposited being worthless or gone overnight (see 2013 Cyprus bank deposit haircut). Smart contracts do exactly what is published for everyone to see on the Blockchain and only that. 

TL;DR, fuck banks. You can earn your money's worth on decentralized platforms right now. And that's something worth FOMOing over with so much inflation going around.",cryptocurrency,1649132575.0

28. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14). There is a report that crypto assets ""shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union."" Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

29. Here’s some analysis of the EU MiCA draft language guessing that there’s a good chance it will pass today (March 14) but that it might be removed during “Trilogues” which will be the subsequent informal tripartite meetings on legislative proposals between representatives of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, and the European Commission.

11. Federal School loan  debt.  Couple hundred thousand left. 
12. I can technically open a sep IRA.  But I have not. 


VUL Rep is saying I need a VUL to set myself up with some tax deferred options so that when it’s time to cash out my 401k I’m
not pushed into a higher tax bracket.  
I cannot find anywhere that it ever states VUL are a good idea unless you are a very very high worth  person (which I am not).  Need some solid reasons (other than the horror stories,  high fees, and I’m better of using a traditional acct to buy stocks ) why the VUL is not for me. 

All my rationale as to why I don’t think I need it has been met with the above explanation plus the rationale that they can set the VUL “floor” so I never lose money. I am interested in tax deferred growth but when I do the back door calculator it does not work in my favor.

worldpolitics,“ECO-safety is the main priority”,"The development of the natural resources of the Russian Arctic requires special attention to the prevention of possible emergency situations of natural, technogenic and ecological character of very vulnerable Arctic nature. Currently, the role and importance of the Arctic is further increased. This is due to the continuing high concentration within the Arctic region’s geopolitical, defense, economic, ecological and scientific interests of the Russian Federation, defining its dynamic socio-economic development and formation of new external challenges and threats to national security. Among them is the incompleteness of international law for delimitation of exclusive economic zones and continental shelf of Russia in the Arctic with neighboring states. The United Nations’ final recognition of the part of the Arctic shelf as Russian territory will strengthen environmental control there. Ensuring environmental security is one of the priorities of interstate cooperation in the Arctic. Among the main objectives of Russia in the sphere of environmental security is to preserve and ensure protection of the Arctic natural environment, eliminate environmental consequences of economic activities under conditions of increasing economic activity and global climate change. Russia takes a responsible approach to activities in the Arctic, preservation of unique natural ecological systems, natural landscapes and natural complexes.
It is worth noting that not all countries behave so humanely with regard to the environment in the Arctic region. For example, NATO member states led by the United States. While Russia actively participates in the formation of international trade in energy resources, without damage to the environment, this order of things does not suit everyone. And some Western countries are trying to squeeze Russia out of the European energy market. The U.S. promotes its ""famous"" shale gas to the world market, the production of which is carried out in the Arctic. The Americans, having announced the onset of the ""shale revolution,"" tried to inspire the West with the idea that a substitute for conventional gas would save many countries from Russia's ""expansion"" in the global fuel market. But soon both the European Union and other parts of our planet learned about the negative impact of shale gas production and its unprofitability. It should not be overlooked that shale gas production causes irreparable damage to the environment.
In recent years in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation measures have been implemented to eliminate the consequences of pollution and other negative impacts on the environment as a result of economic and other activities, thanks to which a significant number of objects that posed a real threat to the environment have been eliminated.",energy,1649145891.0

Last year, I was paid via fellowship instead, though my paychecks didn’t change (apart from the normal ~2% increase that happened every year). Everything I can find online says that fellowship income is taxable unless specifically earmarked for tuition, books, etc. The income is not reported on a W-2 but my university told me to report my income based on my pay stubs. On my pay stubs, I see my “total gross”, but I also see “Federal Taxable Gross”, which is $0.

gaming,Metal Gear Rising: speech patterns of 7 characters,"I think characters in [Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Rising:_Revengeance) have simple abstract speaking patterns.

I'm going to quote **7** characters: *Raiden, Blade Wolf, Jetstream Sam, Senator Armstrong, Sundowner, Monsoon and Mistral*. The post **contains spoilers**. Every name [can be a link to the final trailer by Hideo Kojima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM) to help you navigate the post. The post **contains spoilers**.

In this analysis we take quotes and slice them into pieces and mark every piece with special ""markers"". Those markers tell us about the ingredients of a character's speech. 

Why look for speech patterns? Speech patterns show how a character processes information: in what context a character views an event. But **beware (Disclaimer):** it's a highly speculative idea and I'm just your average uneducated Joe (not a linguist). My idea may be total garbage... but for now it's very important for me anyway, it's not some deliberate joke.

***

# Raiden (Jack)

*""Abstract""/""absolute"" things are things relevant to any possible situation. Often they describe intrinsic properties.*

[Raiden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM) can connect/contrast different absolute things. That's how Raiden describes situations. You can compare his speech to a braid, to intertwined infinite strands.

- *Armstrong! I said my sword was a tool of justice... Not used in anger. Not used for vengeance. But now... now I'm not so sure. And besides... This isn't my sword.*

Here Raiden connects/contrasts different abstract properties of the sword: **""a tool of justice""**, **""not for vengeance""** and **""not my sword""**.

- *I learned young that killing your enemies felt good. Really good. In America, my friends... my family... They helped me forget the devil inside. But who am I kidding? I was born to kill. The bit about my sword -- that ""means of justice"" stuff? I guess I needed something to keep “the Ripper” in check when I was knee-deep in bodies.*

Raiden mostly talks about absolute things and contrasts/connects them: ""*killing enemies feels good* (in all situations)"", ""*friends/family help to forget the devil inside* (in all situations)"", ""*Raiden is born to kill* (intrinsic property)"" and ""*the sword is supposed to be the means of justice* (abstract property), *to keep the Ripper in check* (in all situations)"". Raiden wants to find the **definitive** answer why things are not the way they supposed to be, to understand if his life can **ever** be the right way.

***

# Raiden (2)

*""Specific"" things are things related to unique events (events that don't/can't repeat periodically easily), important outcomes and results.*

You can look at speech at 2 different ""levels"": one level describes how a character reacts to events and another level describes how a character views entire situations. We already analyzed the latter level of Jack's speech and now we're going to take a look at the former level.

[Jack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM) can take an abstract/intrinsic property of something and combine it with a specific event (bolded). That's how Jack reacts to events.

- *People who terrorize and take innocent lives for money.* **They sowed their fate when they took this job.** *I’m just the reaper.*

Here Jack combines a specific event (taking the job/deciding the fate) with an intrinsic property of himself (*being the reaper*) or the organization (*taking lives for money*).

- *Look... I’m fed up, with all of it. Companies like ours -- yours bend the laws when it suits business.* **Why not bend it when it can save innocent lives?**

Jack discusses a specific decision and an intrinsic property of the company (*bending the laws when it suits business*).

This speech pattern can make Raiden a bit of a fatalist: Raiden can focus on a struggle against something unchangeable. This pattern can juxtapose a specific conflict with an absolute thing.

***

# Blade Wolf

[Blade Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM) can connect/conflict specific events. That's how Blade Wolf reacts to events.

- *I may analyze orders, but I may not disobey them. Should I disobey a direct order, my memory would be wiped. I must destroy you.*

- *However, Raiden came to my aid... I have learned from him. When Samuel fell, data analysis was inconclusive... but that has changed. I have established new parameters, now. Created my own directives.*

Wolf connects specific events, outcomes (such as **""memory wipe""** or **""I created my own directives""**).

But there's also another component/interpretation of [Blade Wolf's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM) reaction to events: Blade Wolf can jump from a topic to a topic, leave the connection between facts unclarified. This makes Wolf's speech a bit ""ragged""/dry 'cause there's no smooth connection between speech bits:

- *It is likely no single correct answer exists. Additionally, human conflict stems from opposing ideals and societal norms. I was not programmed with these guidelines.*

You can view this message as jumping from the topic of *«the number of answers»* to the topic of *«the essence of human conflict»* and *«Blade Wolf's guidelines»*.

Additionally, each bit of [Blade Wolf's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM) speech is a standalone self-sustained point. Blade Wolf describes a situation with the most important facts at the moment. Throws a punch after a punch. All of that means you can cut Blade Wolf's speech into small parts without losing context. This ""standalone-ness"" contributes to the ""ragged-ness"" even more.

***

# Jetstream Sam (Samuel Rodrigues)

*""Vague"" means related to qualities of a process/situation rather than to its outcomes &amp; results. ""Vague"" things describe something non-binary, something that can be realized in many ways. Or something consisting of many details, parts or variables.*

[Sam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM) can focus on connections between vague events/facts. That's how Samuel reacts to events.

- *I heard you chopped the lab director in half. Old habits die hard, oh, Jack? But now here you are, the child soldier, fighting for the children.*

- *Ah, but you're a man on a mission, aren't you... Gonna fix everything. Just you and your little sword there. Solve everything with violence, is that it?* 

Here Sam focuses more on the way Jack is doing things rather than on any important outcomes of Jack's actions. Also:

- *Sure, they're adults. Sure they signed up for this. Right on the dotted line of their PMC contract. Usually they're no strangers to war. In fact, many times they already lost a limb or two. Many times they were out of work and starving on the street. So yes... They sign up for surgery, to fight God-knows-where. How else would you provide for your family when your country's embroiled in civil war? Pain receptors shut down, pumped full of fear-inhibiting nanomachines, and sent right into the blender... your blender... But they made their choice, right? Open your eye and see, Raiden.*

Sam connects details about adult cyborgs' background and details about their ""choice""/their future perspectives.

While Raiden judges a situation from the outside, Sam judges a situation from the inside. 

Aside from the speech pattern, you just can't avoid mentioning Sam's cheeky smile. 

***

# Senator Armstrong

[Steven Armstrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM) can describe some vague circumstances related to a single specific thing (bolded). That's how Armstrong describes situations. In that aspect Steven's speech is like a cloud with something in the center. As if Steven is in the eye of the storm.

- **But you did survive!** *Through sheer force of will following your own set of rules. With your own two hands* **you took back your life!**

Armstrong describes an important result (Jack survived) &amp; focuses on detailing *HOW* this result was achieved.

- *Maybe not...* **You've guaranteed** *the status quo will go on, for a while longer at least... War... will continue as an institution. As an industry. Men will fight for reasons they don't understand, causes they don't believe in...* **But at least I'll leave a worthy successor... You, Jack.** *You carve your own path, use whatever methods you see fit... You don't let legal bullshit get in the way. And if it costs a few lives? So be it...*

Armstrong describes vague circumstances (details about war, details about Jack's way of doing things) and connects them to an important result: ""Jack secured the status quo"" or ""Armstrong leaves a worthy successor"".

***

# Sundowner

*""Specific"" events are often related to binary discrete possibilities («yes/no», «win/fail» and etc. ...). And ""vague"" things can be related to comparisons.*

[Sundowner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM) can combine a couple of vague things with a specific thing (bolded). That's how Sundowner reacts to events. And this is a way to tie a couple of tangents to a simple key point. You can compare his speech to a massive sunflower with big leaves around its center.

- *I believe you're familiar with the lesson plan... The same regimen you went through in Liberia. Effective program. Just look how you turned out.* **Of course, running it in the real world just got a bit too... complicated.** *Doing it virtually though? No fuss, no muss. Straight to the brain. It's like a dream. Well, maybe “dream” is the wrong word. They do kill some POWs... some civilians...*

Sundowner ties details of the ""lesson plan"" and feelings from the learning with a simple binary point: there's no opportunity to do it in the real world/it's much worse.

- **Business ain’t been the same since they shut down SOP.** *""A clean break from the war economy."" Well some of us liked that economy. How’s an honest war monger supposed to make a living?*

Sundowner ties a comparison between people (some like war economy, some don't) and a vague topic of making a living (it's vague 'cause *""making a living""* isn't a specific result) with a specific outcome: **business has changed**. 

When describing situations, Sundowner can describe large complex situations (e.g. the current situation in the world).

***

# Monsoon

A full speech pattern is described by **2** levels and each level has **2** interpretations. So **4** components/interpretations of a speech pattern in total.  

I'm going to describe all **4** components/interpretations of [Monsoon'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM)[s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) speech pattern as I see them:

- *Feasting on the insides of your enemies. How easily you ignore the loss of life when it suits your convenience. So tell me: Who saves the weak from the man who saves the weak?*

When reacting to events, Monsoon **(1)** describes details of a process (e.g. how Raiden lives &amp; what it constantly causes), connects vague things **(2)** or jumps from a topic to a topic.

- *Yes, you aren't the only one to grow up on the killing fields. War is a cruel parent, but an effective teacher. Its final lesson is carved deep in my psyche: That this world, and all its people, are diseased. Free will is a myth. Religion is a joke. We are all pawns, controlled by something greater: Memes. The DNA of the soul. They shape our will. They are the culture -- they are everything we pass on. Expose someone to anger long enough, they will learn to hate. They become a carrier. Envy, greed, despair... All memes. All passed along.*

When describing situations (or the world), Monsoon **(1)** makes standalone self-sustained points, tells the most important relevant facts **(2)** or contrasts/connects absolute things, abstract properties (e.g. *«War is a cruel parent, but an effective teacher»*).

***

# Mistral

[Mistral's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM) the longest quotes:

- *I lost my whole family, everything... But butchered those fuckers. My family’s killers. That’s when I realized... I am a killer, too. And a good one at that. I slaughtered dozens in Iraq, in Afghanistan... I’d found my calling.*

- *My enemies fell like domino, one after another. Not once did I feel threatened. I was adrift... without challenge... without purpose... At times, I even envied my prey. At least they had a cause to die for. And then... I met him. () And I know what I’d been missing. His ideals gave my life meaning. Ideals, Jack. What are yours?*

But data analysis was inconclusive. I'm sorry.

I think she describes situations like Armstrong, in one aspect (she combines vague circumstances with the most important specific fact/event).

***

# Full Speech Patterns

Let's give names to all the memes we learned. This way it will be easier for me to describe DNA of the speech patterns.

Patterns about reaction to events:

- Pattern *P1*: absolute thing combined with a specific thing.
- Pattern *P2*: connected/contrasted specific things.
- Pattern *P3*: connected/contrasted vague things.
- Pattern *P4*: a couple of vague things connected to a specific thing.
- Pattern *P5*: jumping from a topic to a topic.

Patterns about describing situations:

- Pattern **A**: vague circumstances connected to a specific thing.
- Pattern **B**: connected/contrasted absolute things.
- Pattern **D**: complex situations.
- Pattern **E**: standalone facts, self-sustained points, the most important facts.

Full speech patterns of characters, closeness resembles similarity (kind of):

- **Raiden:** ................ *P1 + P2, B + E*
- **Blade Wolf:** ......... *P2 + P5, B + E*
- **Monsoon:** ............ *P3 + P5, B + E*
- **Jetstream Sam:** .. *P3 + P4, B + E*
- [Rick Astley:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) ........... *P3 + P4, D + E* (maybe)
- **Sundowner:** ........ *P3 + P4, A + D*
- **Armstrong:** ......... *P2? + ??, A + B?*
- **Mistral:** ................ *?? + ??, A + ??*

Speech patterns of *Blade Wolf* &amp; *Monsoon* or *Raiden* &amp; *Blade Wolf* are almost identical. Though one different component can make a huge difference! For example, I noticed that *Sam* &amp; *Monsoon* are separated by a single component too. *(Though they do have kind of similar smiles))*

**P.S.:** Thank you for reading this analysis! I didn't include **all** of my ideas about speech in this post, but I hope you found at least something valuable here.",technology,1649157040.0

# [Stock futures slip in early morning trading after tech-led rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped in early morning trading Tuesday as traders continue to assess the bond market’s warning signals and the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia war.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 60 points lower, or 0.18%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down more than 0.1% each.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields rose broadly Tuesday, but rates on some shorter-term bonds continued to trade above their longer-dated counterparts. The 5-year yield climbed to 2.6%, while the 30-year rate traded around 2.525%. However, the key part of the yield curve briefly uninverted Tuesday, with the 2-year yield trading marginally below its 10-year counterpart.
*****
&gt; These so-called yield curve inversions have historically preceded recessions, so they are closely watched by investors.
*****
&gt; Investors also kept an eye on Europe, as the war between Ukraine and Russia dragged on. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pledged to pursue allegations of war crimes against Russian forces, noting that more than 300 people were killed and tortured in a suburb near the capital of Kyiv. (Click here for the latest.)
*****
&gt; “Markets have been resilient given the war in Ukraine, continued price pressures, and uncertain global economic outlook, with investors’ ‘buy the dip’ mentality driving equity returns,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research.
*****
&gt; Oil prices, which have shot up since the onset of the war amid concerns over supply disruptions, climbed Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 0.9% at $104.23 per barrel. Brent crude gained 0.7% to $108.30.
*****
&gt; Those moves come after a tech-led rally that saw the Nasdaq Composite rise 1.9% on Monday. Shares of Twitter surged 27% for its best day ever after Elon Musk disclosed a 9.2% passive stake in the social media company. On Tuesday, the stock was up another 1.8%.
*****
&gt; The blue-chip Dow rose about 100 points to begin the trading week, while the S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.8%, both posting their second straight day of gains.
*****
&gt; “In the near-term, we believe indiscriminate selling has created attractive entry points, particularly into some high-growth-potential stocks,” Tony DeSpirito, CIO of U.S. fundamental equities at BlackRock, said in a note.
*****
&gt; The new quarter has kicked off after the major averages finished their worst quarter in two years. Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve meeting minutes Wednesday for further clues on the central bank’s rate-hike path. Meanwhile, the first-quarter corporate earnings season is set to begin next week.

CryptoCurrency,Paying US federal taxes with crypto (good/bad)?,"Seeing that  purchases with cryptocurrency triggers tax reporting requirements, has anyone paid their state or federal (USA) taxes with crypto before?  Pros and cons?  Some exchanges like Coinbase offer a Visa debit card that allows users to earn crypto for all purchases.  I was wondering if paying your taxes using such a card would be beneficial or cause a tax headache the following year since the payment is a taxable event and the crypto earned might be considered a capital gain.

One article states that. ""Coinbase debit card purchases made with stablecoins, such as USDC, may trigger a taxable gain. Although USDC and other stablecoins are closely related in price to the USD, the value is still constantly fluctuating.  The fluctuating price can create a capital gain or loss any time the asset is spent using the Coinbase Card. These capital gains and losses acquired from stablecoins, although likely to be quite minimal on a purchase-by-purchase basis, add up over time. If you are not reporting your Coinbase debit card transactions using stablecoins to the IRS, then you are likely at risk of falsely reporting your capital gains and losses on your Form 8949.""

Obviously the IRS can track who paid their taxes with crypto, so this might open a huge can of worms.  But depending on the size of your tax bill, you could earn a nice chunk of crypto.  I am on the fence on what to do here.  Any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I think my original post was unclear.  I would not be paying with crypto but rather paying with USD on a debit card that earns crypto like Stellar, etc.  Sorry if my title was confusing.",cryptocurrency,1649162674.0
solar,Advice on ground mounted 18.2kW Array,"hi reddit,  


We have pretty high electric bills and are looking to add solar to offset / cover our cost.  We have a nice big filed in the back that gets pretty much no shade and is south facing, which feels ideal for a ground mounted solar array.  


We just got a quote for a 18.2kW Array (4 panels).  The quoted cost is $47,138 before federal tax credit ($34.822 net cost after 26% federal tax credit).   


Some things I am wondering about, would love advice or input from people who have more experience:  


 \- The system would be using a string inverter; I'm wondering if I should go with micro inverters or if it doesn't matter that much since I don't really have much shade.  ( We do get quite a bit of snow in the winter though)  
   
\- Should I worry about what brand of panels / inverters will be used?  What to look out for here? (This is a local company that I do have some trust in and have heard good things about from other businesses in the region that have had them install solar systems.  


 \- Is $2.59 / W a reasonable price for this (I'm seeing between $2 to $3 mentioned on the web)  


 \- What kind of questions should I ask my electric company about a grid tied system?  Does my meter just run backwards while I am producing more than I am using (We do have tiered pricing based on time of day and amount of usage)? 

What else should I be thinking about that I may not be aware of?  Are these systems really pretty low maintenance?

I live with my parents and have a lot of extra income, so I've been paying down my private student loans quickly.

My only concern is my credit. I don't have much credit history and only recently got a credit card to work on building my credit. Is it worth it to continue to pay off my loans quickly? Or should I maintain some balance and pay it off slowly to avoid losing essentially my only source of credit history. My private loan is at 4% interest, and my federal loans are 4.5% and 5.05%

personalfinance,We owe $5k in taxes. Why wasn't more withheld and how do we fix this for next year?,"I'm going to try to keep this short and sweet, while providing enough context.

My husband and I started our taxes this weekend and in the end, TurboTax told us we owed around $5k in federal taxes. This has never happened to us before (full timers for past 8 years, filing jointly past 4 years) so we were shocked. We did some digging and it looks like both our jobs are not withholding enough federal tax. We did the Tax Withholding Estimator through the IRS website and based on how much our jobs are **currently withholding** we would end up **owing $12k** come next tax season. We're really grateful we checked, but we're so confused why our jobs aren't withholding enough.

Here are some details:

* Married, filing jointly
* We both work one job each, with similar pay
* No dependents, no other allowances

**The one thing we caught:** On my W-4, I checked box 2C while my husband didn't (I wasn't worked at the time he completed it and forgot to update it). He has fixed his W-4 now and we're waiting on his next paycheck to see what happens. However, I had this box checked and per the Tax Withholding Estimator, my employer should be taking out **$386 more** per paycheck.

Questions:

* Will having box 2C on both our W-4s help fix the federal withholding?
* Should we just uncheck box 2C and instead fill in 4C with the extra withholding the Tax Withholding Estimator says?
* Last year, we both got new, higher paying jobs, could this have had an effect?

stocks,Fed’s Brainard sees balance sheet reduction soon and ‘at a rapid pace’,"&gt; Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who normally favors loose policy and low rates, said Tuesday that the central bank needs to act quickly and aggressively to drive down inflation.

&gt; In a speech for a Minneapolis Fed discussion, Brainard said that policy tightening will include a speedy reduction in the balance sheet and a steady pace of interest rate increases. Her comments indicated that rate moves could be higher than the traditional 0.25 percentage point moves.

&gt; “Currently, inflation is much too high and is subject to upside risks,” she said in prepared remarks. “The Committee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted.”

&gt; The Fed already has approved one interest rate increase: a 0.25% hike at the March meeting that was the first in more than three years and likely one of many this year.

&gt; In addition, markets expect the Fed to lay out a plan at its May meeting for running down some of the nearly $9 trillion in assets, primarily Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, on its balance sheet. According to Brainard’s Tuesday comments, that process will be swift.

&gt; “The Committee will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting,” she said. “Given that the recovery has been considerably stronger and faster than in the previous cycle, I expect the balance sheet to shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous recovery, with significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017–19.”

&gt; Back then, the Fed allowed $50 billion in proceeds to roll off each month from maturing bonds and reinvested the rest. Market expectations are that the pace could double this time around.

&gt; The moves are in response to inflation running at its fastest pace in 40 years, well above the Fed’s 2% target. Market expectations are for rate increases at each of the remaining six meetings this year, possibly totaling 2.5 percentage points.

investing,Labor shortage (Boomers retiring) and how it will affect future investments? +Supply chain +Inflation,"To me the biggest effect of the pandemic is just how many boomers decided to retire and how it’s affecting labor shortage. 

Almost no one wants to take a low wage job since they can work anywhere and can choose. 
Articles claiming trucking companies have a shortage of truck drivers while other articles point to facts about no labor shortage just truckers have their own company/self employed to get better paid. 
And I’ve seen posts in job boards for small business owners looking to hire where people respond saying the wages they want to pay is the same as fast food restaurants. Which of course they’ve had to raised because no one wanted to work there for such low pay.

All that and more seems to be one main issue that now every workers wants to get paid twice as much as before for almost any job. 

So because so many boomers retired and left a bigger supply of all types of jobs, income will raise a lot. Which companies will pass the increases to consumers. Which will then want to get better paid… and keep going on unevenly for a while.


And then we have all the stimulus and the fed ok with low interest rates and a soft landing (or just slow to react). 
So tons of cash=inflation.


And then the more surprising things (or not so much looking back) of supply chain shocks because now people are going back to work, factories at full capacity, restaurants back again, etc.


I feel this labor shortage for low wage jobs is the real kicker. It’s pushing all sort wages up and adding to inflation.
I think maybe a lot of small business will have to close in masses they can’t pay corporate level price increases.

**Up to 36 months is 1.79%, up to 60 months is 1.99% and 72 months is 2.39%.**

With the way inflation is going, seems like sticking the money somewhere else to earn rather than spending it all on the car immediately would be best as these real interest rates are negative.    

Just judging off the cuff, the choice should be between the 5 year and the 6 year, but does a possible extra year of inflation make up for the higher interest rate the whole way through?

My ex screwed me and kept my portion of rent for months and I only found out a week before that I owed 3500 before my lease was up. I didn’t have that money so I put it on my credit cards. I then accumulated more on my credit card due to unexpected expenses. Before this past year or so I paid off my credit cards and didn’t touch them for over a year. I’m so mad at how much debt I racked up and I do make high payments monthly at least $100-$300 a month sometimes more if I can swing it and I feel as though I can never catch up because the interest rates on both are through the roof and then I end up using the cards again (for little things like gas, food here and there, haven’t used it for big purchases). 
In 2019 I took out a personal loan for 3k for school. Next month I will officially be done paying it. It was $118 a month with an interest rate of 24% yes  high I know but I was 19 and had little to no credit. 
Now I see on credit karma offers for 5-7k personal loans with interest rates of 5-8%. Giving my monthly payment around $100-160 a month. I personally would use at least 3-4K towards my credit card debt, put 1k of my own money towards my debt all in all paying off about 5k of my credit card debt.

I pay all my bills on time and have a credit score of 700 and maintain all my bills as I work two full time jobs. I guess I’m just wondering is it dumb to take out more debt to pay off debt ?

I don’t mind paying a personal loan as I’ve paid my almost paid off personal loan the last 3 years on time and it was such a small amount in my mind I didn’t even miss it.

personalfinance,Accelerate Student loans or Mortgage,"Hey everyone. I tried searching for a situation like mine here but couldn't find exactly what I was looking for.

I plan on paying off the car loan soon and then the Stafford student loans when the pause ends, but once they are paid I am unsure which debt to go after next.

&amp;#x200B;

|Loan Type|Amount|Interest Rate|Minimum Payment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Private Student Loans|about 125K|2.95|730|
|Mortgage|about 190K|3.875|900+100 (PI+PMI)|
|Stafford Student Loans (in pause)|11000|3.51|200|
|Car loan|10500|3.99|333|

For mobile users: Private Student Loans - 125K @ 2.95%, Mortgage - 190K @ 3.875 %

Does it make more sense to pay down the unsecured student loans or Mortgage? With student loans they aren't ever getting discharged. But the money that goes into the mortgage doesn't disappear. I'll have equity that I can tap into for home maintenance and drastic emergencies. Since I just purchased the house there is PMI. Avalanche says Mortgage, but snowball says student loans. I know most of reddit will say I shouldn't worry about paying down debt with such low interest rates. But I hate debt. Call me crazy.

One option I think that makes some sense is to pay down the mortgage to get rid of PMI. Then pay start paying down the student loans. The other path is to just follow avalanche and pay off mortgage and then pay off the student loans. But anyone else that has some opinion feel free to chime in.

In case it matters here's some other possibly pertinent info. I'm contributing 5% to get all of my employers retirement match, 5%, plus paying into the pension (I'm a federal employee under non special FERS). I have a household income of about 135K before taxes. Household of 4 and likely more in the future.

Edit: More info:

* All interest rates are fixed.
* Original value of the home was 200-210K. So about 10-20K of equity.
* Household of 4 and likely more in the future
* I'm 29
* About 40K in retirement account",finance,1649187791.0

personalfinance,How come my taxes look different CPA vs. Turbo Tax?,"After getting audited by the IRS 3 years ago, I have used my family's CPA.

Each time, I prepared my taxes via TurboTax/FreeTaxUSA and compared my forms with what my CPA's. Every year, the amount I owe is different. For this year, using freetaxusa, I got:

Federal: $-6,963 Resident State: $-13,304 CA: $19,872

While my CPA gave me:Federal: $-7068 Resident State: $-606CA: $1658

I haven't gone through my CPA's papers yet, but in the past, I reviewed every single doc and they looked correct. Technically speaking, shouldn't the numbers come out to be the same? Is the FreeTaxUSA software giving me an incorrect number?  


EDIT: finally looked thru my CPA's papers. He didn't count my $300 charitable contributions, but the federal is correct on the most part.   


For state, FreetaxUSA treats as if you should get all of the non-resident state income tax back and pay the full tax amount for the resident state. My CPA actually applied a CA state income tax credit for my resident state income tax (which I think is the more correct way to go about it).

personalfinance,Does it make sense to pay down student loans in a high inflation environment?,"Basically title. I have around $25k left on my student loans, all of which are around a 3-4.5% interest rate. I hate having debt, and have been saving aggressively to try and get them paid off. At my current pace I could finish paying them off by Octoberish. However, with recent inflation outpacing my interest rates, I'm wondering if this even makes sense right now or if I should just wait for forbearance to end and resume making minimum payments.

**Some facts:**

* 32 y/o, married, no kids
* NW of $91k (inflated by $15k value of vehicle on which I carry a $6.5k loan)
* HCOL (northeast US)
* Wanting to move back to the Midwest within \~1 year and buy a home (looking around $350k value)
* $20k in a HYSA; $10k for emergency fund, $10k marked for student loans
* I should be receiving a windfall of around $60k (call it $40k after taxes) in the next \~6 months, which I plan to use to fund a down payment for the above home, either partially or wholly
* Only saving 4% into a 401k to meet ER match, plus trying to max IRAs for my wife and I (see below). No retirement savings other than that. Current value of all accounts is around $80,000.

**Budget:**

* Gross income of $10.8k/month; take-home \~$7,700/month
* Monthly expenses: $4.6k
   * Rent: $2,155 and potentially increasing substantially when lease renews in August (current property has apartments like ours listed at $2,700/month). Going to look into moving somewhere else to keep this at a minimum but it's pretty consistent in our area because, again - HCOL northeast US
   * Groceries: $500
   * Utilities (internet/phone/electric/water): $400
   * Car (loan/gas/insurance): $500
   * Fun money: $400
   * Other (dog/clothes/home and auto maintenance/subscriptions/other: $700

In addition to the above, I've also tried really hard to max IRAs for my wife and I for the last couple of years (and succeeded) so we'll call that $1,000/month. This leaves me with around $2,000/month to save for whatever purpose, which lately, has been student loans. Part of me really wants to just be done with the debt because I hate thinking about it, but another part of me is also tired of feeling behind on retirement. Just kind of curious what the general consensus is on paying down lower interest debt, particularly student loans, when inflation is so high and there's always the looming thought of ""maybe Biden will get around to cancelling some student loan debt like he said he would years ago"". Not really banking on the last bit, but, who knows. I would probably get excluded from any wide-reaching cancellation anyway just based on income.

If I wasn't saving for student loans, I think I'd probably prioritize getting a 6-month ER, then house down payment (factoring in the above windfall), then really ramping up retirement contributions.

When my father retires we must either return the vehicle with no penalty or purchase the vehicle.

It’s a great deal and my plan is to buy the vehicle so I can sell privately and then take the profit of that sale towards the purchase of a larger SUV. My questions are…

- Where should I get a vehicle loan to get the best interest rates?

-I’m only going to need the loan till I purchase the new vehicle since I will have a new loan again. I want to pay as little of interest as possible between both loans. Is there a better way?

Looking at their lease, it clearly states the option to buy the solar system at FMV if the house were to sell.

This is the option I am wanting to do and have been trying to get a quote from Sunrun to buy the system.

The quote they keep giving me is ~80K to pay off the rest of the lease (obviously a dumb idea), that makes sense.

Then they are quoting me 81K to buy the system outright...

This is clearly incorrect information right? Even through Sunruns own website, a new solar system of this size should by &lt;30k.

the In-Service Date, the FMV will include the recapture of any federal tax credits.",energy,1649208220.0
stocks,4/5/22 SPY Daily TA,"Writing this from my new computer which I am very excited that it is finally fully setup and running like a champ! Cant wait to test it intraday tomorrow as my macbook air was struggling for sure with everything I had running at one time. 

Intraday today despite a morning start that looked initially to be bullish the bears were able to get control of the day. Of course, this was at the assistance of fed member Brainard who dropped the bomb about balance sheet reductions and the expedited timeline for the fed. This set the market in to quite the tizzy seeing a massive 0.5% sell off within 30 minutes of news dropping. Initially it looked like we may recover after a clear market over-reaction… thinking back to the Saudi oil field attack we had last week. However, after a small pop from the low of 453.8 to 455.5, the bears took back control and took SPY for an impressively bearish close below some key supports for a -1.25% close. 

The one thing I will be considering going into tomorrow if the markets took the opportunity to price in the FOMC minutes tomorrow and that the markets are assuming that JPOW had said and will be more hawkish than anticipated. However, it would not be surprising to see the markets react bullishly tomorrow morning before seeing a massive sell off once minutes drop. Historically thinking back that is how the last few FOMC meetings have gone. 

SPY today closed below a key “ level” of support of 452 today. The next support level is down near 448. It was quite the fight at 452.5 all day but I believe now that we broke below this support we may start seeing some more downside. 

&amp;#x200B;

The daily chart for spy is quite bearish now. Looking back to March 29th we formed what I am calling the upper resistance at 462 and now we just may retest support down near 410 over the next month. Also today was the first candle closed BELOW the daily 8ema since March 15th. The bears tried very hard last week to close below but the bulls wouldn’t let it happen. In general a close below the daily 8ema is a bearish omen in the markets. We also broke the grey upward channel today officially. 

&amp;#x200B;

The weekly chart is currently set up with another doji but any downward momentum from her will make it a true bear candle. The weekly 20ema and 8ema is still down near 445-446 which could be the target for the bears this week (that is also major supports on the daily chart).

&amp;#x200B;

Apple despite a bearish day tested the support of its channel and it is too close to tell yet on the daily chart if its broke it officially. It did manage to close above its daily 8ema at 174.83 which is a more bullish close for Apple after a -1.89% day. 

But as you can see on both SPY and Apples daily chart their daily MACDs are ready to curl to sell signal and the RSI is looking bearish both near 58 and trailing downward now. 

&amp;#x200B;

The VIX had yet another wild day. Opening at 18.55 before climbing all the way to 21.57 before market close. That is another massive day, at 16% run up from low to high is wild for VIX! Again the VIX though was the guide of the market. Despite the expect over-reaction and mid day bullish reversal once the vix continued its slow climb up we knew that was not going to happen. 

Historically 16.5 to 21.5 over the last year or so has been the average VIX Range so we are not at the upper level of that. A VIX back over 22 would be quite bearish also and could allow for some increased volatility that we surely have been lacking. 

I will be gone in the morning with some personal stuff so I am going to include all premarket levels to watch here as I will not have time to post in the morning. I will be back on the server for live chat hopefully by 12 at the latest. 

Support- 

450.9 -&gt; 450.45 à 449.7 à 449.1 à 448.4 à 447.21 (break support of next “level”) 

\-0.5%= 448.7

\-1%= 446.5

\-1.5%= 444.3

\-2%= 442

I would watch for a break of 450 cleanly followed by the break to 447.2. If we can break and hold there a close near the daily 20,50 and 100 ema all near 444-446 is 100% possible. 

Resistance- 

451.5 à 452.2 (break back above next “level” up) à 452.7(major support intraday today) à 453.4 à 454

0.5%= 453.3

1%= 455.5

1.5%= 457.8

2%= 460

Bulls will need a clean gap above 452 resistance that holds, good FOMC news and they could very well see 455 to 457 end of day with a run up near 460-465 to end the week.",finance,1649208330.0

My problem is that I never bat an eye at small purchases (say under $100), I almost never make big purchases for ""things"" except for Rent.*

What are some tricks or exercises to train your brain into saving more money, and to shift your perspective toward it. I wanna become obsessed with saving,  I have only about $17,000 total debt  mostly due to Federal Student Loans and Medical, and 3 collections accounts that I am taking care of. My credit is okay for my purposes now, but I do want to work on that immediately. I also have 2 credit cards with utilization too high, only 1k limits on each, one with much better terms.

I've been told to eliminate the credit card debt ASAP but I'll need enough capital to pay those off without sacrificing another one of my obligations. I'm not drowning, I'm on top of all of it, I ust need more guidance so I can get some more breathing room.

1. Should they provide a Cali-based W-2 since I did remote work from California? (specific to Non-residents)

investing,CoinBase Is Stupid. Crypto currencies are stupid.,"**I have no vendetta against anybody from CoinBase, nor do I hold any position in any company. I have been hearing about this crypto crap since 2016/17 when I was starting at grad school, but really didn't care much at that point. More recently, when I felt I had been a victim of some crypto fraud (i.e. my identity had been compromised), I decided to take this personally.**  I could really attack any company that has crypto roots, but since CoinBase is the ""[Amazon](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/company/amazon)"" or ""Uber"" of its industry (that is to say the most recognizable name in the space), I am focusing my efforts on it. Again, I don't care if Jim Simmons has invested in the company or Warren Buffet did (though he hasn't), if it doesn't make any economic sense, it is not worth investing in.    


1. Retail Users: Retail users are driving bulk of the activity here. 32% of the [trading](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/finance-dictionary/trading-overview) volume is coming from them and it makes up 94% of the transaction revenue. Retail and institutional guys are lumped under ""verified users"", but their criteria for verified users is ridiculous (it is essentially anybody who has provided an email address or a phone number or some other information). It's really not that time-consuming to open an email account, and as they themselves state, they don't know how many ""unique"" verified users or MTU are on their platform. So for all you know, maybe 100 or 200 folks are driving bulk of the activity here, and they are clearly doing no due diligence checks to verify the identity/finances of the users. I don't know how are Robinhood's onboarding measures different, but Robinhood clearly asks for Social Security number (at least that's what I remember it asking for in 2016), and it seems the barriers to trading here are very low on CoinBase. Why this matters? Because it potentially opens them up to a bunch of lawsuits, which are already in the action and 2) they may potentially be overstating their key business metrics (not potentially, definitely)   


2. Litigation: Company has 3/4 legal proceedings either going against it or has been threatened with. Truly an innovative and cutting-edge company to be dealing with litigation issues at the start of its public life. I can only imagine what other marvelous moments are ahead of it    


3. Security: Clearly the company has not been paying much attention to the security hacks that happen on this platform otherwise they would have created a provision for them or had some sort of reserve to deal with these situations. For their crypto asset wallets, they state the risk of loss is remote. How do you reconcile this with the litigation proceedings that the company has going on? There is a disconnect here   


4. Salaries: Maybe I am looking at the wrong place here, but I can't find the cash compensation of the management team, so I am assuming that the salaries they mention their are cash compensations. Brian Armstrong is getting paid $1 million in base, the salary of Zoom CEO (arguably a shitty company too but at least has a relevant use) is $300K. But what surprises me the most is that they don't have a chief security officer or anyone listed there on the management, and 2) the salary for chief legal officer (one of the more important guys in this business) is \~200K. I am not really factoring in stock options here or any of that stuff because I really think CoinBase is worthless and will be going down. I don't think Brian understands the risks inherent in this business or he would be paying his chief legal officer more here     


5. Technology &amp; Development: This is where I am assuming that security expenses are being included, but it's not abundantly clear to me. They say: ""technology and development expenses include personnel-related expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, and enhancing our platform. These costs also include website hosting, infrastructure expenses, costs incurred in developing new products and services and the amortization of acquired developed technology"". I don't think the company regards security of the platform vital enough otherwise they would be drawing more investor attention to it.  


6. Valuation: Their valuation of their crypto assets is amusingly funny. I am not an accountant, but I find it ridiculous that they value the assets on their book based off the closing on the last day of the respective period. So where are you capturing the volatility in the crypto markets? Dumb. And. Wrong.    


7. Disclosure: As I said before, their disclosure sucks. 31% of the assets on their platform are ""other crypto assets"" and make up 50% of their revenues. But no breakdown on these other assets. I don't know the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum and Lithium and Sodium and Potassium (all the fucking elements of the Chemistry table), but some of you schmucks might know. However, for a company that is making 50% of its revenue from two assets (Bitcoin and Ethereum), it should talk about each in more detail and what separates them. Nothing. This revenue / asset concentration is nothing to write about.     


8. Acquisition: OK I am not dissecting all the acquisitions they've made nor have I researched them. But in January 2022, they made an acquisition of 257 million of which 151 or something was in cash. Why pay in cash if you think think your stock is worth more? Dunno, doesn't make much sense to me.   

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The fact that this asset class (Bitcoin/Ethereum) is at this price or that doesn't matter. 

Before you plow your money into this crap, ask yourself or whoever is asking you to invest in this crap, the following questions:  

**Valuation:**

* How do you ascribe value to these crypto currencies (please help me understand the valuation employed and the assumptions that go into it)?
* What is the difference between Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin? Why is one valued higher than the other? What is each bitcoin's competitive moat?
* What investment time horizon do you recommend, and why?

**Legal:**

* How do you ensure that these currencies or the exchanges they're traded on are not immune to either security hacks or other kinds (by now, cases of multi-billion / million dollar hacks seem to be a common phenomenon), how does one ensure that this does not happen?
* How do you suggest you do due diligence on the parties involved in these transactions, as they seem to be keen on remaining hidden from the public eye?

**Commercial:**

* How further long before all major central banks / governments around the world endorse Crypto as a part of their overall monetary policy framework? In a situation where it is not commonly accepted by all, what risks do you see playing out?
* What reserve currency will these crypto assets be pegged to and why? If USD, why, as bulk of the activity seems to be concentrated in Asia here?
* How do you differentiate between what is ""fake"" crypto currency and what is ""real"" crypto currency unlike the litmus test that exists for commodities (gold etc.)?  

**Accounting / Taxation / Insurance:**

* How does one ensure transparent and correct financial reporting of these crypto assets (in terms of accounting)? How should one be reporting the value of these crypto assets on one's tax returns?
* What's right mark-to-market approach for these assets?

**Others:**

* How do you convince someone , who's not a sophisticated and / or an accredited investor, that investing in crypto assets is a better use of capital as opposed to investing in even more hard, tangible assets (real estate) or non-riskier (as well as non-volatile, and more transparent investment options: government bonds, [ETF](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/finance-dictionary/what-is-an-exchange-traded-fund-ETF) / index funds)    
* Why is there a need for crypto / bitcoins when the existing forms of payment (hard cash, soft cash) seem to be acceptable by most? I am really hoping that the answer to this question is not that a bunch of millennials / generation Z want to ""own"" something different, and so everyone jumped on the bandwagon to make that happen. 

I doubt you're going to get any seemingly intelligent answer to any of these, which does not make this worth your time/effort/investment. I don't know when will this dooms day arrive, but the price of this thing will soon be down going the gutter.

personalfinance,Issues filing taxes on Unemployment Benefits,"Hi all,

I'm having some issues with filing taxes this year with last year's unemployment benefits.

I lost my job in 2020 and filed for unemployment benefits for 8 months only during 2020, but I did not receive the money until late 2021.

I received 1099-G form stating I was compensated over 10k and now owe over 2k worth of federal income tax.

I recall American Rescue Plan Act exempting 10k but only for 2020, so I called my local Department of Labor in attempt to have corrected form for 2020 since I did only request it for 2020 but they took a whole year to compensate me, but they weren't having it.

I have about $11,000 in my bank account and I have a vet bill that is going take about $700 away. With students loan pause being pushed to August 31st I would have about $13,000 by the time the date comes or close to it. This is with my usual budget in account and no other surprise bills hopefully. Should I just go on a pay the full amount when I have before the cut off date or is it a bad idea since I leaving less than $2,000 in my account?

I've already don't have any hope forgiveness will done and I'm not changing to a income driven plan that would make my debt worse to get the public service option. I just want to get ahead and don't want pay more interest if the extension does ever end if I don't pay it all back before the 31st.

 I'm just really unsure, I have my dog I take care of and my parents who are on disability and fixing/getting gas on my car and my dad's. I'm just really stress out and don't want to put myself or my family is a worse situation, but at the same time I don't want to deal with the loans anymore.

\~Army of Spies",cryptocurrency,1649226864.0
investing,What will happen to the 30-year loan after the next rate hike?,"So we've seen the 30-year fixed rate loan skyrocket 1.5% now since the rate hike. How will the next 0.25% rate hike effect the 30-year fixed rate loan?

Will it increase by another 1.5% over the course of 3 to 4 months or will it increase at a slower rate or not at all? I know this is tied to the 10-year treasury note.

CryptoMarkets,Crypto.com lowered staking rates for the second time and received even more backlash.,"That’s a lot of money that's been locked up there too. USDC and other stablecoins were trading at a rate of 12%. They were going to reduce it to 10%, but with their second rate cut, it's now down to 8%. 

They really stated changes a month in advance, with implementation set to begin soon, only to execute some completely different modifications with no warning.

In my case, the 'flexible' interest rate has been lowered by 75%, bringing it down to 2%. I think that’s a good call to action to move elsewhere. There are a lot of other platforms with better rates, even if you don't have any platform tokens. If anyone is interested in transferring alternative platforms, I currently have the majority of my crypto on [Hodlnaut](https://www.hodlnaut.com/) and [Haru Invest](https://haruinvest.com/).",cryptocurrency,1649235704.0
CryptoCurrency,"Sobriety check, manage your expectations","Many people are expecting, hoping and rooting for far fetched values ""by the end of the year"", and I want to offer some factors to consider. 

The most important one:
Inflation.

We all know that the main driver of increased price is an increase in demand, and with the inflation rates right now, crypto serves as a nice way to hedge that inflation. For the past 2 years you have been seeing a price increase that in no small part has been influenced by this, with the exception of a notable sucker rally last year. Which also brought with it enormous attention, awareness and exposure to crypto.
Fiats have become worth less, and people/institutions are trying to protect their money from further devaluation with crypto. 

Another driver here are the financial institutions themselves, whose loans have become worth less thanks to inflation and they have more liquidity they'll want to keep protected from inflation.

Inflation starts becoming a problem when it surpass 5%, and the only realistic way to combat inflation is through increased interest rates, thus making credit more expensive. In the US, the inflation train is gathering speed, and needs to be adressed soon.
US is desperate for those rate increases, like it or not. People are seeing their purchasing power decrease steadily, and it definitely does not help that there's a shortage on nearly everything these days, the war in Ukraine only adding to that.

We all saw what happened to the crypto space when the Federal Reserve announced they would increase the interest rates: liquidity disappeared and crypto had a a significant dip.

As long as the central bank in USA holds back on increasing the interest rates, there will still be a lot of liquidity and even more inflation people would want to hedge against. This would continue the trend of crypto value increasing, showing you green lines and higher numbers while you don't really gain any purchasing power. Your food cost 10% more than last year as well.

Higher interest rates would also mean the economy would slow down, and considering how afraid the politicians are of political backlash from slowing down the economy, we most likely won't see huge jumps anytime soon.

When they inevitably eventually do increase the interest rates by the amounts necessary, a lot of liquidity will disappear along the way as credit becomes more expensive and inflation decreases. 

Don't be naive about this: crypto will be hit harder than any other market.

Finally, I'll leave you with this question: if crypto is to double or triple its market cap in the next year(s), where will all that money come from?",cryptocurrency,1649238847.0

CryptoCurrency,Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are SpyCoins.,"The creation and use of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are not lofty ideas or conspiratorial, it is an actively and openly studied academic discipline and multi-central bank initiative. 90% of the world's central banks now working on digital currencies. They are coming - and they will not be a good thing. They aim to replace paper notes, cash, and coins, with ‘digital cash’ that can be held and directly issued by the state - not requiring an intermediary.      

They are VERY different than the existing system of ones PayPal balance or bank account amount that are ‘digital’, as those are just forms of M1 money, where a commercial bank is performing money creation *(through double-entry accounting via approving loans to simultaneously generate an asset (debt they own) and a liability (deposit balances they owe to bank customers))*. CBDCs aim to cut that middle-manning out, and while it might save some hassle and tax money, the Cons outweigh the Pros. 

CBDC’s will be sold as a *“more convenient way”* to hold fiat and as a replacement for coins and cash as it will *“eventually remove the risks associated with cash”*.       

But if it’s all digital and on THEIR ledger, would you ever really be taking money out of the banking system? Or would you just be TRAPPED inside their ledger no matter what form of money you held? [Besides of course – crypto]

One of the most important qualities of Cash and Crypto is that they are *bearer assets* that can be anonymously transferred between entities. CBDC will not allow for this and will not have privacy preserving characteristics – quite the opposite - they will enable more surveillance and further erode financial privacy.         

China’s eCNY efforts have yet to prove they will be any cheaper, more efficient, more private, or any more convenient than the existing domestic and international payment systems.       

There is even an increased lending cost at risk from a decrease in bank lending, as well as an increase in more expensive market-based financing. CBDC systems could suffer from outages and cyber-attacks - they have obvious potential to be used as tools of surveillance and control by governments as every transaction is recordable – they could put expiry dates on your CBDCs - limit how much you can hold – vary your interest rates and prices depending on who you are – prevent you from purchasing certain things - automatically deduct fines... the list goes on!      

TLDR; **CBDC pose financial, economic, and human rights risks** to all consumers that are potentially severe if designed badly or with bad intent.",cryptocurrency,1649245951.0

investing,Balance Sheet To Be Focus Of Fed Minutes Amid Recession Warnings,"Shedding light on US central bankers’ hawkish stance, minutes from the Federal Reserve March meeting are expected to reveal a committee leaning towards more aggressive monetary tightening.

Likely to mirror post-meeting rhetoric, the Fed minutes are set to reinforce an urgency to frontload policy and included more details on the balance sheet run-off, according to analysts. 

In March, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by just a quarter point as war raged in Ukraine and domestic inflation hit a four-decade high. Since then, price pressures have only increased, and labour market data has shown solid employment growth and an acceleration in wage growth.

With the Fed pulling no hawkish punches in its policy guidance, investors will scrutinise the minutes for any insights on plans to normalise the balance sheet.

# [Stock futures fall for a second day as rates jump with the Fed set to tighten policy aggressively](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/05/stock-futures-inch-higher-ahead-of-fed-minutes-release.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped for a second day on Wednesday and rates soared to new heights as investors bet the Federal Reserve is about to aggressively tighten policy to fight inflation, and in turn slow the economy.
*****
&gt; Minutes from the Fed’s most-recent meeting are slated for release Wednesday afternoon. The minutes come from last month’s meeting when the central bank raised rates and indicated six more hikes were coming this year. Investors are bracing for new details about the Fed’s plan to reduce its balance sheet after comments from Fed officials knocked down stocks on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 220 points, or 0.65% on Wednesday. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.9%, and Nasdaq-100 index futures shed 1.5%. All three major averages were headed for their second day of declines.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 2.65% on Wednesday, hitting a three-year high and continuing its rapid climb this week. The rate ended Monday at 2.40%.
*****
&gt; Fed Governor Lael Brainard in a speech on Tuesday indicated support for higher interest rates and said a “rapid” reduction of the central bank’s balance sheet could begin as soon as May. Following her remarks, the Dow pulled back by about 280 points and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.3%.
*****
&gt; “It is of paramount importance to get inflation down,” Brainard said during a Minneapolis Fed webinar. Brainard has been nominated to be vice chair of the Federal Open Market Committee.
*****
&gt; San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also shared concerns about inflation. “I understand that inflation is as harmful as not having a job,” Daly said.
*****
&gt; Tech shares led Tuesday’s losses and were set to fall again on Wednesday as investors rotated out of the group and braced for higher rates to slow the economy. Chipmakers suffered some of the biggest declines, with Nvidia and Marvell Technology falling more than 5% and 6%, respectively. Both companies were set to continue their descent on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Tesla, Microsoft, and Amazon shares were also slated to fall more than 2% on Wednesday and Twitter shed 3% premarket after rallying this week amid news that Elon Musk purchased a large stake in the company. As the Federal Reserve hikes rates investors have begun rotating into stocks with stable profits, shying away from those offering future growth.
*****
&gt; Investors continued to monitor the latest developments out of Europe, as the Ukraine-Russia war continues. The European Union and the U.S. are preparing to slap new sanctions on Russia after evidence emerged of war crimes allegedly committed by Russian forces. The new sanctions include a ban on Russian coal imports. (Click here for the latest.)
*****
&gt; Crude prices, which have been volatile since the war began, rose again on Wednesday after dipping Tuesday. U.S. oil prices were up by 1.1% at $103.09 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent gained about 1%% to trade at $107.66 per barrel.

——

But oh ya, inflation is only happening because the ships and ports and all that jazz. Definitely not also because of the largest instance of debt monetization in the history of mankind.

This behavior jeopardizes the USD’s status as the reserve currency of the world.


Edit: Not saying that expanding the money supply is the only factor driving inflation. Supply chain issues, as we’ve been experiencing, increases inflation. Supply chain issues + expanding the money supply makes inflation even worse; it exacerbates inflation. I’m also not saying it was a bad thing for the Fed to respond as quickly and vigorously as they did. I do, however, think it was a mistake to add 2 trillion more to their balance sheet from August 2020 until now, amid increasing demand pressures and supply shortages. They kept adding to their balance sheet, expanding the money supply, even as the US made it through the eye of its economic storm.

I also chose 401ks as a reference point to compare against. 9 trillion is hard to conceive of. Thought that a unit of comparison would help. Other comparisons. US GDP = approx. 25 trillion. California GDP = approx. 3.5 trillion. Texas GDP = approx. 2 trillion. NY GDP = approx. 2 trillion. Florida GDP = approx. 1.2 trillion. GDP of UK = 3 trillion. GDP of Germany = 4 trillion.

I'm fine with getting $0 back from my federal return. Or should I be putting it all towards the Trad 401k?

Also, my wife and I each have Trad IRAs that I setup a few years ago. So, I have that deduction as well. Unknowingly in other years I probably only got a partial deduction.

But the effects of the Fed’s tightening of monetary policy on financial conditions — and the the effect that tightening will have on economic activity — is one of the biggest unknowns, Dudley wrote.

Unlike many other economies, the U.S. doesn’t respond directly to changes in short-term interest rates, Dudley said, partly because most U.S. home buyers have long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. But many U.S. households, also in contrast to other countries, have a significant amount of their wealth in equities, which makes them sensitive to financial conditions.

Dudley’s call for the Fed to inflict losses on investors stands in contrast to the longstanding notion of a figurative Fed put, the idea that the central bank would halt monetary tightening or otherwise ride to the rescue in the event of heavy losses in financial markets. Dudley, who ran the New York Fed from 2009 to 2018, was previously chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs and is now a senior research scholar at Princeton University’s Center for Economic Policy Studies.

stocks,The U.S. Fed Will Force Stocks Down,"&gt;In contrast to many other countries, the U.S. economy  doesn’t respond directly to the level of short-term interest rates. Most  home borrowers aren’t affected, because they have long-term, fixed-rate  mortgages. And, again in contrast to many other countries, many U.S.  households do hold a significant amount of their wealth in equities. As a  result, they’re sensitive to financial conditions: Equity prices  influence how wealthy they feel, and how willing they are to spend  rather than save.

I’m in a bit of a unique situation, hoping for some advice.

I recently completed training and have certified as an Air Traffic Controller. Training room about 4 1/2 years to complete. I now being home roughly 160k per year. 

During (most of) training, you’re paid pretty low, considering the FAA can move you anywhere in the US on your dime and drag their feet to train you. This lead to about 3 1/2 years of racking up credit card debt (17k). This has lead to my credit score falling to the mid 600s, leaving me without a lot of “balance transfer card” options.

With my credit card debt varying in interest (22 - 26%), does it make sense to take a Debt Consolidation loan from my local credit union at 10%? My wife and I have budgeted and expect to pay the credit cards off over the next 18 months, and now make well above what we need so using credit cards to float won’t be a thing anymore. It feels like taking advantage of a lower interest rate to pay these cards off in the same 18 months would be beneficial. Any feedback?",finance,1649264001.0

personalfinance,Should I Sell Our Extra Vehicle to Help Pay Down Our Newer Vehicle?,"Hello everyone, I was hoping to get some opinions on selling an extra vehicle that we own. We have a 2010 truck and a 2007 SUV. We also have recently purchased a 2021 SUV that we use to travel the country. It was the biggest purchase of our lives thus far, therefore the interest rate is steep on the 2021 SUV (7.8%). I am planning on paying off a chunk of it after our filing income taxes. This is to be able to refinance it at a much lower interest rate (2.5%) through my credit union (they have a cap what they will offer loans for). I will be able to get it to what the credit union requires for a loan through them without selling any of my current vehicles. 
We spend the majority of the year traveling the country for work and we are only home (our parents house) for approx. 2 months out of the year. When we are home we use our other vehicles to go around town and do activities in which we need to tow trailers (i.e. boats/atv’s). The 2007 SUV is reliable enough and can handle any of our towing needs. It has very high mileage and would not sell for a lot. The 2010 truck on the other hand has a lot less miles and is in better condition. It would sell, I would estimate, anywhere from $12,000-$15,000 in the current market in my local area. There is no issue with storage of these vehicles, they stay covered in an enclosed shed at my parents house and they expressed that they are okay with it multiple times. 
My question is: should I sell the 2010 truck to lower my payment on the newer vehicle prior to refinancing or not? I always have the fear in the back of my mind that if something crazy were to happen, then we have two vehicles at home for backup. The 2010 truck would be considerably more reliable traveling long distances than the 2007 Yukon given that we do travel for work should we need to utilize it for a backup. 
Some financial background on my wife and I: we are 27, we do have emergency expenses in savings for approx 5 months, both have managed IRA and personal brokerage accounts, no outstanding credit card debt amongst 3 credit cards, excellent credit scores, do not have a mortgage, but do have a combined $60,000 in federal student loans and $10,000 in private student loans. We manage our monthly living expenses as what I would consider quite well.

CryptoCurrency,1 Year Alt-Coin DCA+ Experiment - Week 24 Mid-Week Update,"It's time for a mid-week update and unfortunately (as all of you are no doubt aware) the crypto market is not looking good today. Curse you, JPOW.

For those who aren't familiar with my experiment, I'm DCAing into a mix    of 16 alt-coins and using BTC, ETH and BUSD (with interest on BlockFi)    as controls in a 1 year long project. I took feedback from the   community  to help set the roster of 16 coins, but also did a bit of my   own  research and picked projects which I believed in after doing some   DD. I  have posted at least a summary of my DD on each coin in previous   posts  and I will be donating some of the proceeds to a charity to be   chosen by  the person who suggested the best performing coin at the end   of the  experiment. For the starting point you can look here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one\_year\_altcoin\_dca\_experiment/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the most recent update prior to today can be found here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tu8fp8/1\_year\_altcoin\_dca\_experiment\_week\_24\_update/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tu8fp8/1_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_24_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Before I get into the numbers, I wanted to say a couple of things. I don't think any of you will be shocked to see that the portfolio is down since the last update. This has been a pretty bad day in the midst of what had otherwise been a fairly uneventful week. I thought more of this action was already priced in, but it seems both the stock and crypto markets are not liking the rumblings they're hearing out of the FED. So, without further ado, here is the current status of the project:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/301ubuomnyr81.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e042d2b8c52fbc38ff5023c8663eb5398d97e88

As of last week's update the project was up over 2% and had shown over 12% growth week over week. Just a few days later and we've already given up all of that ground. We're back to being 7% down with almost a 10% decline since the weekend. This is unfortunate, but if you look at the NASDAQ index over the same period, it's off about 4% (almost 2% of that today alone) which is pretty significant for an index. I think the issues plaguing the portfolio this past week have more to do with macroeconomic news regarding inflation as well as the US and international response to counter it than they do with any real concerns about crypto overall. Even as I type this, as the official meeting notes are coming out, it does seem that both the stock market and the crypto market are responding positively though.

Digging into the specifics of what's gone on, it's really interesting to see just how strong LUNA has been over the last several weeks. Here in a week when everything else has gone down, LUNA is up 2% over the last 5 days. I don't know how long we can expect it to keep outperforming the rest of the crypto market week over week, but it's really been on a tear lately.

When I look at the rest of the portfolio I notice an odd pattern. There's almost a bimodal distribution in terms of what the projects have done over the last 5 days. The big guys like BTC and ETH are sitting in a group that moved down between 4 to 8% over the last 5 days. Then there's another group of coins that sit in the range of 12-19% down (only the aforementioned LUNA and LINK which sits right between the two groups are not in one group or the other). I'm not sure if this means anything significant. It may just be a statistical fluke, but it definitely jumped out at me how so many were sitting within one of the two ranges.

The worst performer over the past 5 days has been AAVE which had been on a pretty big run, so I guess this is a bit of a correction from the recent surge. Once again FTM was near the bottom of the list for weekly performers and now sits firmly in last place in the portfolio where it's down close to 32% with no other coin in the portfolio sitting at more than 23% down.

I did receive staking rewards for ATOM on Binance.us so that is captured in my rewards and upcoming purchases table below.

As for the overall progress, the updated chart is here.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6lwiuxotkyr81.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=604f1d3598ca087b556096392e33d38e38fe9f14

You can see that relative to the price of BTC over the course of the experiment, we're still doing extremely well despite being down. FTM is the only individual project in the portfolio that is doing worse than a simple index of BTC is since we started. The chart also really highlights how amazing LUNA has been over the last 5 days. With all those large negative slopes and there LUNA sits at the top clearly bucking the trend.

Finally, as always you can see real-time status of the experiment by following this link to CoinGecko:  [https://www.coingecko.com/en/portfolios/public/pokoire-1-year-dca-experiment](https://www.coingecko.com/en/portfolios/public/pokoire-1-year-dca-experiment) where you can see  updates of the doughnut chart below.

personalfinance,Does selling my car make sense right now?,"I've been reading recent posts on this sub about riding out any car loans with low interest rates due to inflation. While I don't fully understand, it's something that has come up for me lately as I've been reworking my family's budget and working eliminate all of our debts (outside of mortgage.)   


Currently own: relatively new 2020 midsize SUV, uses premium gas which has been painful recently.  
Interest rate: 0.9%   
Monthly payment: $600 ($29,000 remaining on the loan)  


I submitted all info to Carvana, who offered me $40,000 for the car. We both work from home so it's not used daily for commuting, so mileage is quite low and it's in very good condition. My idea was that I could take the about $11k after the loan is paid off, and use that as a down payment on a used car that is in the $22k - $23k range, which would bring my total auto loan down to the $12k - $14k range. I could still keep putting $600/month towards it, and be out of car debt much sooner (around 18 months). 

The $600/month fits in our budget, but it would be nice to be done with car payments a couple of years sooner where that $600 can instead be used for savings/house improvements/whatever. BUT since I have such a low interest rate on it, does it make sense to just ride this out. We do love our car and I'd be happy to be driving it for many years to come.",finance,1649272789.0
CryptoCurrency,Why crypto matters (from a third-world point of view),"Warning, long post ahead!  
A few days ago I came across a series of tweets from hardcore anti-crypto people that left me thinking for days, because it was a bit infuriating how people are blinded by the bubble they live in and really gave me perspective on how someone's understanding of crypto is heavily influenced by the economic reality that surrounds them. I'm talking about the first and third tweet *(no names because that's not important here):*

[Narrator: It is not, in fact, trivially easy.](https://preview.redd.it/g4qvrfrigyr81.png?width=606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4429e5d39f89f175cb2ef1b82a280b21dad74150)

It's true that crypto has many use cases, and not every person will benefit from every use case that exists, but just because the uses cases don't cater to your specifics needs doesn't mean that crypto is pointless, empty idealism, a scam or a waste, because there are millions of people worldwide that directly benefit from it, even if you can't see them or don't know about them, as they live in an entirely different situation than you.

The thing is, many people from first world countries fail to see how hard it is for people in other countries to access the international economy, because they are used to live in a system where things ""normally work"", but for us the amount of bureaucracy, expenses and paperwork needed to make it work is unfathomable or it just simply impossible. And there is the core of what crypto really is or why it was born, as a worldwide network capable of transfering value in just seconds or minutes, without the hassle of the traditional bureocratic banking system. I can open a wallet and start receiving transactions within minutes. There is no middleman that would deny me access, limit or control the things I do with my money, and we've seen very good examples of this recently. 

Take me for example, I'm a Software Engineer from a third world country, where our banking system and government simply doesn't work. I've been lucky enough to get a remote job, but they can only pay me in X currency, different than my own. The banks in my country simply cannot receive money from other currencies, I can't open a local or foreign bank account on X currency from my country and the company cannot open a local bank account from abroad. Also credit cards, loans, traditional investment options or even a reliable way to save money are non-existing here. Why? you may ask. Well, someone decided that was the best way to ""protect our national currency and our sovereignty"".

In a world without crypto I would be fucked, because I just don't have access to the global financial system. But, thanks to it, I can get paid, and even more, I can have a savings account with interest rates that are just way out of league with anything in my country. With adoption growing day by day, I can pay for goods and services without even having to exchange into my local currency that has suffered hyperinflation and keeps loosing value every day.

And that's why I believe crypto is here to stay and keep growing, maybe the coins we have today will not be the same we'll have tomorrow, but the technology is already solving people's problems and giving them access to tools that were unreachable before, even if you can't see it directly. Just look at the adoption rates in most developing countries, where cryptocurrency has found a strong foothold the last few years.

Thanks if you made it this far, just wanted to rant a bit about those tweets and get some thoughts out of my head.

**TL;DR**: In the end it doesn't matter if you are in for the money, the technology, out of necessity or whatever, cryptocurrencies have real world use cases and every day it's making life easier and benefiting a lot of people.",cryptocurrency,1649274250.0

&gt;	Typical of this following was Charles Hoskinson, an anti-war Republican college student with an interest in monetary policy. Hoskinson organized “money bombs” — single-day bonanzas of online contributions from small-dollar donors — for Paul’s campaign. Later, he pitched himself into a scheme that allowed Paul supporters to “sponsor” a blimp that cruised over parts of the East Coast, promoting the campaign.

&gt;	Hoksinson, a computer programmer, took a more direct approach to advancing cryptocurrencies. After the money bombs and the Ron Paul blimp failed to bring about political revolution, Hoskinson grew disillusioned with Paul’s movement and the prospects of anti-government activism more generally.

With the incredible injustice that all residents of the USA have suffered from the start because of federal policy makers!  I'm  of course referring to the law that makes it so that residents of the United States can not participate in the Finance sector at all unless they are a ""qualified/educated investor"".  What makes you a qualified/educated investor in the United States? Having access to $1,000,000 or more in cash!  Every trust fund baby in the United States is deemed an ""educated investor"" weather they even have a GED, can read and write or have the ability to do simple math problems!  In other words it is a law that states only the rich can get richer in the United States!  If your not a qualified/educated investor then what? Then you have to pay a qualified/educated investor money for every trade you want to make on the stock market.  Here's the biggest kicker of them all, not only does doing so not provide you with any benefit, reduction in risk, etc. but you are literally paying them to simply make the trade you want to make, you don't even talk to this supposed educated investor, hell this educated investor don't even know, nor care about your trade, you just tell their automated software to make the trade now in days and it happens!  The given reason for this law?  To protect the citizens of the United States! LOL

So as anyone in NY knows, NY jumped on boxing us out of the entire cryptocurrency industry all the way back in 2015, in the same manner as the US boxxed us out of the stock market!  The result? Endless losses for New Yorkers!  Here is a list of some such losses!

1.) Inability to purchase coins/tokens in private/public sales at much lower prices then the market value once they are available in an exchange and by time its available on an exchange that we can use in NY (if ever), the prices are at their peaks and are very high risk for low reward!

2.) We are seriously not allowed to be given airdrops.  If you don't know an airdrop is a portion of coins given to every user in a certain community for free.  Sometimes as much as 100% of all coins that will ever exist are airdropped at the start of the platform.  If your in New York though, your not allowed to get these airdrops (NY lawmakers protecting us New Yorkers by not allowing us to be given free money).  A very low estimate of just the airdrops I know of that I could not access results in a loss of $80,000 minimum!

3.) Access to very few exchanges and for the longest time only Coinbase, just recently a few others have become available.  So NY policy makers have been protecting us by forcing us to use CoinBase, which is an absolute blight on the entire cryptocurrency community!  The incredible amount of fees charged by them is just the start of it!  Buying $100 worth of Bitcoin will result in you owning about $84.00 worth of Bitcoin if you are not very experienced to navigate around a lot of the fees that new users get hit hard with, making a horrible experience for anyone who decides to try out cryptocurrency!  

But then their is the lack of customer service, endless cases of them giving no support to users that lost very large sums of money due to their software glitches and most recently the creation of a service called ""CoinBase One"" which is a complete scam and a totally illegal! Its littered with false, claims, misleading advertisement and flat out fraud!  Cancel it 5 mins after signing up and seeing that its all a lie and ask for a refund for the $30 subscription you paid for 5 minutes ago and did not use? 

Nope, read the ToS, we don't give refunds, you can use the service for the next 30 days that you paid for!  Except you pay them more fees per $1 traded if you use that service then if you simply trade on coinbase Pro.  End result, you pay them $30 a month for the benefit of being allowed to pay them more per trade then you pay them currently for no money a month!  Their response? ""its not false advertisement, its a fee less service, you are paying a ""market spread"" not a ""fee"""" LOL, yes instead of a fee they simply make you pay 1% more then the coin costs, so if bitcoin is at $10,000 on the exchange they quote you a price of $10,100 per BTC and call it a ""spread"" not a ""fee"".  Sure, good luck with that, cya in court!  Thanks for protecting us so well by giving Coinbase a monopoly to extort us for almost a decade!

So I'm very surprised that no organized forum and group exists for fighting the injustice forced upon us by NY politicians!  I fully expected to be able to find a site dedicated to these and many more injustices outlined, and explained for all New Yorkers to learn about the laws that policy makers have made for us that cause us huge lost opportunities and force us to use a monopoly that is littered with illegal actions all in the name of ""protecting us""!  A list of all of this information followed by a list of all of the politicians that created and voted for these policies along with a list of all the NY politicians that  refuse to change these policies would be extremely beneficial in the movement for New Yorkers to actively fight against these policies with our vote!  Add in a petition link at the bottom that outlines all these injustices and lists the politicians responsible and we could get this crucial information read by New Yorkers that have yet to even use this technology to take action simply based on the facts!

stocks,Fed officials to take cleaver to balance sheet; 'many' back big rate hikes,"by Howard Schneider and Ann Saphir 

April 6 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials in March ""generally agreed"" to cut up to $95 billion a month from the central bank's asset holdings as another tool in the fight against surging inflation, even as the war in Ukraine tempered the first U.S. interest rate increase.
Minutes of the Fed's March 15-16 meeting showed deepening concern among policymakers that inflation had broadened through the economy, which convinced them to not only raise the target policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point from its near-zero level but also to ""expeditiously"" push it to a ""neutral posture,"" estimated to be around 2.4%.

""Many"" Fed officials said they were prepared to raise rates in half-percentage-point increments in coming policy meetings to try to bring prices under control, even though the rising risks tied to the Ukraine war held them to the standard hike in March, according to the minutes, which were released on Wednesday. read more
But they also moved forward with plans to pull out of key financial markets that have been benefiting from massive Fed support since March of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic prompted the central bank to buy trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS).

After months of debate, policymakers rallied around a plan to as soon as next month reduce the Fed's holdings of Treasury bonds by up to $60 billion per month and its MBS holdings by up to $35 billion per month, with the amounts phased in over three months or slightly longer, the minutes said.
The pace of the planned balance-sheet rundown, which should have the effect of increasing long-term interest rates, is nearly double that of the Fed's ""quantitative tightening"" from 2017 to 2019, and could also include outright sales of MBS down the road, said the minutes.

""All participants agreed that elevated inflation and tight labor market conditions warranted commencement of balance sheet runoff.""

SWOLLEN BALANCE SHEET
The details of the balance sheet program included in the minutes are in line with analysts' expectations, and pave the way for it to be set in motion after the Fed's May 3-4 policy meeting.
The Fed unveiled its bond-buying program in the spring of 2020, swelling its holdings of Treasuries and MBS from $3.8 trillion to $8.5 trillion.

Yields on U.S. Treasury securities ticked higher after the release of the minutes, with the 10-year note yield climbing to 2.6%, while the dollar rose to its highest level since late May against a basket of currencies. Major U.S. stock indexes closed the session sharply lower.
""I don't think there's anything material that would garner a change in sentiment, as opposed to yesterday where there was a real change and I think it really spooked investors,"" said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz and Associates in Toledo, Ohio, referring to comments made by Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday.

Brainard told a Minneapolis Fed conference that she expected a combination of interest rate increases and a rapid balance sheet runoff to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year, with further tightening to follow as needed. read more

CryptoCurrency,The Federal Reserve plans to shrink the balance sheet by $95 Billion per month and recently raised their interest rate by .25 - that's going to be bearish in the short term but crypto is still likely to be bullish in the long term,"[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)

Alright crypto fam, the FED has officially started to reduce their balance sheet and increase interest rates throughout the economy through their respective tools. So what does that mean? 

1. It'll likely mean a reduction in the money supply. 
2. There will be a decrease in inflationary pressure (potentially). 
3. Risk assets such as crypto are likely to see some kind of reduction in prices; maybe not a bear market but corrections and choppiness are going to be possible. 

The above is likely to happen because it's a hawkish tone from the fed. One that is trying to contain inflation and we know that an inflationary environment is good for crytpo as a risk asset that in some cases is meant to be a haven for those seeking dis-inflationary currency. This is in contrast to the past five decades or so and definitely in contrast to the past two years. 

How long the downward pressure on crypto is going to last is anybody's guess. It could be months or years or it could even be priced in. I'm leaning towards the former and think we're going to have to deal with this for some number of months or low number of years but it's possible to be longer or shorter than that. The question also arises on whether the majority of this has already been priced in since we've known the Fed was going to make some type of move - we just didn't know to what extent. 

With that said, we should still be optimistic for crypto, especially for the likes of BTC as a store of value and ETH's smart contracts and applications. I pick these two in particular as mentions because they're widely adopted within the community and have already proved their worth in their respective category. We'll see reduction in prices potentially but because of their uses, I expect rebounds and continued appreciation because: 

1. Adoption continues. 
2. They proved their use case. 
3. National conflicts have shown that a non aligned global medium of exchange is beneficial to those in need.  
4. And fiat is inherently inflationary and at this time is built that way by design. So while we'll see short term money supply reductions in the long run, the supply is likely only to go up. 

Overall, I'm optimistic about the future.",cryptocurrency,1649281150.0
Trading,Can we talk bonds?,"The bond market is in basically a total collapse right now.  Treasuries have had their worst quarter in more than 40 years.  Looking back at previous declines in treasuries the 30 year basically always bottom when down ~20%.  The 30 year is down around 23% and the 10 year is down around 15%.

With the feds action right now they can and most likely will drive down prices further.  When they begin unloading their balance sheet the market will certainly get even more crazy in terms of volatility.  Now here’s where I’m getting a little risky.

Bonds usually appreciate in value during market downturns.  I’m very bearish on equities and I’m positioned to see further down movement.  There’s going to be a battle between the fed raising rates and investors looking for a safe haven.  I’m considering going long bonds now for a trade.  There’s the fed that’s going to be raising rates and there’s the investors, that I predict, will be pouring into bonds.  I believe a rally could occur until June.

I post this because I wanted to hear others opinion on whether the fed will overcome investors that might potentially lower yields.  I could very well be wrong on both the market going down and treasuries going up.  But there’s signs of a recession brewing and also signs of inflation slowing.  This trade is both risky and high rewarding.  Basically what I’m asking is am I crazy to go long bonds?",finance,1649282308.0
personalfinance,Accidentally Contributed to ROTH IRA (Botched ROTH Conversion),"I made a very dumb mistake that I am pretty embarrassed about and am trying to correct now with the least amount of tax penalty. I have had a ROTH IRA with TD Ameritrade for a number of years now, and for tax year 2021 I no longer was able to contribute directly due to my income. I wanted to try and contribute still with a backdoor ROTH.

&amp;#x200B;

I went ahead and opened what I thought was a traditional IRA on the TD Ameritrade website. Unfortunately this is where it gets messy - turns out what I opened was not a traditional IRA, but was actually a traditional brokerage account. This was in October of 2021. When I opened the account I funded this account with post-tax cash of $1,000. After the cash settled I immediately transferred the $1k to my ROTH IRA for tax year 2021. I then invested in some ETFs.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to January of 2022, I again transfer $4,000 of post-tax cash to the brokerage account (which I thought was a trad IRA), let the funds settle, and then immediately converted the funds to my ROTH IRA. I noted this for 2021 tax year. So all in for the 2021 tax year through the two deposits, I had contributed $5k to my ROTH IRA through what I thought was a ROTH conversion. I again invested in some ETFs.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to March 2022, I deposited $6k to the account, let it settle, and then transferred to the ROTH for tax year 2022. I again invested in some ETFs.

&amp;#x200B;

After chatting with TD today about not receiving a 1099-R for tax year 2021 I was informed of my mistake - that I had been making cash deposits to a brokerage account and then transferring that cash internally to the ROTH IRA. Since I am above the income threshold I was informed I need to complete a removal of excess form.

&amp;#x200B;

I am most concerned about tax year 2021 of course since taxes are due here shortly. My questions to the community are as follows:

1. Should I sell the ETFs in the account before submitting the removal of excess requests, so that I have $11,000 in cash to easily complete the transfers?
2. For tax year 2021, when I go to file my taxes using TurboTax, should I now state that I am not making any contribution to an IRA or Roth IRA? Or should I state that I made a $5k contribution to a ROTH IRA and then show that I have filed a removal of excess form?
3. For tax year 2022 I imagine this will not be as big of a deal, especially since the funds were contributed so recently - but any other advice for this tax year?
4. Calculating earnings - assume its best to let TD calculate the earnings - especially since I am selling the ETFs. I need to make this selection on the form.
5. Tax withholding election - I think the best course here would be to elect to NOT have both federal and state withheld, but wondering what the pros/cons are.  I need to make this selection on the form.

&amp;#x200B;

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated here. I understand there will likely be some penalties especially for 2021 but trying to minimize the damage as best possible. Let my mistake be a lesson, especially for those that move too fast when opening accounts!",finance,1649282343.0

investing,Thoughts on Floating Rate Funds in the current atmosphere?,"Hello r/investing!

My girlfriend and I have a few thousand shares of RSFYX (Victory Floating Rate Fund) through Raymond James -- our average share cost is $9.17 (current price is $9.16).

The price of RSFYX has been on a steady decline since its inception, though it pays decent monthly dividends, and we only pay 1.25% our portfolio value to Raymond James in fees annually (about 0.3% each quarter). We were up 2ish% right before the crazy geopolitical news broke. Since then, we were down 2% at one point, but now only down 0.6% (mainly from fees, as our average share price is $0.01 below the current share price).

The reason I am typing this post is because we are under contract for a new-construction townhome that will break ground in a few weeks. We plan to hold (and continue buying with regular contributions) until we need to sell shares for our down payment, closing costs, and other associated fees. This may be sometime in the next 12-18 months.

Essentially 99% of our saved money is held in these RSFYX shares - emergency fund, new home, furniture, etc. My girlfriend and I share the mentality that although we are taking a slight/safe(?) risk, this savings method is likely to generate better returns than a typical savings account. I am not anxious by any means, but I am curious to hear the community's thoughts on this strategy, especially during this volatility. I watch the RSFYX price daily, it typically never fluctuates more than a couple cents. When the war in the east broke out, it did react rather dramatically compared to its usual behavior, and has been on a slow climb back up since.

Do you think we are better off holding a portion (or all) of this money in cash for the next year and a half (or more)? How could the general performance of the economy or Fed interest rate hikes over the next year affect the bank loan interest that floating rate funds deal with? What are your thoughts on floating rate funds in general, and using them as a vehicle for saving money that typically makes decent gains in the long run?

personalfinance,Looking for the most effective path to buy a car,"2 years ago, my credit score was 480, and i was heavily, almost addictively reliant on payday and/or installment loans. The I got sober and adulted up. In the 2 years since becoming sober on May 11, 2020, I have seen my credit score go from 480 to 670; from a rating of Poor, I am now at a rating of Good. Of the six credit cards I have, 4 are about to be paid off, and I am no longer reliant/dependent on payday/installment loans. I have no accounts in collections.

I have never bought a car and with my credit score the way it is, and the way it continually jumps in double digits lately, I am eager to understand what buying a car entails and pursue the correct path. 

My questions are:

1) Does the amount of cash down impact the quality of cars I am eligible to have financed?

2) Does the amount I wish to pay back the loan on a monthly basis impact the range of cars I am eligible to be financed?

3) With my credit on the low end of Good and with no accounts in collections, how likely is it that i would get a fair financing offer?

4) What would be considered a fair interest rate on my financing and what would be considered unreasonably high?

5) In the scenario I see myself in, I plan to put down $5,000 and expect that my monthly payment be not more than $200 a month. Can I request the dollar amount that I wish to be financed? If I only want $5k for financing, can this option be secured? Or is it what they give me?

personalfinance,Yearly Roth IRA distribution vs. investing outside of retirement,"We'll be talking to a CPA soon but scouting for some opinions here. We have an opportunity to invest in a venture at an extremely discounted rate. The asset is expected to bloat few hundred times over the next few years making its cost basis almost 0 by then. We're in the second highest federal tax bracket right now and the appreciate value is expected to be single digit millions.

We have an option to either invest it into a self directed IRA (before bloat) or just hold it in  some non-retirement account. We will need to liquidate the asset to make any use of the appreciation.

Here's a theory: We keep this amount in the Roth IRA and invest all of it, say in real estate with CoC returns of 10% per annum. Then we take regular, scheduled distributions from Roth each year bearing the 10% penalty. This would still generate more income than had we invested the money outside of Roth, considering the capital gains we'd have to pay to liquidate the asset.

All we have learned is that clearly JPOW are hawkish and ready to do another 0.5bps hike in May at the next meeting. We also learned that the previously doveish members are now even hawkish. 

SPY had a massive gap down at open today from 451 close all the way to 447.3 at open, which of course left a big gap on the daily chart. We know how SPY does not like to leave gaps too… 

&amp;#x200B;

Intraday despite the massively red pre-market and first big red candle SPY traded within a pretty tight range hovering around 445.5 from 945am to 130pm. We saw some green start to take off right before the minutes dropped. They got a lot of people with the fake out (me included) with running it all the way to 448.5 before they dropped it like its hot to 444.2 immediately after. From there I saw some of the craziest intraday swings in such a short period of time that I have ever seen. 

Spy dropped from 448.5 to a low of 443.47 (-1.1%, $5) rose to a high of 448.93 (+1.23%, $5.5) and then dipped to 445.32 (-0.8%, $3.5) and rose to 448 (+0.6%, $2.7) all within two hours of trading. That kind of volatility has not been seen in quite a long time. And being end of the day those who were brave enough to play 0dte made some incredible gains. I was able to recoup my losses plus 2x daily profit on one 0dte put on the initial -1.1% drop along with a few call plays to hit 6x daily profit in one day. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is not surprising that we traded so close to 445.5 all day as that level is a key support of the Daily 20ema. It looked like when the minutes released we may see an aggressively red day and close below those key supports near the 440 level, however, 445 proved to be too strong to break through today. We also found out that 448 to 449 was major resistance too, as anytime we touched it end of day we immediately rejected down.

With a clear MACD sell and RSI trending downward now, favor to bears short term.

On the daily chart you can see we technically still have about an 89 cent gap from 448.93 to 449.82. Some could argue a gap this small is not important and will not be filled yet. One also may argue since its to the upside the push to close it now is not there as much as a gap below would be. Todays close and post market still have some bearish flavor to it. However, being able to close about the EMAs is fairly bullish. 

Intraday tomorrow and overnight we need to see if 1. The gap will be filled up to 449.82 and 2. If the daily 20ema (447.05), daily 100ema (446.7) and daily 50ema (445.2) is going to hold as support intraday tomorrow with the daily 50ema being the key support. If we were to get a bullish push tomorrow the daily 8ema at 451.37 will now come in to play as possible resistance. Failure for bulls to break and close above that again would be bearish. 

If the bears were to get another true bear day I would suspect they will try to close near the 200ema at 439.82. That being the final support bulls have to hold before we would see 410-420 again. 

&amp;#x200B;

The weekly candle is now coming in fairly bearish after a doji last week would hint to me that we very well could see some red next week also. Key support for bulls to hold would be the weekly 8ema at 444.88 and the weekly 20ema at 446.43. A close back below those would all be confirm a dip next week back near the weekly 50ema of 435.07. 

&amp;#x200B;

The VIX had yet another massive day today from its low of 21.24 to its highest point of 24.78 ranging 16.6% of movement. This is three massive movement days for VIX in a row, yet we have not really seen a massive 2%+/- day for SPY yet. I believe tomorrow or Friday it is coming. 

The VIX key level to watch is 24.5 for the bears and 22 for the bulls. Now that the VIX is back ABOVE the average of 16.5 to 21.5 the bulls are in favor here as its is usually easier for VIX to unwind down with no new news than to go up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apple is looking similar to SPY on the daily chart with a clear MACD sell, and rsi at 53 trending down. Apple also has a pretty significant gap from 174.42 to 173.63 (0.45%, 0.79) on the daily chart. 

Apple found support today at its daily 20ema which has not ben touched in over two weeks. 

Apple bulls need a green day tomorrow to fill the gap up to a 174.42, however, they will need to break now resistance at the daily 8ema. 

Apple bears will look for a close below the daily 20ema at 170.96. Bears will not need a very red day to accomplish this and their ultimate goal will be to get Apple below the daily 50ema at 168.44(only -2% from todays close) by end of the week. If bears can accomplish this 157 to 165 will be back in play. A close below the daily 100ema of 165.31 (-3.8% from close) while a very tough chore to accomplish in two days, it is not out of possibility for Apple depending how markets react. 

The questions going into tomorrow is now that the markets have the full minutes from FOMC and nothing news wise until April 12th with the next CPI data…. Which I fully expect to be awful and another emergency/ surprise rate hike. With the markets now seeing the true hawkish fed and the new info about the balance sheets/ QT and rate hikes is the markets going to go back into full panic mode like January? Or will the markets too quickly price this in and return to full rally mode? 

I will be looking at tomorrows close and more importantly Fridays close for that clue. We have key supports and resistance that will give us a clue going into next week. 

I will be back on the sever all day tomorrow after taking the morning off for personal errands and I will also have a proper pre market post up around 9am tomorrow on the server for everyone. 

10% challenge-

Today was a pretty good day for me.

As I said I was gone all morning and ended up not trading till about 1230. I entered some Apple and Spy puts around that time that I held till the first big green candle at 2pm and sold both for -50%. I then was able to grab a nice 80% 0dte play on the way down to recoup those loses + x2 my daily gains goalI had another 2dte -20% put that I played on the first recovery bounce when it faked us out red before ripping green (which is when I entered calls). I then played two different 2dte calls one for 40% and one for 30%. Overall being able to hit 6x my daily profit goal is incredible. I look to go into Thursday and Friday with low risk and being very conservative as I do not want to risk losing all these gains on silly plays. Friday if I have a good day tomorrow will look for a slightly higher risk on than usual though.",finance,1649290462.0

solar,Can I get some feedback on my quotes?,"I've done some research and think I have a pretty good idea of what I want to go with, but wanted to get some additional eyes on it to make sure I'm not missing anything obvious.

This is a new house for us, previous usage was ~580kWh. Water and house heater (water baseboards) are gas, no AC (evap cooler), only significant usage is the kitchen and my PC. We have an EV that we charge ~300kWh a month or so, which I plan on factoring in to system size in more detail once I narrow down installers. Roof is an ideal roof for solar based off comments from multiple installers, no complexity at all. Property is south facing, has zero shade during the day. We require a panel upgrade as part of any installation.

Questions:

* I see the discussion about IQ7+ vs IQ7A inverters - seems the +s might be best when panels won't have full sunlight except for the peak hours. Would the A's be worth upgrading to (depending on cost/return period) considering we're fully south facing and zero shade possible, especially with 400w panels if we go that route? I need to get some specific pricing numbers on that
* IQ8s look appealing in order to be ""futureproofed"" in case of any replacements required down the line, as well as the opportunity to have power during the day if the grid goes down. I am aware that this requires additional investment in hardware to accomplish, not sure if I'm going to go for that or a battery (or either, tbh). Other than those benefits, there's nothing else performance-wise I should consider?
* Most installers have both Silfab and REC panels - since we have such a good roof for solar, would it be worth it to upgrade to the REC 400s in order to increase our generation for future usage increases (another EV + hot tub in a few years)? We're in an area that gets hail somewhat regularly, the RECs are apparently better rated for hail? Not terribly concerned about 25-year efficiency (though, 92% guaranteed is nice to see), I doubt we'll be in this home longer than 5-10 years (max)
* Only one installer recommends a traditional inverter, the SolarEdge. Apparently there is some technology that makes it highly unlikely for the inverter as a whole to go out, it would fail in a similar way microinverters would, with only the affected panels having their output stopped, the rest would continue generating. I'm not sure how thats possible, and we were running out of time in our meeting so I tabled it for after I did more research. Surely the inverter in this example is still a single point of failure? In any case, they have IQ7s they can quote me with instead if I want to go that route

personalfinance,Is this mortgage lender being unethical?,"My parents are purchasing a new home from a builder who is also the mortgage lender and the closing date keeps getting pushed back. The original closing date was March 30th. It was pushed to end of April and now to the end of May. The reason why I’m asking if they’re doing something unethical is because the loan offer will expire by May and my parents will have to apply again for the mortgage. ~~It seemed like a normal thing until we realized the house went up in price from 320k to 360k~~. Interest rates have also gone up since our approval and we’re probably going to pay more than originally agreed upon. We emailed the lender to see why the closing date keeps being pushed back and they keep giving us vague answers like “the construction isn’t done.” When we ask specifically what isn’t finished they don’t have a clear answer either. I have a feeling they’re stretching it out to take advantage of the current housing market. Not 100% sure if they’re just trying to take advantage of us since they control construction and the lending process, but I would like some expert opinions on whether we could do anything to combat this if it were the case.

Edit: please ignore the portion about the house price changing. I apologize for the error. The price of the home is locked in.

I am currently a 21m senior in college and I am about to graduate next month. I am fortunate enough to have landed a job that pays 80k per year and will start that job following graduation. I do however have roughly 87k in student loans that are all between 3.7-4% interest rates with minimum payments at ~$750 per month. I also have roughly 3.5k in credit card debt and just about 2.5k in cash. I estimate my take home pay to be 4.7k per month when I start my new job. This take home pay is after I max the employer match contribution to 401k. My question for all of you is what is the best way to proceed with managing my finances when I start? I live with my parents but I would like to move out by the end of 2023. I could pay off my loans in two years and leave little to no money for investments or I could prioritize investments and continue making minimum payments. My problem is that I live in NJ and I've budgeted conservatively 4k in monthly expenses (including loan pyments) to live on my own. This budget is including everything from food and rent to insurance and car pyments and even 400 in discretionary spending. Moving out is a huge priority of mine for personal reasons but if I still have these loan payments to deal with it really becomes a cash flow problem because im only left with about 700 to spare for investments or saving. How much should I save for moving out and should I prioritize investing over loan payments before I move out and just make minimum payments to maturity?",finance,1649293346.0

personalfinance,Help Updating Form W4,"When I did my 2021 taxes, it turns out I was significantly under-withheld for that year.  I'd like to fix this for 2022, but I don't understand the cause of the problem and am not sure what to research. If anyone can point me in the direction of what I need to read to understand this I'd appreciate it.

In the past my federal withholding has always been within +/-3% of the actual tax due, which is where I like to be.  This year it was &gt;10% short, despite no changes to my W4 and no changes to circumstances which would require W4 updates.

My taxable income was \~245k, and tax withheld was \~50k.  My actual federal tax bill comes out to \~56k.  I am single, have no dependents, and do not claim any deductions on my W4.  I have no income besides my W2 salary.  I don't understand what has changed this year causing the withholding to be so far off relative to previous years.

Do I need to talk to payroll at my company to see if there was some mistake in how they are calculating what amount to withhold?  Do I need to take the amount the withholding was short by and divide by my tax rate (6k/0.35 = 17k)and provide that as an ""extra withholding"" on W4 Step 4(c) to artificially increase the withholding amount?

For those who don't read or simply can't, here's the TLDR: The FED has to raise interest rates and dump assets to counter inflation.

For those wondering how a market downturn affects crypto, generally, it's worse. BTC and ETH will dump more than the S&amp;P and other indexes, and alts will get absolutely slaughtered. I know you guys have an aversion to taking profits, but FFS, if you're still in the green right now, at least consider taking some off the table. Seriously, what could be the worst outcome here? One taxable event? You can handle it, there's software for that.

""Bro, nobody knows shit about fuck"" Yes, we actually do anon. We do for a fact know that a raise in interest rates and the FED dumping assets is generally associated with a market downturn. We also know that inflation is completely out of control and that it will take more than one rate hike to get back to acceptable levels. We also know that we're overdue for a recession.

Yea sure, maybe Apple will announce tomorrow that they're adding BTC to their balance sheet. Unlikely obviously. Also unlikely that Luna comes to the rescue and gobbles up a whole bunch of BTC when they know they can most likely buy it significantly lower than this over the next few months (years?).

personalfinance,Inherited 401(k) and before- or after- state taxes,"I have not been able to find much information on this topic, so i am hoping someone will be able to help...

I inherited a 401(k) from someone who had worked about 40 or so years for the same company in NY (started at the job around the late 60's).  During that time he lived in three different states at different times (NJ, NY, CT).

From looking at my inherited 401(k) account online, I see that all funds in the account are marked as either before-tax or company match.  To me this indicates that 100% of the funds are federally taxable when distributed (such as when taking the yearly RMD).

But my question is about state tax-ability of distributed funds...

I see nowhere on the 401(k) website where it says if the funds that were contributed to the 401(k) were taxed by the state.  I found [this](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/don-t-forget-new-jersey-taxation-iras-401ks-and-403bs) site that indicates that in NJ (at least) you could not contribute before-tax (state) funds to a 401(k) before 1984.  I don't know if there were similar situations for the other states involved.

So what I am asking is... is it possible that some of the funds contributed to the 401(k) were taxed by the state and not by the federal government?

If yes, does this mean that I should be able to reduce the state tax that is paid when I receive a distribution?  Otherwise the same money would be taxed by the state twice.

Of course, I would have to know how much of this money was state taxed (and maybe which state it was taxed by) which unless I can find some records of this seems like a daunting if not impossible task.

Is it possible that when the law changed to allow state before-tax contributions that there was some sort of method they used to convert after-tax (state) funds to before-tax (state) funds, perhaps some sort of one-time tax rebate?

I've looked at some of the prior years tax returns of the original owner of the 401(k) and it looks like he was paying state taxes on the full amount distributed, so this is an indication that there were no after-tax (state) funds in the account, but this may just be because he didn't know any better.

So my final questions are, is it possible that the 401(k) has after-tax (state) funds?  If so, is there any way to find out if this account has such funds?

28. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14).

Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

Here’s some analysis of the EU MiCA draft language guessing that there’s a good chance it will pass today (March 14) but that it might be removed during “Trilogues” which will be the subsequent informal tripartite meetings on legislative proposals between representatives of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, and the European Commission.

personalfinance,Mortgage rates US vs EU,"It's very strange to me how mortgage rates in the EU are always so much lower than in the US. I get it that central bank lending rates are different, but why such a large margin of difference? 

US: On Thursday, April 07, 2022, the national average 10-year fixed mortgage APR is 4.050%. The average 10-year refinance APR is 4.100%, according to Bankrate’s latest survey of the nation’s largest mortgage lenders. 

EU: Ten year fixed 100% lending 2.51%

 ""the United States Fed Funds Rate is projected to trend around 2.75 percent in 2023, according to our econometric models""

ECB lending rates 0% 

So, how does the Fed charge so much more than the ECB? Is it because Fed debt is much higher? But then the Fed would earn a whole lot more than the ECB. Won't the ECB then run up a lot higher debt than the US if they keep lending money for free? OTOH, wouldn't the US economy benefit from lower central rates to increase home ownership? Seems the balance sheets for Fed and ECB are roughly the same at about 8T.

 I've read the official EU explanation about differences in mortgage rates, but it was from 2007 and doubt it applies any longer to current financial conditions worldwide. If someone has a clear explanation of the central policy which accounts for this large difference, it would be very interesting to me.",finance,1649311791.0

investing,Portfolio for a rising interest rate and high inflation environment,"I'm thinking about how to position myself for a high inflation and rising interest rates environment. My current thesis is this:

- Rising interest rates, and thereby a rising risk-free rate, are going to compress multiples in the broad stock market. This makes investing in broad index ETFs less attractive as in the past decade, as the returns are likely low if not negative.

- Bonds are losing value when interest rates rise. Therefore investing in bonds before a period of rising rates is not advisable

- Cash loses value quickly due to high inflation

Therefore, I see two possible options for positioning myself:

1. Investing into different markets outside of EU/US where the environment might be different

2. Going overweight into banking sector ETFs. Banks profit from rising interest rates and could come out on top in such an environment. However, if the rising rates lead to a general market sell of and/or a recession the bank stocks might also lose value.

Of course, the whole thesis builds on the assumption that interest rates will be rising for some time and inflation does not magically go away when supply chain issues are resolved.

What are your thoughts on this? Am I going wrong somewhere?",finance,1649331064.0

# [S&amp;P 500 futures rise slightly following two-day Fed sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose slightly on Thursday as the market tried to recover from back-to-back losing sessions, while traders digested the Federal Reserve’s plans to tighten monetary policy.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat, S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Shares of HP Inc surged 15% in the premarket after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a stake in the tech hardware maker.
*****
&gt; The Fed on Wednesday released the minutes from its March meeting, which showed that officials planed to reduce their trillions in bond holdings with a consensus amount around $95 billion. Meanwhile, policymakers indicated that one or more 50 basis-point interest rate hikes could be warranted to battle surging inflation.
*****
&gt; “The minutes from the latest FOMC meeting portray a higher level of urgency than previous communication as the Fed has circled on a commitment to run the balance sheet down faster than market participants may have expected,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management.
*****
&gt; Officials “generally agreed” that a maximum of $60 billion in Treasurys and $35 billion in mortgage-backed securities would be allowed to roll off, phased in over three months and likely starting in May.
*****
&gt; The news sent the blue-chip Dow down more than 100 points Wednesday, while the S&amp;P 500 slid 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped another 2.2%, bringing its week-to-date losses to 2.6%. Those losses came after comments from Fed Governor Lael Brainard pushed stock prices lower on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “It does seem like they are talking up the possibility of raising rates by 50 basis points at the next meeting so the hope is that message is well telegraphed in advance,” said Brian Price, head of investment management at Commonwealth Financial Network. “I expect that volatility will remain elevated for the time being as there is a lot of uncertainty for investors to digest right now.”
*****
&gt; Investors await the weekly jobless claims data Thursday morning, which is expected to show a total of 200,000 claims filed.
*****
&gt; Investors also continue to monitor the Ukraine-Russia war, as Ukraine asks NATO for more weapons.
*****
&gt; “Ukraine’s urgent needs, the sustainability of supplies, and long-term solutions which will help Ukraine to prevail,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet.
*****
&gt; Crude prices ticked higher after falling in the previous session. U.S. oil gained 0.7% to $96.94 per barrel, while international Brent advanced 0.9% to $101.95.

CryptoCurrency,An analysis of the current market on what has happened recently and what is likely to happen this year,"This year's market has come to this point, in fact, you can get a glimpse of it. Interest rate hikes have landed, U.S. stocks have plummeted, war black swans, new interest rate hikes and shrinking balance sheet expectations, etc., Bitcoin is still stuck in the range of 30,000 to 40,000, which is still a lot from the 21,000 pie imagined by countless bears. distance.

&amp;#x200B;

The expectation of the first interest rate hike has been digested in the continuous decline after Bitcoin reached a new high of 69,000 last year, so the first interest rate hike just happened to be negative and positive, and U.S. stocks also rebounded. Recently, the Fed officials have been further shouting, and they are full of hawks. It is expected to raise interest rates by 50 points in May. It is already a certainty. If you get out of the market, or you have been slumped since the slump a few days ago, you have to continue to observe.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the United States and the European Union have vigorously imposed economic sanctions on Russia. The currency circle has become a potential way for Russian rich people to avoid economic sanctions. The huge amount of funds withdrawn from the European Union is also testing and looking for the next reservoir. There is no doubt that BTC is a potentially large pool. In addition, Ukraine accepts bitcoin donations and has begun to fully embrace the blockchain and embrace bitcoin. Russia has also begun to recognize and accept bitcoin from the blockade of crypto before the war. It is conceivable that after the war Ukraine and Russia, will be the new port for crypto

&amp;#x200B;

The West has been shouting ""personal property is sacred and inviolable"" for many years, and a Russian-Ukrainian war was revealed. What kind of personal property is inviolable, it depends on whether you conform to our position and whether it violates our rights and interests. If you want to seal it up. Feng, I will not discuss with you. This also happens to contrast with assets such as crypto and Bitcoin, which are truly personal and personal, and cannot be plundered by anyone. It can only be said that Bitcoin faced a war for the first time. This Russia-Ukraine war has accelerated people’s understanding and cognition of Bitcoin. Now, time is on Bitcoin’s side.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, if Bitcoin stabilizes in the past two days, it will be a beautiful step back test. In the second half of April before the arrival of May, there should still be the second half of the market, and it should be seen again in April. Long-lost 50,000 BTC. Of course, ETH2.0 is coming, and the strong Ethereum may continue to drive Bitcoin out of this new market fuel Bitcoin, fuel Ethereum",cryptocurrency,1649337086.0
CryptoCurrency,The Case for Bitcoin in Generational Wealth,"# The Case for Bitcoin in Generational Wealth

*Joel Revill*

Generational wealth consists of financial assets that are passed down within a family, from one generation to the next. Managing generational wealth involves estate planning and investment strategies aimed at supporting the financial well-being of a family’s future generations and philanthropic interests. 

Generational wealth is typically invested to preserve principal in real terms while allocating a portion of returns to fund the family’s expected distributions. Investment strategies tend to emulate “endowment-style investing” which seeks to remain invested throughout market cycles, minimize portfolio volatility, and grow principal balances at a rate greater than inflation. 

Generational wealth managers typically construct diversified portfolios comprised of uncorrelated assets which may include publicly traded securities, alternatives such as hedge funds and venture capital, and illiquid investments such as real estate and mineral rights. These portfolios are designed to better withstand market corrections and achieve superior risk adjusted returns over the very long-term.

**Does crypto fit into generational wealth?**

In 2009 an anonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer network designed to store and transmit value. Since that time, bitcoin and over 18,000 other networks built on distributed public ledgers have experienced unprecedented growth and adoption. The total market cap of these crypto assets now exceeds $2.2 trillion with user growth of over 100% per year; well ahead of the adoption rate ever experienced by the internet. In 2021, the number of crypto users nearly tripled, from 106 million in January to 295 million in December. Extrapolating a similar rate of increase in 2022, crypto is on track to reach 1 billion users by the end of this year.

For the question of managing generational wealth, we focus on bitcoin due to its dominant adoption rate among crypto assets and its unique “store of wealth” properties. We believe these two qualities, along with bitcoin's persistent lack of correlation to traditional assets over long periods of time, make it an attractive asset in which to invest generational wealth.

**Bitcoin’s historical returns**

Bitcoin launched in January 2009 but did not price until July 2010 when it began to change hands at $0.05 per bitcoin. Since that time, bitcoin’s returns have consistently and significantly outperformed traditional assets such as gold and equities.

https://preview.redd.it/j0ovepu1x3s81.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f86c677253179aa32d6b51b8bb589cd5e86b3b3

To avoid “cherry picking” a favorable point in time for bitcoin’s performance, we calculated 3-year annualized returns rolling over time. Here we also introduce a hypothetical investment portfolio comprised of 60% equity and 40% fixed income securities (""60/40 portfolio""). This portfolio represents a traditional diversified investment portfolio against which we can compare bitcoin's performance.

As Figure 2 illustrates, 3-year annualized returns of bitcoin significantly outperformed the 60/40 portfolio over time. The median of bitcoin’s 3-year annualized returns was 111.5% compared to just 9.3% for the 60/40 portfolio. In addition, bitcoin's returns exceeded those of the 60/40 portfolio during 99.3% of the observed periods.

https://preview.redd.it/wj0bi6m7x3s81.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05ab9cda7e525eb4482d47f0e5af600c72b91009

We then recalculated 60/40 portfolio returns assuming incremental investments in bitcoin. We began with a 60/40 portfolio and added 10 basis point increments of bitcoin, maintaining a 60/40 split for the remaining balance. With each portfolio, we calculated 3-, 5-, and 10-year annualized returns to understand the impact that a range of allocations to bitcoin would have across different time horizons. 

As Figure 3 illustrates, even small allocations to bitcoin increased 3-, 5-, and 10-year returns dramatically. In fact, just a 5% position in bitcoin *doubled* the *10*\-year returns of a 60/40 portfolio.

https://preview.redd.it/8jvr3cs9x3s81.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=456d1e3334be70da512d772675f524e25853af62

**What about volatility?**

Bitcoin's impact on portfolio returns is not surprising given its significant outperformance relative to equities and fixed income. However, bitcoin has been a volatile asset. So, the question is whether bitcoin’s positive contribution to returns more than compensates for the increased volatility.

To answer this, we calculate risk adjusted returns using the Sharpe ratio, a measurement of a portfolio’s outperformance per unit of its volatility. All else being equal, portfolios with higher excess returns or lower volatility produce higher Sharpe ratios, and vice-versa. Sharpe ratios above 1.00 are considered good, as the asset or portfolio is generating excess returns relative to its volatility.

The Sharpe ratio is typically used to measure the change in risk adjusted returns when a new asset is added to a portfolio. But let's start with the Sharpe ratio of bitcoin as a standalone asset. On a trailing 3-year basis, bitcoin produced a Sharpe ratio of 1.79. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 produced a 0.95 Sharpe ratio over the same period while the 60/40 portfolio produced a 0.99 Sharpe ratio.

To again avoid “cherry picking” a favorable point in time for bitcoin’s performance, we calculated the 3-year Sharpe ratio rolling over time. As Figure 4 shows, bitcoin produced a Sharpe ratio consistently greater than 1.00 over time (88% of observed periods) with a median of 1.63. 

https://preview.redd.it/226r9h1cx3s81.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b77d1d42484559772300f1b1d9faa4aaedc3964

While measuring bitcoin's Sharpe ratio over time provides an understanding of its risk / return characteristics, to understand whether its contribution to returns more than compensates for the increased risk we need to consider the correlation between bitcoin and other assets in the portfolio.  

Adding imperfectly correlated assets to a portfolio can reduce overall volatility and increase risk adjusted returns.  The practical challenge for traditional investment portfolios is that there are very few assets that offer a persistent lack of correlation to equity and fixed income securities over long periods of time.  Bitcoin is a unique exception.

The correlation between bitcoin’s daily returns and those of the 60/40 portfolio was 0.29, 0.21, and 0.11 over the past 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively. This indicates almost no correlation between bitcoin and the returns of traditional assets. Thanks to this imperfect correlation, a small allocation to bitcoin can result in no added risk to a portfolio.  

A variety of measures exist to ascertain risk.  For investment portfolios we use Value at Risk (""VaR""), which quantifies the extent of possible losses over a specified period of time. We calculated VaR of the 60/40 portfolio using 3-, 5-, and 10-year data to understand the impact that a range of bitcoin positions would have across different periods of time. As figure 5 shows, an allocation of up to 5% in bitcoin over the past 3-, 5-, and 10 years resulted in no measurable increase in the risk of the portfolio.

https://preview.redd.it/5p6dlk1hx3s81.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5312ec13604ac9a586cfd9a01bc0748f5075a6b9

Given the substantial increase in returns with no added risk to the portfolio, it follows that a small position in bitcoin would significantly increase Sharpe Ratios. Figure 6 confirms this logic. The 60/40 portfolio produced Sharpe ratios of about 1.0 during the past 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods.  Adding a small position in bitcoin substantially increased these Sharpe ratios. In fact, just a 5% position in bitcoin increased historical Sharpe ratios by roughly 1/3rd across all three time periods.

https://preview.redd.it/nn9wicljx3s81.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f44ecd701020415daaaf7f6dee74581c114505fe

**Bitcoin as a store of generational wealth**

Bitcoin is a digital network that allows for the storage and transfer of value. There are many applications for bitcoin, but here we are focused on bitcoin’s unique properties to store wealth across time. The most important of which is an unchangeable policy written into bitcoin’s code that results in a predetermined and finite supply. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, with approximately 19 million (90%) outstanding as of April 2022.

New bitcoins are issued in blocks during a verification process known as mining at an average rate of one block every ten minutes. The number of bitcoins issued in each block is reduced by 50% every four years. This reward will continue to halve every four years, gradually reducing bitcoin's “inflation” until the final bitcoin has been mined.

**Why finite money supply matters for storing wealth**

In contrast to bitcoin, government-issued currency not backed by a physical commodity (“fiat money”) is subject to an unknown and infinite supply. A perceived benefit of this unlimited money supply is the ability for central banks to manage credit supply, liquidity, interest rates, and money velocity. This may be helpful in smoothing economic cycles but invites the potential for governments to debase their fiat money thereby diminishing its qualities as a store of wealth.  

This becomes particularly problematic when governments spend beyond their means. Deficits require governments to borrow, which in turn requires lenders to fund the government’s debt. Enter the central banks and a process known as debt monetization. Debt monetization is the process by which central banks increase money supply to fund government deficits.  

Unfortunately, that is exactly what's happening today on an unprecedented scale. The US government ended 2021 with a staggering $2.8 trillion deficit. This shortfall, as shown in Figure 7, equated to 12.4% of Gross Domestic Product (""GDP'), among the highest levels on record. 

https://preview.redd.it/thoucoenx3s81.png?width=759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72c785b4a5f993f4551ed16e6ab7464a306df1a4

As a result of the ballooning deficits, US government debt, shown in Figure 8, has been climbing for the past four decades and as of year-end 2021 stands at $28.4 trillion or 123% of GDP.

https://preview.redd.it/n39yohgpx3s81.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a45eee3c8e9d3225041cc8d5d6249affde01adc4

So where is the central bank in all of this? As of February 2022, US Dollar money supply (“M2”) totaled $21.8 trillion, an increase of 11% from the prior year.

https://preview.redd.it/opcbfizrx3s81.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3557a87d9faa0859dee25fe6748e7dbc251ff69f

Even more worrisome about this acceleration of M2 growth is the sustained levels year over year. During the past three years, M2 has grown 15% on an annualized basis. Figure 10 puts these numbers in historical context, with recent levels of growth not seen since the 1970s.

https://preview.redd.it/5ubrondtx3s81.png?width=755&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=360d56d3a97694f1f7ef6db1eea687c93211a775

Debt monetization typically depreciates currencies, lowers yields on government debt, and inflates prices for assets such as real estate and stocks - - a tempting mix of incentives for officials who are subject to short-term election cycles. But there's a hitch. Funding government deficits through debt monetization invariably leads to monetary inflation. And monetary inflation erodes the purchasing power of fiat money, reducing the real value of wealth over time. Debt monetization is in effect another form of taxation. 

To make matters worse, even those investing in government treasuries today are losing real wealth. Treasury inflation-protected securities (""TIPS"") are a proxy for the return on government debt adjusted for inflation. TIPS are a form of US Treasury bond indexed to inflation, which means that the yield on TIPS equates to the real interest rate earned by those who invest in treasuries. As Figure 11 reveals, the real yield on 10-year US Treasuries declined into negative territory two years ago and currently stands at -0.52%. In other words, investing $1,000 in government debt today will return $949 inflation adjusted dollars in 10 years.

https://preview.redd.it/x1st71iwx3s81.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cff0adb5cd2c8e42c92f05575ba8740d0012cda

**Where would you rather store generational wealth?**

Governments seem increasingly comfortable running larger and larger deficits despite the inescapable fact that they are saddling themselves with debt that can only be absorbed by inflation, higher taxes, or default. 

Because debt monetization is a necessary component to fund government deficits, money supply is influenced by officials with misaligned incentives and an infinite supply of money. Bitcoin’s money supply, on the other hand, is finite and unchangeable. 

US Dollar supply has grown at an annualized rate of 15% over the past three years with no change in sight to the government deficits underlying the problem. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is growing at less than 2% annually, a rate which is programmed to steadily decline to zero. A sound money standard, like that of bitcoin, is far superior for storing generational wealth than that of inflationary, fiat-based standards.

**Conclusion**

Bitcoin presents a compelling investment case when viewed through the lens of traditional generational wealth management. Bitcoin's unprecedented rate of adoption, persistent lack of correlation to traditional investments over long periods of time, and sound money supply make it an attractive asset in which to invest generational wealth. Allocating just 5% to bitcoin substantially improved the risk adjusted returns of a traditional investment portfolio, increasing 3-, 5-, and 10-year annualized returns by 700-1,000 basis points while adding no measurable risk to the portfolio.

personalfinance,Is paying off debt here still a good choice? Critique my financial plan.,"Hi all, have posted numerous times in the past but with the current market, I just wanted to double check that I am still making the right choice. 

Quick background, we are 30 married with a 2 year old and a new baby on the way in August. 

We have decreased our consumer debt from 166k down to 68k (currently) since 2019. 

Combined income is around 198k. My wife is going to take a year off with the new baby and I just got a raise while also picking up a per diem gig. I now bring home around 130k a year without my side hustles. 

Our net worth is 375k. 

529: 3800

Crypto: 18k

Cash in HYSA: ~30k

Paid off cars: 45k 

Misc other items: 30k

Retirement accounts: 105k collectively (have been focusing on paying down debt aggressively last couple of years vs investing). 

We owe 374k on our home worth around 585k with an interest rate of 2.99%

Federal loans: 20,700 interest rates 3.8% or less. Currently on hold, will be 75 per month starting august. 

Private loans: 48,500 at 3.85% currently 293 a month

I have increased my 401k to 10% and my employer puts 7.5% in. 

Here is my plan: By June 2022 we will have 50-55k cash. Plan on paying off 48k loan to free up the 293 payment to make the year of one income less tight. Then cash out about 10k of my crypto to add to our E-Fund to about 15k. 

Continue contributing 10% to 401k. Budget is to the T. After all bills, expenses, areas all around for life, will have an extra 500-1000 a month depending on my side hustle and per diem job. 

Does this all sound like the right path? Should I hold onto the debt? Any other suggestions? Thanks in advance.",finance,1649338149.0

He has $93K in student loans ($60K in private and $33K in federal).  The private loan rates are killer - ranging between 5.75% and 10% but they are slated to end in 7 and 10 years. The obvious choice seems like we should refinance the private loans but when we bundle them with the federal, the loan terms we are thinking of is 3.84%, 12 years but with $28K of interest. 

With Biden extending the federal loan forbearance period, I'm thinking of not bundling the federal loans in case there is some sort of forgiveness ( one can dream right?) and since those rates are lower (between 3.4% and 6.8%). I'm also worried about giving up any protections associated with the federal loans. 

I don't really have anyone I can ask about these so just reaching out for any advice with people who have had experience refinancing private and federal loans.",finance,1649339861.0
personalfinance,Daughter can't afford payments or insurance for brand new car.,"My young daughter (21) is also a single mom.  She purchased a brand new 2022 car last Fall, and rolled her previous loan balance into her new loan.  The dealership took her to the cleaners. The interest rate is high (double digits).  The monthly payment is high, like $800.  Her car payment and child care payment are essentially her entire income.  She stopped paying for insurance, and got in a minor accident (front-end damage, still drivable).  She and her son moved back in with us last year, so she doesn't have other expenses (rent, etc).

I have no idea what advice to give her.  If she calls Honda Finance to ""relinquish the car"" back to them, they will sell the car and she will still have probably $10k+ on the loan balance, which she does not have.  But she also can't afford to keep the car either.

Edit: I understand it's not the dealership's responsibility.

Edit 2: I underestimated how much blame would be thrown my way for this.  Thanks everyone.  I'm doing everything I can to educate my children - but there's only so much you can do when your adult children are determined to make awful choices to avoid looking like a ""peasant"" to their friends.

I'm pretty okay at budgeting (I could stand to eat out less) and I put away a least $600 a month, often more. I recently bought a house and have been building my savings back up and have $6,000 saved. I have student loans but haven't paid them since 2021. I want to take advantage of this time to get my credit card debt gone. 

Should I just pay all of my savings to the debt? Should I pay a portion? Should I transfer my debt to another card for 0% interest for a year to get it paid down quicker? Should I take out a loan with a lower interest rate?

personalfinance,Is it worth refinancing my mortgage?,"(Let me preface this: my husband and I are 27yo first time homeowners who know nothing about mortgages or anything related to home buying and we have a VA loan through Navy Federal).
Navy Federal has fucked up my mortgage payments for over 3 months now, and every time we called they would ""fix it"", but then the payment would still decline every time. We have more than enough money in our account (with a different bank) and there was no issue on their end. We got shafted a few months ago because our insurance company dropped us without notice (they said it was a high risk property or something), but I was able to resolve that and get a new policy from a different company. We paid the insurance premium in full when we got it (policy for 9/21 - 9/22). But when my husband called the bank to try and resolve the issue for the sixth time he was told our mortgage payments were going up by about 25% (currently paying about $1200, but they're increasing it by over $400).. when my husband asked why the bank said it was because of our insurance, but if we paid it in full why would it increase at all? Doing business with them has been nothing short of a nightmare. When we were in the middle of closing on the house, both my LO and his manager ghosted us for like a week and we almost lost the house bc of that. Then the LO had the audacity to complain to me about my realtor calling him and his boss several times with no explanation and being upset about it and saying they were unprofessional. I cried on closing day out if sheer happiness from never needing to deal with him ever again (and apparently this is a common thing for him bc my friend had the exact same issue with her VA loan and it was the same LO that I had. Anyways, I'm curious as to whether refinancing is worth it? Like I'd rather have my interest rate go up than to deal with them, that's how stressed out this makes me.

Following nearly a billion dollars in losses from liquidations on Jan. 21 and $470 million on Jan. 22, Wednesday's figures were the third-highest of 2022. BTC (Bitcoin) fell to 42,500 from 47,000$

Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully terminates a trader’s leveraged position as a safety measure due to a partial or whole loss of the trader’s initial margin. This is most common in futures trading, which solely tracks asset prices rather than spot trading, which involves traders owning the actual assets.

Outside of bitcoin and ether, futures tracking Solana's SOL and Dogecoin's DOGE witnessed a combined $40 million in liquidation losses, the biggest among major cryptocurrencies (ETH). Meanwhile, GMT tokens of the month-old crypto project StepN were a surprising addition on the list with $9 million in recorded losses.

Is this the end of Solana and Doge? Ofcourse no. This is especially a good avenue for good investors to buy the dip as this is a 10xer.

I'm already contributing a decent amount to a 401k and health insurance/a FSA, so I feel like I have those aspects of long term planning covered.

personalfinance,Need Advice: Pay off car loan faster vs increase savings?,"My wife and I (both 35yo) just paid off one of our cars freeing up $118 in our monthly budget and I am waffling on how to allocate. My original plan was to use this for extra payments on our second car to payoff that loan faster. However, we probably should try to save more as well so I'm looking for some other opinions. Details below:

We live in a HCOL area, joint annual gross income is $118k. Our house is currently valued by Zillow at $457k and we have $227k @ 2.5% left on the mortgage. The only other debt we have  is our other car which is $283/mo ($18,626 @ 2.99% with $9,712 left to pay - this is an EV we purchased last year and we used what we got back from the federal tax credit toward the loan). If we just keep paying the basic payment the loan will be paid off ~3 years from now. If we apply the $118 as extra payments we will pay off the loan ~2 years from now (I think my math checks out).

On the savings front we have $5k in checking as our basic monthly operating fund, $30k emergency fund, $6.2k home maintenance fund, $6k in a Roth IRA, $36k in a 401k, $6.5k in a brokerage acct, and $1.1k in crypto. Other things to consider - we have 1 child (4yo) and her grandparents already have money set aside for her college. We also have access to my wife's family trust (she shares with her 2 brothers) which has ~ $1MM in assets.  She also has an irrevocable life insurance trust set up with a $2MM payout (upon her parents death). There will likely be some additional inheritance assets but I don't have those quantified. I put 3% into the 401k which is the company match, $200/mo into the Roth, $100/mo into the brokerage so I know we aren't setting aside very much, but given the trusts I think we will be ok.

personalfinance,I think I need a reality check with my house budget.,"**Background:** 

I (28) finished grad school August 2020 and was hired immediately upon graduating. I started with a salary at 70k and have received two bonuses and two raises over the last two years. My gross income for 2021 was \~$84k. My base salary currently resides around $79k. About a year into this job I upped my retirement contributions and started maxing out my 401k, HSA, Roth, and putting a little under $1000/month into an early retirement brokerage account. I was having a hard time putting money into an emergency fund account simultaneously and wasn't a fan of the vulnerability I felt so I recently removed the small amounts I had in my Roth and brokerage account (have currently paused contributions to both), lowered my 401k contributions to 6% (company match) and now have about $15k in cash sitting in a savings account. My 401k currently has $29k and my HSA has $4k (uninvested).

**Budget:**

Monthly take home after 401k, health/car insurance, HSA, and taxes is about $4600. My rent is currently $750/month which includes utilities except internet (+$40). I work from home and about 1-2 times per month drive 6 hours roundtrip for client/office visits which work covers so I have \~$100/month in gas budgeted that I don't use all of.  I have an older Jeep that I paid in cash 5 years ago and just acquired a more gas friendly car for $5k cash through a friend so I can slowly fix up the Jeep and give to my parents. Just some fluff numbers for groceries + going out at $400/month and a miscellaneous cushion number at $250/month. I end out the month with about $3k leftover. 

**House:**

Regions has a program that I qualify for where it is 0% down with no PMI requirements as long as I stay a qualified buyer (high credit, low DTI, house resides in LMI area). Interest rate sits higher, currently at 5.75%. The only reason I am looking for a house is because I am flat out miserable in my apartment. I'm making due because of how cheap it is but it is cockroach infested and has a loud and trashy upstairs neighbor that keeps me up at all hours of the night. I am staying at my boyfriend's house more than I want to just to escape the place. If I were to move, my rent would be about $1200 month for an 'okay' place. 

I've put in a few offers on homes already where my mortgage would be anywhere from $1200-$1600. As interest rates rise, my budget obviously shrinks and I'm eyeing houses I would once tour and feeling uncomfortable by the monthly amount. I am in a quickly growing city in the Southeast and thought I had more time before I felt 'priced out' of rent, hence the minimal house savings. My budget has been $180k-$250k. The top of my budget has come down closer to $235k with interest rates changes. This gets me anywhere from 850 sq ft to 1200 sq ft depending on the condition and location of the home.

**Help:**

I think I need to hear someone tell me 'stop, save and come back later' or 'you aren't in way over your head'. I've always been a pretty frugal and risk averse person so taking on a mortgage scares me more than the average person. But feeling like I don't have a home and have to lean on other people for that makes me equally as uncomfortable. I know I can always step back and save more, but the area I have come to call home and love is quickly becoming the new shiny city with all the amazing recreational activity people want to move for. I'm worried that despite the craziness of this housing market I actually WILL get priced out of owning within a five minute bike ride of downtown as the housing market here has been growing and competitive for the last 4-5 years.

Bitcoin,Bit IRA or Bitcoin IRA?,"I'm trying to decide if I should roll over my 401k into either Bit IRA or Bitcoin IRA.

At least with putting it into an IRA with Bitcoin, I can avoid the Capital Gains Tax.

Service and Maintenance Costs: Bitcoin IRA charges an initial setup fee (varies based on how much you put in), transaction fee (2%), then monthly maintenance fee of $8 for every $1000 in your account ($10,000 = $80 per month). This fee over time is the biggest deterrent.

Bit IRA on the other hand charges a $50 setup fee + x-percent on your initial transfer then 5% on any transfer afterwards, 0.75% on transaction fees, and $0 on maintenance fees. $0.

Security: They both do cold storage but Bit IRA uses a nuclear bunker with guards for your wallets (holy shit...what is this? 28 Weeks Later?!)

personalfinance,Question about helping my parents refinance a home loan,"Hey r/personalfinance! Got myself a situation and could use some advice.

I (35M) was recently approached by my parents (67M, 67F) and asked if I could sign on as a co-borrower on an application to refinance their house with the goals of lowering their monthly payments and getting the interest rate under 5%. They are both recently retired and no longer get paychecks, but also have healthy pensions and enough savings in their 401ks to easily make house/bill payments. I, meanwhile, live across the state with my wife (34F) and we are currently renting, though we plan to save for the next 5-10 years and purchase a home of our own.

Their initial application was rejected due to my mom's retirement and remaining balance on the loan she took out to cover my sister's college education years ago. It looks like getting me to co-borrow would get their application approved, and while I'm tempted to help them out, I don't know what effect this could have on my wife and I's ability to buy a place of our own down the line. There have been some talks about us moving to my hometown and taking over ownership of that house in the future, but I don't want to bank on my parents willingly moving out.

So here are the questions I could use your help with: what could I expect to happen by becoming a co-borrower with my parents? Will this have a big impact on my debt/income ratio and screw up my wife and I's homeownership aspirations down the line? Am I on the hook for the entirety of the remaining loan, or would my parents be able to remove me/refinance again without me once my sister's school loans are paid off? What benefits are there of me actually becoming a co-borrower with them?

Some relevant details:

* Parents' home is valued at $730k
* The remaining balance is \~$278k. They're paying $2k per month at an interest rate that is a smidge under 6%.
* My parents would continue to make all of the payments, and there's *very* little risk of them losing their ability to do so anytime soon.

personalfinance,Newbie questions on retirement/saving for a house,"Been reading a lot recently saving for retirement (honestly, the Millionaire Next Door was super interesting). But I’m left with a few questions, here’s where I am currently:

**Age:** 29, no dependents, single

**Current retirement savings:** about 72k split in a Roth IRA, 401k, and brokerage account

**Gross Salary:** 70,000

**Monthly savings:** 16% of salary into the 401k and going to up my employee stock purchase program (ESPP) contribution up to 15%. Roth IRA is already maxed out for the year.

**Recurring monthly expenses:** Just rent, utilities, food. Got super lucky with student loans being frozen so I paid off my car last year and now have enough saved to lump pay off my student loans too.

1. With my current savings strategy, I’d have about  $1000 a month left over (hopefully a little more as I cash out of my ESPP). As I now enter the point where I’d like to start saving for a house, but i**s my strategy too aggressive to make meaningful savings for a down payment for a house?** 
2. **Is there any place that I can store the extra money for a down payment that’ll give me a better return than a bank?** I have a high yield savings account, but even that’s got a low interest rate of 0.05%. I’d love the idea of  investing it into a general index fund, but is that too risky even if I don’t plan on buying for the next 2 or 3 years?
3. I’m curious, **is my strategy of waiting to see what Dept of Ed does regarding student loans a wise decision?** With the loans being 0% interest right now, it’s not costing me anything extra in letting them sit there. Should they come due, I just pay them off before things restart and avoid the interest. While I think it unlikely, I’d hate to pay them off just to watch some X amount be forgiven that I could’ve just saved for a house/retirement.",finance,1649375682.0

Normally in the UK, borrowers apply for a fixed rate &lt; 5 years, expecting the borrower will switch onto a comparable fixed rate &lt; 5 years (10 years would be very unusually long period to fix for), or a tracker tied within a % or two of the Bank of England base rate (the primary policy tool for setting interest rate policy in the UK). If the borrower isn’t on such terms, they’ll be charged the lender Standard Variable Rate - considerably higher than fixed or tracker rates, but allowing freedom to switch onto a better rate subject to affordability assessment

How does the US model tend to operate? I’ve come to understand it’s more long-term (20+yr) fixes, but posts I’ve seen recently seem to suggest that such fixed rates are affected by FED rate policy. Is that right, or have I missed something?

personalfinance,Need Advice on Fixed-Rate vs ARM Mortgage,"My wife and I are currently in the process of trying to buy our first home. It seems that the general consensus upon searching around is that ARM mortgages are not favorable and we should stick with a fixed-rate to lock in a steady payment without knowing how the future will change.

However, one of our local credit unions offers a new 15/15 ARM where there is only one potential interest rate change in year 16 that locks for the remainder of the loan term.

Their current 30 year fixed rate is listed as 5% whereas the 15/15 ARM is 4.75%. It’s a minimal change in interest but it also states that there is no PMI with just 10% down with this deal. With the price of houses we have been putting offers on (~300-350K), we have just over 10% to put down so this would eliminate PMI for us, which would otherwise probably last at least a few years before we could have enough equity to remove the PMI.

Would it be worth it to take this deal even with the risk of rate changing in year 16? 15 years seems like a long time where we could either move, refi, or have a potential market change for rates to go down or plateau. Any advice on this is greatly appreciated as this is our first time going through this and it almost seems too good to be true. 

TL;DR 5% 30 year fixed rate with PMI or 4.75% 15/15 ARM with no PMI? Putting ~10% down. Need Advice!",finance,1649385898.0
stocks,"Redfin bought RentPath for $608m in cash. Since then, Redfin has dropped 84%.","This is the definition of a bad deal. The strategy was sound. Redfin wanted to add rentals fast instead of building it from scratch. But the price and the way it paid for RentPath is the reason why I wouldn't invest in Redfin. They don't make good decisions.

Redfin purchased RentPath in an all-cash deal for $608m on Feb 19 when its stock price was $96, an all-time high.  Instead of trying to purchase RentPath with stocks or a combination of stock/cash, it did by using 1/3 of its total cash on hand. Redfin literally bought a real estate company with cash at the **exact peak** of the real estate stock bubble.

At $608m, it was 6% of Redfin's market cap on Feb 19.  Today, Redfin's stock price is $15.73 and has a market cap of 1.67B. This means the price paid for **RentPath is now 39% of Redfin's total market cap**.

RentPath was a company in bankruptcy.

Total insanity.

Now Redfin only has $750m in cash instead of $1.35b while they lost $100m in 2021. We're heading into a prolonged bear real estate market due to rising interest rates. I don't see how Redfin can invest in its tech and continue to grow in the foreseeable future. Layoffs are what I'm guessing or another round of fundraising which will dilute shareholder value.

personalfinance,Should I stay in my miserable job to realize equity gains?,"I'm an electrical engineer (not big-tech) and like my industry, the technology, and the work in general. We are working on truly ground breaking things and that feels fantastic.

But we are chronically short-staffed and have been since I started. We are growing rapidly and can barely hire people faster than they quit. All of this contributes to an insane workload and even higher level of stress.

I've only been here 2 years, but I swear I've aged 10. I've gained 50 pounds and have panic attacks in the shower before work. Frequent all nighters and weekends working have me genuinely afraid that I'm going to have a heart attack in my cubical one day and they're gonna have to haul me out on a stretcher.

Now the flip side of this is that I'm recognized as a strong performer and am now earning almost 40% more than when I started. As someone who spent his childhood in homeless shelters, this level of compensation is unreal to me. They've also given me a profits interest in the company that is expected to be worth $485k when our current private equity owners make their exit, which is anticipated to happen by 2024. Being somewhat pessimistic, I realize that it could also happen in 2034...

So the question is. Do I stay the 2+ years needed to cash-out big or do I jump ship for greener pastures?

personalfinance,Does it make sense to hold real state or to sell?,"Good morning :) 

My father passed away late last summer and left me and my three sisters a small amount of cash and two condos. Both condos are relatively small but very central and can be rented out quite nicely. We paid yesterday the inheritance tax we owed and both flats are now registered under our name. We each own 25% of each flat. He also left us a car and a few other assets leaving us with about 30k cash after the car is sold and inheritance tax is taken care of. We used some of the cash to paid whatever little credit card debt he had left, so what is left is ours. 

We now have a decision to make. Should we sell both flats, sell one and rent one or rent both?

Both flats are in need of pretty important renovations, nothing structural but one is over 50 years old and the other one is maybe 30, and since my dad was a pretty heavy smoker both flats stink and are covered in this yellow nicotine grim. 

I have had some contractors look over the flats and they are budgeting around 40K per flat. They will bring a little over 1K each on rent each month if we rent long term, or more if we do short term / airb&amp;b type of a deal. We live on a very touristy island in Spain.

We have all stable jobs and income but no one has 80k cash to put down. I do have that amount of money but some of it is invested and some of it is a cash reserve I have to put down on a house I want to buy this year. 

We can either get a loan against one of the flats and restore both with that and pay it over 30 years or use a credit line we can get over my moms business (Very cheap, 1.7% per year) and fix both flats and use all the rent income to pay the credit line down aggressively. We would leave those 30K in the bank, If both flats are rent, and the renters are straight and we are getting the rent on time, we would use most of it to cancel about 30% of the debt. If the flats arent rent out quick, we would have enough money to cover the credit line and other expenses for a few years at least.  

Each flat would bring about 1200 euros a month, about 50 would cover HOA, power and water renters need to cover, insurance is about 200 a year,  so around 11360 per flat / per year.  A little more actually because the interest rate from a credit used to restore rental property is tax deductible. We would use that money to pay the credit line down aggressively, so we would be set in 4 years and some change, if we dont touch the money on the bank. 

The alternative is to sell one or both flats for around 250 each. 

We dont really need the cash and we are thinking about the rental, but I dont know if it makes sense.

We also think maybe we could go the other way, and once both flats are rent and some of the credit line is paid, maybe use the money left on the bank as a down payment for a third rental place and use the rent money to cover the mortgage every month, if we  are short, we can all easily afford a few 100 bucks a month to cover that. 

I guess its also important to add that we are a very tight family and we have always done everything as a team, so I have 100% trust on the girls, and they on me. 

Sell, rent, or go full Trump and buy a new flat?",finance,1649400381.0

personalfinance,Will paying off my student loans effect me buying a home?,"Hello there,

So I am a bit lost here:

I have $7895 in student loans (deferred until August per the fed government). They have a 4.5% interest rate and a $93 a month payment. I am able to easily pay this without issue.

I was considering just attacking this debt and could probably get rid of it before August and just wipe out the principal since no interest to worry about.

With that said, many have told me not to do this because of my desire to purchase a home within the next 12-18 months.

My credit score is 786 and I was told it would hurt my score.

Can someone please point me in the right direction?

My rent originally was $2200 a month - moving home for a year to save even more money. I cannot imagine what rent prices will be at that time when a year is up so a purchase sounds like the best option. I have a very robust 3 months emergency fund that would cover all my bills and lifestyle if I lost my job.

Thanks all",finance,1649412819.0

personalfinance,How to go about buying a home in today's market?,"Context:  Me and my wife are both finishing school this Summer. I've also been working for a multinational since the end of last year. Our combined income at this point is \~$120k, with the potential to go up to \~180k once spouse gets a full-time job.

personalfinance,(EU - LV) Paying down mortgage vs. investing,"Hello r/personalfinance!

I recently purchased an apartment for 255,000 Euro - 15% down payment, 1.79% interest rate over 12-month Euribor. This is a 30-year mortgage, and the monthly payments come to roughly 900 Euro. 

I recently got a promotion at work, and I'm wondering what the best approach is to manage the extra income. I could conceivably make extra payments on my mortgage, paying roughly 3,000 Euro a month and trying to pay off the mortgage in 10 years. Alternately, I could take the extra money and put it in an index fund. I can't seem to wrap my head around comparing the potential return from investment with the interest rate on the 30-year mortgage, and which would be a better long-term use for my surplus income.

stocks,"As inflation bites and America’s mood darkens, higher-income consumers are cutting back on spending too","https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/as-inflation-bites-higher-income-consumers-are-cutting-back-too.html

With as much as 60% of U.S. consumers living paycheck to paycheck, it’s not a surprise to see that the spending cutbacks have started. Even with a strong job market and wage gains, as well as Covid stimulus savings, pricing spikes in core spending categories including food, gas and shelter are leading more Americans to mind their pocketbooks closely. A new survey from CNBC and Momentive finds rising concerns about inflation and the risk of recession, and Americans saying not only have they’ve started buying less but will be buying less across more categories if inflation persists. But these financial stress points are not limited to lower income consumers. The survey finds American with incomes of at least $100,000 saying they’ve cut back on spending, or may soon do so, in numbers that are not far off the decisions being made by lower income groups. The high-income consumer demographic is key to the economy. While it represents only one-third of consumers, it is responsible for up to three-quarters of the spending. As Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s notes, “If the high income consumers are out buying, we won’t see a big impact on raw consumer activity.”


Lower-income households are the most at risk, and they are the ones most likely to be making unwelcome tradeoffs to make their money stretch as far as it did just a few months ago, according to the survey results. They are also clearly experiencing more financially anxiety, according to the survey, with 57% of Americans with income under $50,000 saying they are under more stress than a year ago, versus 45% of those with incomes of $100,000 or more. The 68% of high-income consumers who said they are worried higher prices will force them to rethink financial decisions is significantly lower than the 82% of Americans with income of $50,000 or less who told the survey this, but it is still a majority. More than half of people with household incomes under $50,000 say they have already cut back on multiple expenses due to prices, and for those with income of at least $100,000, the cutback levels are already similar when it comes to dining out, taking vacations, and buying a car. “People making six-figure incomes are almost as worried about inflation as people making half as much—and they are just as likely to be taking steps to mitigate its effect on their lives,” said Laura Wronski, senior manager of research science at Momentive. “Inflation is a problem that compounds over time, and even high-income individuals won’t be insulated from the second- and third-order effects of price increases,” she said.


Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators and surveys at The Conference Board, said there is still a gap in its confidence data between lower income and higher income consumers and a lot of that is driven by the inflationary environment, and less impact the affluent will feel from factors including gas prices. She said the gap does always narrow in a pre-recession period — but its data is not indicating a recession as of now. What its confidence survey is forecasting is a slowdown in growth over the next few quarters driven by higher prices, and more Americans spending less on discretionary items as more of their money goes to covering the basics. That will be most acutely felt by the lower-income consumers, but there is broad-based concern about prices rising significantly in the months ahead — 6 out of every 10 consumers surveyed by The Conference Board think the Russia-Ukraine war will cause prices to rise significantly. “That is very broad-based and that, coupled with interest rates going up, may make people more hesitant to postpone big-ticket purchases likes housing and autos and washing machines,” Franco said. “We will see a bit of slowing in consumer spending over the next few quarters, but we don’t feel that will drive us into recession.”",finance,1649428356.0

personalfinance,Help me with my situation of debt,"Well what can I say? Other than I did the big dummy with my finances. 

About a year ago I had no debt other than my school loans(14k) on a federal loan plan. I had a 98 Honda that I was taking care of and about 35k saved up in my bank account. Another 20k saved into my 401k. Another 5 grand in my personal trading account. I was living with my mom where my only finances were the water and sewer plus electric. Came out to about 300$ a month. All was gravy. My gf moved into my moms as we saved for our eventual home. At the time I was making 18$ an hour at the age of 26. My degree is in biology with a minor in chemistry. 

In October of 2020 we decided it was a good time to buy a house as we were able to purchase a home in a crazy market. House sold for 160k in 2017 and we paid 174k on a 2.2APR loan. Not a FHA. Just a traditional. I didn’t feel bad paying that much extra as the previous home owners put in a new ac/heat ductless system and nice windows. I figure they barely broke even. Plus the location was great and it was a well taken care of home where we could see ourselves living for quite some time. We put down 20k which left our monthly mortgage at 1200$ with escrow. 

Unfortunately I lost my job in December of 2020. Right after buying a used car for 10k. I mean I got fired really. I deserved it as I made a stupid mistake. Luckily I had some savings! January comes around and I messed up so bad, I turned my 20k into 100k from A stock in my 401k. I foolishly held too long and got scared and sold. Ended up losing 75 percent of my 401k and I now only have 5k and a bunch of crappy stocks I most likely will never recover from. This lead to some severe fomo and depression as I felt like a total loser. 

I basically lived off my savings and remedial cash jobs until I found something solid. This Jan I located a new job which pays me 33$ an hour and I actually really like it. 

Here are my current finances and debts

4,600$ on a 15month 0APR credit card. This is due in July now. 

2,400$ on my best buy credit card. I have free interest until October 2023

148,000 on 2.2APR on my home, 30 year mortgage. We’re trying to pay every two weeks to help pay our house off. 

I assume I’ll have to pay about 3-5k in IRS taxes this year. 

I take home 70k a year. My fiancé makes 75k a year. Our mortgage is 1200$ a month. She has parent plus loan which kills her at 650$ a month. 

Neither of us have car loans. I’m trying to sell my 98 Honda at the moment for extra cash. I have about 6k left in savings. Everything else went to updating our home during the last two years.

personalfinance,Is it unwise to leave a company when the salary is low but the benefits are good?,"I've been working in manufacturing for a big biotech company for 7 years. It's a very technical position for a super niche product and I've really grown into it. It's not my purpose in life, but I love the people I work with, I enjoy the work. My only real complaints are that my department has been understaffed for years while the work volume continues to climb and the salary has stagnated while the cost of living in my area is sky rocketing. Also for one month out of the year, it's so chaotic that everyone looks like they want to cry 24/7 but that's q4 in most big gigs I suppose.

I feel behind all of my peers in salary and it makes me feel a bit like a loser. I am still living with roommates at 33 as I pay down my student debt.  I am making 51K before a small bonus ( 5% inflation)  and overtime when necessary. They do match my 401k and offer stock options (more on that below) The promise for a raise has always been right over the horizon, ""as soon we assign new responsibilities.."" 

So I went out looking for something new and I found a position in a totally unrelated field that I have previous experience in as an Event Coordinator. I'd be working for a small but promising startup full of young, hungry people my own age. They are offering me 10K more, potential for bonuses, unlimited vacation (just not during the busy season), and a more flexible work day. I could work from home 25% of the time but most importantly, I'd be out of the cube, networking with people in the sunlight. It's been a long 7 years in the cube.

So I put in my notice, my exit interview is next week and as I'm tying up my loose ends I realize my company has given me over 4k shares of stock as part of my salary over the years. I can't tell if I'm reading it right but according to the website the value of my vested shares is over 104k. Now all of the sudden the shitty pay seems more reasonable. It seems like at this rate, in a few years I actually could afford a new place and maybe I'm just leaving a super sweet gig over 10k more a year. I also have amazing health insurance and I'm in a sublime work neighborhood I enjoy. The new gig does not have a 401k plan yet, only pays for half of my health insurance (about 3k a year for me) but the work culture is clearly more pleasant and enjoyable.

Well of course the reason was completely different back then.

I recently finished my tax declaration for 2021 and created an [overview](https://imgur.com/a/2MChvke) of my cashflow.

Current state:

* Started working at 29, so I am pretty late to the show
* Was saving cash during the first years for a down payment and started 2021 with 20000€ left in cash and around 30000€ in the pension fund which needs to stay untouched.
* Single, no kids, not relying on any other type of support
* Permanent work spot is safe with very high life &amp; work balance
* Mortgage for a duration of 29 years, first 10 years are fixed interest rate of 1,3%.
* Student loan paid off in 7 years with 0% interest rate.
* Contracts are setup and signed for 2022 &amp; 2023 already with same price range.
* Permanent income will increase by an average of 5% per year, contracts will not.
* Around 25000€ in cash now.

My goals are:

* Dropping contracts over the next years, if possible. 
* Buying a car in the 25000€ price range, this will add around 4200€ towards the ""Loans"" group for the next 5 years.
* Preparing for retirement in 10-15 years.

Questions:

* There is a decent chance that interest rates after 10 years will be far above 1,3% and this could double my paydown to 60000€. How could or should I prepare for this? 
* Is 10-15 years for retirement reasonable?
* At which point should I be able to drop the contracts? Once out, Ill not get in anymore. Looking at my yearly report now, they are the reason why I can invest around 20000€ per year.

personalfinance,Teacher(s) Looking for Financial Advice,"Looking for some feedback here regarding the best way forward for myself (36m) and my girlfriend (29F). The first question is about ***how we should be utilizing Roth IRAs***, and the second question is about ***investing some savings that we'd like to use for a home purchase in the future***. I don't come from a family that ever did any sort of financial planning, so everything I've done to date done is based completely on my own research/reading. Any input is appreciated, since my family basically doesn't know/doesn't really care about financial planning, and hers basically thinks a home purchase should be our immediate priority.

We both are public school teachers and have mandatory contributions (11%) to a defined benefit plan.   
I would be eligible for a max benefit (80% of the average of my highest 3 years of earnings) at age 56, she would be eligible at age 60. This is the primary source of our planned retirement income. I'm also making 403b contributions of 1k monthly, and maxing out a Roth IRA. ***My question is this: since my 403B is all Vanguard mutual and index funds, and 11% of my salary is going towards the defined benefit plan, does it make sense to be ultra aggressive in the Roth (i.e. stock picking)?***

Second question: we have some savings that we'd like to use to purchase a home in the future. We currently have a small condo (2BR, 900 sq ft) at a really low rate (2.9%), no PMI, and a very reasonable monthly housing cost of $2k. The condo is in an area with long term rental potential, and we'd like the option of keeping it when we ultimately move into a bigger space. With the significant rise in interest rates and the already expensive cost of housing, we think it would be best to wait four or five years mainly due to the fact that her salary will increase by \~46% in that time due to her salary schedule. ***My second question is: during the next 4-5 years, what should we do with our savings ($65k) that we want to use as a down payment in the future?*** Keeping it in a savings account or CDs seems too conservative, but she is very concerned about the potential of a significant loss if we were to invest it.

""'**Inflation shock**' worsening, 'rates shock' just beginning, 'recession shock' coming"", BofA chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a note to clients, adding that in this context, 

C**ash, volatility, commodities and crypto currencies could outperform bonds and stocks.**

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday signalled it will likely start culling assets from its $9 trillion balance sheet at its meeting in early May and will do so at nearly twice the pace it did in its previous ""quantitative tightening"" exercise as it confronts inflation running at a four-decade high.

**A large majority of investors also expect the central bank to hike its key interest rate by 50 basis point**.

In terms of notable weekly flows, BofA said emerging market equity funds enjoyed the biggest inflow in ten weeks at $5.3 billion in the week to Wednesday while emerging market debt vehicles attracted $2.2 billion, their best week since September.

It was also an eight week of outflows for European equities at $1.6 billion while U.S. stocks enjoyed their second week of inflows, adding $1.5 billion in the week to Wednesday.

The analysis was based on EPFR data.

Bitcoin,"I figured the Final True End Answer in all Economics, We need to Stop Pricing in $Dollars!!","Hi all,

I figured the true last answer to all economics/finance and the end game final result answer. That is prices in $Dollars.

We seem to forgotten the basic economic rule 101 and that is supply and demand.

Think about it..... whether hyper inflation or deflation or whatever, as long the stuff you buy is priced in $dollars there will always be a demand for $dollars to buy the stuff priced in $ and that's including Bitcoin too!!

When there's demand for something it will never die off no matter how hyperinflated it is. The Fed knows this and will always use the money printer cause they know the $dollar will lose 99% of its value but the remaining 1% is kept alive just by demand. Hyper inflation doesn't affect the rich so the Fed wont give a sht on Hyperinflation.

We need to start pricing stuff in Sats now so people will come off the $dollar and from there we don't need to sell our Bitcoins for hyperinflated $dollars and instead use our Bitcoins directly to buy stuff via the Lightning Network. Whether its buying a coffee or a House or a Lambo it needs to be priced in Sats.

1 Bitcoin = 100 Million Sats so its not impossible and its scalable. Satoshi designed bitcoin to be a currency hence 100 million Sats per 1 Btc.

Bitcoin is not a Asset, its a currency. If it was Asset then there would be 21 million bitcoins only that is each btc not divisible each by 100 million sats only 1 btc unit, thats it!

Ask yourself why satoshi programmed each btc to be divisible by 100 million Sats?

For example a Lamborghini is a Asset, a house is a asset, Ask yourself how many total houses or lambos there is now in the world?

By its nature the word asset means scarce, less liquid, less velocity. Currency is the opposite.

Ask yourself does 21million x 100 million sats sound scarce to you?

Think everyone...",cryptocurrency,1649442529.0

After doing more research I will need a loan for 27k a year for two years between tuition and room and board

Okay I need some advice for paying for college. I'll get straight to it.

My parents are not putting a penny towards my college, so just keep that in mind when giving advice but they are willing to co-sign on loans for me. Neither of my parents went to college traditionally (both through the army) so are not experienced or particularly knowledgeable on how this works. 

So I am graduating high school with both my diploma and an associates degree and am transferring to a University where my yearly estimated expenses is $36k per year, this is including my 15k per year scholarship.

I qualify for $5,500 Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans per year and $2.7k in work study/student employment. Which would leave $28.5k per year left to find loans for.


Now that 28.5k includes all predicted college expenses tuition and fees, housing and meals, books and supplies, transportation, and 2k for predicted educational and personal expenses. This is put together by the college. 

I do plan to work while in school but I am unsure of how much I should plan on spending, like should I realistically plan to be able to afford room and board from working (10k a year)? I will have 6k in savings by the time I enter college but I'm wanting to keep at least some of that in savings as an emergency fund.

Okay I think that's enough information for some basic advise but my main questions are. How do I do about securing a private loan? Do I take it out yearly or all that I will need for the two years at once? How do I determine how  much I will actually need? Any general advice?

Ive tried looking up and researching this but haven't gotten far. Any advice is appreciated as this is quite overwhelming lol. Also for curiosities sake I am getting a degree in Finance and plan to go on to get a graduates degree at some point afterwards.",finance,1649447844.0
personalfinance,"Switched jobs, went from getting a good tax return to owing taxes. Am I missing something? (California)","I work in California and am in the process of filing my taxes. I switched jobs halfway through 2021. After putting in in my 1st W2 on TurboTax, I was supposed to get federal and state tax return. After putting in my second W2, all of a sudden I owe federal taxes and my state refund went down drastically. However, if I put my second W2 by itself, I get a large refund for both federal and state. Am I missing something? I'll put the approximate wage values below along with the estimated return if I put each W2 by itself:

First W2
Approx Wages: $65,000
Federal Return: $1,000
State Return: $1,400

Second W2
Approx Wages: $23,000
Federal Return: $2,400

W2s Together
Federal Return: OWE ($650)
State Return: $750

I had my allowances set to only one state allowance on my W4, and zero allowances for federal, so I would expect to have a refund for both. 
Also, if I put the full values into H&amp;R block as one W2 instead of two, I get back a $3900 federal refund. Idk what I am messing up on Turbo Tax, or if there is something I am missing.

I’m currently 20, and when I was 18 she put a lease for a house in my name, (bc her credit was too bad and wanting to help my family, I agreed), but she ended up moving accross the country in the middle without giving the owners the key or anything, so now I have a FED (eviction) claim on my renters history, as I apparently was taken to court (without my knowledge) by the owners for not paying rent and refusing to leave. Was living at college all while this happened with no idea. 

On top of maxing out my credit card, getting my bank account shut down for fraudulent checks, she also left me with thousands of dollars overdue in utilities. As a result of this, i’m currently in a position where everything has to be in my bf’s name because I can’t get accepted for anything, we even tried to get me listed as a roommate on the lease for our apt and they denied us. No matter how much I explain the debt isn’t mine it doesn’t matter. 

What can I do? My mom still takes care of my child siblings, &amp; ik it’d harm them/her ability to take care of them if she got charged or went to jail. How can I report this/help my credit without getting her charged? 

If it weren’t for my siblings i’d have no problem giving up her name, but my youngest sibling is literally 6.

# **Big banks’ earnings and a hot inflation report could sway markets in short holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/big-banks-earnings-and-a-hot-inflation-report-could-sway-markets-in-short-holiday-week.html)**
*****
&gt; Markets face what could be a hot inflation report in the week ahead and a batch of big bank earnings to start the earnings season.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock kick off the financial industry’s first-quarter earnings releases Wednesday, with Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs reporting Thursday.
*****
&gt; The war in Ukraine will remain a focus, as investors look for any signs of change in the crisis.
*****
&gt; Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said the first-quarter earnings reports from the financial sector will be important to a market considering the impact of the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates and aggressively tighten policy.
*****
&gt; “We want to get a picture of how do they see the Fed’s plan... quantitative tightening, the liquidity drain, coupled with higher rates, affecting their clients and their business units,” said Krosby. “If you look at the XLF [Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF], on days it goes up, it’s the insurance companies because they’re raising premiums. Higher rates are good for banks, until, the belief is, the higher rates are going to hurt the economy.”
*****
&gt; For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3%, but the interest rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite was down 3.9% and the S&amp;P 500 was off 1.3%. For a third week in a month, the jump in the 10-year Treasury yield topped 30 basis points, according to Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher. A basis point equals 0.01%.
*****
&gt; The 10-year rose above 2.7% on Friday.
*****
&gt; “It’s been on jet fuel,” said Schumacher. He said the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, got a boost in the past week from the Fed’s signal that it is planning to trim its balance sheet by $95 billion a month, of which about $60 billion will be in Treasurys.
*****
&gt; The 10-year is important as a benchmark and also because it is a rate that affects mortgages and other loans.
*****
&gt; “People are saying the balance sheet is going to cause the 10s to move quite a bit,” said Schumacher. He said he could not rule out a move in the yield to 3%, given the speed at which the yield has moved recently.
*****
&gt; Economic data in the coming week could be a catalyst for another move higher.
*****
&gt; The four-day holiday week is packed with economic reports. Some will be released on the Good Friday market holiday. The highlight is Tuesday’s report of March’s consumer price index, which is expected to top the 7.9% reported for February.
*****
&gt; “It’s big. It’s the last key data point before the Fed meets May 3,” said Schumacher. A hot number, even in line with expectations, will encourage the market to expect a 50-basis-point hike, or a half percent, from the Fed at that meeting. The Fed began its rate hiking cycle in March with a quarter-point increase.
*****
&gt; The producer price index is set for release on Wednesday. Data on retail sales and consumer sentiment are due Thursday. On the Friday market holiday, Empire state manufacturing and industrial production are released.
*****
&gt; Barclays economists expect CPI rose 1.24% in March, gaining a stunning 8.5% year-over-year, the highest in 40 years. “We expect the annual rate of CPI to peak in March and move lower thereon, aided by positive base effects,” the economists wrote.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures deflator is released April 29, but CPI and PPI will both set the tone for that report.
*****
&gt; “We’ve had such a sharp move in yields. Sentiment is so dour in rates, I wouldn’t be surprised if we got a relief rally in rates after we see the March CPI,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
&gt; “While inflation pressures are still going to be here, I think March would be the peak inflation rate on a rate of change basis... You could get some rotation [in stocks] next week if you get a bond bounce,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; Schumacher said the bond market will also be watching the Bank of Canada for an expected rate hike when it meets Wednesday, and the European Central Bank for comments on its bond purchases at its Thursday meeting.
*****
&gt; # Earnings season
According to Refinitiv, S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1% in the first quarter, but the financial sector is expected to see a decline of 22.9%.
*****
&gt; LPL’s Krosby expects to see choppy trading. “I think it’s going to be a difficult quarter,” she said. She said investors will be watching to see how the market absorbs a 50-basis-point hike. Quantitative tightening, balance sheet reductions known as QT, is also a policy tightening.
*****
&gt; “The QT could start next month. There’s a sense [the Fed] can’t wait any longer,” she said.
*****
&gt; Krosby said she recommends a defensive focus, favoring consumer staples, real estate investment trusts and health care, as well as consumer discretionary names that emphasize cost savings for consumers.

&gt; “I suspect at the end of next week, with the long weekend ahead, people will want to cut risk, but I suspect it could be a pretty rocky ride with CPI before we see that,” said Schumacher.

&gt; # Treasuries Yields Blow Past Dividend Yields

&gt; US Treasury yields have experienced a dramatic move higher as the market prices in continued rate hikes in the near future. With the increase in long-term Treasury yields, we're starting to see what looks like the end of a period where the S&amp;P 500 and the 10-year Treasury fought back and forth over which asset class had a more attractive yield.

&gt; As shown in the chart below, from 1970 right up to the period before the global financial crisis, the 10-year yield consistently yielded more than the S&amp;P 500. As the Fed cut rates to zero during the crisis, though, the S&amp;P 500 went on to see multiple periods where its dividend yield was in excess of the 10-year Treasury yield. With the recent surge in yields as the Fed embarks on what the market expects to be an aggressive rate hiking cycle, the script has been completely flipped. The 10-year now offers a roughly 125 bps higher yield than the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield which is the widest spread since the fall of 2018 and before that, the fall of 2011. As the spread between the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield and 10-year Treasury yield hits the low end of the GFC/post-GFC era, we would note that current levels are still roughly 200 bps higher than the historical average going back to 1970.

&gt; # Bulls Head for the Hills Once Again

&gt; After peaking at 32.8% two weeks ago, bullish sentiment continues to roll over as the S&amp;P 500 has erased some of the March gains this week. After this week's decline of 7.2 percentage points in bullish sentiment, less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. While low, that is still a few percentage points above the weaker levels from February.

&gt; ###### **([https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bulls.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment in turn rose 13.9 percentage points which was the biggest one-week uptick since August 2019 when it rose 24.14 percentage points. At 41.4%, bearish sentiment is now at the highest level since the week of March 17th. That is an elevated reading and a big move week over week, but it is also well off recent highs from the past few months that were more than 10 percentage points higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bears.png))**

&gt; The bull-bear spread tipped into positive territory for the first time in 2022 last week, but the big inverse moves between bulls and bears erased much of the past few weeks' move. The spread is down to -16.7 which is still 13.6 points above the late February low of -30.3.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; The big pickup in the number of respondents reporting as bearish didn't entirely come from the bullish camp. Neutral sentiment also shed a significant amount falling from 40.6% last week to 33.9%. That is essentially mean reversion as neutral sentiment now sits only a couple of points above the historical average.

&gt; # Near Record Low in Jobless Claims

&gt; This week's jobless claims release was significant in a couple of ways. For starters, the Department of Labor revised seasonal adjustment factors (more on that below) and second, the most recent print for the seasonally adjusted number hit one of the lowest levels on record. Claims came in at 166K which tied the number from two weeks ago (after revisions) for the second-lowest reading on record behind the week of 11/29/68. That week's reading was only 4K lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims, this week's reading was higher rising from 1.506 million to 1.523 million. Having come off last week's low, that remains one of the strongest levels since 1970.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; Pivoting back to initial claims, while adjusted claims are at multi-decade lows, non-seasonally adjusted claims are very healthy but not quite at a record. At current levels of 193.1K, the only year with a lower reading for the comparable week of the year was 1969 (170K) but at the seasonal lows in the few years prior to the pandemic, claims were even stronger than they are now. So while unadjusted claims are strong, the seasonally adjusted number was even more eyecatching this week.

&gt; As for why the seasonally adjusted number appears so much stronger, as shown in the second chart below, the current week of the year has historically been the second most consistent week of the year in seeing a week-over-week increase in claims. As a period with consistent seasonal headwinds, the seasonal adjustment would control for this by depressing the level of claims by a relatively strong seasonal factor. That usual increase was not seen this year as NSA claims were actually slightly lower falling from 196.8K to 193.1K. That means seasonal adjustment helped out what was already a strong number.

&gt; Additionally worth noting this week is the DOL changed its seasonal adjustment methodology. The DOL fully describes the change in this week's release and links to further reading on the topic for those interested in going deeper into the weeds, but to briefly summarize: periods when the level of an economic indicator experiences historic shifts in levels as claims did in 2020 and 2021, multiplicative adjustment (which has been used in ""normal times"" like prior to the pandemic and from here forward) would tend to over or understate adjusted claims. Additive adjustment, on the other hand, is less affected by the actual level of the indicator meaning it would lead to more accurate approximations of seasonally adjusted numbers in times of sudden spikes in the series. This methodology has been used throughout the pandemic period. Now that claims have more or less returned to a more normal range of readings, the DOL sees it justifiable to switch the seasonal adjustment methodology back to multiplicative. While that does not mean too much for interpreting claims, that change in methodology has led to some large downward revisions.

&gt; # 10 Things To Know About Inverted Yield Curves

&gt; One of the biggest stories over the past few weeks has been the inversion of various points on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The more well-known 2-year/10-year yield curve spread inverted on April 1, 2022 for the first time since 2019, while the 5-year/30-year inverted for the first time since 2006 on March 28.

&gt; What is a yield curve? The yield curve plots the yield of different maturity bonds, usually Treasuries. In normal times, a longer dated bond should have a higher yield than a shorter dated bond. Historically, after key parts of the yield curve invert, the economy eventually has moved into a recession. This is why these signals are quiet important.

&gt; Here are ten things to know about the yield curve.

&gt; * Yes, past recessions have been proceeded by an inverted yield curve, but by no means does it happen right away. Another way to put it is yield curve inversions have preceded all recessions, but not all inverted yield curves lead to a recession. Historically, when the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverts, a recession has taken place an average about 19 months later.

&gt; * What about stocks? “One of the bigger surprises for investors is that stocks historically have actually done quite well after previous inversions,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained another 29% on average and peaked nearly 17 months later after the previous four inversions.” The bottom line is a yield curve inversion is a warning sign, but by no means does that mean trouble is coming immediately.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * In the LPL Research Chart of the Day (shown below), here is how the S&amp;P 500 has done after all the 2-year/10-year inversions going back to the mid-1960s. Once again, some of the more recent performance has been quite impressive.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-3-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * One thing investors seem to be ignoring lately though is the short-end of the curve. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) came out recently saying as much in Don’t Fear the Yield Curve. They concluded that the 2-year/10-year yield curve wasn’t a good indicator for recessions; instead the near-term spread between the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has been much better. Take note that the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has steepened significantly the past few months, reducing the chances of a recession. Speaking of the Fed, Chairman Powell said last month that the economy was on firm footing and would be able to withstand rate hikes. In other words, the Fed isn’t worried about a recession quite yet.

&gt; * Along these lines, the 3-month/10-year yield curve recently was at its steepest level in 5 years! This has been our personal favorite part of the yield curve to use as a signal for a pending recession (as the 2-year/10-year has given false signals before) and if and until this curve inverts, we believe the odds of a recession on the horizon is limited.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * Yield curves are one part of the bond market, but what the credit markets are saying is another (think of them as bond investors take on financial conditions) and we see a much different opinion here. Lately, high yield bonds have outperformed Treasuries ( Bloomberg US Corporate High Yield index and the Bloomberg US Treasury index), a clue the credit markets weren’t very worried about economic growth going forward. In the past, trouble starts brewing when high yield underperforms Treasuries.

&gt; * Adding to this, spreads on high yield and investment grade corporates have both come back significantly the past few weeks. “To see credit markets showing major signs of improvement the past few weeks is a great sign that financial conditions are probably better than most think,” explained Detrick. “Yes, the yield curve is flashing some warnings, but overall the credit markets are saying don’t get overly worried just yet.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-5-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * Real rates (rates adjusted for inflation) are negative. With the 10-year breakeven rate, what the bond market thinks inflation will average over the next 10 years, currently near 2.8% and the 10-year Treasury yield currently near 2.5%, real yields are actually negative. Historically, negative real rates have been quite bullish for risk assets. The Roaring 1920s, then during the 1940s and 1950s, were the last time we saw an extended period of negative real rates. As history told us, those decades saw explosive growth and stock market gains.

&gt; * Real yield curves (adjusted for inflation) are still upwardly sloping. Take note, we’ve seen real yields invert ahead of recessions in the past along with nominal yield curves (2006 and 2019 most recently), yet another clue a recession might not be as close as some fear. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs noted that nominal curves tend to invert more easily in high inflation environments (we can check this box now), suggesting it would take a deeper inversion than recent cycles to trigger a recession signal.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-6-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * Lastly, the Fed owns nearly $9 trillion in bonds and 25% of the entire Treasury market. Who knows where yields would be if they didn’t own any, but most agree longer-term yields would likely be much higher. So maybe various yield curves wouldn’t be inverted or even that close to inverting? This concept is mere conjecture, but it is a note we’ve seen lately that is at least worth pointing out.

&gt; There is a lot to digest here and this isn’t an easy subject, but the bottom line is the takeaway isn’t as simple as an inverted yield curve means a recession is imminent.

&gt; # April’s Stellar Track Record

&gt; April has been nearly perfect with gains steadily building from the first trading day to the last with only the occasional and minor blip along the way. DJIA has been up 16 Aprils in a row with an average gain of 2.9%. S&amp;P 500 has been up 15 of the last 16 Aprils with an average gain of 3.1%

&gt; April is last month of the Best Six Months November-April and when we begin tracking our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal. But before the “Worst Months” arrive, April’s solid historical track record could keep the current rally intact.

&gt; April got off to its usual stellar start the first two trading days of the month, but some surprisingly hawkish remarks from the usually dovish Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard has stocks on the ropes today.

&gt; Barring any major escalation in Ukraine, we suspect the market to log additional gains in April as the Best Six Months come to a close and then move sideways during much of Q2 and Q3. Likely testing the lows before rallying in Q4 and into 2023.

&gt; Our “Best Six Months” switching strategy found in our annual Stock Trader’s Almanac which is basically the flipside of the old “sell in May and Go Away” adage. After decades of historical research, we discovered that most market gains occur during the months November through April. Investing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average between November 1st and April 30th each year and then switching into fixed income for the other six months has produced reliable returns with reduced risk since 1950.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming holiday-shortened trading week?

CryptoCurrency,Still hesitant to pull the trigger and commit USD to crypto,"First time buyer, still some confusion.   
I have always understood the legitimacy of crypto as a concept, but I had always seen it as more of a stock than anything else. Recently, a good friend brought me to a musician run DAO NFT/Crypto promo show. I can understand the value of having NFTs as like ""stock"" in the artist or a transferable permanent VIP ticket, etc. At this point, I'm thinking that crypto of some form is inevitably going to populate the mainstream global economy, and I don't want to be priced out 10-20 years down the road. And that's the kind of purchase I'd like to make: one where I buy and forget about it for 10-20 years.  


So far I'm leaning into ETH, mainly because a PoW transaction [consumes 1,173 kilowatt hours of electricity. That's the volume of energy that could ""power the typical American home for six weeks,""](https://fortune.com/2021/10/26/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-carbon-footprin/)   
and PoS doesn't scare me as some PoW maximalist may try.  This is as far as I have gotten. I have a Metamask wallet but that's it.   


It's hard to come up with questions specifically because I don't know what I don't know. So I'll just write how I think things work and I'll wait for corrections.  


Your Wallet Provider (which I am still trying to figure out the profit model for that) has access to a specified L1 blockchain, unless your wallet provider is also an Exchange like Coinbase. L2 chains, like Polygon or Loopring, are basically sub-exchanges that only trade specified assets programmed on the L1 framework. I think that this is what ""sharding"" is? Where the L1 main Blockchain has reduced traffic and total blocks by having these sub-ledgers manage in-layer transactions - kind of like how a bank would for the fed.  I like the idea of less gas because of this, but I don't feel like any of these L2 coins will survive 10+ years. Should I just buy ETH and call it a day? can I even get to L2s without having a L1 token?

Back in early 2021, I sold my car privately and bought a fully loaded subaru outback from a dealer. I put $4500 down and took a loan for the rest. Today, it is sitting at a balance of around 11.5k, my interest rate is 2.74% for 5 years, so I haven’t been rushing to pay it off. Unfortunate timing because a month later I successfully landed my new job, which gave me a similar car (awd compact suv), that I am allowed to use for personal reasons. I will for sure be at this job for the next years. I do not see myself going past the next 3-4 years, but who knows. 

The only reason why I really consider this is I also have $28000 in student loans to still pay off (4.65%). The person I sell it to would be willing to pay me the 18k I bought it for 1 year ago (this includes my sales tax). Im sure it is worth more now, considering I’ve only raised it from 92k to 105k miles, but I am willing to part with it breaking even. 

To me the transaction doesn’t seem worth it, if we are both paying sales/income tax on it. But I am wondering other people thoughts. If I do quit/lose this job, this would likely be the same vehicle I would purchase again, and I imagine in a few years interest rates wont be as low. 
Any thoughts are welcome, thanks!",finance,1649468629.0
personalfinance,Company didn't withhold federal taxes right,"So somehow my company wasn't properly withholding my taxes. Waiting to receive my signed form to figure out if it was my mistake or there's. After talking with a few coworkers i noticed I am not alone in this.


On all 3 of our W2, it shows that we are FIT: U

I asked and did some googling and it seems like S for single and M for Married are the typical answers for that spot. I'm not sure what U stands for, maybe Unknown or Undefined? Next to the U it has 0, which I am thinking is the number of allowances claimed.

Mine should show as M and 0 additional allowances I think. All of us that have the problem should be showing as M but we are all showing as U.


Just checking on the following -


1 what does the U mean?

2 am I correct in the 0 being additional allowances likely? Could it be exempt or something (would explain no taxes taken)

3 I filed and paid taxes under the assumption that I'm still on the hook for the taxes, is that right?

4 how to correct/prevent thus for next year?

5 possible ramifications/problems of this? Would I or my employer be in trouble for anything?


Many thanks

stocks,FAAN(M)G valuations by 'value investors'.,"Over the last couple years I got some good laughs at 'value' investors looking at the books of companies like GOOG/L and coming to a fair price that was often roughly 2/3rds of the current price, e.g. GOOG/L coming in at $2K when it was selling at $3K.

I'd scoff and mentally comment that I'm glad I didn't listen to this goofball back when I bought GOOG at $1500 - and they were saying to not pay a penny over $1K.

But as we enter a whole new world of an extended 'unfriendly Federal Reserve' - the likes of which we possibly haven't seen since the premiums on FAAN(M)G stocks were added...

Is it now time to give these goofballs a second listen?

personalfinance,"We have a downpayment saved up, but we are taking too big of a risk buying a home in our situation?","tl;dr We have a high household income, but have only saved the downpayment.  Is it too risky to buy a home with just the downpayment saved up?

I know we are very very fortunate to even be in the market to buy a home at the moment, I know alot of people are being priced out.  My partner and I plan on having our first child next year, as such we are about to go into the market to buy our first home.  We would love a detached home - those go for $1.2 million in my city, even the suburbs.  We currently have exactly $240k saved.  Medium household income for my city is $55k, housing prices are just crazy.

I started a small business 3 years ago.  In 2021 reported a net income of $170k, our business is growing about 150% each year, including the first quarter of this year.  We conservatively expect to make $300k in net income from the business in 2022.  We incorporated the business in late 2021, but for our mortgage application, the banks will only see the income as a sole proprietorship.  In addition to this, I have a day job as a manager for a financial institution where I make 90k a year.  My wife did not make any income in 2021, however, she just got her permanent residence card, so she couldn't work anyways.  When the business was incorporated she was given 50% ownership of the company, so for 2022 she will be reporting income, just nothing for the mortgage application.

We have a $5k a month tax payment for our taxes, and $850 for a lease on our car (both of which do not show up in our credit reports, and the lease is under the incorporated business' name), but we have no other debts.  We currently live with my parents, we contribute roughly 2k a month (rent, groceries, etc) which would go towards our own home when we move out.  

We plan on buying a $1.2-$1.3 million home, our total income for 2021 is $260k.  For 2022 it's expected to be $390k.  Mortgage payment for a loan of $1 million, is in the $4500 per month ballpark.  We had planned on buying a home in 3 months, but were told by friends and family to ""look now"" so that when 3 months comes, you'll be prepared.  I did a ""mortgage calculator"" online with HSBC, I just wanted some information, but then ended up making an appointment to be preapproved for a mortgage this weekend.

If we were to buy a home now in the next 2 months, I feel we would be using all our savings for the downpayment, and only have 20k left over in our account for emergencies, and that does make me uncomfortable given the large size of the mortgage and our tax payments.  I do feel some pressure to buy soon as interest rates will continue to go up.  If we were to buy a home, and only have 20k left over, given our large payment obligations, and growing income, is this a reasonable risk we can take?",finance,1649471810.0

personalfinance,Tried to cancel gym membership - now apparently in debt to them,"I'm from EU, currently on business visa in USA (Alabama) for a work project; all expenses, apartment rent, car rental, salary, etc paid by my employer from EU.Some time ago I joined a gym (big company), because they had a 1 month for 1 dollar deal and like $10/month fee or something like that. Signed up with my debit card, but never actually been to the place after signing up. Soon after that they tried to charge me ""annual fee"" of about $25 and of course random charge like that did not get through my card.

And yes, in contract there were annual fees specified to that amount, but I thought ""annual fees"" will be charged after a year, not week after. It doesn't matter now anyway.

I did not react to that at the time, assuming my account will just get cancelled and that was it. But no, I got more messages stating that I now owe about 40 dollars in that plus ""late fees"". At that point I wrote several emails to them explaining the situation and requesting to close my account. They replied that in order to close my account I have to provide proof of relocation in form of a recent mortgage agreement, apartment lease or something like that. I was honestly astounded by the fact that they request such documents just to close gym membership and did not reply further.Today I got a mail from debt collection company stating that I owe almost $140 to them.

I'm really baffled and fed up with this whole situation and was planning on just ignoring it, but what will happen if I do that? I don't have any assets here in US and will relocate to another state soon or might not even come back here at all depending on what project I get assigned to at work. What will happen with that? If I was ever to come to US again for work or travel, would that affect me in any way? Can someone come to the apartment I rent with my work colleagues and harass resident over this?

Thank you in advance for any replies.

edit:

I forgot to include it in the post, but there is note in the mail that I can contact debt collecting company if I think debt is not right in order to dispute it or otherwise they'll assume it is correct and mine. Should I reply to them describing the situation? I'm worried that if I reply it would mean acknowledging the debt or something, I honestly don't know.

personalfinance,Budget Advice - How much rent can I afford?,"Hi! For some context, I'm 24F living in Chicago and working in the Loop. I'll be moving in September and am trying to find an apartment without roommates. It seems like $1,300 is the bare minimum to get a livable studio or a cramped 1br in my neighborhood. I'd significantly prefer a 1br because I have a cat, but I would need to push my rental budget out to $1,500 to find something that isn't incredibly run down and even if I can afford it I'm not sure if I want to pay that much for an apartment.

I want to stay around here as I can easily take public transit to work. My transit pass comes out of my pre-tax income, and I also have a 401k match that I'm taking advantage of so my income already has those taken out.

The scenario I'm proposing is below:

Income - $3,300

Rent - $1,300

Utilities - $110

Groceries - $400

Cat - $60

Jiu Jitsu - $175 (currently out due to an injury)

Private Student Loans - $220

Federal Student Loans - $200? (30k debt, but I graduated in 2020 and haven't made a payment)

Fun money - $400

Savings - the remainder, split 50/50 between long term and short term ($435 in this scenario)

Debts - 45k student loans (15k private, 30k federal), $1,000 medical debt that I'm working to dispute with my insurance company.

Current Savings - $1,300

Some details - I do have a car, though I am not including the insurance in this as I plan to sell it. It's doubtful I'll get more that $1,000 for it, and I plan to put that all into long term savings/an emergency fund. Until student loans are restarted, my federal payment will go to savings. Also, my short term savings will be used to save up for fun stuff such as trips/large purchases once I get a safety net built up.

The numbers all seem to work out. It kinda fits the 50/30/20 rule. That being said, I'm really stressed about the concept of paying that much rent. I'm paying $1,000 now and that's the most I've ever payed by a large margin. I'm also making more money than I've ever made, and I can't live in college apartments forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I'm feeling a bit house poor, and concerned that I'm not able to save enough money for future repairs/expenses on the house, as well as save for retirement.  When I bought the house in December 2018 I thought I had the numbers worked out and calculated that this was a good time but now I'm not so sure four years later.

Some numbers--as a full time teacher in upstate NY, my contract for this year is $57k base, and I do extra tutoring four days a week that gets me another $2-3k.  I'm guaranteed 4% raises on the base contract for the next four years, but the tutoring is not guaranteed.  I'm not in a high COL area.  My mortgage/insurance/taxes payment is $1065 per month.  I refinanced when interest rates went down, so I'm finishing my first year of a 20 year, 2.75% fixed mortgage.  Have $114k to pay on the house.

I spent about $16k in the first year and a half fixing a couple of things I didn't plan on doing so early (retaining wall, deck), and this had me jittery the first couple of years as I blew through savings.  I've only recently got them back to about $20k.  Luckily, nothing is really wrong with the house, though I could see the furnace being the next thing to die within the next five years. 

 I live alone in the house, it was built in the 70s so  the rooms aren't exactly big.  I have no dependents or kids to worry about.  My only other debt is my car, and have $10k on that to pay off to my family, who I bought it from.  I have retirement/pension through NYS and a separate 403b I set up, but I have made zero contributions to both since I bought the house.  The 403b is at about $22k right now.  After expenses, I can save about $830 a month.

I picked one based on the recommendations of multiple friends and checked the proposal with another person who works as a corporate accountant... 

So before I file my taxes, I want to know if it's possible to check to see if this office did everything right. I have a few reasons for being skeptical that they were thorough. 

1) I stopped doing consulting almost completely about 2/3 through the year and took another full time job, which I told them about but they did not retain this information at all. 

2) I will owe federal taxes despite paying all his estimated payments (and more). The estimates are obviously wrong — if I'd kept working for myself I would have earned a lot more and therefore owed a lot more in taxes. So I'm very suspect of attention to my situation and detail. 

3) They did a crap job reconciling my accounts or collecting any information from QuickBooks even though my subscription is through them, they have all the access needed, and I diligently recorded everything quickly in the software. 

4) Even after I told him and emailed him the amounts of my tax payments for the year (which were on QuickBooks), we had a meeting two days later and he had none of that information, therefore his estimate on what I owe was inaccurate, and he suggested that I put almost more than I earned into 401k to reduce my tax burden (based on bad information, since he didn't listen to my information anyway).

5) His estimate on quarterly business taxes was only slightly higher than last year, even though I was no longer working for myself and if I had been, they were obviously much too low. 

Am I being unreasonable? Is there a good way to check that they actually did include my business expenses properly and I'm paying what is appropriate in taxes but not more? I appreciate any advice.

Yes, REIT’s have risk of being illiquid and losing value depending on if it’s publicly traded or not. However bonds also have risk with interest rate swings and are likely even more illiquid. 

Also bonds return 2-3% while REIT’s return 5-6%. And yes there are REIT’s with considerably high fees but you must do your research first. Also you can diversify with REIT’s just like stocks or bonds.

We have a total of 50,000 saved up for a down payment for a theoretical house. My contribution is 15,000, but since we can’t get a mortgage now anyway, I want to use it to pay my debt down. I’m thinking paying off my car loan this month, which will free up about 350 a month, which I will then put (together with what I would be paying monthly for my federal loans) toward the private loan and pay that down to less than 20,100. I estimate this will take until November (unless federal student loan repayments have to resume in August). If I pay off my car loan, I can renegotiate my insurance to a higher deductible and save money there too.

I also save between 10-20% of my take-home pay, which I will use toward these goals. I currently have 3-month savings for the both of us in the bank, just in case we both lose our jobs at the same time. I feel safe with this amount since I am an ICU nurse and husband works in IT, so we have flexibility even in tough labor markets.  I don’t want to touch this at all, since I am sure we’ll have unforeseen expenses in the eventual homebuying process.

What am I missing? Can I be managing my debts better?

personalfinance,Fastest way to pay off student loans,"I'm going to be graduating from college soon and am running some projections for how to pay my student loans off the fastest. I'm sitting on loans from three different providers:

* Heartland ECSI ($9,500.00 @ 5.00%)
* Aidvantage ($27,163.61 @ 3.73%)
* Great Lakes ($80,553.00 @ 6.28%)

From what I've read, it sounds like the most efficient method would be to pay the minimum payment on all three providers and then dump as much money into the highest interest rate loan until it's gone. I've created a spreadsheet to estimate the results of this method and landed on paying everything off in 42 months with these constants:

* $3000 in total monthly payments
* $200 minimum payment (this number is pretty arbitrary, tried to high-ball it)

I am also considering refinancing my Parent PLUS loans with Great Lakes because 6.28% interest is ridiculous.

personalfinance,Some questions about paying estimated taxes as a first timer.,"So last year was my first year doing freelance/gig work. I only started in august and only made like 5k. I just paid my federal stuff for the year but this year since I expect to do it the whole year I will make somewhere around 12k total maybe a bit more maybe a bit less.

Since every month can be different how much I get paid would it be fine to just pay exactly what the tax burden is by doing this for each quarter.

Total earned for the quarter x 92.35% = Taxable Amount
Taxable amount x 15.3 = Exact quarter taxed owed.

If I did that could I just pay the exact amount to make sure my estimated taxes are not wrong or do I have to do exact payments. Because estimated how much I will actually make for the entire year is impossible for what I do. one month I could make 500 and the next I could make 1000. So if I could just pay the exact amount this would be a lot easier.

Second question since I will only be making around 12k for the entire year should I choose not to pay estimated and just do my annual taxes how bad would the penalty be as it might be worth not dealing with the headache if its not that bad?

Need advice as a 24 year old in Ontario, Canada

My parents never really did any investing. They believe in just saving and working, then retiring. I've just graduated from my Master's program with $40800 in debt ($38800 Federal loan maybe 2.75% interest?, 2000 Ontario loan 3.75% interest, Federal interest is frozen until March 2023). I've decided to pay off the Ontario portion so it's 0.

I currently have $40500 in savings, $4000 invested into basic ETFs, and some dividend stocks. I hope to invest about $1000 per month. I currently am enrolled in OMERs ($290.27 bi-weekly) and contributing to my CPP ($160.23 bi-weekly) that is already taken off my pay. 

My car is on its last legs pushing 290,000kms and I commute to work about 45 minutes away so a vehicle is a must. I've been looking at getting a Toyota as I can get a family discount from the dealers.

Do I pay off my osap? Do I invest more? Do i buy a car with cash and get it over with? Also if anyone can explain OMERs, I'd appreciate it... I know it's a great benefit but I honestly don't know)

MachineLearning,[R] Local Learning Matters: Rethinking Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning,"\#cvpr-2022

Happy to share our CVPR-2022 paper ""Local Learning Matters: Rethinking Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning""

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14213.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14213.pdf)

Code: [https://github.com/mmendiet/FedAlign](https://github.com/mmendiet/FedAlign)

Federated learning (FL) is a promising strategy for performing privacy-preserving, distributed learning with a network of clients (i.e., edge devices). However, the data distribution among clients is often non-IID in nature, making efficient optimization difficult. To alleviate this issue, many FL algorithms focus on mitigating the effects of data heterogeneity across clients by introducing a variety of proximal terms, some incurring considerable compute and/or memory overheads, to restrain local updates with respect to the global model. Instead, we consider rethinking solutions to data heterogeneity in FL with a focus on local learning generality rather than proximal restriction. To this end, we first present a systematic study informed by second-order indicators to better understand algorithm effectiveness in FL. Interestingly, we find that standard regularization methods are surprisingly strong performers in mitigating data heterogeneity effects. Based on our findings, we further propose a simple and effective method, FedAlign, to overcome data heterogeneity and the pitfalls of previous methods. FedAlign achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art FL methods across a variety of settings while minimizing computation and memory overhead.",technology,1649539549.0

For context, we have a realtor and lender who have obvious gains to make from our purchase, and the only other help I have is parents who bought a house 36 years ago for $25k.

Me: annual income $100k pre tax, I usually get a 5-8% raise a year if not promoted
-30k student loans
-5k car payment debt
-30k savings

Him: 75k income, active duty military retiring 2023.
-15k various debt (boat, credit card)

Housing situation:
- I bought a dilapidated home 5 years ago from a family member for $50k, paid it off and invested another 75k into fixing it. Lived in it for years, now rent to a close friend (too) cheap ($750/mo). They are leased through 6/2023.

- He owns his home, pays $1300/mo. I live here now and pay for food and most utilities. 

Our long-term dream is waterfront. We live in a town that fulfills all the horrible market stereotypes; properties up 50% YoY, bidding wars $150k over asking….

We’re preapproved at $400k, $550 if he sells his house. 

With the rise in interest rates, it feels like a pretty bad time to buy. I’d originally set a budget at $300k with interest rates at 3.5% which would be a cost that wouldn’t impact our lifestyle. He is becoming obsessed because he’s worried his post-retirement income won’t yield such a strong preapproval.

He is now looking at homes $350-420 and our monthly is inching towards $3k/mo.

economy,Why is the Federal Reserve raising rates before it raises the reserve ratio?,"I only took a few economics courses in college, however, why is the Federal Reserve raising rates before raising the reserve ratio?  Doesn't a reserve ratio of 0% suggest that the money multiplier is infinite?  Aren't the banks just printing money as they please?  The current Federal Funds rate is 0.25 percent.  And according to the Federal Reserve website, the Reserve Ratio has been 0% since 2020.  

How can Federal Reserve board members even appear to be 'hawkish?'

Furthermore, isn't it more efficient to pull back the balance sheet when the reserve ratio is not at 0%?  I mean what is the point of taking money out of the economy if the money multiplier is infinite?  Can someone explain this phenomenon?  I mean, the 3 month LIBOR rate is at around 0.99%, so how did it get there if the Federal Reserve's website clearly states a reserve ratio of 0%?

Is this just another LIBOR problem that will have to be dealt with?  What is happening?  

The only thing that I think can possibly be happening is that the money that is being multiplied is being multiplied at a rate slower than the rate that money is being taken out of the economy.  However inefficient, it is still possible if the banks hesitate to lend money against liabilities.

Context: My fiance is trying to do his taxes but doesn't have any real understanding of his 1099 B. His overall picture is that he did not work in 2021 for anyone. He got a 1099G for unemployment he received $11,415 and had 10% withheld for federal taxes $1,140. 

He worked for Intel 2018-2020 and left October 2020. In January 2021, he sold his stock he'd gotten as part of ESPP. This somehow triggered a 2021 w2 for him for $3524 from Intel. 

His ESPP was done via e-Trade and he has a mix of short and long term gains for 2021. According to e-Trade, he has the following Gains/Losses:

1. ESPP Long Term: Acquisition Cost - 4282, Adjusted cost basis - 5,111, Total proceeds - 6253, Gain/Loss - 1192, Adjusted Gain/Loss -  1143
2. ESPP Short Term: Acquisition Cost - 4380, Adjusted Cost Basis - 5153, Total proceeds - 6137, Gain/Loss - 1757, Adjusted Gain/Loss - 984
3. ESPP Short Term: Acquisition Cost - 3547, Adjusted Cost Basis - 5469, Total Proceeds - 4748, Gain/Loss - 1201, Adjusted Gain/Loss - (721)
4. RS Short Term: Acquisition Cost - 0, Adjusted Cost Basis - 758, Total Proceeds - 753, Gain/Loss - 753, Adjusted Gain/Loss - (5)

In total he had proceeds of $17,891, Gain/Loss of 5682, and Adjusted Gain/Loss of 1400. 

I don't fully understand how the ESPP works but I have been told that it's possible to be double-charged taxes on ESPP stocks when it comes time to sell because it triggers the w2 that you owe taxes on and the short/long term gains. I don't know how to clarify in FreeTaxUSA that he's been taxed already on the w2 portion of it. When I put the short and long term gains in along with the w2, despite his adjusted gains being on 1400, it cuts his tax refund in half from $1440 to $845. No way he owes $600 on a $1400 gain especially given that even with this he's in the lowest tax bracket for the year.

# The Future of Bitcoin as Part of a Nation’s Reserves

## Should nation states accumulate Bitcoin as part of its national reserves’ strategy, and should they make it legal tender?

 

[ Torn dollar bill exhibit at GIC office in Singapore, representing the epic strategic move made by Dr Goh Keng Swee to secure Singapore’s first gold reserves in 1968. Image credit: https:\/\/andlarry.com\/work\/gic-office-a-torn-dollar-bill-and-gold-for-singapore](https://preview.redd.it/yt44ona8ins81.jpg?width=1420&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=897fa4926b3b8a5e29f5a96d0bfa0ca0fd5dcbd9)

&amp;#x200B;

Singapore is one of the richest countries in the world, with a population of just 5 million, ranking 4th in the world in GDP per capita.

However, few people including Singaporeans know the story of how (and more importantly, why) Dr Goh Keng Swee, A.K.A. the Economic Architect of Singapore, built our reserves by circumventing a gold embargo by the US and purchasing gold directly from South Africa.

Picture this: a finance minister of a tiny newly formed sovereign state, going to the president of South Africa’s room, turning the volume of the TV up and striking a deal in secret behind the US’ back. (read more about it here: [https://jansenko.medium.com/glittering-gold-ac51d27b5cd6)](https://jansenko.medium.com/glittering-gold-ac51d27b5cd6))

He had identified that Singapore had to diversify its reserves, and that US treasury bills which were the bulk of Singapore’s reserves would be a huge risk to the economic stability of Singapore, and that gold was money in extremis. In other words, gold was the hardest money there was, and Singapore had to do what it had to do for its own self-interest, self-preservation, and growth, even if it would later upset the world’s largest superpower.

Sound familiar? If not, it will by the end of this article.

Dr Goh struck a deal and purchased 101,600 kg of gold at US$40 per ounce (about US$140 million).

At current prices, that same amount of gold would be worth about US$7 billion. About a 48X in USD terms. In a way, you could say Singapore was the original hard money hodler, and it paid off in unimaginable ways.

Physical gold today is still extremely hard money, but a better form of hard money has emerged in the form of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has many of the same properties of gold, but is more scarce, easier to store, can move around the world at the speed of light, and is much more difficult to create (mine).

I wrote an article about why Bitcoin is the hardest money in the world back in Oct 2020, and how monetary energy will continue to flow into Bitcoin. You can read it [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/monetary-energy-money-bitcoin-5d084a47832f).

# Bitcoin adoption as a key part of countries’ national reserves.

Before answering the question if countries should accumulate Bitcoin in its national reserves, we need to define the goals and objectives of a country’s national reserves.

1. Protect national currency and provide currency stability (protect against currency attacks)

2. Buffer against bad times

3. Endowment to finance current needs

The first goal is to protect against foreign interference and volatility of the currency market. In Singapore’s case, if another country or corporation were to attempt to attack Singapore’s currency by selling a huge amount of SGD at once, Singapore’s MAS will use its foreign reserves to buy back the SGD and maintain price stability. Without a strong reserve, currencies can be subject to attacks which will threaten the savings and livelihoods of everyone in the country.

The second goal is for economic resilience against market cycles and unforeseen downturns. A common trap for third-world and developing countries is that weak national reserves make them unable to handle economic recessions and hardships, which result in them having to borrow money from larger countries or the IMF and World Bank in order to prop up their economy and help the citizens survive. This could have happened to Singapore as well, had we not had strong reserves.

The third goal is related to financing the economic plans a country may have for growth, such as building infrastructure, attracting foreign direct investors, grants, and investments into local companies, etc.

# What would Goh Keng Swee do?

With the goals defined, let’s ask ourselves what Dr Goh would have done were he alive today, and the leader of a developing country.

## Protecting against currency attacks

A bulk of Singapore’s as well as majority of countries’ foreign reserves are held in USD and other tier 1 currencies. If a country is friendly to the US, the west and China, there shouldn’t be any issues defending the currency against attacks by using the foreign reserves to buy its own national currency if an attacker is selling aggressively. However, if for whatever reason, it chooses to go against someone like the US and the west, its foreign reserves could be held hostage and frozen, and it would not be able to use their currencies that it holds in foreign reserves to save its own currency.

Singapore has condemned the actions of Russia in Ukraine, but it doesn’t change the reality that the US has shown that it can weaponise the dollar, and it poses an unnecessary risk for any country to be holding too much USD, whether you’re a friend of the US or not.

What’s the alternative? If your answer is to hold RMB instead, then as a country, you would just be switching one jailer for another. So you’d find yourself with two remaining options, gold and Bitcoin.

Physical gold as mentioned is still hard money, or money in extremis, but will be hard to liquidate quickly for the purpose of buying back your national currency to defend against attacks. Paper gold trading requires access to traditional banking infrastructure, which may be blocked in the event of economic sanctions like what we see in Russia.

You now find yourself with only one remaining option, Bitcoin. No national or central party controls Bitcoin. It is the most open and fair economic and financial infrastructure known to man. Participants cannot be censored, blocked, or removed from the network. It can interface with the current traditional financial infrastructure, and stand-alone as a decentralised financial layer without any intermediary and outside of anyone’s control. It is also easy to liquidate and gets easier every day as more infrastructure is built around it.

If countries held Bitcoin as reserves, they could use it to back their national currencies and protect their currency. This can be done by selling some of their Bitcoin reserves for their own currency in the event of a currency attack.

As central banks start adoption their own digital currencies, it could even be possible to peg the value of their currencies in relation to another currency or basket of other CBDCs algorithmically and allow redemption of the currency in exchange for Bitcoin and vice versa. Any deviation from peg would allow triangular arbitrage between Bitcoin, the pegged price, and the trading price of the national currency to keep its peg. Fees can be earned by the central bank for currency redemption, which could form another revenue stream for the country.

## Buffering against bad times

The covid pandemic resulted in the US printing 80% of all US dollars in existence from Jan 2020 to Oct 2021. If a country holds primarily USD as its reserves, it is effectively putting the country’s economic security in the hands and at the whims of the US federal reserve. The ability for the country to afford what it needs in bad times could be threatened by the actions of the US Fed.

The only options are gold and Bitcoin, and in this case, both playing an equally important role. Gold has proven itself to be a reliable store of value for thousands of years, whereas Bitcoin is still largely correlated to the stock indices, which would perform negatively during bad times. Bitcoin is expected to eventually deviate from its strong correlation to the stock market once it hits a market cap closer to gold’s and is seen less as a high growth tech stock.

Countries should be planning decades ahead, and accumulating Bitcoin now for the purpose of tiding through bad times 20–30 years or even 100 years from now would be an extremely wise and prudent decision. This would be similar to Dr Goh’s decision to purchase gold to secure Singapore’s economic security not just for the immediate economic dangers but for generations. This would save them from needing to go to the IMF or World Bank in the future (where they would possibly or even probably be borrowing Bitcoin or CBDCs backed by Bitcoin).

## Financing economic plans

That brings us to the third goal, related to financing economic plans. Some estimates put Bitcoin at a future market cap of 100 trillion USD in the long term (100X from its current market cap of 1T). This is achievable if countries and corporations like Google and Apple start adopting and holding Bitcoin in their reserves. Whether or not it hits 100 trillion or falls short, the long-term growth would be extremely positive either way, and any country adopting Bitcoin today, such as El Salvador, would be looked back on 50 years from now as being as prophetic and wise as Dr Goh Keng Swee.

We may even see El Salvador as successful as Singapore within 1 generation and being the financial capital of South America. There are many parallels, such as getting rid of gang violence and corruption, and buying hard money assets (in their case Bitcoin) and attracting foreign direct investments by being a haven for crypto innovators and Bitcoiners all over the world. Like how Singapore went behind the US when purchasing gold from South Africa, El Salvador worked on their Bitcoin legal tender bill in secret, to the [great displeasure of the US](https://blockworks.co/us-house-bill-seeks-to-study-el-salvadors-careless-gamble-on-bitcoin/) and [IMF](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/imf-urges-el-salvador-to-scale-back-its-push-for-bitcoin-as-legal-tender#:~:text=Twitter-,IMF%20urges%20El%20Salvador%20to%20scale%20back,for%20Bitcoin%20as%20legal%20tender&amp;text=NEW%20YORK%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20The,unused%20funds%20to%20its%20treasury.).

Like Singapore’s founding fathers, Nayib Bukele and the leaders of El Salvador are looking out for their own people first, even if it means angering a superpower.

What about the volatility? Like Bitcoin, gold was (and still is depending on your benchmark) extremely volatile, seeing multiple drawdowns of 25%-55% since the 70s. Imagine if Singaporeans had been critical of Dr Goh’s move, calling it “reckless”, “careless”, “gambling with Singaporean’s money”? Where would Singapore be today?

# Bitcoin as legal tender

Moving forward, for the next 10 years, we’ll see countries fall into 3 categories.

1. Oppose or ban Bitcoin for fear of causing destabilisation of their national currency

2. Countries who treat Bitcoin the same way they treat gold. A store of value which their citizens can purchase and own, governed by the same laws that apply to gold, but short of being legal tender.

3. Countries that make Bitcoin fully legal tender. That means that Bitcoin must be accepted as payments (for taxes, debts and contracts). I.e. if a person chooses to pay with Bitcoin, the recipient has to accept the payment.

Countries who fall under category 1 will fall very far behind, as their citizens will have very little Bitcoin holdings compared to other countries, and the fiat currencies and national reserves of these nations will fail as other countries shift to the Bitcoin standard for their national currencies. Entire countries under this category may go bankrupt or see massive hyperinflation.

Most countries will fall under category 2 and issue their own CBDCs, buy Bitcoin as part of their reserves, but not make Bitcoin legal tender, at least in the short to medium term, or until the CBDCs themselves fail. Singapore will likely fall under this category as well.

Looking at the facts, as long as the CBDCs are backed by reserves, and a significant portion of the reserves are denominated in gold and Bitcoin, this could be the best of both worlds. Countries would argue that Bitcoin is not ready to be a unit of account given its volatility, and though it is hard money, it is not ready to be a currency yet (note that there’s a difference between money and currency). Making Bitcoin legal tender could see pushback domestically as well as internationally, and many developed countries will avoid shaking the geopolitical hornets’ nest at least for now until there is no other choice.

Countries who fall under the third category of making Bitcoin legal tender will largely be poorer third world or developing countries that have experienced currency failures in the past, are going through high or hyperinflation, have high dependence on remittance as a percentage of GDP and are reliant on USD for local transactions. The first countries who adopt Bitcoin as legal tender and accumulate Bitcoin in their reserves would see the highest growth rate in terms of GDP and GDP per capita than all other countries in the world, given a 20–50 year time-frame, and given that these policies are not retracted by future politicians. They would see currency and economic stability, influx of capital and talent, and growth of national reserves which will be used to build infrastructure and attract foreign direct investments from developed countries.

# Environmental impact

Some countries would argue that the environmental impact of acquiring Bitcoin would be too detrimental to the environment, due to the amount of energy required to mine and secure the Bitcoin network.

When countries frame the question as “how do we acquire Bitcoin without damaging the environment”, rather than the usual “should we buy Bitcoin given that it harms the environment?”, they would start to find creative ways to do so, that could even have positive spin-off effects on the environment, such as greater investments in clean energy production.

As Bitcoin’s price soars in the future, the economic incentive for countries to invest in clean energy technology and infrastructure would be even greater, and excess energy generated from these sources of clean power can be used to power the homes and cities of the citizens in that country.

Some unconfirmed reports indicate that the UAE’s sovereign wealth fund is investing in turbines in dams in other parts of the world to generate clean hydropower, that could be used to mine and acquire Bitcoin without any carbon emissions.

It would be unsurprising if countries like Singapore start investing in clean energy technology like [nuclear fusion technology](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/new-nuclear-energy-technologies-potential-much-safer-mti-2606196), or invest in hydro and [solar power overseas](https://newatlas.com/energy/sun-cable-australia-singapore-solar-undersea-powerlink/), and use surplus power generated to mine Bitcoin.

# What does this mean for you?

There will only be 21 million Bitcoins created. 19 million have already been mined. Out of that number, about 3 million coins have already been lost forever, meaning there are 16 million available coins in circulation. There are 40 million millionaires in the United States alone, meaning even if all 40 million of them wanted to own 1 Bitcoin, it would be mathematically impossible for all of them to own one. If Bitcoin were distributed equally to everyone in the world, each person would have 0.0026 BTC (about 100 USD today). Given that whales, long term holders and in the future, billionaires, institutions, and countries will be buying Bitcoin (because there’s really no other choice), how many units of BTC could the average person actually be able to hold? It would be closer to 0.00025 BTC (about 10 USD today).

There would be a shift sooner or later to Bitcoin playing a fundamental part in the future global economic order just based on there not being any other option. In many ways, we’re still early.

Whether you live in a country that will fall under categories 1, 2 or 3, you may want to secure your own personal Bitcoin denominated financial reserves. A simple way to do that given you have conviction in Bitcoin is to dollar cost average.

personalfinance,What student loan options do I have?,"I realise this is a subreddit with people with student loans but I'm looking to take up one.

Basic Background: I started an Msc. course and my parents had offered to pay for it. I'm currently about 1/4 way through with it. Last week, my parents came forward and let me know that they hadn't planned well for the course and won't be able to continue paying for it. This is 2 weeks to when the next module payment is due. If I wanted to defer, I was supposed to have done it 2 months before the start of the next one. I really don't want to defer but if it comes to that, I will. However, whether I defer or not, the module payment needs to be made. If I don't it becomes a debt with a monthly interest rate that will be in my name. I'm currently working but even if I were to give up 100% of my salary every month, it wouldn't come to even 1/4 of the fee for one module.

Part of the reason why I don't want to drop the course is because it aligns well with advancement in my field. 1. It has complemented so much of the little knowledge I got in my undergraduate degree. It's even helped land me a new job (starting next week). Now imagine if I tell them I'm not continuing with the course which formed part of the decision to hire me. 2. Completing it will broaden my career prospects. I work in a professional field which typically requires registration in whatever country you want to work in. However, there is an international registration body. Completing this course makes me eligible to be registered internationally by them. 3. I'd feel so wasted if I dropped it. I've already worked so hard this far. I've sacrificed my time and energy to make sure that all my assignments had a distinction grade. It'll just feel terrible if I let it go.

personalfinance,"Student loans, pay off aggressively?","Hi all, new to this sub. My husband (38m) and I (37f) were struggling/living on $40k while I was in nursing school for 4 years. We now have a combined income of $120k, no kids. No car payments, $1k in credit card debt, we rent ($1650/month) and would like to buy a home when the market comes down. We also have $60k in savings that my husband inherited from his late grandma  last year that we pretend isn’t there (the money, not the dead grandma). In the meantime, my nursing school loans are $37k and the scheduled payment is $126 whenever the govt starts processing federal loans again — currently scheduled 8/31/22. I’ve been putting about $1k-$1500 into savings per month. Should I try to pay off my loans aggressively or stick to a lower payment (ie $200/month) and keep pushing into savings? This is all new to us and i want to be smart about it. Thank you all so much!

personalfinance,Should I keep my financial advisor?,"I'm looking to buy a house and my financial advisor told me that I should pay my car loan before I even consider buying a house. Because of the rising home prices and interest rates I'm concern that I will not afford to buy a house if I wait. Though house prices goes high my salary didn't go high, I dont see a salary hike for me in the near future. Also I dont want to pay more than certain amount every month for mortgage. Considering all these things I feel like if I wait to pay off my car loan then I will loose opportunity to buy a house. My financial advisor follow Dave Ramsey. I agree with him if we are living in a normal housing market. Below is my argument for him.

I have a $15,000 car loan (1.99% APR)

House prices went up close to $75,000 - $100,000 for the last year in my area (Type of house that I'm looking) interest rate is now around 4.6%

As per my financial advisor, if I go ahead to pay my car loan, then I may payoff my $15,000 car loan (1.99% APR) but during this time house prices will go ahead let say $75,000 (4.6% APR) so while i'm eliminating $15,000 debt, I will be adding extra $75,000 in to my bucket. Which does not make any sense right?

I have enough money to put down for down payment and I have a good paying job. so that make no sense for my financial advisor to ask me to hold the home buying process in this market condition right? or Am I missing something here?

There is another important thing that my advisor missed to point out here. Rather than paying my car loan why don't I sell my car and buy a cheaper car (Yeah, I get that, car prices are higher these days, but I can still manage to buy a 10-15 year old car for lesser price)

I'm wondering should I keep my financial advisor or not. Let me know what you think.

Note: I dont have any other debt other than my car payment. and my car payment is $250 per month. I have a 6 figure income.

And I'm already pre-approved for a mortgage and my plan is to go for a mortgage for 35% of my take home income",finance,1649594051.0
CryptoCurrency,Washington is coming after stablecoins.,"""The Biden administration on Monday took the first significant step to impose banklike oversight on the cryptocurrency companies involved in the issuance of stablecoins, outlining a process that could shape the future of that digital money."" WSJ

So, the Treasury recommended to congress that the only ones who should be able to issue stablecoins, are banks. They also want the FED involved so they can ""write more-stringent risk-management standards for stablecoin companies"". 

""They asked Congress to pass legislation requiring stablecoin issuance to be limited to entities regulated like banks, which would subject their reserves to oversight from a federal banking agency.""

Big corporations are afraid of stables too, which is where the pressure is coming from:

""Administration officials say the coins may be used more broadly as a swift means of payment for consumers and businesses, putting them into competition with banks and card networks such as Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. ""

Some from the Washington camp think this is good for adoption:

“This is huge progress in the acceptance of stablecoins and provides a path for their adoption as fundamental infrastructure for financial and economic activity in the coming decade,” - Jeremy Allaire

I just see this as a way for the government to impose more control. Once they get their hands on stables, forget that nice APY we're all seeing, it'll be the same lame 1% the banks are giving us.

defi,What problems do you have with DeFi protocols?,"What’s up, crypto fan! We’re a team of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and we’re here to create first-class DeFi products that will solve all of your problems and earn you more money. Share your issues with us! We’ll work on the most popular ones.

\&gt;We also use DeFi protocols quite actively, so here’s the list of the problems we’ve faced:

1. You lose money as you seek to recoup the commission on depositing currency to the DeFi protocol and the actual APY turns out to be lower than expected. Then you have to pay commission again as you want to withdraw tokens.

2. Exchange rate differences. The native tokens of DeFi protocols you get cost cheaper when you want to make a reverse exchange. You not only lose money on depositing and withdrawing but also on the exchange rate.

3. You constantly have to search for new protocols. You need to look through many of them on DEX and pay commissions to deposit the token you just bought there. You also need to repeat the entire process if the APY drops. 

4. Restrictions on withdrawing. Some protocols don’t allow you to withdraw money immediately by freezing them. Personally, I would like to have an opportunity to withdraw my tokens at any moment to sell or transfer them without any losses.

5. Very few protocols can guarantee security. Some of them state that you invest at your own risk. If the blockchain gets hacked, who is going to pay for that? Commonly, the risk is entirely on the investor.

6. If you invest in a mining pool that only has 2 or 3 tokens you often lose a lot of money on variables. That’s why I prefer one-time staking.

\&gt;We want to solve the problems mentioned above by creating a DApp so that:

1. It will allow you to stake 1 token on any network that allows you to do so. There will be no need to search for new protocols or watch your APY. The system will find protocols or pools with high yield. As soon as there’s a drop in APY the tokens will be transferred to some other protocols or to a mining pool if the latter is safe enough.

2. It will pay for all of the temporary losses. We’ll have to create a progressive APY index to ensure that some amount of money is placed in stock. It means that originally the stablecoin APY is going to be 7-12%gradually increasing to 10-20%. The entire process depends largely on the network where the stablecion is placed. The interest rate will be higher for altcoins.

3. It will compensate for losses in the event of a hack at the expense of insurance and the money in stock.

4. There will be no hidden exchange rate difference.

5. The future versions may add new strategies to increase the interest rate.

CryptoCurrency,Defi 101 - Basic Protocols everyone should understand,"There seems to be a lack of understanding of Defi in this sub.

In an attempt to shift the narrative of just buying and holding, to buy , hold and use. I am going to attempt to give a quick DEFI 101 lesson.

What is Defi? It’s decentralized finance that happens on chain with use of smart contracts. Defi allows lending , swaps and collection of yields by providing liquidity. 

Dexes -  Decentralized exchanges where people can swap one token to another. You can also provide liquidity and obtain a certain yield. The yield is usually based on the current pool liquidity and the volume of swaps that happen. For every swap the dex takes a fee which is distributed to lp providers and sometimes stakers.  The fee distribution is different from dex to dex, but usually you collect fees in governance tokens. You can use governance tokens to participate in governance or just simply sell them. Some governance tokens are stakeable and allow users to collect a portion of the fees collected by the dex. Please read the docs because not every dex is the same and their tokenomics are not the same, despite most dexes being copy/pasta of uniswap.

Autocompounders - This is where you trust a third party with your liquidity pool token. This third party automatically sells your token for you and compounds your rewards into more liquidity pool tokens. They often times take a performance fee, and a deposit fee so please be sure to read the docs.

Lending protocols - These are protocols where you deposit a token and can take a borrow position in another token. Your borrow position is usually over collateralized. Why would you want to borrow? If you wanted to short a position, if you see an opportunity to arbitrage interest rates or if you simply wanted to leverage. Read the docs to understand how liquidation works and if there are other fees associated with the protocol.

Things to watch out for - You want to use a trusted dex. A dex that has been around for a while with a good history. Oracles!!! People talk about oracles but don’t really understand the use case, well dexes need oracles for price feeds to make sure there aren’t any arbitrage opportunities and that the price is correct. Immutable contracts , this is important because you don’t want the dex a dao or even a hacker to have the ability to change your contract and possibly withdraw your funds. Also you may want to check if these protocols have been audited by a trusted third party auditor. 

Things you can do to keep safe. Diversify your funds across chains, and across dexes. Keep your keys safe and use a hard-wallet if you need the extra security. 

I’m writing this because in my last post there seems to be a lot of people who don’t understand defi and in order for adoption to happen I think information needs to be broken down to something more digestible. If I'm missing anything please let me know down in the comments.

Personally I am very risk adverse, so I mostly farm stable-coins but  even with stable coins I can participate in defi and earn. I think crypto should be used and not just held. I think this is a disruptive technology that can change the way we bank and save. We have the ability to collect yield and be our own banks and the more people who understand this the quicker crypto will be adopted.  Not Financial Advice, Please DYOR.",cryptocurrency,1649605947.0

So I’ve been on the home market for a while and finally the dream home has come into the market that’s within budget and within specifications. However, I’m stuck in this awkward situation where they are unwilling to agree to a national lender and I will need to go through a local lender (apparently they’ve been burned by them a few too many times. I have no opinions since I’m a first time home buyer.) For me to buy this home, I need a preapproval letter from a local lender. 

Anyways, I contacted my local lender and he’s pushing the 5 year (4% interest)  and 7 year (4.5% interest) ARM hard over the 30 year (5.5% interest) fixed. He’s telling me that we can take the ARM with locked in rates for a few years then refinance to a lower interest rate after the 5 or 7 year period. I’m very skeptical, since I’m pretty sure banks done do anything that’s not in their self interest. 

I was hoping to get your guys take on this situation? 

The ARMs are quite incentivizing since they knock off up to $400 off the mortgage payment for the first few years, and will only make sense if I can refinance later. 

I might go to a local credit union later when they are open to see what their interest rates would be, but I’m not sure what they mean by local lender (im just assuming local bank, but my real estate agent just gave me a number to call)

Thanks!

TLDR: 5 ARM (4% interest rate), 7 ARM (4.5% interest rate), 30 fix (5.5% interest rate). Need local lender. Do I take ARM and refinance later or do I eat the 30 year 5.5% and potentially refinance later?",finance,1649614094.0

economy,Lessons of the Pandemic,"What's the ***principal*** Lesson of the ongoing pandemic ?

We must draw lessons from the current pandemic if we must deserve to be reckoned sensible.

From the communist perspective, the principal lesson humanity must draw from this pandemic is the human individual is an ***insignificant*** entity — so much so that the individual is unable to survive without direct aid &amp; assistance from society. This calls for doing away with private property and matrimony, the two **Barbarian** evils that are to blame for the division of society not only into classes but also into units called families based on one or two individuals' capacity (property). 

Private property brought about the division of society into the propertied class (consisting of an insignificant few of the rich &amp; the super-rich) and the non-propertied millions that make up the **99%** of humanity worldwide today. Matrimony, money, market (the growing ***concentration*** of wealth in the hands of the **1%** leading to the growing ***impoverishment*** of the rest of humanity reflects the ***fundamental*** law of the market economy), commodities, etc. contribute to the perpetuation of this most ignominious division of humanity, a division premised **Not** on any ***merits***, ***talent*** or ***contribution*** to society or civilisation but on private possessions derived through inheritance &amp; exploitation.

How many men really deserve to be reckoned ***lions*** of men? I define a lion of a man as a guy capable of making a worthy husband or a worthy father, and by a worthy hubby or father, I mean a guy with capacity to ensure the social &amp; financial security and decent standard of living of his wife &amp; children as well as decent upbringing of the kids and decent livelihood of the grown-up kids. According to the UNDP Human Development Reports, India's poverty ratio is **27.9%**. Nevertheless, I consider it unacceptable totally in the light of the fact that not more than 1\*\*%\*\* Indians pay income taxes ( [Only 1% Indians pay income tax, govt tells Lok Sabha](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/economy-politics/story/only-1-percent-indians-file-income-tax-govt-tells-lok-sabha-273519-2020-09-21)), which means around **99%** of Indians are in the eyes of the Govt of India so poor as to deserve full exemption from the payment of income taxes. And further, according to a report released in 2018 by the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University , “ 82% of male and 92% of female workers earn less than \[Rs\]10,000 a month, “ while the minimum salary recommended by the seventh Central Pay Commission (CPC) is “ \[Rs\]18,000 per month. “( SWI 2018, Fig 4.10 &amp; Fig 5.5; [STATE OF WORKING INDIA 2018 REPORT FIGURES](https://cse.azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWI_2018_All_Figures.pdf) **)** As I see it, the monthly income figure of **Rs 18 000**, as  recommended by the seventh CPC, deserves to be taken as the Right poverty threshold for India in this 21st century, the **S**pace age. On the basis of this, I think Indians below the poverty level make up no less than **90%** of the country’s population.

stocks,Buffett's Alpha academic paper review and takeaways,"I recently came across the paper [Buffett’s Alpha](http://docs.lhpedersen.com/BuffettsAlpha.pdf). It’s an award-winning, highly technical paper filled with math equations and other heavy financial modeling to understand how Warren Buffett, probably America’s greatest investor, was able to consistently significantly outperform the market for almost six decades with an overall 19% compound annual growth rate!

I read this long and technical paper so you don’t have to, and have summarized its findings below.

There are four things that helped Buffett with his edge:  

* Investing style
* Finesse with leverage
* Minimal outside money
* Lucky to start in the 60s

# Investing style

The paper uses the Carhart four-factor model to summarize Buffett’s investing style and explain where his alpha (stock market jargon for market outperformance) comes from.

The first Carhart factor, MKT, showed that Berkshire’s stock was less volatile than the rest of the market and significantly outperformed it, which we already know. The second factor, small-minus-big (SMB), showed that Berkshire tended to buy large stocks. The third factor, called the value factor (HML), showed that Berkshire tended to buy stocks that had a high book value relative to their market value. That is to say, Buffett bought cheap stocks. The final factor, the momentum factor (UMD), showed that Buffett is not a momentum investor and didn’t chase trends in his stock selection.

However, the paper states that these four standard factors actually don’t explain Buffett’s alpha. As such, it introduces two more factors to measure Berkshire’s performance by. First, the Betting Against Beta (BAB) factor which showed that Berkshire tended to buy low risk (low volatility) stocks. Second, the Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) factor, showed that Berkshire tended to buy companies that were profitable and growing. By controlling for just the BAB and QMJ factors, Berkshire’s public stock portfolio’s alpha is driven down to a statistically insignificant value.

Therefore, the main reason for Buffett’s success is his preference for low risk stocks that are profitable and growing.

# Finesse with leverage

Buffett was able to obtain cheap leverage by buying insurance companies and using the insurance float as a sort of leverage. This was his genius. The insurance business model of charging insurance premium up front and paying out claims at a future date is essentially borrowing money from customers. When done properly, these loans are super cheap, significantly cheaper than the interest rates of the day.

Compound interest goes both ways, and an annual interest cost of 2% vs 5%, for example, makes a tremendous difference in the returns of a leveraged portfolio over time.

Even with cheap leverage, however, Buffett didn't really use a lot of it. According to the paper, about 1.6:1. This restrained use of leverage showed that Buffett was very careful and strategic with how he used it, and instead relied on consistent compound growth aided with just a little bit of borrowed money to achieve spectacular results.

# Minimal outside money

Another stroke of genius from Buffett to achieve his long-running success is how he structured what is essentially his investment fund. Buffett closed off Berkshire from outside money very early on and more or less managed his own money throughout the decades. This might seem insignificant and perhaps even limited the amount of money Buffett could’ve made if he took on outside investments and charged a management and performance fee similar to modern hedge funds. However, even though Buffett stunted his short term income by avoiding outside money, this decision was key to Berkshire’s long term survival.

For example, from June 30th 1998 to February 29th, 2000, Berkshire lost 44% of its market value while the overall stock market gained 32%. If Berkshire had outside money, this would've probably killed the fund with an onslaught of redemptions from anxious outside investors.

# Lucky to start in the 60s

Finally, it'd be remiss not to mention that even though Buffett employed significant skill in achieving such long-running success, he was also incredibly lucky to start investing in the time period that he did. This was a time period where access to information was low, thus increasing market inefficiencies and creating the underpriced companies that Buffett was able to invest in, and also the beginning of a multi-decade contraction of interest rates and expansion of the money supply by the Federal Reserve that is still ongoing today. In fact, just a few years after Buffett acquired Berkshire Hathaway, Nixon ended the gold standard, effectively giving a green light to the Federal Reserve to massively inflate the US dollar supply. This has unsurprisingly been a boon for the US stock market’s dollar-valuation.

If Buffett were to start investing today, it’s unlikely that he’d come even close to the performance he managed to achieve with Berkshire Hathaway since 1965. With the widespread availability of the Internet, and very accommodative central bank policies all over the world, markets are much more efficient and bloated. It’s incredibly hard to find the sort of deep value companies Buffett found in the 60s, 70s, and 80s to jumpstart Berkshire.

personalfinance,Why are my federal taxes so much higher than last year?,"I know, it's tax season and this is going to get drowned out. But I have to try to get advice because I'm baffled and upset. 

I'm married filing jointly. Husband's stuff hasn't changed from last year to this one. In fact, very little about our situation and income sources changed from the previous year to this one. The only thing that changed was the amount of net income after expenses for me. I have a shop where I sell handmade things, so I pay self employed taxes on that. For 2020, my net after expenses was about 30K. For 2021, net was 48K. With that change ALONE, I'm seeing completely disproportionate spike in calculated fed tax owed. It was 3.5K for 2020 and is...currently showing as 8.5K this time. 

Is this supposed to make sense? I'm not sure I understand the change here. I haven't even changed tax brackets. From 30 to 48K and the tax owed has more than doubled. How?? This is hugely painful for us. I was expecting something a bit over 5K, based on what we had last year. But 8.5. And that's not even mentioning state taxes. Ouch.

Really hoping I added something incorrectly on TurboTax, but can't figure out what, if anything.

EDIT- Ok guys, thanks for the reassurance! My brain is fried from taxes and other chores, but I read all of these. And I get it....I should be withholding. This isn't really my strong suit and I can barely find the willpower to tolerate tax things once a year, so more than that felt daunting. Also my income isn't really set in stone every year, so it always seemed easier to just pay once a year rather than try to estimate in advance. It's never before been too overly painful to pay everything once a year so I didn't see the issue. 

But ok. I'll look into withholding!

Having said that, I did take profits when valuations got stretched, PYPL and ADBE are two cases where I've got rid of 80% of my holdings because future growth looked subdued compared to their earnings and sales multiples.   
In Nvidia's case this is an important indication that growth may decline some in the next few quarters, after torrid growth in the last two years.

personalfinance,"I-bonds are great, but remember that they cause you to lose money","I-bonds have taken this sub by storm, and the personal finance world more generally. This is with good reason: the interest rate is a whopping 7.12% right now, with virtually no downside risk. The interest rate adjusts with inflation, and it's likely to be even higher in May. Your money will be locked up for a year, but other than that it's the investment of a lifetime - right?

Let me be as precise as possible:

**The real (inflation-adjusted) rate of return for I-bonds is 0%. Factoring in taxes, the present-day value of your investment will decrease.**

Let's work through an example. Suppose you buy $10k of I-bonds on May 1st, and cash them out in 5 years. Assume for simplicity that the rate of inflation from May 1st 2022 to May 1st 2027 stays constant at 8% per year (let's hope not!), and assume that your federal income tax rate is $20%. Finally, assume that a taco costs $5.

* Right now, you can buy 2000 tacos.
* On may 1st 2027, your I-bonds will be worth $14693. When you cash them out you will pay 20% of the interest in taxes, so your balance will be about $13754.
* But the price of a taco also increases at 8% per year, so it will cost about $7.35.
* Thus you will only be able to buy 1872 tacos. Your account balance increased, but your buying power decreased.

**I-bonds are still a great investment! (For certain purposes...)**

Let's compare I-bonds to your alternatives.

* If you leave your $10k in a HYSA earning 0.5%, you could only afford 1389 tacos after 5 years.
* If you put the money in the stock market and get the historical average of 6% per year net inflation then you could buy more like 2432 tacos (assuming 15% long term capital gains taxes).
* But if the stock market has a few bad years then it could easily be half that.

So if you're pretty sure you're going to need to buy a lot of tacos in the next 5 years, I-bonds might be your best bet - no, you won't be able to buy 2000, but you are virtually guaranteed to get close, no matter what happens with inflation or the stock market.

But if you are saving the $10k so that you can have a lifetime supply of tacos when you retire in 30 years, I-bonds aren't going to cut it. You are much more likely to succeed with an appropriate mix of stocks and ordinary bonds. In particular:

**Don't change your long-term retirement investing strategy because I-bond rates are high right now.**

stocks,"Former Treasury Secretary Summers makes another ""doomsday prophecy"": U.S. recession is inevitable","The combination of economic overheating, policy delays, and supply shocks makes a U.S. recession more likely in the coming years. Economists' latest forecasts also show the chance of a recession in the next 12 months has risen to 27.5% from 20% last month

According to former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the United States will fall into a recession next year, and more and more economists are reaching a consensus on this.

On Friday, Summers pointed out on a TV show that the combination of ""overheating, policy delays, and supply shocks"" poses an extremely difficult set of challenges, so that a U.S. recession is ""clearly more difficult than no recession in the next few years."" It is possible,"" adding that economists are gradually reaching such a consensus.

Data from a survey of economists does show that the probability of a recession they forecast in the next 12 months has risen from 20% last month to 27.5% today.

Summers emphasized that historically, the United States has not been without a recession within two years after inflation above 4% and unemployment below 4%. At present, the market's expectation for the US CPI in March has exceeded 8%, and the corresponding unemployment rate is 3.6%.

Summers believes that if the Fed is to reduce inflation, it needs to properly weaken the labor market. He cited nominal wages (not adjusted for cost of living), which he said were surging at the fastest rate on record, with an annual rate of 5.6 per cent in March. And a recent co-authored paper by Summers shows that once nominal wage growth exceeds a certain rate ""say 4% or 4.5%"" it leads to worse, not better, outcomes in terms of household purchasing power.

And right now, in the words of Summers, the U.S.’s current 40-year high inflation means that average real wages last year were “one of the worst performances we’ve ever seen.”

It is worth mentioning that Summers predicted as early as the middle of last year that U.S. inflation would reach 5% by the end of the year, much higher than the Fed’s statement of 3.4% at the time, and the final data also confirmed Summers’ prediction.",finance,1649646942.0

business,How to earn in an inflationary environment and high interest levels?,"Hi out there!

So, the hot 10 years since 2012 with low interest and crazy price hikes in real estate have made many people rich, sometimes by not even trying to become rich!

What do you guys think is the next big trend to earn on in the coming inflationary environment in which we are going to see higher interest rate levels?

In my understanding it is highly unlikely that RE will stay a prospective market as buying power of private households are crippled by the combination of high inflation and higher interest rates.

So, what will be the next thing?

personalfinance,Why are HELOCS generally cheaper than Home Equity Loans?,"I googled first! Do I understand correctly? A Home Equity Loan is a loan against the value of the home for some specific amount, for some specific need, right? Whereas a HELOC is a revolving line of credit.

I read that HELOCs generally have lower interest rates. **Why would this be**? To me, they sounds riskier than a Home Equity Loan.

  
My specific situation is that I want to have flooring done in my house soon, guesstimate about $15k. (Just getting started/first guy is coming out to measure &amp; quote today.) I could scrape up the cash, but it would use up my regular savings so I am considering options. Just like many people right now, I have serious equity in the home. But of course I know things will eventually change, so if I am going to be a borrower, I want to be a smart borrower.

Could I even get a HELOC for this kind of expense if I wanted? And if I was going to get one or the other, wouldn't I *want* a HELOC because of the lower interest rate?

personalfinance,Should I purchase a house (for parents),"Hi all!
To give context before I start 
I am making 62k~ a year living in a pretty high cost area (northern Virginia) . The debt I have are federal student loans (which are paused) and car payments with about 2.5k left at for 150 dollars a month. My credit score is at 750.

My parents are the first generation in the US. They live 3 hours away from me in a place that isn’t too crazy living cozy wise. I could never fathom making this much money when growing up and seeing how they didn’t make much as well puts into perspective how lucky I am. My father is ill and does not have much time left so my mother is the one providing. She is 60 and working over 50 hours at her restaurant she owns and it’s catching up to her. She also hates the business and wants to sell it soon.

Unfortunately, I don’t think she has anything saved for retirement. She also is paying rent in the townhome I grew up in (to a family member who owns it). Her credit is awful pretty terrible. With the funds of my father’s life insurance and his assets - that’ll provide a decent amount I believe.

I am THINKING to buy a 250k~ ish townhome / small home for my mother to live in. She would help with the down payment and I think I could bring 8-10k up front. I’m thinking it would be close to a college campus (10-15 minutes away) I bring that up because if my mother moves back to our homeland I could start renting it out to college students since the location would be great. I’m not too far from the area so I can plan on coming down and fixing the spot up if needed.

So I’m wondering if this is actually a smart decision or if I’m just too in over my head. I know the housing market is crazy right now so some honest insight would be great.

TLDR; making what seems like ok money to me. Want to buy small home for mother and having it as a rental spot in more for the foreseeable future.",finance,1649673673.0

My monthly payment including taxes is $1450 (thanks Illinois...).

I'm looking at South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee. I'm working from home full time, so the world is my oyster. I don't have any family around, so I'm not bound to any specific location. 

I make 100k a year. My per month take home (direct deposit, so after taxes, 401k, health care, etc), is $5000.

I don't have any debts besides my mortgage and can make a 20% down payment for a new house without selling the old one (around $60k) and still have my emergency fund of 6 months. 

The houses I'm looking at are new construction and with lot premiums (I can remodel a house, but can't move it!) I'm looking at a ballpark of $310k-$330k.

Would you think that with my financial situation a mortgage company would give me a second mortgage?

\-Should I have the lender and rate I want locked in before making an offer, or do I have time after making an offer to get the financing squared away?

\-We can afford 5-8% down-payment now OR we have enough equity in our current home to take out a HELOC to cover a 20% down payment. Do folks think the lower rate and no PMI from a 20% down-payment outweighs the variable rate uncertainty of taking out a HELOC?

Typical r/personalfinance logic is that since new cars quickly depreciate, it's financially savvy to instead buy a well maintained 2-3 year old car. Does this logic hold in the current market? Used cars seem to be holding value better than in the past

Are there any value adds to buying new? Warranties? Things I'm unaware of?

Any reasons I'm overlooking why used is better?

What about the 20/4/10 rule (put 20% down for a term of 4 years or less with a total cost of less than 10% of your income)? I assume 20% down was needed to get the best possible rate, is this still the case? If you can get an interest rate near 2%, wouldn't it make sense to get the maximum term possible and pay the minimum?

I inherited a Traditional IRA a year-ish ago, the total value being approximately \~$50,000. As I understand it, with the recent rules changes I have 10 years to withdraw the full total of the account which will be taxed as regular income. There are no longer any RMDs that I need to take over the course of the 10-year period due to the rules changes.

I currently have approximately $60,000 of student loan debt from my first career, the interest rates are varied between 4.5-6.5%. I am currently in school for a second BS that I am paying cash for, so I will not be accruing any additional loans during this period. I have approximately 1.75 years left until I finish my program.

Logically, if the markets return 7-10%, then I should come out ahead just leaving the IRA for the 10-year period if I just compare the interest. However, I have some concerns regarding having such a high student loan balance hanging over my head. It feels like a Sword of Damocles, especially if there is an economic drawback in the next few years wherein the balance of the account is severely diminished and finding entry-level employment in my new field extremely challenging. Currently my income is probably lower than it will be should I be able to secure employment in the new field (engineering). I suspect if I withdrew the money now, I would be taxed at a rate of 22%. It could be at a higher rate in the future, depending on my salary at that time. I just fear the catastrophic scenario outlined above and the $60,000 worth of debt just compounding while I struggle to find work.

personalfinance,Correction of excess 401k deferral in 2021,"Hi. I switched employers in the middle of 2021 and I tried to max out 401k for 2021 overall only to later realize in January 2022, that combining the 401k contributions in both employers, I had performed excess deferral ($235).

My 401k provider took most of the deferral out and cut me a check ($231). I'm hoping the remaining amount ($4) will also be removed out before April 15. The letter enclosed with the 231 check stated ""this amount is subject to ordinary income taxation for calendar year 2022 and therefore will need to be included in your personal federal and state income tax returns. The distribution will be reported to the IRS on form 1099-R. This form 1099-R will be sent to you by January 31, 2023.""

When I talked this over with my tax professional, he said that the excess contribution will be considered as taxable only in FY 2022. But online search (Fool.com,Nerdwallet and IRS guidance) says that the excess deferral is taxable in the year that they were deferred (i.e.2021) and the earnings considered for 2022. And my tax professional is not willing to calculate the excess deferral into the current tax filing without having 1099-R currently present.

I would appreciate any advice on clarifying this. If I'm to be taxed in 2022 for the excess amount, am I going to be  paying some penalty as well?",finance,1649707474.0

I got a pro-rated retention bonus in AUG 2021. Left the company in FEB 2022 and received a letter last month that I owe back the pro-rated amount.

I’ve already filed my taxes for 2021 and owed/paid the money I to fed and state. I expect to receive money back off the corrected W-2 as the amount I paid back to the company includes fed/state taxes on the bonus from 2021.

personalfinance,It's better to buy a home when interest rates are up,"This is a contrarian viewpoint and I'm ready to have dirt kicked in my face.

Interest rates and asset values are inversely related. Rising interest rates means asset values will drop. Falling interest rates means asset values will rise. So are you better off buying a cheaper priced home with a high interest rate or buying the same home at a higher price with a low interest rate?

Loans which do not have prepayment penalties have asymmetrical risk, specifically reinvestment/prepayment risk. This is most mortgages that we are familiar with. We can prepay early and there is no penalty. When interest rates fall, and the borrower has a fixed rate mortgage, it is beneficial to prepay. The borrower can just pay more each month, or the borrower can refinance. At the same time, the borrower gets to see their home appreciate in value as the interest rates fall. They get to win on both sides.

Let's say you buy during low mortgage rates. And then rates start to increase. You will see your home value decrease or stagnate, depending on how strong inflation is. You will have no opportunity to refinance, since it makes no sense to refinance to a higher rate. And you end up losing on both sides. If you buy a home when interest rates are high, you have an opportunity in the future to refinance, and lock in gains on both sides of the deal. When you buy a home when interest rates are low, you are stuck on the bad end of an asymmetrical arrangement.

To sum it up, interest rates should actually be irrelevant to your decision of buying a home. You need to figure out if the house itself is cheap or expensive. The best way to do this is probably to figure out the potential rental value of the home divided by the home value, and comparing this ratio historically or against other locations.

PS - If you buy as interest rates are in the middle of rising, you will likely buy a house from a holdout, and you will end up paying a high asset price AND paying a higher interest. Wait for things to stabilize. Home prices will lag interest rate changes.",finance,1649709725.0
personalfinance,Is it okay to keep kicking the home-buying can down the road?,"In the last two years I started looking at buying a home, but it has been very hard and prices only keep going up. I can barely afford anything in my area, and I make almost $200k / year. Houses listed get multiple offers within 24 hours of posting in the MLS and buyers are signing away inspections and appraisals with wild abandon. This has been going on for two years. So not only are prices higher, but the buying process is more expensive and entails high risks, e.g. a low appraisal could mean you own $100k on top of the sale price. Rising interest rates don't seem to be calming the market at all, but are increasing borrowing costs.

Is there anything wrong with just saying... screw it? My rent will keep going up, perhaps $200-300 a month per year. My income has increased but it doesn't seem to matter in the housing market when there is so much demand and so little supply. I feel like a fool even trying to buy something in this market.

personalfinance,Should I payback student loans even if interest is not accruing? If not what should I do with the money?,"Hi all,

I have a relatively small amount of federal student loan debt. Because I was frugal while I was in college, I managed to get by without using all of the funds. I now have more than enough in savings to pay back these loans in full, but I have been holding on to it since interest is being paid by the government while student loans payments are postponed. 

Is there a benefit to paying back these loans anyway? Should I hold on to my savings in a bank account to accrue interest? Is there a low risk investment I should make like a bond or something?

Edit: forgot to include some important details:

The actual balance is $3,500 with an interest rate of 2.750%

I have a 3 month emergency fund saved up and I am making a 12% contribution to my 401k at work.

personalfinance,"W-2 employee trying to avoid underwithholding due to bonuses, any solutions?","I just filed my tax return for 2021 and found myself having to write $12k total worth of checks to federal/state. looking at it, I believe the issue relates to my large bonuses only being withheld at 22% resulting in underwithholding. I had $120k of salary wages with an additional $155k of bonuses.

I wasnt hit with any underwithholding penalties, as I paid (way) over 100% of my 2020 tax liability, but next year I wont be so lucky if I dont change things. I forecast for 2022 to have about $125k of salary wages plus $160k of bonuses. $110k of that bonus pool has already been distributed, with the other $50k coming this fall.

I will be looking at updating my W4 at work, so I will see if I will be able to get back on track for the year. withholding what will probably be $13k of additional taxes over 8 months is a significant increase, so I am not sure how high withholdings via the W4 can go.

But if I cant, can a W-2 employee make a direct payment to the IRS (probably in late Q4 once I have my income forecast dialed in) before the end of the year to prevent an underwithholding penalty on my 2022 tax return? I know 1099s have to make quarterly estimated tax payments, but wasnt sure if that system is open for W-2 employees too.

CryptoCurrency,Food for thought: Bitocin is not a hedge against inflation,"How can we be so sure that Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation? doesn't seem like it lately. 

The appreciation of price is caused by Quantitative Easing and low rates by the feds but I don't think inflation correlates to BTC or crypto prices directly even more so that now the rate of inflation is alarming. If your paychecks buying power diminish from $2,000 to $500 a month, and your monthly living cost around $500 a month would you invest it or would you use it to live? Higher Inflation leada to less buying power which will translates into less money spared for investment. This is why everytime the CPI index increases the price dumps because smart money know that is not a good sign, the only hedge against inflation proven time to time is either gold or real estate and Bitcoin hasn't proven itself to be at least ""immune"" to inflation, let alone be hedge against it.",cryptocurrency,1649728859.0
solar,1.99% vs 5.99%,"Forgive me if this is an over asked question. 

I'm about to close on solar for my home and need financing. I understand most of the process but am struggling to understand why I would choose a 5.99% loan.

I am planning on applying the projected tax credit at time of purchase, essentially using cash to pay this and then when the credit comes in using it to reimburse myself. From there I plan to make my monthly payments slightly over double the minimum with the second installment going 100% principal. Therefore paying the 25 year loan off at around 12 years. 

I've crunched the numbers through a true cost loan calculator and have found if I go this route I will save approximately $500 over the same strategy with the 5.99% option. 

All of this makes sense. I have to ""buy"" the lower interest rate, but ultimately save cash on the back end with less interest. However my rep keeps advising on 5.99%, saying it will save me money. 

Is this a sales tactic? Can't imagine he benefits as he doesn't work for the bank. So..  what would be the benefit of choosing a 5.99% other than a lower borrowed amount?",energy,1649729265.0
personalfinance,Starting medical school and broke as hell. Would it be stupid to draw from my 401k?,"I am about 5 years out of undergrad and have about $15k in my 401k, and a few more thousand in a 403b. I've spent every last penny I had (and more) going back to school so I could apply for medical school. The good news is I got in! The bad news is I'm more than broke (no savings and a couple thousand in CC debt, which is at 0 APR for now thankfully), and federal loans will cover only the barest living expenses.

Obviously touching your 401k funds is never a good idea. I'll lose  potential interest, take the 10% hit for early withdrawal, and then get taxed on top of it. But going forward, I'm not sure how to pay for moving expenses, CC bills, veterinary bills etc. with no income.

My first step is selling everything I can, but if that wasn't enough and I drew down $10k from my 401k, would it be any worse than ultimately only seeing about $6-7k of that money and losing out on doubling that $10k over 10 years?

personalfinance,Backdoor roth and freetaxusa,"Hi, I'm following [Financebuff's guide](https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-backdoor-roth-freetaxusa.html) on doing the backdoor roth. 

Itemizied deductions/IRA contributions
1. Did you make any traditional or Roth IRA contributions during 2021? Yes
2. Did you recharacterize any IRA contributions?  NO
3. 2020 Excess IRA Contributions? No and NO
4. Did you withdraw any traditional IRA contributions by the tax filing due date? NO

I found that it was still doing a deduction for 6K. I saw in another reddit post that if you go back to W-2 and click retirement plan under box 13 it'll change your traditional IRA deduction to 0. Which it did and dropped my fed return by 2k (less deductions I supposed. But I didn't click it to begin with bc box 13 was empty on my W2s) anything else I need to watch out for when clicking the retirement plan in box 13??



So now I'm going through it again. 

5.Traditional IRA Basis and Value: I was gonna enter 0, 0, 0 like in the example but the last part 
6. Enter the amount, if any, of your contributions to a traditional IRA for 2021 that were actually made from January 1, 2022 through April 18, 2022: which I contributed to my traditional IRA between these dates. Do I put 6k?

Where can I see form 8606. I can download and view the      IRA deduction worksheet- schedule 1, line 20

1a- were you covered by a retirement plan? Your IRA Yes was clicked (I assumed this was what was fixed by clicking retirement plan under box 13)
2a. 76000 (single)
3. listed the total salary of my box 1s 
4. empty
5a. listed the total salary of box1
6. No was clicked and it said none of your IRA contributions are deductible. For details on nondeductible IRA contributions see form 8606. 
-I know my salary is too high for traditional IRA deductions. Did I do everything right? Do I even need the form 8608?

My goal is to lower this amount and then contribute $6k to my Roth IRA to claim a 10% ($600) credit.

personalfinance,bought the dream home but am now swimming in debt - help?!,"so we did the thing and bought a millionaire dollar home in the bay area. 

the numbers / context:

\- 1.3M owed on the home. original price was $1.7M, we put down 25%. 3.8% interest rate.

\- 8k/month in PITI which makes up almost 50% of our monthly expenses (yikes)

\- i am solopreneur consulting in tech. i give myself a take home pay of $325,000 but have dividends that add in around \~$300k-400k that I can invest back in the business or pay myself as a 'bonus.' 

\- i am not super confident that this is a sustainable route for the near future. the average take home for a regular 9-5 job is more like $170,000 but we'd be in the negative if I did that now with the debt we owe. 

\- i personally dont think this is our forever home. i think we'll be here a minimum of 4-5 years then make that long term decision when the kiddo reaches kindergarten / elementary school age. 

our goals (i think):

\- I've broken almost all my own personal rules to create a happy life for my wife and kid. happy wife happy life right? unfortunately, i'm not feeling super anxious about the 8k/month that we're stuck with. its manageable for now but it forces me to stay as a solopreneur and focus on maxing out our cash earning potential. no comfy 9-5 job till something changes there. 

it would be GREAT if we cut down our monthly home expenses from 50% number to 35%, or a smidge higher. 

it would be EVEN greater if we can cut it down using a 'normal' 9-5 salary that i would expect and still get it down to that 35% ish number.

but to do that would mean paying off almost $750,000+ in debt, staying as a solopreneur and investing all capital to personal, instead of growing out the company, investing in other assets, etc. 

questions: 

\- am i thinking about this wrong given that this is NOT a forever home? am i being overly concerned about the massive monthly payments that i'll have to pay as a somewhat risk averse solopreneur? 

\- what other questions should i be asking myself to understand how this connects with longer term goals?

\- any other general advice to help mitigate my anxiety would be much appreciated.

solar,Quote review and some questions,"Hi everyone, I'm pretty new to solar. I got a quote from Sunrun for a 4.08 kW DC Solar System with 12 panels and 12 inverters, estimated to produce 7,133 kWh in the first year (104% of estimated usage). The price is $19,420 with financing (1.99% interest rate) or $16,320 with cash. What do you guys think? From what I read on this sub, the price per kWh seems to be on the higher end?

I also have some additional questions, and will appreciate any input:

1. Does anyone have experience with Sunrun? Are they any good?
2.  I'm a new homeowner of just 3.5 months, so I only have electric bills in the winter so far. The guy from Sunrun said they have an algorithm to estimate annual usage, which works pretty well. So they estimated my summer usage based on the type of cooling I have. Has anyone done something like this, and is it accurate? 
3. Among the forms Sunrun asked me to sign, there was one that asked for my bank account. They said it was for the monthly payment draft, and I could put a bunch of 0's as a placeholder until I decide to go with them. But doesn't that still sound weird? Is it common in solar financing?

personalfinance,Please help me run the numbers,"Hello everyone,

I always lurk but I finally have another reason to post. I’m kind of good with numbers but at the same time I’m not lol, please bare with me. I have a mortgage with about $14,500 left on it. It’s a 30 year mortgage but I have been paying it down like crazy, I am 3 years in as of this May and as you can see, it’s almost done. The interest rate on this mortgage is 5.375%. I have a Chase Credit Card with a credit limit of $16,400. Now, I am very frugal, especially since I am a student, I rarely spend any money I don’t have to, I use my credit cards to pay bills and then pay off the credit cards each month, so I don’t have any spending issues. The Chase card is at a $0 balance. Today I received a balance transfer offer in the mail with physical checks. Apparently I can write a check, up to $15,000, and it will count it as a balance transfer and apply it to my $16,400 credit card limit. There is a 5% fee on the total amount. However, the balance transfer itself will be 0% until September 2023. Usually I don’t take advantage of these balance transfers as I pay off all my credit cards. However, would it be smart to use one of the checks to write it out to the mortgage company and essentially pay off the mortgage, but then just make smaller payments than I have been making to the credit card as now I’ll have 0% until September 2023 which I can definitely pay it off by? That excess money I would usually pay on top of the mortgage could go towards student loans / personal debts I have / 401K / etc. I figure the 5% fee after fees and everything would be around $750-$800 which isn’t bad, if someone can help me see that the interest on the mortgage would exceed that and that it does make sense to do this. I appreciate your time and patience in helping me, thank you so much!! I’m excited at the possibility of actually “paying off” the mortgage!",finance,1649744704.0
CryptoCurrency,Economists fear aggressive Federal Reserve may trigger recession,[deleted],cryptocurrency,1649745069.0
CryptoCurrency,People are thinking about this all wrong. We are not shifting from low inflation to high inflation. We are shifting from high investment inflation to high consumption inflation.,"People keep wondering why inflation would stay so low during two decades of, on average, low interest rates and massive QE.  The answer is simple: it didn't.  Assets were inflated rather than consumer goods.  Now we're getting high consumer inflation due to war, COVID lockdown, trade protectionism, etc. and as the average person's disposable income dwindles due to higher cost of living, less will be invested.

People who think that crypto is an inflation hedge completely miss the point.  We've already had massive inflation - why else would the s&amp;p go up 50% in two years during a global virus outbreak?  Now inflation is shifting to consumption and away from investment, and the only strong play right now is probably commodities because they're tied to consumption.

Don't invest in crypto now because you think it will protect against devaluation of fiat.  That already happened.  There are plenty of other reasons to invest in crypto, but thinking that we are now suddenly in an inflationary environment is the wrong paradigm.",cryptocurrency,1649745810.0

Soon need to get transportation for the two youngest, plus my own transportation is 25 years old POS gas guzzler. Just did a re-gI last august and didn’t take a penny out. But lowered my house payment like $300 a month which is nice. Dropped to like 2.5 interest rate. 

But mortgage company is now offering me to take out money. The sales guy was pretty persuasive. He said “our customers don’t want to leave their equity on the table like that, they want to cash out as much as they can to have it on hand and not lose it” etc. 

I don’t live a heavy debt life and the thought of INCREASING my mortgage again pisses me off. But I sure could use cash on hand. I CAN afford to take out like $40k and accept the increased payments, but it raises my interest rate to 4.75 which is just a huge jump yes? For not I have like $150k equity right now. Of course I’d hate to lose it.

CryptoCurrency,"In February, inflation numbers broke a 40-year high. Today's CPI (consumer price index) numbers are expected to break that record too. The global economy is bearish.","If you're wondering why Bitcoin ^and ^nearly ^every ^asset ^for ^that ^matter is falling so much today, the consumer price index being released today is expected to break more records. Records you don't want to break.

In February, we had the highest year-over-year inflation since December, 1981 at 7.9%. 

Now, just a few months later, and the numbers are expected to be higher, at  8.4%. 

More data is coming out today, which is expected to show the month-to-month consumer price increase from Feb-March was 1.1%.  The highest month-to-month jump since 2005.

Meanwhile, Joe Biden's approval ratings today have hit an all-time low in his presidency. The war in Ukraine ravages on and the price of essentials (food, housing, gas, etc.) are ever-rising.   

Loans are becoming significantly more expensive as The Federal Reserve has hiked rates too abruptly. 

All of these wonderful events point toward a global recession being inevitable. How bad of a recession is left to be answered.  It it is not a question of *if* the global economy has an impending recession, but rather, *how bad* of a recession will it be? Invest accordingly. 

Finally, I will add that the overwhelming influence of the 
The Federal Reserve System, which is the *central* bank of the United States needs to be minimized sooner than later.

Decentralized systems are bullish in the future for these exact reasons. Bitcoin will *not* solve all of our economic problems, but every step towards more decentralized economics will give people more say and make changes less sudden and dramatic.",cryptocurrency,1649749414.0

CryptoCurrency,I think people who think “this is the dip” are going to be very disappointed in 6 months time. I’m not a fud spreader or a doom monger but I don’t think we’ve seen anything yet.,"Typically a recession is around 12-24 months behind the major event and for past 2 years, governments around the world have sheltered their people from the impacts of covid, with lose monetary policy and “free money”. Inly now are we starting to see the cost of that policy, with CPI expected to go through the roof today. 

Some commentators saying “bitcoin could be a hedge”….spoiler alert, it won’t be. History tells us that when the stock market has a cough, the crypto market shits the bed. I mean just look at where we were in march 2020.

personalfinance,Risks of 10 year ARM?,"As interest rates slowly rise, what’s stopping me from getting a 7/7 ARM or even a 10/1 ARM and rolling the dice that interest will eventually fall again? Looking at 30 year historical trends and it looks like interest rate increases typically last for a 3-5 year period before falling again. 

Of course rates can skyrocket again especially to fight inflation but, again, historically speaking they have been constantly falling over the past 30 years. Am I just being too risky, naive, and optimistic about ARM rates with this line of thinking? 

Would a, say, 2% ARM be low enough to warrant consideration over a 4.5% 30 year fixed?

EDIT: To clarify, the strategy would be to refinance to a 30 year fixed by end of 7 or 10 year ARM term in the hopes that interest rates are still reasonably the same or even lower.",finance,1649759696.0

personalfinance,Buying Property - Does our business buy it? Do we buy it?,"We are currently farm shopping and are looking to buy a farm in the 150-250 acre range. The only way to get financing on a piece of property this size is with a commercial mortgage. The interest rates are slightly higher (about 0.5 to 1.5%) than a traditional mortgage and the maximum term is 25 years (with a minimum 20% down). We are comfortable with all of the above.

My question is in terms of which entity we use to buy the farm. We have an S-corp. We pay ourselves meager salaries. I'm going to use inaccurate numbers here, but the ratio is the same. Assume my wife and I pay ourselves 50k each (100k total). Assume the S-corp net income is 200k per year. We could increase this net income to 300k by not paying ourselves - or we could decrease this net income to 0 by paying ourselves 150k each.

In my mind, and after talking with several professionals, there are 3 options. 1 - Buy the farm with the S-corp. 2 - Buy the farm in our personal names. 3 - Buy the farm in an LLC that is owned by the S-corp.

It is important to note that the S-corp is in an entirely different business category than the farm. The farm will become a business over time, but this will be slow and arduous. 

Am I missing something here? What is the best option? Any advice or guidance is appreciated.",finance,1649768080.0
ethereum,Ethereum's Shadow Fork,"The first mainnet shadow fork for Ethereum went live Monday, signifying a critical achievement for the popular cryptocurrency.

Background: Ethereum’s network follows a proof-of-work (PoW) system, which can be a manual way of verifying a user. The network is now switching to proof-of-stake (PoS), which can be faster and more energy-efficient.

Details: A shadow fork basically is a critical point in this migration where data can now be shared on both chains. Basically, it is huge news for Ethereum developers and traders.

History: Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, has been pegged by some experts to overtake Bitcoin in 2022. Obviously, that hasn’t happened yet.

Numbers: Despite the shadow fork on Monday, the price of Ethereum fell about 6%. However, most cryptos had a bad Monday as well, which has been attributed to rising interest rates.

Final Thoughts: At this point, Ethereum is still down for the year.

personalfinance,Mortgage Rate Lock in nonsense,"Hello,

I just got off the phone with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with little more guidance than before.  Anyways, I am conveniently trying to upgrade my home because my family has grown, and we are working from home now (which my wife and I did not realize in 2018).  That said, we've been trying to find housing since before my second child was born starting in Feb 2021.  It has been awful as most people already know.  Anyways, we found a community with new construction, great.  Definitely expensive, but after running the numbers with the Lender, it was fine.  Estimated date of completion October 31, 2022.  We signed the sales contract with a 3.25% rate at the start of last December (2021).

At that moment, when we first spoke with the builder's preferred lender ($5000 ""bonus"" (but not really because of how they fudge transfer tax sharing)), I immediately asked if there was any way to lock in the rate.  Estimated completion was about 11 months.  His answer to me was no, we lock in rates around 90 days out of settlement.  I follow the Fed and Finance news pretty closely, and I knew the MBS buying program was going to have a horrific effect along with QT before we can lock in.

At the end of February, I sent a long email explaining why I think they need to take exception to their ""rule"" (as I understood it based on what I was told) given the unprecedented macro environment that we are in and how volatile things could be toward the middle and end of 2022.  I'm again asking is there ANY way we can lock in the rate?  He calls me and says no.  At this point, I regret not calling other lenders I had worked with.  But, to that end, I know that the rate I would get doesn't really change much between lenders.  (I'm sure everyone has their story proving the exception to that, but not me :) ).

Toward the End of March 2022, I send another email explaining how going from 3.25% to 5% will make the mortgage payments on the edge of unaffordable for our family's income.  He calls me, and admits something-- he states: ""I talked to \[the back of house or whoever sets rates?\] here and they are starting to use this one mortgage product from \[FreddieMac? or something\] where we can do 12, 9, or 6 month lock ins.""  I heard this.  I was angry.  I asked, ""Can I have the 12 month lock in be retroactive to when I had initially asked to lock in the rate??""  He said, ""no.""

I'm feeling very frustrated.  CFPB was not really helpful.  I guess I could just file an official complaint and see where it goes.  I would be happy to have locked in the rate (plus the fees of locking in so far out) as of Feb1 or whatever.

Does anyone have any suggestions here to salvage this?  I thought knowing the economic environment was enough for a consumer to at least not get taken advantage of, but I failed.  I have kids, a wife, a full time job, and lots of other things that take up time from me being aware of financial products.  That's a lame excuse, I know, but I wanted to believe that I could trust the Loan officer to at least give me all the options to make this work given the unbelievable state of bonds and mortgage rates.

**edit: tl;dr--**  If I am asking to lock in rates using a financial product that exists, and my lender obfuscates the possibility of using it either by intention or by incompetence, is it on me, as the consumer to suffer the consequences by looking for a product that I don't know about?  Clearly a lot of people here did not know that there are rate lock products 12 - 9 months out.  I guess I should have just made my question shorter so that commenters didn't think I was looking for a hand out, just a competent, ethical Loan officer.  I'm not an expert, I did not expect a retroactive 12 month lock in.  If I had known the product existed, I would have locked in or found a lender that would have done it.  For anyone else in my situation, good luck, and I guess my loss can be a lesson to others?  Not sure why people here feel the need to condescend?

\---- EDIT:  This is the email I sent on February 6, 2022 ---------------

&gt;Dear Lender,  
&gt;  
&gt;One point of growing concern I have and, I am sure, a number of other buyers under contract of sale, is the macroeconomic environment we are all experiencing.  We are all dealing with inflation in a variety of different ways and that is due in large part to the dovish Federal Reserve policies and the easy money made available to prime dealers.  I will not mention the supply and demand of the real estate/housing market in this email.  As the Federal Reserve has finally decided to increase the Federal Funds rate while also tapering the purchase of treasuries, securities, and mortgage backed securities, the average interest rate for a 30y mortgage has already spiked significantly and in a short period of time.  This has also happened before any actual Federal Funds rate changes have occurred-- aka ""priced in.""  
&gt;  
&gt;So the current situation is this:  Purchase programs of Securities and, especially, the Mortgage Backed Security (MBS) will cease as of the March FOMC meeting; the Federal Funds rate will increase 0.25 or 0.5.  Additionally, the number of rate hikes this year will be at every meeting (or so we can expect).  
&gt;  
&gt;At the time we conducted our prequalification, the quoted rate was 3.25% (Dec 3, 2021).  Per Freddie Mac, average 30y Mortgage rates in November were at 2.98% and that number has jumped to 3.55% as of the end of January.  For a median priced home ($358k as of 12/2021), that increase roughly equates to a $200 increase in mortgage payments.  I am not delving into the breakdown of that baseline mortgage agreement and payment schedule.  But, the point stands that this is a significant increase in monthly payments.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am already expecting to have a rate as of today at around 3.75% now given the change in macroeconomic conditions (as I described above).  This means that by the time we can even lock in the rate, we will, most likely, be hovering around 4.125%.  That's a 27% increase in interest cost.  
&gt;  
&gt;My question is this:  can we lock in the rate sooner, rather than later?  I hope I have made the case that this is a highly unique situation that we are in, from a macroeconomic point of view, and it has a significant effect on those of us under contract.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the rate lock date can not be changed, are we able to pay down points?  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for your time!

Panasonic warranties the 410W panels to be at least 20.42% efficient for 25 years.  Performance, parts, *and* labor are covered for 25 years, which I think is beyond the other two panel warranties.  And I guess it's a better brand name.  ::shrug::

I don't know how to compare the estimated savings between the two companies.  They are both reputable local companies, but they most likely will calculate things slightly differently.  

When does a difference in $/Watt between vendors become significant?

Is the Panasonic 25-year performance/parts/labor warranty significant?

personalfinance,Serious home buyers remorse,"I’m about to close on a house for the first time, and let me tell you, I am experiencing some *serious* buyers remorse and anxiety, so much so that I’m considering walking away from the contract and forfeiting our earnest money deposit.

The main reasons I’m fretting is that I’m worried we’re getting in to more house than we need, and I’m also feeling very anxious about committing to this house and no longer being able to relocate if necessary.

My wife and I are currently renting a 1 bed apartment, and have been in a 1 bed for the last 7 years. It fine for our needs right now, although we’re getting sick of it. The house is a 3 bedroom (sort of 4 — there’s a finished basement as well). Our monthly payment will be 2.5x what we’re currently paying in rent. This won’t be a problem for our budget, because right now that “excess” money is going towards our “down payment” savings goal, so after the purchase we won’t need to decrease any of our other spending/saving goals. But it feels sort of ridiculous getting such a big house for just two people. We considered getting a 2 bedroom or small 3 bedroom, but most of those around here are condos, and given the likely lower appreciation, the condo fee, and the fact that we might outgrow it in a year or two (if/when we have kids), it just didn’t seem worth it to buy smaller for now.

I’m wishing we had just decided to rent a bigger place, but with house prices shooting up in our city over the past two years, it seemed like if we didn’t buy now we weren’t ever going to be able to. Although I now feel like that was stupid logic and I’m buying at the peak.

The other factor is feeling locked down to one place. I can’t help but thinking of what-ifs: what if I want to pursue a great job opportunity in a new city? What if all our friends move to the other side of the city? what if the neighborhood goes down hill or becomes unsafe (this is a house in a city). It seems like if we don’t stay in this house for 4 or 5 years we’re probably going to be losing a lot of money compared to if we had rented similar places over the same time span.

Additionally, we started looking for houses when interest rates were a full percentage point lower, and I’m worried we kinda stumbled forward even as the outlook for buying became less attractive

I will say, I’m naturally a worrier and have always found it hard to make big life decisions and commitments. I can’t tell if I’ve actually stumbled into a bad financial situation and I should just cut my losses by forfeiting the earnest money deposit, or if I’m being ridiculous and I’ve let the anxiety go to my head…

Sorry for the ramble. Anyone else here have these anxieties the first time they bought? How did you deal with them? Or should I actually walk away…? (The earnest money deposit is not an insignificant amount of money. It’s about 10% of our before-tax annual income)

(p.s., I don’t think there’s any way to get out of the contract and keep the earnest money.

The condo in the midwest, I don't really want to sell it, it generates 1100 monthly.  200 to HOA, 700 for mortgage.  I like the idea of passive income.  The loan is FHA ARM, current Interest rate is 2.125.  For those unfamiliar with FHA ARM it can only go up every 6 months, and a max of .5 points per rise, and maxes at 6.75

I am being offered to refi it to a 5.005% standard loan and I'd get about 45k in cash.

There is no way right now we have enough for a downpayment.  Let's say 1.4million is an average home where we are looking.

My concern is the cash on hand we have, and the imminent inflation.  If that cash doesn't go into an asset it will just sit there losing value.

My thoughts:  pick up another rental property someplace.  buy a crypto miner or three?

Should I take the refi and money out, and do something with that cash?

Other assets that I can buy that will go up with inflation?",finance,1649794890.0

personalfinance,Is it okay that I take out a small to medium sized loan for college?,"I go to community college. I am paying my own way through college, with the help of grants and a couple small scholarships. 


My plan is to work part time while I go to school, or at least through the summer full time. I have a job, I am getting another one in the summer. 


I am transferring to a university in the same city of Orlando after I get my AA. I am 19. Right now I live alone in my moms apartment that she left for me until the lease is up. She gets grants for the majority of the lease, I only pay electric and the internet, my grandparents pay for my food. I pay for my personal bills, such as hygiene, car insurance, and gas. But shits about to get real. The lease is going to be up in August and since I was not prepared to move out (no savings) I am temporarily moving out of state to stay with my sister until I figure out housing as far as Florida. 


Everything is here. My family (even though I can’t live with them), my boyfriend, my friends, my college. Mainly the college though, this is a rare opportunity for me the way it worked out with the transfer agreement between my community college and the university, as my community college has a transfer agreement with all state universities here in Florida. I don’t want to pay out of state tuition, and I am actually getting a quality education at this particular community college. 


I don’t want to lose my entire life just to work full time and get my bachelors in what, 6, 7, 8 years? That’s if I pay for each semester out of pocket. 


I don’t make enough to pay for classes AND living expenses. I can do one or the other, but not both, it would take me far longer than I am okay with being a student for. 


I won’t have to take out any loans for classes at this community college. With my grants and the low cost, I can pay out of pocket. But I have come to terms with the fact that I may have to take out about a 12,000 loan for my two years at university. 


I did a little loan calculator estimator on smart asset and these are my numbers: interest rate 4.66, monthly payment 225 over five years, lifetime cost 13,475.


I thought, not bad. Not compared to others who take out loans, I’m still savings a bunch of money since I’m going to community college first. But it still scares me. I don’t know anybody who would co-sign on this. My grandparents have excellent credit, and they are staunchly against loans. My siblings don’t have the means. My mom has terrible credit and is running away from 60,000 in student loans. My dad is against me taking out any loans but I might get him to sign. 


I don’t have any support for this and I keep thinking about how a 200+ bill for my first five years out of college might affect me. And I won’t be able to take it back unless I want to ruin my credit. I’m confident I can find a good job out of college. I’m confident I can pay it back, and I think the high monthly payment is worth it because it means the sooner it ends, the more money I save and the sooner I can build a good savings before my thirties. 


I thought this was a good idea but after talking about it to my family, it has me not trusting myself, even if I have a positive outlook on my job situation as I graduate.",finance,1649795976.0

personalfinance,What's the benefit to the government of issuing I-bonds?,"Lotta justified chatter on this subreddit over series I bonds being a great investment as inflation goes up, but it has me wondering what benefit there is to the federal government in even issuing them! My understanding of the whole history of savings bonds is that they originated as a sort of deal with ordinary citizens: the gov't got to borrow money from them at fixed, long term rates, and citizens got access to a long-term relatively low return but extremely low risk savings vehicle, which meant a lot to people who had lived through various financial boom-bust cycles. 

But today, the feds to my knoweldge don't have any trouble borrowing money on the bond markets at much lower rates than what I bonds are offering, and I-bonds are relatively short term vehicles so they don't even lock in the loans for that long. Obviously the $10K limit shows an awareness that they need to put a ceiling on what people can put in to make it all tenable. So are I-bonds actually a useful form of debt for the gov't to issue, or are the feds basically subsidizing a nice little investment for people who have a bit of a nest egg they can afford to keep tied up for a few years?",finance,1649801873.0

personalfinance,Builder/Seller Mortgage Company Keeps Moving the Goal Post,"My husband and I had an offer accepted on a new construction home a couple months back, with the date of closing to be the end of September. Our accepted bid on a house + larger-than-average lot was pretty okay (not super low, not super high, just okay) so we were stoked to get it for being still comparatively low. The market in our area is exploding and prices are still going up like crazy. They \*might\* level off at some point, but they aren't going down and the base price for our model in that development is already going for almost 20K over what we paid for it (35K over the original base price and with normal size lots). The builder highly incentivized us to use their mortgage company and we began working with them. Last week, they gave us the first opportunity to lock in our mortgage @ 5.0% - For $3K we get a 120 day lock, and for the other 60 days between the end of that and close costs us \~$35 a day (.01% of the entire loan) coming out to about 5K all told due at close. There was a 150 day lock option with 30 days of the .01% fee, but it cost more to lock, so it was technically cheaper to do the 120 lock + 60 days. So we overnighted the deposit to lock on Tuesday, it was received, and I got an email from our rep saying that our interest rate was locked for 120 days (with a 1 time float down option). Friday, we get an email saying that the daily extension has gone up to .013% (\~46/day). 

They have us by the short hairs and they know. We know it. Our real estate knows it - she told us that demand is so high that builders are cutting 'problem' buyers and giving back their earnest money because they can find someone less demanding - and probably charge them more. Supply remains very low, but the area is in high demand. Rents have increased 35% in the last year in our area and are still going. But for them to increase the daily lock fee?

Just some background info I live in Southern California and hold a steady job with a salary of $90,550 before taxes.

So I will be living in my townhouse for about four years this coming fourth of July, my current loan was taken out for about $495,000 at an interest rate of 4.625%.

As of today my remaining balance is $414,506 with an equity of $223,494. Per the bank app it claims my current home value is approximately $638,000.

I intend to get married in June and ideally we want to stay just one more year in the townhouse and find a bigger home. I would LIKE to rent out the the townhouse and use the equity on this loan as a downpayment for another house.

Using the rent money from the townhouse to either pay its current loan or we make a profit off it whatever we could make on it.

Of course one thing is what I hope and another thing is a reality, reading articles on taking an equity loan isn't giving me the confidence that I can pull this off.

I know I am already past the deadline of refinancing to get a lower interest rate and I didn't pull the trigger because my parents told me about waiting FIVE years before doing anything else financially to the mortgage.

I would like to try and kill two birds with one stone in refinancing my townhouse to get a lower monthly payment (hence getting more out of the rent) and taking equity out to use as a down payment on another home.

I am aware that this is risky but I would like to get input that given the current state of the world/economy/housing market and seeing who knows how things will be a year from now is this worth it?

Or am I better off selling the townhouse and just buying a new home from the sales?

I’ve tried reading up on credible websites &amp; searching the forum, but am still confused.

We will be paying off $35k in credit card debt (the spending issue has been resolved &amp; hasn’t been a problem for over a year, but the interest is killing me).

Income is stable &amp; not variable. We do not plan to move for 5+ years, and are confident that, without 25% interest rates, we can pay off the debt in 3.5 years, maximum, based on the rates we’ve been approved for.

My credit score is on the upper end of average, but my spouse’s is great, so he is the one who has applied and been approved for both options.

Now, what I’m trying to decide, is which one would best serve our needs? We do plan to replace the roof, HVAC, and floors before we sell. (All are dated, but currently in working order.) However, as stated, that won’t be for 5 or so years.

Well the dates weren't in our favor. We agreed after talking to a friend to just trust that our good fortune would continue. We told our loan originator about her new job. 

At first the loan originator said no problem. But, then she said that it might interfere with our USDA Rural Development loan program. This program is giving us $3,500 to pay for closing costs. It is also cutting our interest rate from the current rate of 5% down to 2.875%.

I currently have about 59k in student loan debt. (All federal, 9 loans total)
My current annual salary is about 61k. Take home about 4k a month but I do not get paid for July and august. I’ve managed to bring my monthly expenses to about 2k.

No dependents
$1,100 in credit card debt. No interest (paying off soon)
No car payment
All other expenses about 2,000 per month
13k emergency fund
State pension

I would like to be debt free by 2025 if not sooner. So I’m debating if I should attempt to go for the loan forgiveness which would require about 4.5 years of consistent 500+ month payments or not go for forgiveness and just aggressively tackle my debt &amp; pay it off using the avalanche method but have the flexibility to pay the minimum month requirement $285 incase of an unexpected circumstance.

personalfinance,I have a seemingly irreparable student loan taken out on my credit and need to get it resolved as soon as possible. Any and all help is appreciated.,"Hello all,

I just recently graduated college in May 2020 and have a sticky situation on my hands.

I was applying for a job nearby and they ran a credit report on me, and I found out the hard way I had/have a few derogatory marks on my account. Many of them were medical debt, and four were student loans. I was able to pay off all the medical debt collections placed on my account and become current on three of four student loans, but there is one student loan that originally kept me from getting the job.

Side note: my dad said he would pay the minimum monthly payments on these while I was in school so I wouldn't have to work while I was in school because he said school should be my number one priority, but through this credit report I found out he had not paid a single one, with his parents as cosigners. I was a clueless teenager that had blind faith in his dad which has come to be the death of me.

 I was told that as soon as I can get the last one off of my credit report, I will be good for hire. The one issue with this student loan is that the account was closed by the lender in January 2022 for roughly $46k, and my goal is to get it off of my credit report ASAP. I contacted the original lender, seeing if I could get it current and set up a payment plan and bring it current, get a settlement, or any number of options just to get the closed account settled/paid off/current, but to no avail. I was told I would have to pay the amount in full with the lender (which I cannot do with my current financial situation), or wait for a debt collector to purchase my debt so I can set up a payment plan with them. Considering it has been 4 months and no one has purchased my debt yet, I was wondering if there was any way to try to get this off of my credit report as quickly as possible, or if I am just screwed and have to wait for a collection agency to pick it up. 

I had the idea to maybe take out a new loan to pay this closed account off in full, but by now my credit has been tanked so much I am not sure I would even be able to take out enough money to cover the loan, and if I did, I would be paying an ungodly interest rate on it. 

Any and all help would be appreciated, just need this off my credit ASAP. I feel out of options to get this off in a timely manner, but need this job in order to continue to make monthly payments on these loans my dad pulled in my name.

vet,My kitten (3months old) keep sneezing up foamy discharge after feeding.,"So, my 3 months old persian almost always sneeze up foamy or lathery discharge when I feed her. And it goes on for as long as hours. It started like a month ago. She first showed this symptom after she ingested some dry cat food I fed to the older cats. I went to the vet. She suspected worms. And she was dewormed a couple of days later after taking a supplement. And the doctor told us not to give her any solid food for the time being so, she was mainly fed by the mother and milk replacement as she wasn't getting enough. She was doing fine and she even started to eat some soft kitten food the vet suggested. And I made sure to keep her out of reach from the large cat food. But these days, the symptoms are reappearing again and now she sneezes up discharge even when all she had was the bottle milk. She seems to do fine with the mom's milk but I think the mother cat might be drying up because my kitten seems hungry all the time. The vet says it could be an infection and also enourages to continue giving her bottle milk but just for a little bit. She has also given antibiotics for her. I am following the vet's instructions. But it's really hard to watch the little one as she struggles whenever we feed her. So, I was wondering if anyone has experienced similar case like mine? If so, I wanted to know if I could do something to help her.
The symptoms only comes after she eats or drink bottle milk. She can drink water just fine. And she starts sneezing up white foamy discharge, not food (when it comes to milk, Im not able to distinguish if it is milk or just foams) and it's not vomitting. Stuffs just comes out of her nose. She keeps crying out when it happens and always seems to stand up using the wall or stuffs as support (I think it makes her feel a bit better).",cryptocurrency,1649832444.0

My car is pushing 20 years and is slowly making its way to the junk yard. I want to get my credit score in a good place (higher than 720) before I have to get a more reliable car. 


*Current score*: 
- My bank says 688 using vantage score 3.0
- CreditKarma Transunion says 687, but CK Equifax says 642. I see that CK also uses the vantage score 3.0

I’m not sure of my Fico score auto 8. 



*Debt*:
- *Credit Card 1*: $12,500 balance / 13500 limit (92% utilization 😣)/ 23.34% APR / $360 minimum payment
- *Credit Card 2*: $230 balance / 950 limit / 22.24% APR / Not sure of minimum as I pay in full each month
- *CareCredit*: $1,500 balance / 4500 limit / 0% APR through 2022 / $200 minimum payment
- *Credit Card 3*: $0 balance / 6000 limit / 23.99% APR 

*Total*: $14,230 balance / $24,950 limit (57% total usage overall)


*Credit profile*: 100% on-time payments. Most recent hard pull was Spring 2021. Nothing unfavorable to report.


*Plan*
- April 2022: Pay off CareCredit and CC2. Payment of $2500 to CC1. 
- May 2022: $3800 toward CC1. 2k of this will come from my HSA reimbursement from my CareCredit payoff. The other $1800 is what I budgeted.
- June through Sep: $1800/month toward CC1 until it’s paid off. I’m currently waiting to start a 3rd freelance gig that will be around ~$1000/month after taxes so I *might* be able to pay this off earlier but I don’t want to count money that isn’t guaranteed.

My husband and I live in Houston texas and began a contract on a new build home back in February. It’s 340k, 3.3% tax rate. We’re putting 10% down and back in February I was quoted a 3.5% rate on 30 year loan by a lender that I was referred to by my realtor. Closing date got delayed and delayed, and now rates are a whole point higher if not more and its getting close to being not affordable at all. My builders preferred lender has taken over 6 weeks to even come up with an estimate and I’m not sure what to do. We love the home a lot and negotiates a lot of upgrades at no cost to us and we feel like we won’t be able to find another home around this price and in the area that we want. My realtor said worst case scenario, we take a shitty rate and refinance later on when rates decrease after inflation is controlled but that seems very uncertain to me too. Should we try and lock in a rate and bite the bullet or Give up on this one? My biggest fear is interest rates climbing to the point where we really can’t afford anything and I’ll regret not getting this place. Please help!!

However, the bond funds that she does own have all lost 5% since the start of this year, presumably due to the increase in interest rates.

Would it still make sense for a retiree to shift some stocks into bonds given that the Fed has indicated that interest rates will continue to rise?

The lawsuit alleges that by March 14, Musk’s stake in Twitter had reached 5%, which required him to publicly disclose his stake 10 days later by March 24. Musk didn’t file the required disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission until April 4, after he had boosted his position to more than 9%.

retirement,Mortgage-free and planning to move? Get your new home before you announce retirement.,"TLDR: Consider buying your new home before you announce your retirement so that you can continue to qualify for pre-approved financing based on your income. This will allow you to compete in bidding wars.

Be warned! I did a lot of research ahead of retirement, but failed to uncover this particular challenge/scenario. I live in Ontario and retired last Nov. with the idea that I would downsize to a smaller place in a cheaper location. My current home is mortgage-free and I figure I can pocket some $ on the deal. As the inventory of homes in my chosen location is low, my realtor suggested that I buy there first and then sell my place as its value would continue to accrue as I waited for the right house.  I want to bid on a house tomorrow (holding offers until 4 p.m.) and the sellers are seeking a fast closing.  I am unable to secure financing through the bank to make a firm offer because my very low pension income is not high enough to qualify me. (My plan is to get a part-time job, if needed, in my new location as I don't drive.) Bank said: lending products are based on income and not assets. I've got a call in to a mortgage broker to see what we can do.  FYI: Bank said they could offer bridge financing if I had an offer of sale on my home, but... it's a little late to sell this baby by tomorrow.

UPDATE: I did not get the house. I will be exploring options again next week, including a HELOC. Thanks to all for advice and support. Happily, I adore my current home and am good to wait until the right deal comes along. Also interested to see how interest rate hikes affect pricing and inventory.",finance,1649859977.0

To preface I am a young male in early 20s and currently live at home, so I thankfully don't have to pay rent along with not having to pay insurances as well. I have about ~56k in federal student loans from going to college and about half of that are parent PLUS loans at 6.28% in my father's name and the other half are direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans from 2.5% -~4.2% ish. I also have a automobile loan where I pay $340 a month @ 3.99 for 72 months. Min payment is $310. 

Currently I have around ~30k in my account and have tried to be conscious of my credit and debit spending, althought I have gone over my self established limit some months. This month I spent around 15% of my monthly income on my credit card (food, gifts, groceries, wants) . I'd like to be less than 10% though.

I'd like to get started on clearing my debt relatively fast as I'd like to be moving out in the next year or so and hopefully living with my significant other. I have ADHD and am very impulsive to just pay a large chunk of my loans off (thinking ~20k) and then paying a monthly payment after.

His average cost of BNDW is around 80, and the current value of BNDW is 72. And it’s getting worse by the day due to rising interest rates. 

I have another ~$25k to throw into the market for him this month. Should I go $15k VT and $10k ibonds, and leave the BNDW untouched?

btc,The Internet of value.,"Good news everyone, we recently tested our new bridge between SmartBCH and Binance Smart Chain, we transferred our Swap token Ki from SmartBCH to BSC, with what is a new set of smart contracts. While we initially deployed already available open source code for our Testnet bridge, after long consideration and testing a few other bridges, we decided to design and create our own bridge! On this and an upcoming post I will try to  summarize why we are writing new code, how are things going and what plans we have as we built the basic infrastructure to the **internet of value! We are pursuing this idea of being able to access any token, NFT,  DEFI contract, on any blockchain, with low fees and securely; what we are calling the internet of value.**

# Bitcoin Cash at the center of the bridge.

The highly scalable properties of Smart Bitcoin Cash, and its low fees create the perfect platform to make it the center of a set of bridges and tools that would allow for value to flow across chains. **We see a future where tokens and NFTS securely move across blockchains with low fees and high security.**  We see how in turn **PoW** based **scarcity** and **usefulness,** are the ultimate value generators for a blockchain coin.  Not all networks are the same, and PoW chains are the only ones we believe can be truly scarce. Consider how relatively easy it is to launch a new PoS chain, yet the same is not true for a PoW chain, energy sets a hard limit and creates real scarcity. Scalable and scarce, Bitcoin Cash is the perfect platform for the internet of value.

# Federated bridges

We had previously discussed how a Federated bridge works, if you will like to learn more about them please check our previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/osynga/lets\_talk\_about\_bridges/](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/osynga/lets_talk_about_bridges/)

Here are some popular Federated bridges, they all work very similarly to each other.

\-[https://bridge.roninchain.com/](https://bridge.roninchain.com/)\-[https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge)\-[https://github.com/certusone/wormhole](https://github.com/certusone/wormhole)\-[https://github.com/rsksmart/tokenbridge](https://github.com/rsksmart/tokenbridge)\-[https://xbridge.qbt.fi/bridge](https://xbridge.qbt.fi/bridge)

Many of the above bridges suffered recent hacks, the attacks targeted vulnerabilities on their smart contracts code, and API end points. Some of these bridges are trying to do a lot of things, have lots of moving parts and are very complex. In the case of Wormhole, they created not only a bridge but a protocol that allows any message to be relayed across multiple chains, while useful the added complexity may prove to be a mistake. We believe it would be better to focus every design detail on resiliency. Roninchain attack resulted in 600M dollars being lost!

A big disadvantage of federated bridges is that federators need to coordinate their actions.  This proved to be a challenge on our recent work testing RSK bridge and Chainsafe bridge. Not only are they difficult to deploy and maintain, but coordinating work among members of the bridge proved extremely difficult.

Many of these Federator bridges have limited  multi chain support, adding new chains adds complexity. For instance if you wanted to use RSK bridge to support multiple chains, you would end up having to deploy one bridge set for each one of the chains. Then coordinating the work among the different participants of the federation becomes an even more difficult task. A nightmare for any devops, and a security issue for the bridge itself.

Federated bridges  like RSK need several transactions to complete moving a token with minimal security. In this case, even while the platform is configured to always receive 5 out of 5 signatures, the high costs result in that there is always just 3 signatures, the other 2 are out of the picture for real world usage.

When things go bad for Federators, an it does happen often, lots of devops work required. This required work adds risks, coordination among the different parties running a Federator is often needed.

These are just some of the most notorious issues with the current generation of available bridges, there are many more considerations.

# Our solution, “Signatory bridges”.

Signatories based bridges share various of the same ideas that make Federated bridges work, but they simplify the components that make bridging possible .

Lets now go over how a token is moved using our new bridge. First the user sends the token into a  multi-signature contract that locks it. Signatories take notice of the deposits, once the deposits gets to a certain level of finality, signatories do their best attempt to make accessible a signed message certifying that a token is locked into the bridge contract.  Unlike Federators voting on the destination chain contract, a Signatory merely signs a message and blindly does its best to write to a website. The Signatory does not have any open ports, it is completely hidden from the internet. Does not communicate to other signatories  or even tries to call functions of any contracts. It works completely independently. It sees a transaction, it signs it when it is certain the transaction won't be rolled back.

Multiple Signatories running independently are signing the same transaction and doing their best to communicate it to the outside world. One or a few failing to do so, does not stop the transaction from being successful.  Our bridge is optimized for resiliency. A user is able to find enough Signatories signed messages corresponding to his deposit and put them together to form a claim.

The user then switches to the destination network and submits a transaction with the claim to the bridge contract on the other side. If the claim is valid the contract then mints or unlocks the coins/tokens and sends them to the user submitting the claim.

The way the destination contract knows the claim is valid is by checking the validity of the signatures. The contract stores the public keys of the signatories it trusts so that it can verify that the claim message was in-fact signed by the signatories.

This simplifies the bridging process a lot; there is no voting meaning lower complexity and much lower costs on the contract. There is no need for Federators paying contracts for each of the votes. Instead of multiple transactions, this signatory method only needs 2. One deposit, one claims. While at the same time maintaining the levels of security of signatories and even improving it. You will notice that it wont make much difference to have a 3 out of 5 signature check scheme, or a 15 out of 20, it would still only be 2 transactions.

Signatories are EXTREMELY simple, small code footprint, well-known cryptography primitives. Closed box, rarely will need an update if ever. Can be deployed in minutes, no open ports and can be kept under a firewall. Set it and forget it. No access to keys by Devops. The Signatory makes use of a docker container with an encrypted file system. Upon its first run internally generates keys and informs of its public key.

Notice how the only thing that the signatories did is they certified a transaction exists and is valid. Signatories did not move any value from one chain to another.  There may a time when laws may need services moving value to report on them.

Another big upside, adapting the code for non EVM compatible blockchains is extremely easy. Only the claiming contracts need to be rewritten. Imagine the same on a Federators based bridge, they need to support making calls for different types of blockchains. A lot more complex!

CryptoCurrency,DFX: Decentralized FX for foreign stablecoin - 13m DFX in circulation - 6.5m market cap - Doxxed team - hyper-efficient AMM - Unique bonding curve - Minimized slippage - Optimized capital - Maximal utility!,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e7294dan0ct81.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a7c5f94559f082874c3dfb08acdb2574c81f4bb

**What is DFX?**

While most stablecoins today are pegged to the USD, this leaves out the rest of the world. DFX is here to change that.

**DFX is a decentralized foreign exchange protocol focused on foreign stablecoins.**

*Watch this short video to get a quick intro:*

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs4bA2GPFjM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs4bA2GPFjM)

The team is building a ecosystem focused on three key aspects:

1. Building a **hyper-efficient AMM** optimized for foreign stablecoins
2. Seek out **stablecoin issuers** around the world and their on/off-ramps
3. Incentivizing and **bootstrapping liquidity** for these stablecoins

**The Vision:** The next generation of global finance cannot rely solely on USD-pegged stablecoins. A decentralized protocol where users can swap non-USD stablecoins pegged to various foreign currencies is not only important, but necessary.

**DFX is building stablecoins for the world.**

DFX Finance works with global agencies to create foreign FIAT-backed stable-coins that allow residents of those countries to easily onboard into crypto . Everyone knows USDC, but since crypto is global, it only makes sense that each country has their own official stablecoin. CADC, EURS, XSGD are a few examples.

And the DFX protocol offers very attractive interest rates for staking those foreign stablecoins. Usually between 15-25% APR and some ranging to 80%.

An automated market maker (AMM) on Ethereum allows the decentralized exchange of tokens according to a bonding curve. For DFX, this curve will be dynamically adjusted by using real world FX price feeds from Chainlink to ensure that you get the best rates. **The DFX bonding curve** continually shifts to allow for the most efficient trades. This means you can get extremely close to spot prices while taking advantage of Ethereum's quick settlement finality.

&amp;#x200B;

Bootstrapping the world with minimal slippage, optimized capital and maximal utility.

In building the protocol, DFX will bring liquidity and volume to fiat-backed stablecoins everywhere. If you are thinking of issuing a stablecoin in your country or if you are a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp in your jurisdiction, make sure to get in touch: [https://dfx.finance/](https://dfx.finance/)

Working with stablecoin issuers in foreign countries and their local crypto on-ramps will be necessary to onboard the masses into DeFi. DFX aims to create partnerships with stablecoin issuers around the world and help them bootstrap the usage of their tokens to the world. U need a stellar team for that. They have it! This project is being developed by a team who is serious about DeFi and have worked for the Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys, UMA, Omisego, Deloitte, and TD Bank. You can check out the team on [https://www.linkedin.com/company/dfxfinance](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dfxfinance)

**The DFX token** is the governance token for the DFX protocol. In the near future, DFX will be controlled by a DAO where DFX token holders will be able to submit proposals and vote on protocol changes as a decentralized community:-Name: **DFX**\-Max supply: 100m.-Current circulation supply: 12m-Rest of tokens is **vested** to be released in roughly 8 years.

Federal loans/financial aid have covered a very small portion of what I'll need to get through school, so I'm looking to take out some private loans (around 20k each year for 3 years). I had some questions.

* Is it realistic to obtain a loan this big without a co-signer as a 21 year old with a credit score of 681? If it helps, my degree is going to be electrical engineering and computer engineering (double major).
* If I *do* need to ask my parents to co-sign, what kind of control does that grant them? 
* Do places allow you to apply for the same loan twice, once with and without a co-signer, to compare what they're willing to give?
* I've noticed APRs vary on fixed loans. How often can the rates change? 
* Is it a bad idea to apply for multiple loans and accept the best offer?
* Besides the forgiveness period and APR rates, what else should I look out for in a loan?

Ultimately, I’m hoping to secure in the ballpark of $65,000 (waiting on a couple more estimates to nail down) for home improvement projects with as little additional out-of-pocket monthly payment as I can. I own two houses that we’re looking to leverage to our benefit if possible. I’m considering two options based on my reading

Option 1: HELOC on my primary residence. I hoped I could do a cash-out refinance to offset the cost of the cash loan by lowering my mortgage payment. My current interest rate is too low to refinance now that rates have gone up. I missed that boat. As I understand it, a HELOC would increase my monthly out-of-pocket cost but avoid closing costs.

Option 2: Cash-out refinance on my rental house. I’d previously discussed refinancing that house and the advice I was given was that I didn’t owe enough to justify the closing costs, etc. However, I wonder if that advice is the same considering a cash-out. My current interest rate would likely stay close to the same but it would allow me to reduce the mortgage payment to offset the loan payment. This benefit might make it worth paying the closing costs. 

Option 3: Something you’d suggest that I’m not thinking about.

Property details for reference:

Primary residence
Purchase price - $255,000
Purchase date - May 2016
Unpaid principal balance - $206,000

personalfinance,Can I afford all this travel? Plus general advice would be appreciated :),"Hello! I am generally a saver and anxious about spending money, so I figured I'd ask here for people with more experience than me to point out things I can improve, or to tell me to stop worrying so much and live my stupid life. Most of this is napkin math but I tried to be as conservative as possible. Thanks in advance!

**My dilemma:** I have 3 opportunities to travel in the next few months and am wondering if I can afford to go on all 3 trips. Again, this is all just napkin math, and I've only done surface research into actual costs. I just did this to get a ballpark and see if I'm too broke to do any of this. Here's the info:

**Trip 1: PNW** \- My bf has family here we'd like to visit, and we are also thinking of moving here in a few years so we'd like to scope the scene. Would be a 3 day trip.

* Plane tickets: $550
* Food: $100 (we'd mostly be eating with family)
* Transportation: $0 (can borrow their car)
* Misc spending: $50
* **Total: $700**

**Trip 2: DMV** \- I have friends there who I haven't seen in a few years, and I have never been to this area. Would be a 3 day trip.

* Plane tickets: $800
* Food: $200
* Transportation: $80
* Misc spending: $50
* **Total: $1130**

**Trip 3: Road trip** \- When I graduate I want to take 2 weeks off and visit family/friends, plus go camping and hiking and such. This is the trip I most want to go on since I haven't really had a break from work and school in... a while. Grad school sucks, y'all.

* Gas: $330
* Camping/hotel costs: $200
* Food/supplies: $270
* Misc spending: $100
* **Total: $900**

**Current earnings/expenses**: I (23F) am a full time master's student working part time in my field of study (engineering). I currently make $550 (gross) biweekly. I put 15% into my 401k (2% match), $50 per paycheck into savings, and the rest is just enough to cash flow all my expenses. I have a $9k emergency fund in savings. No debt except a $6k federal student loan (3.76%) that I don't have to pay until the government stops kicking that can down the road.

I live with family and commute to school/work so my expenses are mostly just gas ($50/week), contributing to groceries ($40/week), and eating out ($75/week). I fully admit to splurging a little too often on take-out since I rarely have the time or energy to cook. I rationalize it because I'm not eating into my savings and can still afford gas and groceries, plus other periodic expenses like car maintenance. It's also easy for me to write off since I'll graduate soon and make Grown-Up Engineer Money (even though this is, of course, not the right mindset to have). Food is the one thing I don't feel anxious spending money on so I might be too blind to it, so please to talk some sense into me if needed. 

I've maxed out my Roth IRA for the past 3 years (including 2022). I currently have $4k vested in my 401k, plus another $1000 not yet vested. I'd like to retire early (say, 50ish), but I haven't fully worked out how much I need to save to get there. But I'm sure that's a better question for r/Fire.

I currently have $23k in general savings (in addition to my emergency fund). I saved a crapload before grad school to pay for tuition and living expenses, since I wasn't planning on working during school. However, I've only needed to touch these savings for tuition/books since working part time has covered the rest. Now that school is all paid for, this money is just sitting around until I figure out what to do with it. I would fund all the above travel with these savings. I plan on moving out when I graduate and will need some cash for a security deposit and furniture and such, but I don't know what a reasonable number would look like. I could fully pay off my student loan when payments restart but with such low interest/monthly payments I'm not sure if I should, although I suppose it's a better alternative than letting it sit in a savings account. I'm not sure what else I should save this money for but my anxiety is telling me to hoard it. Which is why I'm here!

If I go on all three trips with my current math it would cost just under $3k, which would leave me at $20k in savings. I am nervous dropping $3k on something ""useless."" Even spending the savings on tuition, which is what I saved it for, made me anxious. Now that I've typed this all out I feel like I can afford it, but there's still a part of my brain telling me I have overlooked something and the costs will actually be much more than $3k. Please snap me out of it or tell me what I'm missing. Thanks!",finance,1649883899.0

I’m about to move from Houston to NYC, so I’ll be selling my car. Similar models are selling for 22k-24k right now. I spoke to some dealerships, and I should expect to get ~17,500 for it.

I have student loans in the amount of $12,052.72. Currently interest rates of student loans are 0%, but usually the interest rate is 3.73%. I pay $193.73 every month, and have been paying it down interest free over covid.

I want to pay off one of these loans with the money I make from selling my car. I’m leaning towards paying off my student loans, since the interest rate is higher. Then I can pay my car note off more aggressively since I won’t have my student loan payments to make.

I’ve also considered holding onto the money until student loan interest rates go back up.

Main problem a lot of people have is they are so full of themself. Do you really think you can time the market better then insane smart people spending full time on crypto? Hired by institutions and years of experience ?

LUNA bought thousands of BTCs the last weeks and they were wrong most of the time. Partly hours before a dip.

Timing the market is pure speculation and I really hope everyone gets lucky buying the bottom or selling at the top but the last weeks really proofed the opposite of how volatile crypto is.

5% spike or plunge is recently a daily hick up on the chart

I highly recommend to stick to a plan like most people do. Set yourself a goal around what value you want to buy, what do you expect BTC to hit and buy/sell 5-10% area around that goal.

Any crazy bullish news on the way up? Sell +10% of your goal.

5% over our goal to buy? Still a good deal. As I said earlier 5% change happens sometimes on a day.

But trust me the worst feeling is being to greedy and wait for too long no matter if it’s selling or buying.

Let’s take current prices as example. Damn it dipped under 40k but maybe it goes a bit further? BAMM it’s 41k today and the worst feeling is when you FOMO chase a pump towards 50k and then it goes down.

If the fed wants people to stop trading crypto on margin, they bump their stupid interest rates up. If they pull this stunt, I simply switch to borrowing euro stablecoins for margin trading.

&gt;The state hopes to have all new bus purchases be electric and have zero emissions by 2027. By 2035, New York wants all buses in operation to be electric. The plan hopes to be able to use $500 million from the budget toward school bus electrification. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority will help the school districts finalize a plan and provide support as needed.

Without inflationary monetary policy, perpetual war is impossible. The US military is the largest consumer of energy and the largest emitter of carbon on the planet. Inflationary economics also promotes consumerism because time preference is eroded and therefore people buy cheap crap they don’t need (why save when it’s worth less tomorrow). Because savings are not a viable way to store wealth for the future, investors are forced to seek yield in profitable businesses. To remain profitable, businesses have to produce and promote cheap crap without regard for externalities. All of this and more are the direct outcome of fiat money.

Our only debts are my car payment ($343 a month), 2 credit card payments (one for each of us, combined total being about $90), and my mom's student loan payment (which has pretty much been forgiven, but the payment has been factored in at $36 a month if she were to pay on it). The car loan is in both of our names, but I am the one in charge of the payments on it as it's my car, all of which are made on time each month. My mom's car was paid off prior to us starting the mortgage process. My mom has acknowledged that she needs to bring her credit card balance down and is working to do so; my own credit card is paid in full each month. The loan is a conventional 30 year fixed for first time homebuyers through a credit union.

One of the stipulations with the loan we're getting is we can only get homes in PUDs, which pretty much limits us to single family homes and townhouses, both of which we're okay with. The issue lies in that a lot of the single family homes and townhouses are either out of our price range, in not so great neighborhoods, or are for investors. Our only real wants in a home is a 2 bedroom with all electric and central heat and air. Pretty much everything else we can be flexible on as long as it does not have gas because I have birds, who cannot be around gas from my research and I'm not giving them up. A lot of the homes that are for sale in the area are condos. We did not shop around for rates with different lenders (probably our biggest mistake here), so we're unsure if a different lender would've allowed us to purchase a condo, therefore expanding our options.

All of that said, I'm feeling very uncertain about what our next steps should be. My mom and I are both in agreement that the apartment we're living in is no longer worth living in for a number of reasons and that we can do better, and we're both in agreement that we want to move out. The question is where we go. We were hoping for a home, but with our options so limited, I'm questioning whether or not it's worth it to keep trying or if we should just learn from this experience, move into another apartment (probably closer to our jobs), continuing improving financially, and try again next year, when the market is hopefully better or give it about another month to see what happens, which would put us at around mid-May. I'm being promoted at the end of the month, and my new position comes with a pay raise and a quarterly bonus; I'm unsure on the numbers right now, and I wouldn't have a month's worth of pay checks at my new rate of pay until June.

So I guess my question is this: should we go ahead and give it until around mid-May with the hopes of finding a home or just stop while we're ahead, move into another apartment, and see what happens in a year? Would it even be worth it to shop around for lenders that would possibly sell a condo to a first time homebuyer? (We are aware it would be another hit on our credit since it's outside of the 14 day period.)",finance,1649915577.0

*""Under this rule, there would be no leeway for the central reserve bank, as money supply increases could be determined ""by a computer"" and therefore business could anticipate all monetary policy decisions.""*

So then to implement K-percent rule is it even necessary to have a central bank? The Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing could just automatically print money according to the rule.

NGDP level target:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_income_target

NGFPT targets ""inflation,"" which is more subjective to measure so couldn't it be modified to be more like the K-percent rule where we just target the money supply so that with a NGDP target of 5% if GDP is 3% then instead of bankers targeting 2% inflation, the Treasury would just automatically increase the money supply by 2%?

Forex,Is AUD/USD ready for another leg higher?,"The US Dollar’s strength on the back of soaring yields over the last few days has resulted in AUD/USD pulling back from its highs, but the pair could be ready to start a new leg higher after potentially basing this week. 

AUD/USD seems to have been able find support at the key psychological level of 0.7400, which also happens to be around the previous cycle highs, indicating that the uptrend is still intact. 

With today’s AU labour force data holding steady, the impressive rebound over the past few months has put Australia back at full employment. This could further fuel current speculation over a June rate hike from the RBA following their recent hawkish pivot, and naturally support the Aussie Dollar higher.

However, with the Fed meeting looming and a 50bps rate hike all-but-confirmed, it’s important to remember all trading carries risk as US yields could resume their rally and pull the greenback higher with them.

Either way, this pair is definitely worth adding to the watchlist for the coming weeks.",finance,1649926430.0

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the housing market sucks. I'm wondering how much this high-interest rate affects the long-term investment of a home. I owned a home for 5 or 6 years and lost it in a divorce to the ex. Currently renting and don't mind it, but would rather pay slightly more for a home that builds equity. I just know a house is better money spent than renting. My question is for those that are familiar with how investing in homes/property works. Does buying at a higher interest rate now(4.5-5%) seem better on long-term investment or does waiting 6 months to 2 years for a rate to drop to something like 2.9%? Does the increased interest increase the cost beyond what you would gain equity-wise from buying in a year or two? Will the value of the property grow enough in 2 years that the extra interest is worth agreeing to pay today or would it be better to get a lower interest rate and pay the increase in property value in 2 years?

*""To stimulate investment, especially in fixed capital, we may discuss the issues of mining, namely the creation of data centers and the corresponding infrastructure,""* Mishustin noted.

Before that, the First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, Kseniya Yudaeva, called cryptocurrencies a highly speculative tool, which is actually a financial pyramid. She warned that legalization could encourage citizens to invest in cryptocurrencies actively.

personalfinance,I want to sell stock to pay off a loan,"Hello! I'll try to make this short and omit non-important details. Got roof replaced in 2018 on old home, took out personal loan to pay for it and consolidate some credit card debt. Sold said house in 2020, paid off remaining credit card debt with proceeds. Still have the loan.

Loan has 15 months remaining, 9.32% interest rate, about $1050/month payment. New house roof is about 16 years old, may need replacement in 4-5 years. I put money away in VOO ETF rather than sitting in savings account, contributed to it monthly, and it has had it's standard 9-15% (or more) annual growth.

I'm now at the point where the amount I have in VOO will intersect with the remaining loan balance, so I could potentially sell my stocks to pay off the loan 15 months early and free up that large monthly payment. I looked into it a bit and found that it may be worthwhile to sell stock if the rate of return is equal to or higher than debt.

Pros:

* Free up large payment every month.
* Can continue to put money back in VOO.
* Can begin to exercise company stock options through my employer.
* Can eliminate my last, highest-interest rate debt.
* Can begin to pay off student loans quicker (interest rates are super low).

Cons

* I spend a lot of money all at once.
* I lose my low average cost per share in VOO.
* Credit score would tank initially.

Any thoughts or feelings are appreciated. The monthly payment doesn't kill us, it's just a thorn in my side.

2. The only two things running gas: the dryer and a tankless boiler (for heated floors). Hot water runs on a [electric heat pump](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Rheem-Performance-Platinum-80-Gal-10-Year-Hybrid-High-Efficiency-Smart-Tank-Electric-Water-Heater-XE80T10H45U0/312741506)
3. **We haven't lived in the house, so we don't know how much our electric bill will be (this is probably important, since we don't know whether it'll be worth or not)**

We got the final proposal from sunrun (still waiting on the sunpower one). Roof total replacement is needed at 18k (they gave 2.3k credit), and 30K for the system (buy/finance with loan) before tax incentive. With incentive (26% federal, 5K state, 5% of installation per year for four years, total 20% from city off property tax, and apparently the city one allows to deduct the cost for roof and gutter as well). The final net cost after all is 24K for system and roof.

personalfinance,How does making large principal payments on HELOC affect monthly payments?,"I'm looking to take out a Home Equity Line of Credit to pay for a solar panel project for my home.  I understand that I would only be paying interest on the money that I use.  For example, if I take out $150k HELOC and my solar project costs $80k, I'm only paying on the $80k I used and not the full $150k.  My question is what happens to my monthly payments if I make a large principal payment?  In the case of solar, there is a 26% Federal Income Tax Credit.  My plan is to use that full credit to make a large principal payment on the loan after the 1st year.  So in my example, that would be $20,800.  Would that mean that money goes back in to be drawn (if I choose to) and I would only be paying interest on the remaining $59,200?",finance,1649953802.0
personalfinance,"In a lot of debt and struggling, would you default or file bankruptcy?","I have been in a lot of debt for over 7 years. 


Was always debt free, and It all started with a large medical bill, that I didn’t have money to cover to put it on credit cards so out about 25k on a credit card and figured I’d just pay it off.. well I struggled paying it down and each month I’d end up having to basically use the credit card to pay for food and bills so it stayed stagnant.. figured I’d eventually pay it off with tax returns and such.

But things kept getting worse and worse and slowly each month it would build up and up. 30k, 40k, by then the interest was so high I wasn’t even denting it. 2k payments a month would take down $150 of equity. 

Just last year I finally got a good job and make decent money now but my entire paychecks go towards debt and it feels like I’m living paycheck to paycheck.. and it would continue like this for years and years before I could pay it down.


At one point I was up to $75k credit card debt. At around 28% interest.


It was and still is unbearable. 
About 7 months ago I called up the credit cards and put myself on a payment plan. They closed the credit cards and moved them into a program with low interest rates so I’m finally seeing a dent but it’s still behind crippling. And after having paid almost 50k in just interest alone over the years, I’m getting so fed up and depressed. I truly feel like I ruined my life and each day is a struggle.


In the past year I have managed to take it down from 75k to $55k but it’s still so absurd. I wanted to see if anyone had advice.


The program I got put in tanked my credit so I’m in the low 500s and unable to obviously get any type of assistance with that score and that scares me.


I have the following debt and interests

$28,900 at 2%

$13,170 at 6%

$2,700 at 12%

$4,892 at 20%

$8,229 at 30%

$1,078 at 0% that will incur $600 of interest if not paid off by next month.

I own a house and a car.

My monthly payments to just the debt is $3,220.
This leaves me with pretty much zero extra money. I’ve been living paycheck to paycheck for 7 years.. and honestly i don’t know if any of this is worth it.. but im terrified if I file bankruptcy or anything that my life will be ruined. Im almost 40 and plan on having kids in the next couple years but im scared I can’t afford anything as it is right now.
I can’t put any “extra” to the debt since each month drains me dry.

Any advice is welcome.. im so depressed I just want an end to this all.",finance,1649954346.0
personalfinance,Xfinity billing me for service I never ordered,"First, I typically use the Xfinity app to check my balance when I need to.  It is automated, so I normally don't even fuss with it. I have been an Xfinity (Comcast) INTERNET ONLY customer since early 2000's.  Don't have TV, Phone.  Just Internet since 2005.  I auto pay my bill every month.  I have never been late.  Own my own internet modem/router.  No real issues other than the usual stuff everyone else deals with.  Until now.

So, I was checking my account online through a web browser (this is relevant\*\*) and saw my usual $160 monthly internet bill. However, I also saw an Xfinity Mobile balance due of $1700+!  My first thought was WTF.  My second was, I have never had Xfinity Mobile in my life.

First, I chatted with...""Agent"".  I explained the issue and after literally 45 minutes of chatting...said it was all taken care of.  It has been escalated should be removed in a couple days. 

After a few days, I checked to see if the charge was still there.  It was.  Then I called back.  Again,...after an extremely long conversation on the phone...it was determined (from their end)...I had ordered two Galaxy Phones in August 2018 (I didn't) and they were delivered to my address and signed for a few days later(they weren't).   The account was opened with my name, address, and SS# (so they say).  The email that was used was an account I didn't recognize and the card they used over two years ago had an ending number I didn't recognize either.  HOWEVER, this would be escalated.  I should expect a call back from an ""agent"" in three days (last Thursday).  I didn't get a call back.

So...today...I actually go to the Xfinity store and talk to the Asst. Mgr Rick.  He also had his ""first day on the job training newbie"" next to him as well.   Again...explained the story to Rick (surprise...no record of the escalated issue I was on chat/phone for the last few weeks.)  He dug a little further.  Seems he found a tracking number, however FedEx only keeps records for two years....this was nearly four years ago.    They were activated the same day as delivery.  I asked, ""where?"" and he didn't have that info (that seemed relevant to me.).   I basically, in a very calm voice (I was cool as a cucumber..and Rick was a just doing his job and seemed sincere) asked, ""where we go from here?""  Essentially, the way I look at it, they have only part of the proof they were delivered.  Yes.  They were delivered to me according to their records, but without proof of delivery and signature from FedEx, I feel like I'm screwed.  The only reason I found out about this is I checked my balance through a web browser rather than the usual Xfinity App.  Oh yeah...to circle back from earlier\*\* in this post.  Xfinity and Xfinity Mobile are two separate apps/accounts/things.  Did you know that?  Neither did I. 

So, Rick said this time ""he would absolutely escalate it"" and that I should expect a call from him in the next 3-4 days.  If not, come back to the store and we will see what else we can do. So, there we are.

Do I even have a chance with this?  Any suggestions?",finance,1649954918.0
personalfinance,Considering all-in-one solution,"Hi all,

Hoping to share some info and get some recommendations/suggestions from this super knowledgeable community.

Quick background: I am slowly working my way through self-education on a lot of personal finance topics, from retirement to investing to deposit accounts and credit cards. 

My family is not one that has a longtime relationship with a money manager, there is no ""my dad's broker"", or anything like that - my parents were both in the nonprofit sector and are pretty ignorant of all things finance - although they have no need for much knowledge about it because of their situation. 

I bring that up only as context for my probably pretty basic questions...I have sat through some introductory meet-and-greet sessions with money managers but I have had a hard time discerning if they are giving me good information or just selling me.

I'm mid/late 30's and in a solid career job and am to the point where I am slightly stressed that the money I have earned is just sitting stagnant in a low-interest savings account. So I'm finally getting off my backside to try to do something about that.

My first thought is that there are probably good options out there for all-in-one financial solutions (Schwab comes to mind) for someone with my assets. 

With all that said:

$135k sitting in a low-interest savings account

$46k in a Merrill Lynch 401k from my former employer (just transitioned to new company)

$8k in a Webull account

$4.5k in an Acorns account 

Salary $155k (as well as some annual bonuses, again new at job but expecting \~$15k)

I own my own home but have a mortgage for \~$150k ($867/mo pmt)

I have 2 primary credit cards that I pay off each month - Chase Amazon Visa and a Discover It.

\--

Again, acknowledging this is a basic request because I'm uneducated in these things, I'm hoping to get recommendations for institutions that may be a good option for checking/savings/investment/retirement/possibly credit cards.

Also - do any places that offer those solutions also have integrated tax services? That's the other thing I know very little about and it's one reason I have not sold the stocks I've purchased via WeBull - not sure how to properly account for taxes and don't want to get stung later on. I know that's a stupid reason to not realize a gain but it's my reality for now.

personalfinance,Difficulty Refinancing Joint Auto Loan,"I'm helping my fiancée attempt a refi on her auto loan in PA.  Current interest rate is 6.12% and it looks like we could get it down to around 3.5% without too much trouble.  

The issue is that when the car was purchased it was a joint title with her father as co-borrower since her credit history wasn't long enough at the time.  

Now there is no issue with approval in her name, but the bank we were going to go with said that they could not do the refi and remove her father from the loan and title.  They suggested that we take a personal loan to pay off the car, change the title once we get it into my girlfriend's name only, and then roll the personal loan into an auto refi.  With interest rates rising I really don't like this option since we have to wait for the DMV to physically mail the title which in my experience has sometimes taken over a month.

Forex,Long term Forex strategy with EUR in decline,"Hi all, I am new to trading in general, so please excuse my post if it is not suitable or low quality.

Today the ECB announced that they will continue QE till quarter 3 and perhaps after that increase the interest rates. Meanwhile other countries with a lot of trade with EU like Norway, UK, US, and Canada all announced recently that rates will go up.

I translate this as it will be harder to acquire NOK, GBP, USD and CAD currency; with the result that the Euro will drop respectively. By the end of the year EU countries will also be required to have enough natural gas bunkered for the winter months, natural gas which they will need to have bought from example Norway, Canada and the US.

personalfinance,Refinancing car loan (4.99% to 1.99%) or aggressively pay down existing?,"I bought a 2020 Chevy Equinox at the start of the pandemic for $27,321 at 4.99% APR.  The loan was through the dealership and I really didn't question or bargain at all since I was super naive and had other things to worry about at that time.  Two years later I've begun reassessing my finances and actively read a lot of posts on this subreddit.  This is an amazing community and it's been a huge inspiration for me to take my personal finances seriously.

I've done a lot of self-education on how auto loans work and interest rates since then, honestly really feeling stupid for how I never learned this stuff earlier.  Last month I was able to successfully finish setting aside enough money for an emergency fund and now begin looking into aggressively combating some of my debt.  I'm aware of amortization being a thing and that earlier in the life of a loan you pay more interest than the latter half.

  Basically I'm worried that if I refinance my car loan (I'm not necessarily looking to extend the life of the loan, I know that can get me lower payments but I plan on contributing more of my income to pay it down early anyways) that I will be stuck paying interest again to a lender versus possibly just paying down the principal. 

I've ran it through a few amortization calculators and honestly feel a little lost as to which is more advantageous.

**Current Loan:**

* Loan term: 5/2020-9/2026 (75 months)
* Original Note: $27,321.00
* Interest Rate: 4.99%  
* Monthly Payment: $425.65
* Remaining Balance: $20,624.93
* Total Interest Paid: $2358.37 (out of a $4537.77 total)

**Future (possible) Loan:**

* Loan term: 36 months (I'm open to more or less depending on which makes more sense)
* Original Note: $20,624.93
* Interest Rate: 1.99%
* Monthly Payment: ~$590
* Total Interest Paid: $638.87


Extra Monthly Income (to throw at loan): $500

I went to my local credit union to get the 1.99% rate, however they weren't able to help me with my questions.  They seemed hyper-focused on getting my monthly payments as low as possible, which I totally understand that's the goal for most people refinancing car loans.  I'm just not sure if it's the best path forward for myself since I intend to make aggressive payments.

PS - I have also checked my loan paperwork after reading some posts about early repayment fees, thankfully my loan doesn't include those.  (It just requires that I pay the interest accrued up until that date).

Edit: I ran both loans through an amortization calculator from Investopedia and added the estimated ""Total Interest Paid"" for each of the loans to the info above",finance,1649961707.0

cybersecurity,Executive Order 14028 implications on Software Supply Chain Security,"Software supply chain cyber-attacks have increased by over 650% YOY in 2021 and the trend is continuing. According to a recent survey, more than three in five companies were targeted by software supply chain cyber-attacks in 2021. In the last year, several high-profile attacks demonstrated gaps in the software supply chain cyber-security. In the SolarWinds (network management software) and Codecov (codebase coverage tool) attacks, bad actors gained access into the development infrastructure to inject malicious code that was then downloaded by thousands of customers, into their own networks. In another incident, vulnerability in the Log4j framework put thousands of applications at risk of compromise. The ransomware attack on Kaseya’s (IT management software) customers was a result of vulnerability in the Kaseya admin console. The list goes on. Attackers are increasingly targeting upstream software supply chain code as a path to exploit downstream victims at scale. 

The Executive Order 14028, issued in early 2021, outlines actions that federal agencies need to take to improve the nation’s cybersecurity. It has 10 sections ranging from the adoption of zero trust architecture to creation of Cybersecurity Review Boards. However, almost one quarter of the order focuses on software supply chain security (section 4). The section states that “the development of commercial software often lacks transparency, sufficient focus on the ability of the software to resist attack, and adequate controls to prevent tampering by malicious actors.”  So why does this matter to all organizations? The EO requires federal agencies to comply with guidelines set forth in Section 4 with respect to software procured by them and requires software suppliers to “comply with, and attest to complying with” the requirements in Section 4.

## What are the directives in Section 4?

EO 14028 section 4 has directed NIST to improve the security and integrity of the software supply chain by establishing baseline security standards for software development, protection, and transparency. 

Three key workstreams of section 4 are as follows: 1) secure software development framework, 2) transparency/due diligence in the supply chain and 3) a proposed labeling program to demonstrate software security capabilities. For NIST response and guidelines, please review the detailed post using the following link: [EO 14028 Implications for Software Supply Chain](https://www.riskone.io/post/executive-order-14028-implications-on-software-supply-chain-security).",technology,1649971121.0
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 18th, 2022","Good Thursday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 18th, 2022.

# **Stocks could stay choppy as fears about the Fed overshadow earnings news - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/14/stocks-could-stay-choppy-as-fears-about-the-fed-overshadow-earnings-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Earnings season is here, and it may distract investors from other issues, but it’s not likely to be the big driver of the overall market in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Investors instead will keep an eye on the things that have been worrying the market — interest rates, inflation and war in Ukraine — and they will be sifting through company commentaries to see how these things are impacting the bottom line.
*****
&gt; A highlight of the week should be Thursday’s International Monetary Fund panel, which includes Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, among others. The panel is a debate on the global economy and is to be moderated by CNBC’s Sara Eisen.
*****
&gt; There are just a few economic reports, with several focused on housing. The National Association of Home Builders’ survey is released Monday. Housing starts are reported Tuesday, and existing home sales are Wednesday. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey is released Thursday, and manufacturing and services PMI surveys are issued Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think the market is so focused on the Fed and inflation and everything else that stocks will have a very weak response to earnings,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “I think the market is going to trade up, but the market is not going to give companies full credit.”
*****
&gt; Seven Dow blue chips report earnings next week, including IBM, Procter and Gamble, Travelers, Dow Inc, Johnson and Johnson, American Express and Verizon. Netflix reports Tuesday and Tesla reports Wednesday, both after the bell. Snap reports Thursday.
*****
&gt; Bank earnings will continue to roll in with Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon both reporting Monday. Transportation companies will also release their numbers, including trucking firms Knight-Swift Transportation and J.B. Hunt Transport. United Airlines, American Airlines and Alaska Air are also on the calendar, as are railroads CSX and Union Pacific.
*****
&gt; “Guidance is going to continue to be poor. Companies are going to whine and complain about cost pressures, even when they’re going to report improved results,” Golub said. “I think that’s going to make it a little sloppier in terms of the price action.”
*****
&gt; Strategists expect there could be more misses and fewer beats in the first quarter earnings season. Earnings are expected to increase by 6.3% for the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “I think you’re going to see a lot more differentiation and divergences,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist. “I think you’re going to see companies that have managed well, and others that have profit pressures. You’re going to see more extremes, relative to broad-based strength over the past two years.”
*****
&gt; Strategists expect the market to remain volatile, as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates again in early May and continue to tighten policy this year.
*****
&gt; “Our broader view is we’re going to continue to be in this big, broader choppy range,” Lerner said. “The way I see it for the next couple of months, is no new highs, and no new lows.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down about 1.5% for the week, as of Thursday afternoon.
*****
&gt; Rising bond yields were weighing on the stock market this past week, and the 10-year Treasury yield made a rapid move up to a high of 2.83% Wednesday from 2.70% on the previous Friday. It was at 2.82% Thursday.
*****
&gt; The big focus for the bond market will be Powell’s comments Thursday.
*****
&gt; “I think Powell’s going to be hawkish. He’s going to emphasize that they’re going to hike, hike a bunch, do the balance sheet and get on with it,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
&gt; # Neutral on stocks
&gt; Lerner said uncertainty about the Fed is one reason he downgraded the stock market from attractive to neutral this past week. He also did it based on rising yields and the defensive positioning he sees in the stock market.
*****
&gt; “Given the rise in yields, the comparative valuations are now in a place where stocks have historically had an average outperformance [versus bonds] of about 3.5%, rather than the double digits when yields are lower,” he said.
*****
&gt; Lerner said defensive sectors like consumer staples, health care, energy and REITS have been outperforming.
*****
&gt; “When you look at the more economically sensitive areas of the market — financials, transportation and home builders, they’re all lagging. That’s telling us the market is concerned about slower growth,” he said. “Our view is recession risk is still relatively low over the next year. However, this is telling you we’re more likely to have a slowdown in the economy. Part of that is the Fed and also the sticky inflation numbers.”

&gt; # MACD End Best Six Months Seasonal Signal Triggered

&gt; Last week we issued our annual Best Six Months Seasonal MACD “Sell” signal to our newsletter subscribers (arrow in the chart). But it is not an all-out sell. It’s a neutral signal for us to reposition our portfolios and get more defensive for the weaker time of the year from May to October – which is weakest in midterm years.

&gt; We have been calling it a “Sell” signal for years, but we are reconsidering that now as we don’t sell everything outright. We do sell some positions, tighten up stops, limit new buying and rotate into more defensive positions in sectors that historically do better in the Worst Six Months May-October, but we do not sell everything and hold many core positions.

&gt; We have been warning about heightened volatility all year, since our 2022 Annual Forecast out last December. And that is expected to continue into Q2-Q3 as we have major headline risk from Ukraine, inflation, the new Fed rate hike cycle, and China’s zero-Covid policy lockdowns that continue to hamper and exacerbate persistent supply chain issues. We are not bears, but we are not bulls either – we are neutral

&gt; # Sell Passover. Exodus: Movement of Your Portfolio

&gt; Much like the ancient Hebrews’ exodus out of Egypt, springtime and the Passover holiday are often an excellent time of year to consider portfolio maneuvers and repositioning as the “Best Six Months” of the year November-April comes to a close. In years like 2022 when the “Best Six Months” are underperforming, it is often an indication that the “Worst Six Months” AKA the “Sell in May” period will also be weak.

&gt; Some may remember the old saying on the Street, “Buy Rosh Hashanah, Sell Yom Kippur.” Though it had a good record at one time, it stopped working in the middle of the last century. It still gets tossed around every autumn when the “high holidays” are on the minds of traders as many take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

&gt; The basis for the new pattern, “Sell Rosh Hashanah-Buy Yom Kippur-Sell Passover,” is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here.

&gt; We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It’s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and opportune months. We then took it a step further and calculated the return from Yom Kippur to Passover, which conveniently occurs in March or April, right near the end of our “Best Six Months” strategy.

&gt; Perhaps it’s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 63.6% more advances, about half as many losses and average gains of 7.0%. From Passover to Yom Kippur DJIA averages just 1.9% and is littered with nasty declines.

&gt; # Short Interest Trade Mirrors Last Year

&gt; The first quarter of last year was marked by a period of massive short squeezes leading to outperformance of stocks with high levels of short interest. A little over one year later, the opposite has held true. As shown below, the stocks with the highest levels of short interest at the time of the last all time high on January 3rd have been the worst performers over the past few months. The decile of Russell 3,000 stocks with the highest levels of short interest at the start of the year have fallen 21.5% since January 3td while the first four deciles of stocks with the lowest levels of short interest have only fallen mid-single digits.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/041322-SIPF-RAY-3.png))**

&gt; The latest update of short interest data through the end of March hit the tape earlier this week. The average level of short interest as a percent of float for all Russell 3,000 stocks fell sequentially from the mid-March update but with an average short interest reading of 5.78%, current readings are roughly half of one percentage point higher than at the start of the year.

&gt; Breaking it down by industry group, retail has seen the biggest increase in average short interest and now has the highest level of any industry group. Autos are the runner-up in both departments as short interest has climbed from 8.2% on January 3rd to 9.75% today. Utilities, Banks, Insurance, Commercial and Professional Services, Materials, and Real Estate, meanwhile, are on the other end of the spectrum as the only sectors with short interest as a percentage of float below 4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/041322-SIPF-RAY-4b.png))**

&gt; Turning to individual stocks, Rent the Runway (RENT) now has the most elevated level of short interest as the only stock in the index with over half of its free-floating shares sold short. Conn's (CONN), however, comes close with 49.16% of its float sold short. Both stocks have seen sharp increases in bearish bets this year as those readings compare to 26.82% and 14.58%, respectively for RENT and CONN. Most of these heavily shorted names have been pain trades this year, but there are a small handful of exceptions. Gogo (GOGO) and Arch Resources (ARCH) have seen substantial rallies of 66.3% and 72.45%, respectively, as the broader market has pulled back. While not as strong of a performance, Dillard's (DDS) has also rallied solidly gaining 16%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/041322-SIPF-RAY-1.png)**

&gt; As previously mentioned, CONN finds itself near the top of the list of the most heavily shorted Russell 3,000 stocks, but it has been the one with the largest increase in short interest of the whole index since the January 3rd high. No other name has seen short interest rise by more than 30 percentage points in that time, but MedAvail (MDVL), Rent the Runway (RENT), and Frontier (ULCC) have seen readings rise over 20 percentage points.

&gt; # Defensives Propping Up New Highs

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has fallen in four of the past five sessions continuing to pull back from its lower high, but surprisingly, the net percentage of the index hitting new 52-week highs actually saw one of the strongest readings of the year on Friday as we show in the chart from our Sector Snapshot below. To cap off last week, a net 11% of S&amp;P 500 stocks were at new 52-week highs; the highest reading since January 5th which was only a couple of days after the index's last all-time high. Typically, we look at net new highs as a way to confirm moves in the broader market. In other words, it is viewed as better to see a larger number of stocks trading at new highs versus new lows. While net new highs are so far lower today, Fridays' double-digit positive reading was unusually high for a down day. Historically going back to 1990, the average net new high reading when the S&amp;P 500 has been lower on the day has only been 1.6%. It was even a strong reading compared to the average for up days (4.77%) as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/041122-Defensives-1.png))**

&gt; As for how new highs have held up relatively well as the broader market has pulled back, defensive sectors—Consumer Staples, Health Care, Utilities, and Real Estate—are almost entirely the ones to thank. To illustrate this, below we show the daily percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks hitting new highs that are from one of the four defensive sectors just mentioned. There is plenty of precedent in the past several years for these four sectors to account for all of a day's new highs including several days in late January and early February. At the high last Wednesday, over 90% of S&amp;P 500's new highs came from defensive sectors. On a 50-DMA basis, this reading is now at the highest level since the spring of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/041122-Defensives-2a.png))**

&gt; In other words, defensives have been a notable pocket of strength recently. As for just how large of a run they have been on, in the charts below we show the rolling one month change of these sectors going back to 1990 (2001 for Real Estate). While the rates of change have peaked, Health Care and Utilities are up double digits in the past month while Consumer Staples and Real Estate have risen high single-digit percentage points. For all sectors except for Real Estate, those rallies rank in the top 3% of all monthly moves since 1990 and Real Estates is still in the top decile of all monthly moves going back to 2001.

&gt; # BABY's Back

&gt; Since mid to late-2019 when interest rates really started to fall, the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 consistently provided a higher yield than the two-year US Treasury. With a higher payout plus the potential for price appreciation, equities looked more attractive to many investors. The period from the Financial Crisis through 2017 also saw a similar setup where the S&amp;P 500's dividend yield was higher than the yield on the 2-year, but before the Financial Crisis and the FOMC's zero-interest-rate policy, it was extremely uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to yield more than the two-year Treasury. This year has caused a tidal shift in the balance of power in yield between the S&amp;P 500 and the two-year Treasury. As the Fed came to the conclusion that inflation wasn't as transitory as originally thought and found itself behind the inflation curve, it shifted from a much more accommodative stance to one that was more biased towards tightening, and that shift resulted in one of the most rapid increases in two-year Treasury yields in decades. In the process of this spike in rates, back in February, the yield on the two-year rose back above the dividend yield of the S&amp;P 500 for the first time since 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/SPX-vs-2-yr-graph-1-041122.png))**

&gt; As Treasury yields have continued to spike, the premium in yield of two-year Treasuries relative to the dividend yield of the S&amp;P 500 reached an important milestone last Friday (4/8). As shown in the chart below, the spread between their yields widened out to 110 basis points (bps), taking out the high of 108 bps from 2018. At these levels, the spread between the two is now the widest it has been in fourteen years since the Financial Crisis. It started with long-term Treasury yields, but as the overall trend in rates has been higher, most of the Treasury yield curve is now yielding more than the S&amp;P 500. For years now, investors have had a TINA (There Is No Alternative) relationship with the stock market, but as interest rates have shot higher, TINA is taking a backseat to BABY (Bonds Are Better Yielders).

&gt; # Potential Sector Winners and Losers This Earnings Season

&gt; Earnings season unofficially got underway yesterday with results from Blackrock, JPMorgan Chase, and Delta Airlines. The results were mixed, with JPMorgan Chase shares selling off on the results amid a sizable Russia-related writedown, Blackrock shares little changed, and Delta shares up 6% on its results.

&gt; Delta’s results are encouraging for the travel sector, though we would be careful to translate the news over to the very broad industrials sector and is further along in its recovery while facing a wide range of economic challenges.

&gt; The cool reception to financial services results on Wednesday may foretell what will be a challenging quarter. “Financial services companies, particularly the big global banks, faced a number of challenges in the first quarter,” noted LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “The flattening yield curve, Russian sanctions, and a difficult year-over-year comparison after significant loan loss reserve releases in the first quarter of 2021 almost certainly set the stage for lower earnings.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Financial Chart of the Day, energy sector earnings will likely produce by far the strongest earnings growth in the quarter. But on the other end of the spectrum, financials earnings are expected to see a significant annual decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-4.14.22.png))**

&gt; The aforementioned macroeconomic challenges coupled with this expected earnings decline were among the reasons LPL Research’s Strategic and Tactical Asset Allocation Committtee (STAAC) downgraded its financials sector view to neutral earlier this month despite relatively attractive valuations. The sector has also experienced price weakness that, from a technical analysis perspective, the Committee thinks may signal continued near-term underperformance. Finally, negative earnings revisions in the month leading up to earnings season, shown in the chart below, suggest some caution is prudent ahead of reporting season, in our view.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-2-4.14.22.png))**

&gt; The STAAC also downgraded views of industrials and consumer discretionary to negative this month, a stance certainly supported by recent earnings revisions. Those two sectors are generally hurt by high energy costs, Russian sanctions, the China lockdowns, and ongoing supply chain disruptions.

&gt; So what sector might be winner this earnings season? The obvious answer is the natural resource sectors, i.e., energy and materials. But perhaps less obvious, we think utilities will be able to grow earnings double-digits. STAAC upgraded its utilities view to neutral this month. The sector may benefit from energy sensitivity and is less exposed to a potential slowdown in the economy.

&gt; STAAC’s view of healthcare, another potential earnings winner, is positive. Healthcare quietly generated a 7 percentage point upside surprise to earnings last quarter, is a reopening beneficiary, is relatively less economically sensitive, and is more insulated from supply chain issues and slower growth overseas than the cyclical sectors.

&gt; Finally, don’t fall asleep on technology. Our view of the sector is still just neutral but double-digit earnings growth in the first quarter looks likely, while estimates have held up well over the past month despite the global economic slowdown.

personalfinance,Backdoor Roth 1099-R confusion,"I am trying to get my taxes sorted and I am having a bit of trouble with my backdoor Roth conversions.

I made $6000 in non-deductible contributions for the year 2021 and $2500 for the year 2022 into traditional IRAs. I did two separate backdoor Roth conversions. One was for $6000 and the other was for $2500. These both happened in 2021.

Now I have two 1099-Rs from my brokerage. One is for $6000 and the other for $2500. When I entered the 1099-Rs into turbo tax my federal tax due went up by $2720.

I know I can add my contributions under the ""Deductions &amp; Credits"" section in turbo tax. Do I put in $6000 here? I am confused because I contributed a total of $8500 in the year 2021 but it was split into different contribution years. Do I have to wait until 2022 to put in the $2500 contribution in my taxes? Does that mean I have to pay taxes on the second 1099-R for $2500?

vet,"Cat losing hair, scratching, and poor appetite – NEED ADVICE","**TLDR: I need advice on what to do about my cat that is barely eating, losing hair, scratching, and vomiting (1-2 times a week). See pics below. Been to the vet with her twice, they haven't been able to give her a diagnosis, but they think it could be IBD or food allergies.**

Hello,

I started fostering an 8 y/o, female, DMH cat named Momma three weeks ago – I actually just adopted her! :)

I have already been to the vet with her twice. The first visit was just to get her up-to-date on all of her vaccines/flea/deworming treatments. The vet said she had bronchitis so she prescribed an antibiotic which I syringe-fed to her every 12 hours for two weeks. The vet also gave me a topical appetite stimulant to rub inside her ear once a day, in the morning. Even with the appetite stimulate, she still eats very little – at first I thought she was just stressed out from moving to an unfamiliar place – but now I am really starting to get concerned.

I have done tons of my own research and have tried all different kinds of wet food, broth/food toppers, baby food, salmon/tuna fish, etc. I have tried to spoon feed her (she will only lick a little bit and becomes disinterested the more I try). The only things that she will eat without hesitation are Temptations and the Churu squeezable cat treats – I realize these aren't very nutritious though so I am still trying to get her to eat her wet/dry food (Wellness brand). She also vomits 1-2 times a week (I have had her for about 4 weeks), and it's pretty random every time (not after a meal or medicine).

Over the past week, I have noticed she is losing a lot of hair, and scratching at her ears to the point that she has developed a bald spot under her left ear. It is red and a little crusty and my initial thought was that it could be ringworm – so I took her to the vet again and they ran a black light test on the area. The vet said it lit up, but couldn't give a definitive answer on whether or not she has ringworm without additional testing.

The vet thinks that Momma has IBD and that could be why she is vomiting/decreased appetite. The vet asked another doctor for a second opinion, and that vet said Momma may have food allergies, but again there is no definitive answer unless I get additional testing.

During the second trip to the vet they gave Momma steroid injection to see if that would help with the inflammation in her intestines and itching. They also told me to continue the topical appetite stimulant and try adding 5mg of Pepcid twice a day for the IBD.

I feel like there are so many unknowns and I am really scared about how little she is eating. I just tried force feeding her with a syringe for the first time today and that did not go very well – I wrapped a towel around her but she still managed to wiggle her way out.

I have attached pictures of the bald spot beneath her ear/on her head. I also attached a picture of her in her pink bed when I first got her 4 weeks ago (before she started losing hair).

Any advice about the hair loss, vomiting, scratching, &amp; lack of appetite would be much appreciated!

personalfinance,Help with job decision,"Hey all, 

Trying to get some feedback on a potential job change for a federal (GS) position. 

Backstory: Served 10 years in Air Force, separated in September and took a job making $120k a year. I have 3 elementary school age kids and my wife does not work or really have a skill that has a high income potential, so money is important to me. 

This company has a great 401k and medical benefits. For my medical, I pay about $500 a month for family to include dental and vision. 

The 401k contributes via profit sharing 10.2% of my income to my 401k automatically, with none from my end, but no matching. 

Well, my old military job wants me, and I got an offer as a GS12 step 9 which is about $101,560. 

The medical benefits are about the same. It’s the pension and other factors that I want to justify a $20k a year loss. 

Also, there is no real growth for my position and the federal system does not give cost of living increases like the private sector does. 

Can anyone give me scenarios of why you would take a federal job with a pension over a $20k loss other than job stability?

Are there things I should also consider. Usually it’s the benefits, but I feel like this position already has good benefits. 

I’m trying to figure out the long term, retirement side and where I am better off. What’s the pension worth in 20-30 years. Vs a minimum of 12-13k added to my 401k without my own contributions. 


Theoretically.  I could max my 401k and have 10.2% added and have over $33k a year added to a 401k. 


Say I work in the federal system for 25 years and leave, that “pension” is gone, right?

Any guidance on this decision from those more experienced in the job market would be appreciated :)

Bitcoin,Common Critique - BITCOIN MINING IS A WASTE OF ENERGY,"You’ve probably heard claims like “Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than all of Argentina” or “Bitcoin mining uses more energy than all of Google operations”. Claims that will earn the raising of eyebrows, but fail to address the fundamental question is the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining is worth the benefits? This question should be broken down into two aspects: energy consumption and hardware churn.

The energy used by Bitcoin miners does three powerful things:

**Energy consumption**

1.Secures all the wealth stored on the Bitcoin network in a decentralized state.

Most current financial systems are controlled by a centralized entity, banks, credit unions, federal reserve, etc. This means that those central parties can manipulate funds, stop transactions or do whatever they feel is in the “best interest” of whatever source of power is pushing them to act. For example, Canada recently confiscated funds that were donated to a protesting group they did not agree with. Banks, credit unions, GoFundMe, and many other entities were asked to freeze accounts, stop payments or take action in some way to prevent funding the protesters. Because Bitcoin has no single point of control, flexing this level of power is not possible whether you’re an individual or a sovereign nation.

2.Creates a financial incentive that promotes renewable energy sources

Bitcoin mining has become a profitable industry for many companies. One major expense mining companies face is energy costs. What is the cheapest energy long-term? You guessed it, renewables. There is a built-in financial incentive to acquire the cheapest energy for these “for-profit” companies which means every mining company will seek out integrating renewable energies as part of their operational setup. With greater demand for renewables, renewable companies will allocate more funds for research and development to improve wind, solar, and hydro technologies to better fulfill the added market demand. Coming full circle, Bitcoin mining is not only promoting the adoption but also the improvement of renewable energy technology.

3.Provides stability to unstable power grids

An interesting aspect of Bitcoin mining is the ability for miners to be turned on or off ad hoc without affecting operational infrastructure, unlike cement, steel, or any other industrial entity. Because of this, we are seeing grid operators partnering with mining facilities to best make use of the energy grids. In Texas, there was a recent overload on the power grid when a freeze came through and every household had to turn off their heater. With the amount of energy needed to sustain every business and household, the energy grid was at a near collapse and rolling blackouts were pushed to keep the grid intact. Since the freeze, the grid has been expanding with added renewables and with miners leveraging much of the “excess” or unused energy. In the event of another freeze where the household energy consumption is expected to spike, the energy companies would pay the mining companies to turn off a portion of their Bitcoin miners to free up the needed energy supply to the grid. Once the household load subsides, the Bitcoin miners can be turned back on utilizing the freed-up “excess” energy.

**Hardware Churn**

The physical lifespan of a current ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miner is between 2-3 years. Financial lifespan will have a broader range depending on multiple factors such as cost of energy usage, when the miner comes online, the hash rate growth of the network, and what the Bitcoin price does during the miner’s lifespan. 

Another factor that’s had a significant impact on mining is the rate at which hardware technology has evolved, specifically for ASIC miners. As soon as a new miner is released, there is a stronger and more efficient miner right around the corner. This has led to a lot of churn with large-scale mining operations quickly retiring old miners and replacing them with new ones.

Given that Bitcoin mining is still relatively new, especially from a commercialization view, mining technology is evolving at a rapid rate which means if you are in the business of mining for profit, you’ll likely continue purchasing the new mining rigs to keep your financial returns competitive with your peers. This leaves many “older” mining rigs in a position of no man’s land where they can’t return profits worth their operational costs and they can’t be re-purposed for any other use.

I believe this is the most valid critique of Bitcoin mining but one that can hopefully be addressed in the near future. There have been a few ideas floating around, such as integrating retired miners with new home energy builds to help offset energy costs while maintaining the Bitcoin network or building miners in a way where once they are decommissioned, they can be better stripped to have their components re-purposed. Either way, hardware churn is a top concern of the Bitcoin community and is likely to be addressed as more hardware manufacturers enter the space.

**In Summary**

*Bitcoin mining is a waste of energy*

This critique is COMPLICATED - On one hand, the energy Bitcoin consumes is used to secure all of the stored wealth in a decentralized state, provides stability to power grids, and promote renewable energy development and implementation. On the other hand, the physical miners are often replaced frequently with no real repurposable utility for the retired miners.",cryptocurrency,1649981446.0

personalfinance,Where to fit in college funds in savings budgets?,"Hey /r/PF,

I've looked at the prime directive, but was curious to see where other people view college savings for kids. Location is CA, so no tax advantage unfortunately for 529s. Basic info:

* household income of ~$200k gross
* e-fund funded
* kid 1 ~2 years
* kid 2 ~8 months
* early / mid 30's for both of us

Currently, no debt outside of two auto loans and mortgage as follows:

* Auto 1 - $22k balance @ 3.2%
* Auto 2 - $28k balance @ 2.9%
* Mortgage - $580k @ 2.6% fixed 30 (VHCOL)

As far as savings for retirement, I have no employer match for 401k and my wife is self employed. We save (on a monthly basis):

* 401k $1,708
* IRA $500
* 529 (kid 1) $500
* 529 (kid 2) $500

It works out to be just shy of $40k annually out of our pocket. While I don't want to pay off the mortgage early with the sub 3% interest rate, I have been slowly chipping away at the auto loans to get them paid off early. However, should I consider stopping or limiting the 529 contributions to get the autos paid off sooner? If I stop them completely and shift the money into auto 1, I could have it paid off in 12 months, then start contributions back for 529s and double up payments on auto 2 (original payment + what I was paying on auto 1).

Or, do I just keep things as is?",finance,1649981596.0

DPTs make decent money but nothing crazy at the staff level, I worked my ass off in 2021 and made a decent chuck while living with my parents in VHCOL spot. I know I have a lot of luck/privilege going for me in general with my situation, but I want some outside perspectives. 

Numbers: Current NW excluding debt is \~ 155k (this can fluctuate a lot, you can probably guess why) Roth IRA \~ 30k in VTI;  rolled a Roth 401k into it from a part time job and maxed since 2020 

401k \~ 1k in generalized S&amp;P low index cost plan; New job that has a traditional 401k, had more but as mentioned rolled that into Roth 

Checking/Savings \~ 13k, This is much more than 3 month emergency plan, but I think within about 1-3 years I will need to buy a new car, so I want a decent chunk of change on deck, more to come on that 

Crypto \~ 125K at the moment, almost all in ETH/BTC. This is where I think I’ll get the most flak, crypto is a bit of passion of mine and I fully believe in the utility and future use of these 2 major players, I will continue to invest in this outside of my retirement accounts. 

In general, I expect to keep my expenses under 3k/month depending on the situation, with maxing my Roth (low AGI as a traveler means I don’t need to backdoor) as well as 401k, with the rest going into savings and BTC/ETH. (I know, I know, tell me I’m a ding bat). A small part of me is betting on a steady crypto gain that could allow be to put a down payment on a house in the 28-35 yo range. 

I switched to a Travel PT position to travel more as it’s one of my passions as well as at the purely staff level Travel PT’s make much more than their full time counterparts. However, due to the nature of Travel Healthcare, what I take home can and will fluctuate greatly. I expect to take home about 7-10k/month after taxes on average, however I will probably be taking about 4-8 weeks of “vacation” (Traveler’s do not get vacation, we just space out time between contracts) which will cut into that, as well as spending on some travel activity. I plan on doing Travel for the next 3-5 years at a minimum. 

My current plan is to continue Travel and figure out where I want to live and how I want to change from being a Staff DPT to a more leader/manger/business owner roll, as the ceiling affect on a DPT happens pretty quickly at the staff level. I may want to buy a home before I am 30, but very unsure here. 

By nature, I don’t think fully retiring is ever in my future. Though I think about 3-5mil by around 50-60 yo would make me financially independent enough to do whatever I want. I do plan on finding a spouse and having children down the road, though that is not currently in site. 

I guess what I am wondering is, what would you do differently in my situation. Do you think my bet on crypto is really that dumb?

My wife and I filed jointly, which we did last year (our first year filing as a married couple)  though our income was completely different.   We both lost our jobs at the start of the pandemic, but got new jobs at the end of 2020. My wife is a child care provider and while she works for a family she's technically an independent contractor, therefore self employed, and usually pays quarterly taxes. Last year I worked in customer support, though I also worked as an actor (most gigs came with W2s though a couple were W9s, so I had to pay more taxes for those gigs). Our collective income was roughly $82k, with my earnings making the majority of our income. 

Last year, due to lack of income in 2020 we received a refund and my wife did not have to pay quarterlies. This year we knew would be different, but not this different. We're being told we will need to collectively pay ~$1500 per quarter federally and $480 per quarter to the state (NY). This is obviously due to my higher earnings last year but I've never had to pay quarterly payments for acting work previously as my income varies from year to year and my customer support job was under a W2. This is the first time one partner's employment has drastically affected the both of us at tax time. I guess we were naive, but we thought that my wife would pay quarterlies based on her income and my taxes would continue to be taken out of my paycheck and I would pay what else I owed at the end of the year. What's more frightening is I was unexpectedly let go by my customer support job end of February and while I have more acting work potentially on the horizon and some promising job prospects, our 2022 income is doubtful to look like it did in 2021. Thankfully we saved and can take care of this, but this is a serious blow. 

So we know for the future, given our economic circumstances and difference in income, would it have made more sense financially to file separately rather than jointly? All I'm wondering is if we file separately, will our taxes look more like the did when we were single or would we have had to pay even more? Everyone- family, friends and tax professionals- have always said we should file jointly, otherwise we're ""just leaving money on the table"". Well, it certainly doesn't feel that way right now.

personalfinance,Organization of Savings at 23 Years Old,"Hello there everyone,

I recently graduated from college about 1 year ago, and about 4 months ago got a job at a local engineering firm. I invest $700 monthly into a 401K with match, have student loans/car paid off, and try to put around $4500 into savings for my short term goals. I have several paths I want to pursue in the next 5 or so years, but wanted to check if there are better ways of approaching these particular goals. I also wanted to write this all out for my own sake as it will help me keep focused lol.

**My largest current goal: Buying a house.**

I live in Oklahoma and as such housing is still relatively inexpensive around here. Most of the houses I have been eying are around the $250K-$300K. I am considering putting a standard 20% down on the house with a 30 year loan; however, as interest rates rise and I am still out of a house, I am considering going more aggressive towards this goal, potentially putting 30% down instead (This would take quite some time to save for, but again just an idea). I have two very reliable friends who would be willing to rent from me if I do pick up a property within the next year or so. This would help break even on the mortgage before I consider getting into a long term relationship (I don't want to charge too high of a rent as I want to help them get set up as well as much as possible). 

**Investment Options:**

My next large focus is on building various investments for the next 10 years. I have been looking into the standard S&amp;P 500 portfolio, or a dividend portfolio. As I already put a decent chunk into my 401K, this has been on the backburner, but I have been researching more into building a post-tax portfolio over this last month. As the house is such a high priority, I do not quite know when to start building up this portfolio, or even the best options for this route. I have also looked into I bonds as they provide a guaranteed 7% and could be an excellent hedge against the current inflation scare or even the recession I believe could follow. I am curious as to what are your preferred investment methods? How long have they been in place, and what return have you seen, and would you recommend them?  

**Fun Stuff: Car, a liability but worth it?**

Ok, now we get to the point where I will probably receive the most disagreement. Cars were always a major passion of mine, but I did not have the full funding to pursue that hobby until somewhat recently. My realistic dream car is a MKV Toyota Supra, and optioned would be in the range of $57K-$59K. My current car trade-in value is $30K on the dollar according to KBB. I have been considering trading in my car, and going for a 5 year loan, if I can get a reasonable interest (I have the cash for the car however I do not want to spend so much money all at once as part of this fund is potentially going towards the house.) This will allow me to save up money still for the house without parting with $30K (this is including registration and tax) while also still affording my dream vehicle. I understand cars are liabilities and not the wisest purchases; however as my other monthly costs are less than $1K I believe I have room for this purchase. 

Overall this was a sort of ramble but I am curious as to how yall would approach this situation? What focuses would you make a priority, investment strategies, all the good stuff?",finance,1649998826.0

I get paid weekly and gross about $630-640 with a net of about $470-480.

I pay $25.60 into my 401k each week along with $10 into my HSA each week. I pay $10.62 for Medical, Dental, and Vision each week as well.

For some context, I'm planning on opening a high yield savings account to store emergency funds ($10,000-$15,000), as well as funds for other savings goals that are a bit further off (house, vacations, etc). Reading online resources tend to say that interest compounding daily is ideal even if it's marginally more money than compounding monthly. But I ran some calculators online and in every situation the amount of money I would earn compounding daily is still less than the compounding monthly, unless I'm calculating incorrectly. 

Comparing Ally Bank at .5% compounding daily and LendingClub at .7% compounding monthly, I still end up saving more with a rate like lendingclub after 5 or 10 years. Why would someone opt for a compounding daily account in this case? Thanks in advance!",finance,1650020519.0

&gt; The Fed governor said inflation was too high and the central bank has to continue onward with planned rate hikes to its benchmark interest rate to try to get inflation under control.

&gt; Waller repeated he would support a half-percentage-point rate hike at the Fed’s next policy meeting on May 3-4.

&gt; “I have said before I prefer a front-loaded approach. So a 50-basis-point hike in May would be consistent with that, and possibly more in June and July,” he added.

&gt; The goal of Fed officials is to get its benchmark policy rate above “neutral” by the later half of this year. The Fed estimates a 2.25% rate for its benchmark would neither boost the economy nor restrain growth. At the moment, the benchmark rate is at an ultra-low range of 0.25%-0.5%.

- Shorter term treasury yields broadly align with his comments. 2 year rate at 2.5%, 1 year rate at 1.75%, indicating a front loading tightening cycle which tops out around 2.25%-2.5%

- Yield curve has un-inverted and is now back in normal convexity, with long term yields having show willingness to rise over recent weeks, suggesting the market believes the plan is likely to happen, and is not excessively tight

Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in effect, said a digital dollar would crush private cryptocurrencies during a congressional hearing last July. ""You wouldn't need stablecoins; you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital U.S. currency,"" This is why the government is so terrified of stables; it directly threatens their intentions with a CBDC. 

Last month, Biden issued an executive order calling on government agencies to research and design a digital dollar prototype as a way to reinforce America's financial leadership and protect ""national security.""

Greg King, the founder and CEO of Osprey, argues CBDCs would spark a backlash over privacy concerns and push more people into decentralized private cryptocurrencies.

“Imagine the world’s fiat currencies are digitized. I actually think that pushes more people into something like a bitcoin because, frankly, that would give governments even more control than they already have around their money supply, and a lot of people get into bitcoin for concerns about that type of control.”

Unpopular opinion, but one of the saving graces is that tons of institutional money is flowing into crypto, and the government gets A LOT of money from institutional lobbyists. I can't imagine the government wants to squeeze these cash cows that they subsequently end up bailing out when they overleverage. 

It's going to be interesting, to say the least, to watch this all unfold. I, for one, am not interested AT ALL in a CBDC.",cryptocurrency,1650026187.0

“The way I bonds are structured requires close attention or example it really consists to different rates one called the composite rate which is presently zero, and the other is the inflation rate which currently is 7.2%.

A new composite rate and inflation rate for the I will be established on May 1. 2022. New rates are established every six months.

I have not found any projections on what the new interest rates will be commencing May 1, 2022. But I speculate that as inflation rates have risen considerably the inflation rate on the new bond as I am calling it commencing May 1, 2022, will be higher.

One area I am confused about is where does the interest earned? In a separate account that is held by the treasury titled something like interest earned. It is unlikely to be added to the value of the bond which would then earn the rate the interest-rate for the next interest rate paying period . Nice but an assumption on my part. 

In any event this information set can lead one to conclude that at the current interest rate of 7.2% it becomes a very attractive investment choice. A no risk investment  backed by the United States government.

CryptoMarkets,Common Critique - BITCOIN MINING IS A WASTE OF ENERGY,"You’ve probably heard claims like “Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than all of Argentina” or “Bitcoin mining uses more energy than all of Google operations”. Claims that will earn the raising of eyebrows, but fail to address the fundamental question is the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining is worth the benefits? This question should be broken down into two aspects: energy consumption and hardware churn.

The energy used by Bitcoin miners does three powerful things:

**Energy consumption**

1.Secures all the wealth stored on the Bitcoin network in a decentralized state.

Most current financial systems are controlled by a centralized entity, banks, credit unions, federal reserve, etc. This means that those central parties can manipulate funds, stop transactions or do whatever they feel is in the “best interest” of whatever source of power is pushing them to act. For example, Canada recently confiscated funds that were donated to a protesting group they did not agree with. Banks, credit unions, GoFundMe, and many other entities were asked to freeze accounts, stop payments or take action in some way to prevent funding the protesters. Because Bitcoin has no single point of control, flexing this level of power is not possible whether you’re an individual or a sovereign nation.

2.Creates a financial incentive that promotes renewable energy sources

Bitcoin mining has become a profitable industry for many companies. One major expense mining companies face is energy costs. What is the cheapest energy long-term? You guessed it, renewables. There is a built-in financial incentive to acquire the cheapest energy for these “for-profit” companies which means every mining company will seek out integrating renewable energies as part of their operational setup. With greater demand for renewables, renewable companies will allocate more funds for research and development to improve wind, solar, and hydro technologies to better fulfill the added market demand. Coming full circle, Bitcoin mining is not only promoting the adoption but also the improvement of renewable energy technology.

3.Provides stability to unstable power grids

An interesting aspect of Bitcoin mining is the ability for miners to be turned on or off ad hoc without affecting operational infrastructure, unlike cement, steel, or any other industrial entity. Because of this, we are seeing grid operators partnering with mining facilities to best make use of the energy grids. In Texas, there was a recent overload on the power grid when a freeze came through and every household had to turn off their heater. With the amount of energy needed to sustain every business and household, the energy grid was at a near collapse and rolling blackouts were pushed to keep the grid intact. Since the freeze, the grid has been expanding with added renewables and with miners leveraging much of the “excess” or unused energy. In the event of another freeze where the household energy consumption is expected to spike, the energy companies would pay the mining companies to turn off a portion of their Bitcoin miners to free up the needed energy supply to the grid. Once the household load subsides, the Bitcoin miners can be turned back on utilizing the freed-up “excess” energy.

**Hardware Churn**

The physical lifespan of a current ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miner is between 2-3 years. Financial lifespan will have a broader range depending on multiple factors such as cost of energy usage, when the miner comes online, the hash rate growth of the network, and what the Bitcoin price does during the miner’s lifespan. 

Another factor that’s had a significant impact on mining is the rate at which hardware technology has evolved, specifically for ASIC miners. As soon as a new miner is released, there is a stronger and more efficient miner right around the corner. This has led to a lot of churn with large-scale mining operations quickly retiring old miners and replacing them with new ones.

Given that Bitcoin mining is still relatively new, especially from a commercialization view, mining technology is evolving at a rapid rate which means if you are in the business of mining for profit, you’ll likely continue purchasing the new mining rigs to keep your financial returns competitive with your peers. This leaves many “older” mining rigs in a position of no man’s land where they can’t return profits worth their operational costs and they can’t be re-purposed for any other use.

I believe this is the most valid critique of Bitcoin mining but one that can hopefully be addressed in the near future. There have been a few ideas floating around, such as integrating retired miners with new home energy builds to help offset energy costs while maintaining the Bitcoin network or building miners in a way where once they are decommissioned, they can be better stripped to have their components re-purposed. Either way, hardware churn is a top concern of the Bitcoin community and is likely to be addressed as more hardware manufacturers enter the space.

**In Summary**

*Bitcoin mining is a waste of energy*

This critique is COMPLICATED - On one hand, the energy Bitcoin consumes is used to secure all of the stored wealth in a decentralized state, provides stability to power grids, and promote renewable energy development and implementation. On the other hand, the physical miners are often replaced frequently with no real repurposable utility for the retired miners.",cryptocurrency,1650034521.0

economy,Am I Wrong?,"Long time economic doomsday prepper here. I'm curious as to yall's thoughts on the 'velocity of money' with regard to current inflation. 


We obviously know inflation comes from increasing the money supply, which the US has done more than ever in its history. But, the velocity of money has gone down significantly. 


The velocity of money, if I'm correct, is how often a dollar moves through the economy. 


(see here data from the St. Louis Fed showing velocity over time.)

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/32242

So we've increased the money supply by an incredible amount, but almost none of it has actually hit the markets yet, as far as I can tell


I think this is why they're hesitant to hike interest rates. It's all stashed away in investments and when rates rise everything will really start unwinding, opening Pandora's box for inflation; like, three or four digit inflation.


I'm convinced the Fed doesn't know what they're doing; anything they say is lip service so they don't spook the markets.

vet,"Cat losing hair, scratching, and poor appetite – NEED ADVICE","**TLDR: I need advice on what to do about my cat that is barely eating, losing hair, scratching, and vomiting (1-2 times a week). See pics below. Been to the vet with her twice, they haven't been able to give her a diagnosis, but they think it could be IBD or food allergies.**

Hello,

I started fostering an 8 y/o, female, DMH cat named Momma three weeks ago – I actually just adopted her! :)

I have already been to the vet with her twice. The first visit was just to get her up-to-date on all of her vaccines/flea/deworming treatments. The vet said she had bronchitis so she prescribed an antibiotic which I syringe-fed to her every 12 hours for two weeks. The vet also gave me a topical appetite stimulant to rub inside her ear once a day, in the morning. Even with the appetite stimulate, she still eats very little – at first I thought she was just stressed out from moving to an unfamiliar place – but now I am really starting to get concerned.

I have done tons of my own research and have tried all different kinds of wet food, broth/food toppers, baby food, salmon/tuna fish, etc. I have tried to spoon feed her (she will only lick a little bit and becomes disinterested the more I try). The only things that she will eat without hesitation are Temptations and the Churu squeezable cat treats – I realize these aren't very nutritious though so I am still trying to get her to eat her wet/dry food (Wellness brand). She also vomits 1-2 times a week (I have had her for about 4 weeks), and it's pretty random every time (not after a meal or medicine).

Over the past week, I have noticed she is losing a lot of hair, and scratching at her ears to the point that she has developed a bald spot under her left ear. It is red and a little crusty and my initial thought was that it could be ringworm – so I took her to the vet again and they ran a black light test on the area. The vet said it lit up, but couldn't give a definitive answer on whether or not she has ringworm without additional testing.

The vet thinks that Momma has IBD and that could be why she is vomiting/decreased appetite. The vet asked another doctor for a second opinion, and that vet said Momma may have food allergies, but again there is no definitive answer unless I get additional testing.

During the second trip to the vet they gave Momma steroid injection to see if that would help with the inflammation in her intestines and itching. They also told me to continue the topical appetite stimulant and try adding 5mg of Pepcid twice a day for the IBD.

I feel like there are so many unknowns and I am really scared about how little she is eating. I just tried force feeding her with a syringe for the first time today and that did not go very well – I wrapped a towel around her but she still managed to wiggle her way out.

I have attached pictures of the bald spot beneath her ear/on her head. I also attached a picture of her in her pink bed when I first got her 4 weeks ago (before she started losing hair).

Any advice about the hair loss, vomiting, scratching, &amp; lack of appetite would be much appreciated!

personalfinance,New job - federal withholding way too low,"I just started a new job after being laid off for 2 years (Yay!)  I filled out my W4 that I am married filing jointly and husband also has a job, no dependents.  From what I've read, just checking that box (2C) could potentially end up withholding more than necessary, but I'm ok with that...and my problem is that they're not pulling nearly enough.  My first paycheck wasn't for a full pay period, and my federal withholding calculated at barely 5%.  HR said they can't advise, but that because it wasn't a full pay period, ""the tax tables are not always as robust until you earn the full salary.""  Not entirely sure what that means, but ok, I waited till 2nd paycheck, which is now a full pay period.  Today's fed withholding is barely 8%.  So it went up a little, but not nearly enough.  Based on my salary of $85K, it should be 22%...with husband's salary we actually go up to 24%, but right now I'm not even at the minimum tax rate.  I called ADP and they ""can't advise"", but kept asking if I want to add to my withholding.  I understand that I can do that, but I feel like I shouldn't have to just to get to what my normal rate should be.  And I'm a little afraid to, in case at some point they figure themselves out (wherever the issue is) and then I have too much taken out (yes I know then I can fix it back).  

I see that the W4 changed in 2020, so I'm not looking for just those simple numbers (1, 0) you used to enter.  I'm just trying to understand what's happening.  Does it not understand the total I expect to make by the end of the year, so since my YTD is only about $5K it doesn't want to tax me too much?(even though I'm still below the minimum 10% rate)  Is it going to increase as my YTD hits each bracket?

 Payday lenders charge outrageous interest rates on these small loans and that's how they make money.

Obviously this would be helping them, so I would think that it could work. Maybe have it set up as a charity where everyone that does work there is doing it part time pro bono and have people donate to raise funds.

Could the same potentially work for a bank? Both set up accounts for people to bank with and also accept donations in order to give out home loans and auto loans with extremely low rates to attract more customers. Perhaps make a rule that homes purchased have to be for primary use and not investments, to try snd make housing more affordable?

CryptoCurrency,You should think twice before 'lending' your coins.,"People on this sub often dangerously claim that you should always lend your coins because it's free money. At first glance a return in excess of 8% interest per annum seems like a no brainer, however you must weigh up the risks.

People often argue that the return on interest is better than having money in the bank. Whilst this is true on paper, what people don't tell you is that lending your coins on platforms in an unregulated environment carries huge risk.

Unregulated lending platforms often offer a high interest rate return to BRING IN liquidity. These platforms cannot stay financially afloat without liquidity. As there are no regulations forcing these platforms to disclose their total liquidity you literally do not know how financially stable these platforms are. Which brings us to the next couple of risk factors.

These lending platforms can change the internet rate returns at any given moment. Fact is 8 percent plus interest return per annum is UNSUSTAINABLE in any market. Sometimes your liquidity could be locked away and suddenly your returns are completely changed and there is nothing you can do about it.

You don't know the financial stability of any of these platforms and they are not legally required to disclose it. You are literally trusting that the platform your lending your hard earned crypto on is not about to go bankrupt. Given the unregulated environment of crypto you are EXTREMELY UNLIKELY to get your crypto back if the platform goes bankrupt, after all you will NOT be considered a secured creditor.

Given the unsustainable returns they are offering these platforms are at much higher risk of going bankrupt.

Even more concerning is that these platforms are highly vulnerable to being hacked, scammed and regulated to death - if you lose your crypto as a result of any of this you don't have any recourse.

So my question is - why the hell would you risk your hard earned crypto if you have little to no protection? The returns are literally not worth the risk unless your investing huge sums or long-term. Long term might not even be viable given the fact the government could regulate this space.

So whilst members of this sub will advise you to lend your coins, think twice and remember it's extremely risky. You must satisfy yourself whether the huge risk is actually worth the returns?",cryptocurrency,1650060854.0

https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ten-members-international-stock-manipulation-ring-charged-manhattan-federal-court

This is just one of the juicy parts:

&gt;First, the defendants and their co-conspirators secretly amassed control of the vast majority of the stock of certain publicly traded companies that were traded on the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market in the United States. Second, the defendants and their co-conspirators then manipulated the price and trading volume for these stocks, causing the share price and trading volume to become artificially inflated, through coordinated trading and false and misleading promotional campaigns that they funded.

I am *really* curious on which stocks on the OTC market were impacted. I wonder how many people on /r/pennystocks fell victim to it.

The whole indictment is an interesting read, I recommend reading the full thing.",finance,1650065305.0
MachineLearning,[D] What is the difference between channel-wise and self attention in this case?,"Example: 
I fed 32 feature maps of dimension 6x6x32 into a Squeeze and Excitation layer, which assigns a weight to each of my channel through a channel-wise attention mechanism. 

What is the difference between passing these 32 feature maps into a Hybrid Transformer Encoder with patch of dimension 6x6? (So 1 patch for each channel)

 As I understand it, channel attention says ""which channel is important for the final prediction"". While  transformer (with self attention) tells us ""where to focus our attention in a given context"".

Isn't that the same if the patches are the channels? Basically it tells us on which patch to focus, and if patch=channel then squeeze excitation = self attention ?",technology,1650065372.0

Bitcoin,Update - CampBX Lawsuit,"Hello, my name is Jay Daniel, I'm a member of BDI Capital, LLC. Until now, I've been unable to publicly speak about the case, and answer any questions about it.   I know that many members of the crypto community have reached out to me privately over the last few years, and I'm sorry for ignoring those questions/emails, but I couldn't speak about the case while it was working its way through the legal process.

The case has been delayed due to COVID, and we were lucky enough to be the first civil trial before Judge Totenberg since COVID started back in March of 2020.  This past week I've been at the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta), where we were finally able to have a trial in the case.  The three day trial was conducted in front of a 8 person jury, and on Thursday after lunch they came back with a verdict in the case.

The jury found CampBX, also known as Bulbul Investments, LLC, and its founder, Keyur Mithawala, misrepresented statements to customers regarding the stability, reliability, and operation of the CampBX website and cryptocurrency exchange.  Launched in 2011 as first U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange, CampBX announced to only select customers in the fall of 2017 that it was winding down but it has yet to complete that process or return Bitcoin to all customers.  The jury found that BDI Capital, LLC reasonably relied upon false information supplied by CampBX and Mr. Mithawala and suffered economic injury as a result.

I'd personally like to thank both John Richard and Sean Smith with the Continuum Legal Group, LLP (Atlanta) for all of their help both in preparing for and during trial.  It's hard to explain how stressful a federal trial can be, and I couldn't have gotten through this without their help and guidance.

I know there are a number of other members of this community who have yet to recover their property, and I wish you the best of luck in doing so.  I'll try and answer any questions I can about the case moving forward.",cryptocurrency,1650066444.0

I purchased the condo in October of 2019 for $141k. Similar 2 Bedroom / 2 Bath condos in my area are selling for around $320k. I'm not sure i'll be able to get that much, but I have a hunch that the housing market is going to start cooling off sometime soon. I could be completely wrong, but my condos valuation has more than doubled in a little over 2 years.

I was not planning on repurchasing for the time being as I feel most prices are fairly inflated. I was actually planning on renting for a year or two, and then repurchasing. The unused assets would be invested in a balanced mutual fund with primarily bonds and a few stock index funds. 80% bonds, 20% stock. The federal reserve has announced potential increases in interest rates in an effort to stop rising inflation. The federal reserve even indicated we ""may"" be seeing a real estate and commodity bubble.

I have owned the condo for a little over two years as a primary residence, and I could take advantage of Section 121 of the US tax code.

Rent would be $1500 a month. Phoenix Arizona

I'm currently trying to add solar panels to my roof. 50% is me trying to help offset my footprint against the environment and the other half of me wants to future proof my home (lower utility bill while increasing my family size as well as increase my property's value) . I'm currently living by myself in a 3br home in central FL and I've spoken to 2 different companies. Being the only person in the home at the moment I tend to only spend about $50-100 each month on my electric bill. I'd appreciate any advice as I outline their options here so far.

(Copying a recent Solar quote question from another user because I like this format)

**Company 1:** Total system cost $22317

* 5.11 kW system size
* 7627 kWh Year 1 system production
* 6130 kWh Annual usage
* Panels: 14x  CertainTeed 365 BOB
* Inverters:  EnPhase IQ8+
* Offset: 124%
* Warranty: 25 year
* General  comments: They have emailed me regarding a $1000 discount for suddenly becoming a ""VIP Customer"". I also get $2000 if I install with them as part of a discount I get because of my employer. The rep I've spoken to is not based in FL but he has answered all the questions I've had specifically related to FL Solar options in a very timely manner. They've been a little pushy regarding the project and have very recently been a little pushy on having me sign the loan document ASAP.

**Company 2:** Total system cost $19027

* 4.4 kW system
* Estimated yearly production: 6680 kWh
* Panels: 10x Aptos DNA-144 440W
* Inverters: 5x AP Systems DS3 Microinverter
* Offset: 110%
* Warranty: 30 year
* General  comments: This company was recommended to me by my friend/neighbor who was pleased with their service on her home. They're going to set her up with a $500 referral bonus but can't really budge on their system cost for me. The guy is not as pushy or in frequent contact as the first company but he is a FL resident and seems to know our utility options a little better.

Both scenarios have me paying roughly the same over a 25 year loan with the same interest rate. My utility company has a $30 minimum fee to remain connected but since I'd be producing so much more than I use I feel like I'd get a decent amount of that back at the end of the year with the 1:1 net metering.

My little girl suddenly got very sick out of nowhere. Here's the story:

Tuesday in the afternoon she was playing and jumping around in the garden, trying to catch flies and butterflies. She was just her happy old self. Then I noticed her right eye was completely covered by her third eyelid. I thought something had flown into her eye or she got a branch or sand or something in it. I wasn't too worried and she was still really happy and active, it didn't seem to bother her one bit. We had called the vet though to let them take a look at it wednesday noon.

At 11pm I noticed both of her eyes were covered, she was lethargic, didn't eat and just seemed unwell. Then I started to worry but we had an appointment at the vet the next day.

Wednesday we went to the vet, she was worse hadn't eaten since the day before when all this happened, barely moved (seemed half dead). The vet examined her and I'll summarize all the results of tests she had the past few days:

No fever

Soft Belly

eyes looked normal

Her weight was still what it used to be so no slow change we hadn't noticed (4.4 kg)

Her BLOOD RESULTS were mostly NORMAL, WBC count was normal, proteins were normal, glucose were normal, liver enzymes normal...only her BUN and creatinine were slightly low..

They tested for FCoV prescence in her blood --&gt; negative

Test for toxoplasmosis --&gt; negative

Vet tested CRP which was very low too

In the meanwhile my baby developed balance issues, she has no coordination --&gt; vet thought maybe middle ear infection

Started antibiotics and metacam --&gt; yesterday we visited her and although I thought she didn't look very good the vet said she was more lively than thursday and tried to get up but couldn't yet, she was more alert, eyes were still mostly covered though, they took her off the IV and she licked some food and when I picked her up I saw she was looking through the windows following the cars with her eyes so yes she was indeed more alert...but she seems to have developed some breathing issues though but nose seems stuffed??

And now it's weekend, there is a vet for their practice (not the vet who was treating my cat) to take ""care"" of the animals that are hospitalized but apparantly she only goes check a few times a day! I'm horrified! She called (late was supposed to call around 11am-12pm, called at 2pm), said my cat wasn't improved at all, said she was breathing heavy and was talking about if she were to die on her own (she also said she didn't know the case (and didn't really seem to care either))...she seemed annoyed she had to go check on my cat during her easter weekend cause my cat is the only animal they have at the moment. She wasn't particularly interesterd. She said they wouldn't call until TUESDAY (!!!!) if everything stayed the same. She didn't even propose for us to come and visit my cat, she just said we wouldn't hear anything till tuesday (unless she got worse). And now we can't even reach her cause no one is there. I feel powerless, my kitten is dying there, completely alone and suffering and no one's there to comfort her. I feel sick. She's dying and we don't know why. It all went so fast too.

I'm completely shocked and in tears. Help

personalfinance,"Switching jobs, looking to make the most of my raise while expenses are low","I (25M) recently accepted a new job offer that is essentially giving me a $23k raise to $68k, coming from a $45k salary. I generally have low expenses as of now as I live with my partner’s (26F) family and our monthly rent is very low due to it being income based ( we live in NYC ). 

I’m looking for advice to make the most of my new raise for the time being until expenses pick up later in the year and once we have to move out next February ( rent amount will change as our incomes have both increased ). I don’t have any CC debt and my only outstanding debts are my federal student loans ($12k but currently on forbearance) and my car loan ($20k, 36 month term, but monthly payments are split between me and my partner). In terms of savings and investments, I have $7k in a HYSA at .50 APY, an emergency fund of $1.2k that I’m looking to rebuild, and around $3.5k in crypto and stocks. I have a Roth 401k through my current employer and I have just recently opened a Roth IRA.

My main financial goals right now are to save money for a house downpayment for the future (~5 or so years down the line,~ $50k) and have a healthy amount of savings and investments. I don’t do any heavy or reckless spending and always pay off my CC’s in full each month. I contribute about 25% of my current income to savings and investments. We’re planning on moving outside of NYC due to lower taxes, potentially lower expenses and to live in a generally safer area with more space.  

What’s the best way to utilize my raise to better meet my goals? I don’t plan to take on any more expenses and live beyond my means. My new salary would put me just shy of $4k net of monthly income after taxes + 401k contributions.

I’m also looking for some advice on what to do with my Roth 401k balance (~$2k) as I will have to either move it over to my new employers plan or potentially move that into my Roth IRA. My new job does 100% matching at 4% of my contributions, and my vesting in company matches increases by 25% after each year of service.",finance,1650117756.0

stocks,Beware the POWcycle,"Hi, all.

I posted this earlier, but it's so deeply buried in a very long thread that no one will see it. In case it might prove helpful, here it is:

There's something that I call the POWcycle that has defined market conditions since mid-Feb 2021. The cycle is this:

1. Each month, the CPI is released;
2. Every six weeks, the two-day FOMC meeting is held; and
3. Right afterward, the JPow holds a press conference.

(Please note that FOMC meeting minutes are released three weeks after the FOMC meets; these can sometimes have a dangerous effect throughout the stock market, so you'll want to pay attention to the timing. Usually, no one cares, but in inflationary conditions like this, this can be an important catalyst, i.e. risk to try to avoid, depending on what's in them; you'll know based on the market reaction, which will occur within several minutes of the release of the meeting minutes.)

Often, because market participants anticipate and react to the future preemptively, there is a mini-crash sometime within ten days leading up to 1, and about one week leading up to 3. It might happen ten days before, but it's not very likely. It might happen five days before. It might happen the day of. Think of atomic orbitals and probability clouds.

What this creates is a situation where some periods are relatively less dangerous than others. To really try to figure out the most opportune buying and selling times, make a list of the companies that you're most interested in, and then research how they've behaved for the past year with respect to the POWcycle, and try not to get caught on the wrong side of it. Buy when the market is very red and others are afraid. Sell into strength, when the market is green and others think that the coast is clear.

Also note that sooner or later, the market will transition out of the POWcycle into another state. (At a macroscopic level, think of market conditions as a finite state machine. There are distinct states, but identifying the transitions isn't easy.) It will do this when what the Fed will do to combat inflation will truly have been priced in. Since the Fed doesn't know, and since we can't anticipate how the war against the Ukraine will unfold, never mind the virus and the disruptions to the supply chain that it'll cause in China and elsewhere, it's always better to be patient and try to err on the side of caution.

The JPow will hold his next press conference on Wed 4 May, which is eighteen days away. If the past fourteen months (with rare exceptions) replay themselves again, then we would expect another buying opportunity in the run-down to that event or during it. Again, we can't predict the future, but we can try to learn from the past and anticipate what might happen again, so that in case it does, we can be ready. That means knowing what we'd like to buy, and having a plan to buy it, including triggering conditions, the amount of capital to allocate to a full position in that security, a scaling strategy, and a risk management strategy.

There are three important things to keep in mind:

1. Valuation always matters. Learn to perform a DCF and establish a multiplier for the resultant fair price per share of a stock based on how similar companies' theoretical fair values are being multiplied by the current market conditions. (Multiplier contraction and expansion occur over time as the result of various factors; for instance, with growth stocks, it's a function of interest rate changes and sentiment, among other factors.) Don't just buy shares in a company. Know what they're really worth, and make comparisons.
2. As interest rates increase, the growth companies get hurt the most. This is because their cost of capital increases. (They have to pay more interest on loans. Even worse, they can get backed into a corner and be forced to issue new shares, which dilutes existing shareholders immediately and usually quite substantially.) Because they don't make a profit, they're forced to take out loans or issue new shares (there are other possibilities, but those are the main two) just to be able to keep paying employees. Unless they did this, they'd go bankrupt. This is why investors sell out of and avoid growth companies like the plague in inflationary conditions such as this. The reason that many of these companies have crashed by at least 60% is because they became drastically overvalued. When a company needs to operate for fifty years to make back its own market cap and it's simply not growing very much, it's important to not get trapped within it, because it might never recover, or it might flatline for a decade while other securities move way up. In the worst case, it could delete all of your money. Sometimes it makes sense to try to take advantage of others' fear. This is why I advocate buying MELI, PLTR, and SE while they're down. Within three years, the probability is very high that each of them will outperform QQQ.
3. Inflation is the single most critical driver of stock market behavior right now. The primary cause of inflation is the doubling of the money supply caused by all of the Fed's money-printing. Some of that money has been burned up by retail panic-selling for a loss, and as the result of margin calls. Both of these delete capital, as if it had never existed. While tragic for the individual or institution that realized losses, this ironically helps to attenuate inflation. The only ""problem"" is that not enough of it happens to have a major impact, but it does help a bit. Right now, we're in a trader's market characterized by high and unpredictable volatility, overvaluation, and inflation.

It hasn't been a great time to be an investor, and no one really knows how bad conditions will get, whether there will be a recession, how the labor market and fiscal policy will be affected, whether there will emerge a crisis for US debt repayments, given higher interest rates, etc. It doesn't take a macroeconomist to see that there's a lot more bad news than good. Because of all of this, I recommend proceeding slowly and cautiously. Don't get fooled by ""relief rallies.""

If you look at market dynamics, you find that for a long time now, there have been far more companies near their lows than highs. The winners are far and few between, and highly concentrated. This is why investors in index funds have outperformed growth stock investors by an incredible margin, for instance. This isn't healthy for the market. We've been looking very closely for signs that IWO (an ETF that's made up of the growth stock subset of the Russell 2000) has bottomed. No one is quite sure whether we might take out previous lows. This is why I'm personally being very cautious and waiting to see how the market will react to the JPow's upcoming press conference and the release of the subsequent CPI.

Market participants can ultimately only price in what they can reasonably anticipate. Anything unexpected hasn't been priced in, and no one has seen a downtrend in the CPI, among other factors, yet to be able to declare that the coast is clear. Proceed slowly. As we like to say, ""It's better to be late and safe rather than early and sorry."" I know that your money is being eaten up by inflation, but on a single month basis, the decline in buying power isn't very much. Wait for the right opportunity.

I hope that this helps a bit. Some of us run a free Discord server, but I don't think I can post it here. If anyone is interested, you're welcome to private message me.

Hang in there, and good luck,

I stopped by the DMV today to pay for transfer of title, registration, tax and all that. They had asked if there was a loan and I said yes. They processed everything but they're sending the title to Lightstream/SunTrust.

personalfinance,Tackling Lots of Student Loans,"Hey all, 

Long time lurker, 1st time poster. I’ve been trying to figure out the best way my husband and I should tackle finances. My husband (35) and I (26) got married about a year ago after he finished his nursing degree and while I am debt free, he has a good chunk of loans from not just his nursing degree but also a biology degree years ago when he was planning on going pre-med. sorry in advance for length.


Background: 

Debt: (these are approximate) 
- husband has various student/ government loans: $70k Currently no minimum payment, projected around $700ish/mth so we have been paying at least that. 
- consolidated private loans to a 4.25% loan with earnest, totals about $130k. Monthly payment just under $1300. 
- 1 car, $263 per month (only a year in to the loan). 2nd car is paid off. 

income: 
he makes $35/hr x 36 hrs as and RN and I make $19/hr full time. It’s been pretty variable total, but averaging around $6400 (after taxes, healthcare, and min. matching for our 401ks). 

He recently was able to switch to a better floor at his hospital, but will be on day shift (losing a couple hundred due to shift differential). 


Budget:
- rent is 1200, utilities around 160-180 
- only other bills are a $46 phone bill and we pay about $52 a month for renters and car insurance total
- 500 for food (and we are not buying expensive food, just what it is in our area)
- 10% tithe at church 
- 400 for discretionary spending (also used for clothing etc that we need) 
- $200 other needs: budgets around 40-50 each for Personal Care/Household items, Gifts, Car Repair, and Misc. Expenses. 
- $150 gas (though with prices, this may go up) 

- 500 for retirement - on top of our 401k matches (6%), we’ve been putting $150 in my Roth ira and $300 in his (He has no retirement savings and I had a decent head start) 

- the $260 car payment 
- $1300 private loan 
- we have been paying $700 a month on the other loans, all to the highest interest rate one 


Anything extra (sometimes a few hundred) we either put in our emergency savings or apply to loans. 


I have previous savings in investments totaling around 34k, with another 33k in my Roth and 10k in an old work ira. We have 4K in our emergency cash savings (0.5% apr). 

Currently any extra debt repayment goes to the highest interest govt loan (6.8%, the rest are around 4-5%). Minimum payment keeps getting extended (for now).

Any advice? I am worried that we are not allocating our debt vs. savings as well as we could. For future context, if we stay where we are, a house will not be cheap and we would want kids too. Husband wants to go back to school for an advanced degree. Hospital may pay for most, but he would have to take off at least some hours for at least the last year. Tells me he will make over 100k though after. 

Should we keep plugging along with current strategy and accept we will have the debt payments for 10 years or find a way to tackle it faster? Should I be trying to find a higher paying job or save less?  Is there anything we could be doing to lessen future minimum payments?",finance,1650137103.0

I personally feel so overwhelmed looking at investments and budgets and retirement stuff.

My brother helped me set up a Roth IRA but we never got around to actually *investing* it into anything so it's just been sitting there doing nothing for 8 months because I keep forgetting it exists and I'm too scared I'm going to do it wrong if I mess with it on my own without a ""knowledgeable"" person supervising what I am doing.

Is it worth it to pay someone to help me get started? Or should I fumble through things on my own? If it is worth using a person who actually knows what they are doing, who is actually trustworthy/good at what they do? I would like to actually retire at a reasonable age. And like have enough money to buy a house eventually, or just to have backup for emergencies.

Based on my previous spending habits I'll probably have around $500-1000/month above basic bills/food/cost of living and typical spending habits to save. I'm just so overwhelmed with my options and all the advice I've read.

personalfinance,Advice on Refinancing in current climate,"Hello Reddit, this is my first time posting here and will try and answer any questions you guys might have promptly. Just some background information:

Original Loan History: I originally bought my home for $289,900 (Purchase Price) in August of 2019. This was at a fixed rate of 3.75% for 360 months (30 Years). Because this was an FHA Loan, I paid an Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium (UFMIP) of 1.75%. As well as the 3.5% minimum needed for the FHA Loan. This Loan would have a Monthly Insurance Premium (MIP) of 0.85%. After everything was said and done, our Total Loan Amount came to being $279,750. 

Current Situation: Since I’ve bought my home, I’ve tried to double down on payments in an effort to reach 20% of the loan paid off. My logic was to pay off 20% of the total loan amount to get rid of the monthly insurance premium and refinance. Hindsight, I should have refinanced a lot sooner since I’m confident an appraisal would have shown my home has actually gone up in value since I originally bought it, and when rates were still low, could have gotten rid of the PMI; I currently owe $227,750 on the life of my loan. 

Fast forward to today, I’ve finally come close to reaching the 20% paid off on the Total Loan Amount and am looking to get rid of the monthly insurance premium. Because the MIP is 0.85%, I find myself paying roughly $1,935 every year (0.0085 x 227,750). BUT with interest rates currently rising (and expected to continue), I don’t believe I can refinance for a lower interest rate on a new loan. I would ideally like to refinance for a lower interest rate on a conventional loan for a shorter period of time (15-20 year loan). But now I feel stuck between refinancing at a higher rate and getting rid of the monthly insurance premium OR waiting to refinance in the next couple of years (meanwhile paying the yearly $1,900 in MIP) but trying to double down payments to pay off the principle faster. 

Financial Background: Between my wife (26) and I (28), we can do our mortgage payment, which is roughly $2,000 (which includes PMI and Escrow account to cover the yearly taxes as well as homeowners insurance). And I can afford to make a second payment.

I have no debt (no car, no student loans, no mortgage or rent, and little credit card debt that I pay off in full every month.

I found this article, and this sentence really struck me:

**‘No one gets a free pass’**
New Jersey’s authorities take particular issue with BlockFi’s offering of interest-bearing accounts. The New Jersey-based firm offers interest rates between 0.25% and 8.5%. These rates depend on the crypto asset and deposit size. BlockFi also offers a trading platform and bitcoin rewards credit cards. To compare, the U.S. national average for savings account interest is 0.06%, while 10-year Treasury notes yield 1.19%.

The announcement also highlighted how decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are not FDIC or SIPC insured like traditional banks and brokerages. Although BlockFi offers similar savings and lending platforms to those operating on decentralized ledgers, it is a centralized company.   

Based on the action and comments of the SEC and CFTC, bitcoin and Ethereum are widely believed to be commodities. However, this is much less clear for other assets supported by BlockFi such as Chainlink and Uniswap.

“Our rules are simple: if you sell securities in New Jersey, you need to comply with New Jersey’s securities laws,” said Acting Attorney General Andrew J. Bruck.**“No one gets a free pass simply because they’re operating in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency market.”** He added that the Bureau of Securities would be monitoring the issue closely.

By his own words, ""No one gets a free pass simply because they’re operating in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency market."" - Acting Attorney General Andrew J. Bruck

Am I looking at this the wrong way? Or is it true, that I'm a psychopath like the fake science reports said and I'm just not compassionate for multimillionares or billionaires that need their safety net?

All attempts for rallies in Feb and April of this year have been sold viciously. Dont get me wrong , I am down 30k on a portfolio of 100k but here is why I think we are heading towards a lot more pain in the coming months

1) Legendary investor Ken Fisher recently released this video (link [in comment]) about identifying bear markets, and per this evaluation,  bear markets tends to last 12-24 months.

(Wink wink : We have been touching lower lows of 1-2% every month since November 2021 till now)

2)Last week we found out that inflation hit 8.5% this year, highest since 40 years. Thanks to unlimited money printing by JPowell and supply chain issues/ lack of ramping up production.
Georgia has already declared emergency over supply chain constraints yesterday

3) War in Ukraine.. which has now potentially became war of attrition and WH has predicted it might go on for months with no signs of end of hostilities. That potentially means high oil prices until EOY. Crude recently went below $90, but now is back up to $106

4) Mortgage rate is over the roof with average 30 year fixed breaching a holyguacamoly number of 5.3%

5) Most accurate predictor of recession, the yield curve has also inverted last month. 10 Year yield has breached 2.82%

There is no question that JPowell chair of the Federal reserve controls the long term health of the US stock market. He is stuck between increasing inflation or causing recession.  May 5th FOMC will be a big day  for the market this year with a lot of volatility just like March FOMC

Both times, I actually contributed to the Roth the year after and applied to the year prior, before the deadline (i.e. I did the 2020 backdoor roth in Jan 2021). I am over the income limit to receive a deduction for these contributions.

For 2021, I did not do this (i.e. I did not do a 2021 backdoor roth in 2021 or Jan-Apr 2022). Vanguard issued me a 1099-R saying for 2021 I contributed $6000 to my traditional IRA, and all of it is taxable (this was for my 2020 backdoor roth contribution).

In FreeTaxUsa, I enter Vanguard's 1099-R, where Gross Distribution and Taxable Amount are $6,000. I tell it I converted it all to a Roth IRA. This increases my federal taxes owed.

For Deductions - 2021 IRA Contributions, FreeTaxUsa asks ""Did you make any traditional or Roth IRA contributions during 2021?"" This is where I'm confused. If I say yes (I technically *did*, but they were for the 2020 tax year), $6,000 - it reverts my federal taxes owed.

Otherwise, enter the net amount you converted from traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs to Roth IRAs in 2021"": $6,000. Then it subtracts my basis ($0 as I've never held money in a trad IRA - always immediately converted it), and says $6,000 is taxable.

personalfinance,House refinance to buy another property,"Hi All,

Looking for advice and feedback on my real estate plan. 

Overview: I want to refinance my current house and use the equity to purchase a multi unit property. Then sell current property in the short term.

Current property: single family
169k left on mortgage, 3.625% FHA rate. 
Current Estimated appraisal 310k
Monthly payment: $1250
Other debts: $290 monthly student loans that are continuously pushed back
Credit score: 800
Income: ~72k a year

Plan A

1) Refinance current mortgage with a cash-out refi from a FHA to a conventional loan. I’d want to do a FHA on the new property, so this would allow me to do that. Yes my interest would increase(3.625% to about 4.5%). The base monthly payment would be about the same because I’d drop the PMI. I’d be able to use the cash from the equity as a down payment. I saw the cash out to be a better option than doing a HELOC because I have to refinance out of a FHA anyway, and HELOCs have variable interest rates. I know the total payment would increase depending on the amount of equity I pull out. The rate increase isn’t that concerning to me because I want to sell this property in the short term.

2) purchase second property. 2-4 unit. Currently trying to figure out what I’d be able to afford and qualify for. Move into one of the units to qualify for FHA, rent out the other(s). I would use current property to qualify rental income, even though I probably wouldn’t rent it out. I would make sure I have savings and cash out money banked to cover cost of both mortgages and living expenses for half a year. 

3) finish renovations on current property, and sell within a couple month time frame. 

Why not just sell current property and then use proceeds to make a purchase after that? 
There are renovations I’m currently doing, and more planned that make it hard to live in the house. These will maximize the selling price, hoping to come in around 350k. I’d like to have a few months of it vacant so that I can get a bunch of things done without living in a construction site. Rennovations will not be that costly, target is no more than 15k. The ROI is there. Also don’t want to move twice ie. move out to apartment now then move into new house once current one sells. Personal preference.

Part of what I’m currently evaluating is how much equity to pull out for down payment. I want to have enough in the bank to cover both mortgages and living expenses for 4-6 months. To my understanding the more I pull out increases my debts, decreasing the amount I’d qualify for a new loan. 

Plan B

The other option would be to refinance current loan and not pull any equity out, borrow the money from my family to cover the down payment on a new place and rennovations to the current, then repay that family loan once I sell the current. I’d like to be independent about making this all happen, though family has said they will help me especially if it’s a better move financially. They will want a concrete plan and it not to be super risky for them though.

My real estate agent and my mortgage lender are having a disagreement. They're sorting it out, but I'm curious to get outside opinions. 

Scenario: Moving from state A to state B. 


My job: internal transfer within same company, just switching locations. 


Spouse job: New job at New employer. However this employer is federal, and has paid for much of spouses education. There is a 3 year work contract to make things square with the employer. If my spouse doesn't start work on 9/1/22 sharp, we are in breach and have to pay back an entire bachelor's degree in 6 months. 


Mortgage lender: We can't close on a house until we have already started new jobs, so closing earliest on 9/2


(Obviously we can't very well start work if we don't have a house to live in. This paradox is ridiculous and also something I've never heard of.)


Real estate agent disagrees, thinks the contracts should suffice. 


Us: how the fuck are we supposed to start work if we don't live there yet? Does every single family who moves across state lines have to rent for an unknown number of months until closing and then move a second time? That's an enormous cost of capital, time and effort.

personalfinance,tax help!! filing for two states!! ahhh!!,"tax question, i'm very very new to taxes and freaking out a little bc they're due soon.

so i live in nyc but work remotely for a company in MA. after googling and talking with another coworker in my similar position, i found out i need to file for both NY and Massachusetts. So I filed my federal and state (just for NY) using credit karma (now called Cash App taxes) and got my return approved.

unfortuantely, cash app only lets you put down one state to file for state taxes, so i thought i'd go to another site and just file another state tax. but now i'm using Free Tax USA and it won't let me just file a state tax for MA, but go through the whole federal tax shebang as well as NY state taxes. Can I... just... submit a return through Free Tax USA for my federal and NY and MA? Like, would the IRS see that I double filed and just look at my MA state filing? Should I go to another online e-filer that will let me do just one state tax? (do those exist?) Is this even the right way to be doing it?

for what it's worth i made very little in 2021 bc i only started working in the fall, (made like $8k), sooo should I even bother w MA taxes?",finance,1650178215.0

economy,Bank of America warns of dire recession that could see cryptos rocketing to new highs!,"As the US economy continues to reel under the pressure of mounting inflation, the Bank of America (BoA) predicts a humongous recession as the FED moves in to tighten its monetary policy.

As per a report by Reuters, Michael Hartnett, BoA’s chief investment strategist, warned in a weekly note that the US economy could fall lower following what he termed as “inflation shock” and “rates shock.”

Expecting a recession to unfold, Hartnett foresees a rise in the unemployment rate by 1.5%. This will be in addition to an already inverted 10-year yield that has historically preceded every US recession.

Hartnett however argued that in the context of this economic turmoil, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and cash would come out strongly, outperforming bonds and stocks due to their considered inflation-proof nature!

As and when the global conditions shift back to positive, crypto markets will be the first to recover. Projects with sound fundamentals and real-world use cases such as Plastiks, a project that bridges the gap between plastic production and recovery; Aave, a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that facilitates users with flash loans; and Enjin, a protocol that acts as a store of value in the booming NFT space, may see a dramatic spike in market capitalization.

His sentiment echos a note by the bank in late February where Alkesh Shah, Global Crypto and Digital Asset Strategist at the bank ruled out the possibility of a crypto winter despite the US Federal Reserve and microeconomic headwinds likely limiting the upside of cryptocurrencies. To Shah, the level of adoption and growth in development activity only screamed continued strength by cryptocurrencies!",finance,1650185598.0

stocks,What to watch for the week of 4/18/22,"Earnings season is in full swing, and the spotlight turns to an array of blue-chip companies across multiple sectors. Despite the numerous upcoming earnings reports, Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter (TWTR) could still be the top watch this week, with new twists anticipated after the company responded to his hostile takeover bid with a “poison pill” strategy. Some analysts believe that Twitter is unlikely to recapture its all-time-high of $80.75 per share from last year, and that a deal with Musk or another buyer may be the best strategy. 

As jam packed as this week may be, the biggest driver of the overall market will likely be the continued pessimism of interest rates, inflation and war in Europe. So you’ll definitely want to keep an eye on Fed Chair Powell whom is due to participate in a panel discussion titled ""Debate on the Global Economy"" at the Spring Meetings of the IMF &amp; World Bank Group. That takes place at 1pm EST. So don’t get blind sided with low trading volume by that potential high impact catalyst. Analysts will be sifting through company commentaries to see how all of these things are impacting the bottom line. Forward guidance could continue to be poor. Companies are going to whine and complain about cost pressures, even when they’re going to report improved results. So that may cause price action to be a little sloppier.

According to this book, Germany replaces the US as Saudi Arabia's main ally and overthrows the petrodollar agreement, while Russia corners the market on the mineral cobalt, putting US defense at the mercy of Russian and Chinese exports.

stocks,Market Multiples and Valuations - The S&amp;P 500 is overpriced.,"Last week, I had posted that high inflation and higher interest rates would cause stocks to fall and had suggested [taking profits in stocks such as NVDA to buy back 20% lower.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u0uymd/nvda_take_profits_and_buy_back_at_180/) Now NVIDIA is pretty much a family jewel and selling some our holdings meant that I really foresaw a weak 2022 for the markets - **even with the S&amp;P down 8% from its all time high of 4,766 in Dec 2021!**

Why do I think the S&amp;P will fall further? 

I don't believe the markets are fully pricing in  

1. A 2.75% 10 year treasury rate and climbing - mortgage rates crossed 5%, that will hurt housing, one of the strongest spots in the economy.
2. 8% Y0Y inflation - many are divided, some think that's the peak, many portend that it could well increase further.  I believe that a still very sluggish supply chain will continue to keep inflation elevated.
3. Geo political shocks from the war in Ukraine.
4. The Fed very much likely to increase interest rates in 1/2% bursts in 2022.
5. A profit squeeze due to higher costs, which will slow down earnings growth in 2022 and 2023 - this is very unlikely not priced in S&amp;P 500 earnings.

There is an interesting S&amp;P 500 earnings forecast from Yardeni research - here's the link [https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf)

The market consensus for S&amp;P 500 earnings are around 227 and Yardeni's is higher at 240.

At Thursday's S&amp;P 500's close of 4,392 the 2022 PE is 18.3 for Yardeni's earnings and 19.5 for analysts'  If you see the chart in figure 5, between 2007 and 2015, the PE ratio stayed below 15 most of the time and rarely rose above it. Between 2015 and pre covid March 2020, the PE ranged between 16 and 19, with a one massive drop to 13.5, mainly caused by the taper tantrum of late 2018 - when Fed chair, J Powell suggested he would start tapering and the markets took him to the woodshed.  Post Covid, PE's were significantly higher for two reasons, lower earnings and **an extra ordinary low interest rate and high fiscal stimulus environment.** 

**Both have reversed in spades and the S&amp;P is down only 8% ? And the forward PE is closer to 19, still at its high end of the range!**

Bulls would argue that earnings have grown significantly, therefore higher PE's are justified. Sure they have but from lower Covid levels and a historically elevated profitable period due to huge stimulus and catching up of demand  --- which is highly unlikely to continue. Consensus earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are calling for 10% growth in 2023 from 227 to 250, still above historical growth rates of 5.7% from 2009 to 2019. But, higher inflation reduces demand from consumers, which reduces earnings and higher interest rates reduce earnings multiples - **a double whammy.** 

I would not buy anything till the S&amp;P corrects to at least 4,000, another 9-10% fall from these levels.

CryptoCurrency,"Security Warning - If you use MetaMask on an iOS device with iCloud backup enabled, then your vault seed is automatically backed up by default. People are being phished for AppleID resets with one victim losing $650K yesterday.","**TL:DR** 

If you have MetaMask on an iPhone or Mac, then you're likely also using iCloud backup.  MetaMask backup your Valut containing your seed by default, so turn that off from Settings\\Profile\\iCloud\\Manage Storage!

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

I have been following this developing story on Twitter about a user that lost $650K yesterday due to the following phishing method with others coming forward claiming that the same has also happened to them.

**Background**  

When you create a wallet using MetaMask on an iPhone, the app will create a JSON containing your wallet, this is stored on your device.  Most users use iCloud to automatically backup their phone and app data, but unbeknown to many users, MetaMask include this file as part of the backup.  From a google search, this isn't new, it was discovered in 2019, but MetaMask have today acknowledged (addressed) it [HERE](https://nitter.net/MetaMask) after a number of users were targeted resulting in lost funds.

**Phishing Method**

For the user that lost $650K, it appears to be a very sophisticated attack. They fell victim as follows...

The malicious attacker requested several password resets against their AppleID/iCloud generating several emails to their account.  From there, they using a spoofed caller id to call the victim and claimed that they were from Apple and calling about suspicious activity on their account.  They asked them to generate their MFA one time pass to confirm that they were the account owner.   The hacker used this to reset the password and take control of the Apple account.  From there, they were able to restore from a backup and drain the wallet of all funds.

stocks,"WSJ: Shipping stocks will sink as U.S. Consumers, China Lose Ballast","I posted a [similar thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tz6r47/container_shipping_rates_are_going_mad_again_read/) 9 days ago, and there was much pushback in the comments to the article. Paging /u/namjd72 and /u/Easy7777 as you both seemed 'in the know.'  That article was all about spot prices.

[Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shipping-stocks-will-sink-as-u-s-consumers-china-lose-ballast-11650026359?mod=markets_major_pos1) to the latest article.

Here's a [graph](https://i.imgur.com/4IPZYe1.png) of the World Container Index from the article. Here's [another graph](https://i.imgur.com/7DGB6WH.png) I found from Google that goes pre-Covid. [It does not include 2022 though, so you have to directly compare the charts to see the full trend.]

The article:

&gt; Container shipping rates have started sinking. This might only be the beginning of their descent.

&gt; A steady fall in the World Container Index compiled by London-based Drewry Shipping Consultants is the latest hint that Americans—and developed world consumers more generally—might be starting to spend less on goods as fiscal stimulus drains away, inflation at a four decade high eats into wage gains, reopening economies shift back toward services and the Fed initiates aggressive rate increases. Another factor might be the lockdown in Shanghai, which appears to be disrupting the flow of goods out of China—meaning less need for container shipping.

&gt; The World Container Index is down 16% since the beginning of the year, with key routes Shanghai to Los Angeles and Shanghai to New York down 17% and 16% respectively. But most striking is the steep fall since March 10—the WCI is down 13% since that date alone. That suggests that either spring retail sales data in the U.S. will hold some nasty surprises or that the large Covid-19 outbreak in China, which really started to gain steam around mid-March, is already having an even bigger impact on global supply chains than many appreciate.

&gt; Shipping companies have started employing “void sailings,” where ships continue to sail but don’t load or discharge containers at ports, to reduce their supply on offer, and therefore support rates, according to George Griffiths, who covers the global container shipping market at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.

&gt; While the WCI is still far higher than it was before the pandemic, the trajectory will likely remain downward with significant new ship supply setting sail by the end of this year. The boom in container rates over the last two years was driven by the switch away from services toward goods owing to the pandemic and government stimulus. But if Americans really are beginning to tighten their belts now, shipping rates might only see a modest pickup when China’s lockdowns end.

&gt; The cost to ship bulk goods such as grain—which are facing more disruption from the war in Ukraine—has also fallen since mid-March. But the Baltic Dry Index, a barometer of that part of the shipping world, has performed better overall in 2022. It is still roughly flat for the year.

&gt; Container shipping stocks meanwhile, are a mixed bag. A.P. Moller-Maersk is down about 20% since mid-March. Evergreen Marine and Cosco, which also operates other types of vessels, have also struggled but fared somewhat better. If China’s lockdowns don’t ease soon and U.S. consumers don’t step up to bat, investors in the sector, and perhaps more broadly in retail, may ultimately wish they had abandoned ship earlier.",finance,1650224506.0
CryptoCurrency,HODL and compound interest,"A lot of posts here say the only right strategy is hodling and staking your coins to earn more coins.

You might ask how long would it take to double the amount of your coins since that's something we all want, am I right?

Let me introduce the Rule of 72 to you then. According to that rule, to get an approximate time it'll take to double your investment is to divide 72 by the annual interest rate.

Now some examples to see it more clearly:

If your interest rate is 5 percents, it will take 15 years to double your coins.

With 8 percents, it would take app. 9 years.

Do you want to be faster and double your coins in 5 years? The rate should be then 14.4 percents.

Should you use compound interest on your coins? Definitely! Should you expect to double your $100, $1000 or $10000 in few months just from compound? Definitely not.",cryptocurrency,1650224560.0

vet,Does our dog have a chronic issue?,"This is really long because there’s a lot of back story… please scroll down to see our dog’s current symptoms/concerns.

We began noticing serious issues with our 3 year old dog recently that developed after she lost her housemate, our other beloved dog, suddenly and unexpectedly of acute renal failure. This was soon after the stress of an overseas move. Before these developments, we never noticed any major health issues with her before, though she had always been a fussy eater and she had some separation anxiety that we had been able to significantly reduce over the years. She is a rescue, a Vietnamese mix (Phu Quoc Ridgeback) who we found on the street.

The clinical signs we noted at the time (early March) were as follows: subtle signs of decreased energy, wiry fur, enormous amounts of shedding, decreasing appetite (sometimes not eating for 24+ hours), lip smacking (especially at night), and abnormal behaviors (searching). She had some tests by a specialist (internist) and was prescribed an antacid called Omeprazole which significantly helped her appetite. 

She seemed OK initially, but unfortunately took a severe turn for the worse a few days after her specialist visit. She developed diarrhea, vomiting, very bad nausea, insomnia, complete loss of appetite, no drinking, and extreme lethargy. One night she was awake through the entire night in so much discomfort, constantly smacking her lips and unable to settle down. She went to the vet about 3 times in 3 days as they tried to figure out what was wrong, and she was eventually hospitalized (this was a fiasco I won’t get into, she should have been hospitalized right away). She was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis which made sense given that she got into a very fatty piece of food the day before the symptoms presented (someone gave it to her without asking us). However, an internal scan also revealed extensive inflammation of the stomach lining, so that was treated as well, and we were told it actually was not pancreatitis, it was the inflammation causing issues. She went on fluids and some meds and she got better quickly.

Four days after receiving fluids and new medications, she was significantly better. She had energy again, began eating with no issues, and her fur stopped falling out and became soft again. We fed and hydrated her through a syringe for a few days. Her searching behaviours also started to go away and she regained some comfort at the dog park. She has now been on a bland, low-fat diet (salmon Fromm’s kibble, white rice, boiled chicken), plus daily probiotics, and antacid 2x/day for just under a month. She has also had 3 B12 shots in that time. She also takes Nexgard Spectra once/month for all her preventative stuff (we started this 2 months ago, prior she used a combination of other things). 

We’re really pleased with her improvement, but we can’t shake the notion that something could be chronically wrong. She recently developed diarrhea that lasted more than a few days, for which we were prescribed a different type of probiotic (in tube form) which helped immediately. As soon as the probiotic ran out, she got diarrhea again. It’s not explosive or anything, but it usually follows a pattern, it’s a semi-solid poop in the morning and then completely liquid diarrhea shortly after that. We’re taking her to the vet for this issue the day after tomorrow. Other than this, she is eating as normal (2x/a day, not always right away but she eventually eats everything we give her), drinking (though not as much as we’d like), sleeping well. Though, we notice she sleeps all of the time. Like, all the time. If she is not on a walk, or eating, or greeting us at the door, she is asleep, like deeply asleep. She’s always slept a lot, but the difference now is that sometimes she doesn’t want to get up. She will, but she’s hesitant, especially in the morning. 

Her behaviour is also up and down. She has always been playful and liked other dogs, though this changed a bit when she was brutally attacked 2 years ago. Since then, she developed some reactivity, but we have helped her to the point where she can be around other dogs and sometimes, in certain environments, gets enough confidence to play. Since our other dog died though, she has only played with other dogs at the park less than a handful of times. She becomes very still, does not engage, and often gets her hackles up or bares her teeth when approached (she doesn’t attack or bite). She is interested in other dogs but doesn’t seem to know how to play. Though, her separation anxiety has gotten much better and she is not destroying anything at home.

TL;DR/Her current status/concerns:
As you can see below, the test results have ruled out some chronic issues, but we’re concerned about her SDMA level (especially given how our boy died), and her high cortisol levels. The lip smacking is also concerning, as it happens frequently, especially throughout the night and early in the morning (though the antacid stops it for a couple hours). She is also yawning and stretching a lot—we notice that she yawns sometimes around other dogs. Another new behaviour is chewing/licking her feet and lower front legs with regularity, while before, she never used to do that. When we take her out for a walk or a big hike, she has bundles of energy, but she is completely hibernating at home. We’re very very worried that she has something chronic and we’re missing it. We suspect maybe she has a mental health issue (ongoing stress/anxiety?) or ongoing GI or esophageal issues (inflammation?) or an allergy? 

Summary of recent-ish test results:
	•	SDMA 10/03/2022: 22; 15/03/2022: 24 [high]
	•	Thyroid TT4 10/03/2022: 40.7 [high, but she doesn’t seem to have the clinical signs of hyperthyroidism]
	•	Urine Protein:Creatinine ratio (UPC) 10/03/2022: &lt;0.2 [normal]
	•	Baseline cortisol 16/03/2022: 224 [high, not Addison’s but also not suspected Cushing’s, vet attributed this to her being very scared at the clinic]
	•	Kidney values excl. SDMA 16/03/2022: [all normal]
	•	cPL pancreas 16/03/2022: [abnormal]
	•	EOS 13/03/2022: [high]
	•	RETIC 13/03/2022: [high]
	•	Internal ultrasound scan 17/03/2022: [all normal, but some stomach inflammation, which has presumably now rectified itself]
	•	Several abdominal examinations revealed no pain

CryptoCurrency,Can the Average Person Handle True DEFI?,"WIthout greater freedom comes with greater responsibility. And with more financial freedom, people have more opportunities to screw up. 

Let's look at one issue that is commonly brought up in this sub: We like to bash banks for the centralized nature of our economical system. Yes, banks charge absurd fees for over-drafting. 

But we need to look at some underlying reasons why people are getting overdrafts. 

While some over-drafting may come from mistakes in the bank, I believe many people who are getting overdrafts are simply irresponsible, and can't even check their own balance in their bank account before making a purchase. 

If some people aren't responsible enough to even check their own accounts that they have enough money to make a purchase, do you think they can be responsible enough to handle a cold storage wallet? 

Can the average person ensure:

*  that they can enter a wallet address correctly (and risk transferring the funds to the wrong account).
* That they won't get scammed constantly by using a scam DEX, or improperly using even a legitimate DEX.
* They won't lose their seed phrase and get locked out of their account forever. 

A little bit off point, but we see many people getting themselves into bad financial situations by taking out payday loans with predatory interest rates. What does this mean? This means that many people are financially irresponsible. Can they handle DEFI?

The worst bond rout in decades shows few signs of abating, threatening further pain for both investors and borrowers.

Rising Treasury yields are in many ways a reflection of a robust economy. A big reason why many investors expect continued high inflation in the near term is that households are flush with cash and eager to spend their money on travel and leisure activities as they begin to worry less about the Covid-19 pandemic. The labor market is also, by some measures, the tightest in decades, giving workers leverage to demand better wages and confidence that they can always find a different job if they lose their current one.

These forces, though, are precisely why the Fed has been trying to push up bond yields by promising a rapid series of interest-rate increases—an effort whose urgency hasn’t been diminished by a modestly encouraging inflation report last week. Many investors are saying they expect bond prices to continue to fall this year, and ***some contend it won’t be clear that the central bank’s message is getting through until stock prices suffer more serious declines.***

Treasury yields largely reflect expectations for short-term rates over the life of a bond. They in turn set a floor on borrowing costs across the economy. The Fed, now, wants borrowing costs to rise to slow consumer demand and bring down inflation—and it is succeeding at least in the first of goals, with the average 30-year mortgage climbing last week to 5% for the first time since 2011.

One hope of some bond investors is that surging consumer prices, coupled with higher borrowing costs, could slow consumer demand in relatively short order. In that case, the Fed could keep tightening monetary policy, but officials wouldn’t feel the need to raise their rate forecasts further, allowing bond yields to stabilize.

Guessing the final destination of interest rates is extremely difficult, he said, but ***one sign that the Fed might need to do more than currently expected is that stocks, as a whole, have only experienced modest declines, with the S&amp;P 500 down 7.8% year-to-date.***

US citizen with foreign parents/roots, my father passed away &gt;5yrs ago, my mother works in a small store she owns in her home country, my younger sibling started university this year in a public school to become a doctor. I recently came to the US in order to pay students loans I obtained to pay for a bachelor's degree in business administration with minors in Finance &amp; Management at US university's foreign campus.

I have a month working as an accountant/data entry in a good workplace, with friendly coworkers, excellent bosses, as a temporary hire under a recruiting agency, at $23/hr, 40hrs/week, paid weekly at $750 if only 40hrs worked ($3,000/month). 

I have expressed that I want to be considered for a permanent position in the company, and this past week my boss told me he spoke with another director (in the accounting/finance department of the company), and that they are preparing to offer me a permanent position after my temp. contract runs out. I purchased a YNAB subscription (monthly) to better budget myself and my finances. I do not yet know if this would come with a pay increase, but having the assurance that I have a job is best for now.

Because of almost non-existent credit history, I was only approved for a 2018 vehicle at 22% interest with $560 monthly payments (horrible I know, but did not have funds for even a beater car, only a $1k down payment, just applied for a Discover It Secured with $300 credit that is coming soon in order to start building/fixing my credit, and hopefully refinance the auto loan in the near future).

My rent is currently is $550 with family members, not on lease just ""helping out with utilities and groceries"" but unfortunately have to move by June, am looking for a place near my current work &gt;$900 (30% of my net income).

Auto insurance is currently $160/month, don't have a private health insurance or renters insurance, each week I fill my car with $60 (I don't go out much other than work and gym, which is on my commute), am not a big spender on clothes, if needing something, I check my local Goodwill first. Phone bill is $100/month until I am credited ~$25 for my previous phone I turned in. Currently setting aside only $75/week into a savings account aiming for a $1k emergency fund. 

I would like to send back to my family ~$200-300/month to help them out, but they've understand that I am only now settling here.

I believe my company offers 401k to permanent employees, but as I am not yet an permanent, I have not asked around much about it, hopefully that changes soon, and if possible, am able to contribute for my retirement. I would also like have a Roth IRA but don't know much (recently finished J. L. Collins' Simple Path to Wealth).

CryptoCurrency,"I did the math and I can't retire until BTC hits $100 million per coin, FML","**tldr: Crypto is not going to make me rich and I'm going to work until I die.**

I'm aiming for $100,000 a year passive income in my retirement. (EDIT: the 100k is my estimate for what I want my future income to be, not what I'm making right now. I raised it to account for future medical expenses, and padded it so I could spend more during my retirement than what I can afford right now)

That seemed attainable to me and not too crazy of a goal. I felt I could reasonably retire early in 10 years, or even in 5 if crypto really goes crazy.

But then I actually did the math, with all the taxes and everything taken into account, and crypto isn't going to help me much at all, actually. It really deflated my hope that crypto will make me rich. Unless you're a whale, a normal person with a few thousand in crypto right now will not be a millionaire or retire comfortably unless the price of your coin does 1000x from here. It's possible, but not likely.

Here are my calculations, working backwards, step-by-step:

$100,000 final take-home net income. This what I want to end up with to pay for my yearly expenses and to not have to work.

~$120,000 pre-tax gross income. I'm assuming 15% combined long term capital gains tax, for federal and state. This tax rate varies of course depending on your state. I use this to estimate: https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator

~$3,000,000 stock/bond portfolio needed to safely withdraw 4% from (to get that $120,000). The Trinity study is based off of a traditional stock and bonds portfolio. There is no SWR established for crypto portfolios.

~$5,000,000 crypto portfolio I need to sell in order to get that $3m traditional portfolio. 40% tax. Again, roughly estimated from this https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator

If I have like 0.05 BTC, which is a lot imo, that means I would need BTC to hit $100,000,000 in order for me to get the $5m I need to retire. 

You can sneer at that 0.05 BTC and say just invest more, but I don't think most people would have $2,000 lying around to throw into crypto. 

So I don't know about you, but BTC is not going to hit $100 million per coin. I'm certainly not going to rely on that to happen to fund my retirement.

You can adjust the numbers and say well maybe you just need $50,000 to live in your retirement or you might have 0.1 BTC already. That still means BTC has to hit $50 million a coin to make retirement happen. Or say you're well off or super lucky already and have a whole 1 BTC. This still needs the price to hit $5m to retire, when most of the bullish predictions now are only around $1m per BTC. 

You can tinker with the tax percentages or whatever for your country/state (or correct my calculations above; I'm not an accountant), but I think the ROI needed are still astronomical and I (and you) need more realistic expectations.",cryptocurrency,1650243146.0
personalfinance,Took an education loan for undergrad in engineering,"I’m a final year engineering student (22F) from India, and I live in a small city here that has one of the best private universities in my country, so my city is basically just famous for its education. Back in 2018 my parents didn’t want me moving away to a different place and they decided to make me study here itself. But obviously since it’s a private university it’s super expensive as well. And we couldn’t afford it. So to get me the best education my parents got me an education loan. In 12th grade I’d been through depression and I didn’t give a sht about anything and just agreed to whatever, I was very clueless about this whole part of life, didn’t do any research about the university, and I fcked up big time that way. Plus my family doesn’t have a good educational background as well, so most of them had no idea about any of this, and it was a pretty big deal for them that I’d be doing engineering in the first place, even more so since it was in this university, and even more so because I’m female.

My tuition fees for all 4 years combined is Rs. 1,186,000. And the rate of interest from the bank is 8%. My parents haven’t paid any interest to the bank so far because they haven’t been doing well financially since the last couple of years. So I checked my loan account recently and it shows that I owe the bank Rs. 1,400,000 as of today. I haven’t even finished my studies yet, I’ll be graduating in 3 months.

I have a job offer in hand, and I’ll be making about 50,000 per month starting from September mostly, but I’ll be moving to a bigger city for this and I’ll have expenses there as well, and my family still isn’t doing that well financially so I’ll also have to send some money home.
Every month there’s an interest of Rs. 8k being added, and I’m not sure how I’m going to repay this amount. This feels like a major burden specially since the interest has already come up by Rs. 214,000 till now and I haven’t even graduated! I do have time to repay my loan but the interest keeps increasing and I’m getting so worried about my future. Do I talk to the bank about this interest rate? How do I repay this amount?

personalfinance,House help/money recommendations,"Hello, looking for some feedback on if I am making myself house poor or making a bad decision by purchasing a house in the first place, I am 25. My fiancee currently lives in another state and would move here after I purchase this home since my 1 bedroom apartment would be too cramped for everyone, she has a 10yr old daughter. The house she currently lives in would be sold but her father owns it, there is about $400,000 of equity in that home which he has verbally said is hers but I would rather leave that out of the equation.

Financials below

Salary: 100k

Brokerage account: 75k

Cash: 25k (original down payment for 5% on a $500,000 home.)

Total in retirement accounts: 90k

Credit card debt: $3,000 at 0% for the remainder of this year, $50/month

Car loan: $2,500, but will be paid off by next month, this is currently $180/month

I was originally looking at houses in November when the interest rate was 3% and my budget was around $500,000. We were never able to get offers in since most houses were under contract by the time she was in town visiting. Fast forward to today, interest rates went up and my budget has shrunk to around $410,000 for a similar monthly payment. There are not too many houses in this price range that I would be comfortable buying. Desirable homes in my area sell for around 20k over the list price. Would it be wise to use the money from my brokerage account to increase our down payment or should I be waiting for prices to soften? I am hesitant about doing this because the extra money put down never seems to make a large difference and would be better suited in my pocket. On the other hand, what am I saving money for if not for these big life purchases? My retirement accounts are healthy and do not need to be supplemented by the brokerage account. Also, is purchasing this much house going to make me house poor? I am going from living a single lifestyle to something very different which is just added cost I have not had to deal with.

investing,Inflation might temper sooner than expected,"I was firmly in the camp that inflation and rate hikes are going to be severe this year. Then I thought some more, and wonder if the inflation will die down sooner than I thought (meaning the prior inflated prices will stay, but new inflation going forward will be tempered.)

The reason is 2-fold: 

1) inflated prices are taking away real purchasing power from consumers. This will hit their pocket books, and wages have never grown faster than inflation in the past decade. Even with this year larger than usual raise, it's still behind inflation.

2) household debts are pretty high, making households sensitive to even small rises in interest rates (same goes for US debt.) this will again depress spending.

as long as the US government doesn't hand out more money or forgive tons of debt, the debt overhang effectively act as a deflationary factor.

My greatest fear, however, is that if monetary tightening is not enough, there will still be speculative money floating around, causing continued asset prices to rise unreasonably, especially in housing.

I have another scenario for rate hikes which I didn't consider before: it's middle of the road between low rates and runaway inflation, and very high rates, moderate to severe recession and low inflation--rate hike to about 3-4%, inflation rate decelerating to 5-6%, mild recession, average 30-year mortgage rates to hit 6-7% this year, and stock market PE to shrink moderately. So not like a catastrophic scenario.

Anybody poke some holes in my theory?

And I hear people saying that interest rate needs to be higher than inflation rate in order to tamp down inflation. I don't understand the reasoning behind it. Why does it require 9+% interest rate to battle a 9% inflation rate? If someone can enlighten me on this, that would be appreciated.",finance,1650250948.0

personalfinance,I'm afraid to do anything with my assets.,"Throwaway account. See Title.

A bit of background: I grew up without much, so I have always looked at money a bit differently and I'm now trying to figure out how to make use of my assets. I am in tech and work at a startup, so I've saved up $225k in a savings account over the past 5 years. However, I don't really know when enough is enough. I don't currently own a home, but was recently shopping for one in this market. I ended up not buying one because I realized I was feeling rushed by the market (FOMO on the housing prices and the interest rates). I know at some point I want to buy a house, but I don't know if I want to buy right now just because of my lifestyle. I know right now I don't want to deal with the maintenance. Additionally, writing a check for $125k for down payment and closing costs made me feel really insecure for some reason (I do go to therapy to help with some of these issues around money). I think it has to do with the inflation right now, and feeling somewhat insecure with what could happen in the economy in the next couple years. It makes me feel secure to know that I can fall back on the savings if I needed to.

My conservative financial nature has definitely caused me to miss out on earning some real returns in the market, whether it be investing or real estate. I just keep putting money into a savings account and anytime I get close to making a big financial decision, like buying a house, I get cold feet. It seems odd to me to feel this way. My net worth is about $500k (401k and my cash savings) and I'm in my mid 30s, so I'm doing some things right. But I am just afraid of doing something other than saving.

Was curious if anyone else has dealt with similar issues and how you overcame them.

Thanks.",finance,1650253491.0
investing,Stocks vs Bonds vs Commodities,"The goal here is to determine the expected return of bonds, stocks, and commodities given current market conditions.

I previously addressed stocks vs bonds here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_the/). Since then the stock market appears to have peaked, as I expected. However, the bond market is also having a rough go of it. Bonds continue to have a higher expected return than stocks, but neither are expected to be good.

For this reason, I’ve been casting about for another place to invest. Real-estate is expensive as well, and I already own plenty. However, I have been hearing that commodities may be the place to be, so I decided to investigate further.

I’ve reworked my analysis, and put it at [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC\_izY14qAa7zdSm\_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC_izY14qAa7zdSm_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing). I’ve removed all mentions of real dollars and am now discussing nominal dollars and returns only, as looking at real dollars doubles the number of columns in the spreadsheet and lowers the correlations I find (because I do not know how to predict inflation). Coupons and dividends are reinvested, as before.

I’ve also changed how things are organized so that stocks, bonds, and commodities are on a more equal footing. Bonds are just one possible investment, rather than the reference point for stocks.

**I use the following predictors / valuation measures:**

*Stocks:*

Jesse Livermore's Average Investor Equity Allocation (AIEA) has the best performance that I’ve found.

Briefly, AIEA is (Stocks Owned) / (Stocks + Bonds + Cash Owned) by the entire market. It can be thought of as a fear/greed indicator, where higher values are greedy and lower values are fearful.

AIEA is discussed here: [https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/](https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/), and the raw data is available here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis).

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.86 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of -0.8 +/- 2.5%.

*Bonds:*

The mechanism used for the model is that the bonds held are traded each month for new bonds at the new interest rate. This takes into account the effect of changing interest rates on the value of bonds held, but not taxes or fees. Coupon payments are reinvested. The given interest rate for the current ten year bond is a good (though not perfect) predictor for what the ten year return will be. The data comes from [http://www.econ.yale.edu/\~shiller/data/ie\_data.xls](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls)

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.88 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 2.1 +/- 2.0%

*Commodities:*

I did not find any good suggestions in my searching, and tried a wide range of possibilities. The best predictor that I found was GSCI/GDP. GSCI is S&amp;P’s commodity index, with records back to 1970 here: [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci). GDP is the U.S. gross domestic product, with data here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP). This implies that there is a natural level of investment in commodities, compared to GDP. If you know of something better, please let me know.

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.64 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 13.5 +/- 10%. The high uncertainty here is largely because the correlation got markedly worse in 2005, around the time of global financial crisis. Commodities suffered a bubble and pop, with a peak in June of 2008. In addition to the demand fluctuation related to the global financial crisis, this was the time that massive oil and natural gas investment was occurring, which ended up crashing the prices until recently.

So it is clear that Commodities have a higher expected return going forward. However, much of this depends on whether you believe that the correlation breakdown in 2005 is permanent or temporary. Personally, I am confident enough to put a sizeable commodities investment in DBC, a commodities futures fund, but not going all in.

**Back tests:**

As before, I worked out an optimal back tested strategy. With this I find the following CAGRs, from January, 1970 to January, 2021.

Stocks only: 10.93%

Bonds only: 7.18%

Commodities only:6.79%

Stock and Bonds: 13.42%

Stocks and Commodities and Bonds: 17.18%.

For each of these, I use the indicators from six months prior to the current date. This happens to give better results, as well as being possible without a time machine. I switch the entire portfolio to the best investment once a month, where the best investment has a fudge factor. That is, if expected stock return &gt; expected bond return + 0.8%, I go with stocks. Otherwise I go with bonds. If I wish to look at commodities, If find that it almost never a good idea to choose commodities over stocks. However, if expected bonds return &gt; expected commodity return + 0.5%, I stick with bonds. Otherwise, I stay go with commodities.

By the time I get to commodities, the model feels over fit, which means that it should used with caution. However, we can still stick with the conclusion that commodities are cheap right now, and likely have much more upside.

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* AIEA measures a natural level for stock vs bond ownership. This is not a fundamental parameter, with an underlying theory about why the natural level should be where it is, or will remain the same in the future.
* Though GSCI/GDP feels like it could be fundamental parameter, it leaves out important phenomena, like the changing structure of the economy, as well as paradigm shifts in commodity extraction technology.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* My analysis starts in 1970, because that is when the commodities data becomes available. This is a smaller data set than I ‘d like.
* I’m using the S&amp;P 500, 10 year US treasuries, and GSCI because they have long data sets, not because I consider them to be optimal investments.",finance,1650255915.0

As of writing this post, all of my exit targets have been reached. 25 @$95, 100 @$85, and the rest @$76. If you don’t like math, that’s OK. I don’t like it either. Realized PNL: just over 5.5k. Here’s a SS of position right before it got filled:
 
[Filled Position](https://imgur.com/a/HjDpIWf)

A couple of weeks ago, when the price kept creeping up to ~117 ATH, I started feeling a bit nervous. It seemed as if every other news article on the sub was about Do Kwon buying more and more BTC. The daily discussion threads were full of Luna holders shilling it to everyone and their mothers. 

Then it started trickling down. Fed news leaked. Inflation curbing. Interest rate hikes. The ongoing war in Ukraine. Etc. etc. Macro definitely helped my position here.

Then the cascade down. Terra injecting 3 million Luna into circulating supply (Project Dawn, a known factor). UST demand flatlined for a couple of days. Terra injecting another 10 million Luna. People taking profit. People panic-selling after losses. Liquidations.

If Luna ever breaks its ATH again, I’ll be there to short it again. Principally, nothing has changed in my criticism of Terra, Luna, and UST.

People who short on this subreddit get a lot of hate because hodlers and DCAers think we’re just hating on their coin. I DO believe in the future of crypto, and I try to long when I can. But why limit yourself to fighting with one arm tied behind your back? If you see an opportunity, you take it. On low leverage of course (not like that degen Korean Youtuber Satto).

The money has just been sitting in a checking account for the past year. I’m really encouraging her to invest it and want to help by giving some guidance. 

So my question is:
What type of investment accounts do you recommend? We’re looking for something that’s basically a one stop shop. What I’m imagining is something where we could buy into a ready made portfolio, forget about the money and let it grow until we need it someday. This would likely be 20+ years as I could only see us using it to help a hypothetical kid in college or our own retirement (outside of an unforeseen emergency). 

Let’s hear your thoughts! Thanks!!",finance,1650280608.0
wallstreet,"A book entitled ""The Fall of the US Dollar: A Second Coming of the Non-Aggression Pact"" forsees strong communist momentum coming about from negligent monetary policy. According to this book, Germany replaces the US as Saudi Arabia's main ally and overthrows the petrodollar agreement","A book entitled ""The Fall of the US Dollar: A Second Coming of the Non-Aggression Pact"" forsees strong communist momentum coming about from negligent monetary policy. According to this book, Germany replaces the US as Saudi Arabia's main ally and overthrows the petrodollar agreement, while Russia corners the market on the mineral cobalt, putting US defense at the mercy of Russian and Chinese exports. US economic and military hegemony would come to an end. According to the book, Germany wil either leave the eurozone or annex the European Central Bank. The US in this scenario would try to use Bitcoin to prop up the USD, but the attempt would fail.

The rise of communism in America, as explained in the book, is attributed to something that Keynes mentioned in one of his books. It is right in line with what is transpiring in the US, and ""The Fall of the US Dollar: A Second Coming of the Non-Aggression Pact"" eloquently explains the connection. I forget what chapter of ""The Fall of the US Dollar"" that the connection is made between Keynes and what is happening in the US. It is certainly there and right on the money.

The non aggression pact is an agreement between Germany, Russia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo(DRC), Ukraine and China. There is a free preview on Amazon and you can use the search function to see what topics are discussed in the book.",finance,1650281230.0
stocks,"Is it ""difficult"" for the U.S. economy to make a soft landing? Goldman Sachs: 35% chance of recession within two years","Historically, the gap between jobs and the labor force has narrowed significantly only during recessions, and as a result, Goldman Sachs believes the Fed's economic soft landing is ""on a tough road.""

High-fever inflation in the U.S. is putting increasing pressure on the Fed, and Goldman Sachs sees a 35 percent chance of a recession in the U.S. within the next two years.

Just this past Sunday, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said in a research note that it may be difficult for the Fed to achieve a so-called soft landing for the economy. Because the Fed's main challenge now is to close the gap between jobs and the labor force, and by tightening financial policy to slow wage growth to a pace consistent with its 2% inflation target without drastically raising unemployment.

Historically, such a sharp narrowing of the gap has only occurred during recessions, and as a result, the Fed's economic soft landing ""is on a tough road.""

But Jan Hatzius also added that a recession is not inevitable, and the normalization of labor supply and durable goods prices in the post-pandemic era can be a boost for the Fed. Furthermore, many developed countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Canada, have also embarked on a soft economic landing.

As for the U.S., of the 14 tightening cycles since World War II, 11 did have recessions within two years, but only 8 of those can be ""partly"" attributable to Fed tightening. And in recent times, ""soft landings"" have been more common. Get it right at Jan Hatzius, and the odds of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months are about 15%.

Before Goldman Sachs, many institutions and well-known investors have expressed the view that the Fed is difficult to complete the economic soft landing. For example, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said after the company's earnings report last week that the risk of the Federal Reserve accidentally pushing the U.S. economy into recession while it is fighting inflation is increasing. Previously, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers made another ""doomsday prophecy"", saying that a U.S. economic recession was inevitable.

It is also worth mentioning that economists are gradually reaching consensus on the forecast of a recession in the US economy. Relevant survey data show that they predict that the possibility of a recession in the United States in the next 12 months has risen from 20% last month to 27.5% today.",finance,1650283766.0

I can afford it, no problem - I actually prefer to owe money come tax time.  But I also would love to know \_why\_ I owe so much money.  

I made $206k in wages (W2 box 1), $225k in medicare wages (W2 box 5), maxed out of my 401k for the year, and did a roth IRA backdoor (which shouldn't affect my taxes at all, right?)

I have a brokerage account that made about $1.5k in dividends which I acknowledge I need to pay taxes on, but aside from this, all other income was made from my full time/professional job and should be taxed appropriately, right?  I have two allowances on my withholding, FWIW (I don't recall why I chose two instead of 1 when I started my job a few years ago).

The only ""lead"" I have is that I was granted a few cash grants (similar to RSUs/vested stock, but instead of stocks just straight up cash.  1/3 of the grant vests each year).  These were taxed at a flat 22% federal rate which I \_think\_ is correct given that they are supplemental income.  If they are classified as regular income, the tax differences kinda make sense - a few thousand could be attributed to this, lowering the amount owed to less than $1k...

Anyways, on your transactions ask does the crypto change ownership? 

* If yes, then it is most likely taxable
* If no, then it most likely isn't taxable.

So if you transfer from one wallet to another wallet, then it isn't taxable.

# What I know isn't taxable

* Transfers from one of your wallets/accounts to another you own
* Maybe gifts up to an amount
* Minting NFT
* Holding your crypto/NFT

# What is taxable capital gains

* Trading crypto for normal money
* Trading crypto for crypto
* Trading crypto for an NFT
* Using crypto to buy a good or service

# What is taxable income

* LP rewards
* Staking
* Mining
* Actually getting paid as income
* Air drops (Note dust and stuff you don't want, you don't get taxed as long as you never sell it)
* DeFi
* There might be more

# What is tax deductible

* Trading fees
* Losses up to $3k a year. Losses greater than can deduct in future years up to $3k per year.

&amp;#x200B;

# Capital gains Long vs Short

Note each state has different local capital gains rules. Like FL has no capital gains, while others tax both long and short the same. So look up what your state rates are.

Federal:

* Short term capital gains are taxed the same as income. Short term is anything held less than 1 year.
* Long term you aren't taxed up to a given amount ($40k if I recall right). Long term is when you hold more than 1 year.

Note capital gains can screw with your AGI. Meaning your income taxes can increase to a higher bracket. But in theory if you paid only $40k in long term and nothing else. Then you can get away with paying 0 taxes on what you earn that year. 

Note the long term capital gains $40k changes per year. What some people do in the stock market is when their long term is getting close to a given $. They sell, then buy back to reset the cost bases. This keeping them in a low tax bracket.

&amp;#x200B;

# NOTE: you don't pay taxes on a loss (note the $3k deduction). But the wash sell rule I think it does come in sometime in the future. But for 2021 it was OK with crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

# Note: If you hold $10k of funds/crypto on a foreign exchange then you need to file given paperwork on this. 

&amp;#x200B;

# How do I handle all the data?

I use Koinly. Note coin tracker is mostly the same, so check the prices. Just note it uses past transactions and personally I use Koinly because when I asked Cointracker if the payment plan is for all transactions or just that year. They wouldn't answer me. With Koinly, I asked and it is just that year. meaning old transactions you're not paying for.

Koinly gathers all the data, check for errors, pay for the proper plan, and get the documents needed.

Note the IRS does allow for consolidation of transactions. They only care about how much you made, if it is income or capital gains, and if it is long or short term. 

&amp;#x200B;

I personally keep mine as FIFO. The reason is, there is NO tracking software that lets you mark giving trades as LIFO. So it is an all or none. FIFO is friendly if you are going for long term capital gains. LIFO is friendly with bots. It might be possible to rig it with multiple accounts if you use bots with a given exchange and never use it for anything but bots.

&amp;#x200B;

# NOTE: Keep whatever info for about 4 years on the off chance you get audited. 

Because there was a number of people who literally off themselves and there is even cases where the IRS went after the family of the dead person to get the tax money. Political people put in rules to force the IRS to start being nicer and more forgiving. At worse if you did an honest screw up, you might have to deal with an audit, and if they find something then you will pay in back taxes + interest. And it is likely they will work with you to do a payment plan or forgiveness on part. 

So don't let your anxiety wreck you unless if you need everything right for a security clearance or something. The IRS isn't the Mafia and going after your knee caps. They understand if you are in jail, you most likely can't pay the gov, and they want to steal all the money they can from you. They are smart like that .....",cryptocurrency,1650305130.0

**TL;DR:** Married filing joint, made less as a household in 2021 than 2020, didn't change W4's and owe $4000 since not enough was withheld. Wondering why that happened?

Anyways, I am trying to seek out clarity on why we had to pay in so much in taxes this year. I'll be honest, taxes always confuse me so maybe this is a dumb question with a simple answer.

My wife and I both work W2 jobs, married filing joint, and mid point last year she switched to part time and hourly. So we made about $10K less as a household compared to 2020. I also got about a $4000 raise from 2020 to 2021 but that $10K accounts for that. I noticed my Fed tax withheld was about $1000 less with my new salary vs. the old salary. Why? I didn't change anything on my withholdings so why did it withhold less automatically on a higher salary?

In theory, we both claim ""0"" but I understand a few years back they changed the W4 to a calculator style, which has honestly confused me. So truth be told we've never walked through that as we've both always claimed 0. Is this the issue alone?

Anyways, we just finished taxes, and usually do TurboTax, but hired a CPA this year. We ended up owing $4000 in taxes. We also got penalized for not withholding enough. Obviously, this is a big surprise to get hit with. When we asked the CPA for clarity on it, they simply stated well unfortunately you collectively didn't withhold enough, so thats the difference. So, yeah it seems like a simple answer based on simple math. But I thought the point of 0 was to withhold more so you dont owe or get a refund?

But my question and frustration is *what changed last year that caused this?* We made less money and didn't change our W4 from previous years. So WHO decided or WHY was it decided less was withheld when we didn't actively make that decision?

I asked the CPA who to talk to that can give clarity on it and they said it's an HR question. I plan to reach out, but don't think it's going to really answer anything.

I'm assuming the answer will just be ""You didn't have enough withholdings so therefore you owe. Do the IRS calculator to make adjustments"". I get that I just want to know *why we didn't have enough, when we did years prior.*

If we get a raise are we supposed to adjust the W4 to withhold more every time? I always assumed the 0, 1, 2 adjusted accordingly to that. Does it have something to do with the stimulus checks? Does salary to hourly pay affect it?

We plan to sit down and do the new IRS W4 calculator to hopefully avoid this again, but I just am very baffled and frustrated with this 2021 return.

I normally use TurboTax to file my returns, and get a nice tax return. Late last year I sold around 100k in stock, and now I'm seeing that owe 15k to the fed and state (combined.). I did not expect it to be this high, especially since I was our on injury for almost half the year and did not bring home a big salary. 

Is it possible to file an extension, and throw some money into a IRA or 401k to lower my taxable income, or is that too late?  I did not contribute to anything last year due to the lack of salary.   If I file an extension, will that extend my time to pay?

I've been in an intensive program with multiple tests per week, and unfortunately I let this sneak up on me. 

THANK YOU!",finance,1650310556.0

investing,"Hot Economy, Rising Inflation: The Fed Has Never Successfully Fixed a Problem Like This","https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-jobs-fed-recession-economy-11650294297?mod=hp_lead_pos9

The Federal Reserve is setting out to do something it has never accomplished before: reduce inflation a lot without significantly raising unemployment.

Central bank officials think it is possible with calibrated interest rate increases that slow booming demand just enough to take steam out of an overheated economy. But even one of the Fed’s closest allies, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, sees the risk of failure. “It will require skill and also good luck,” the former Fed chair said in public comments in Washington last week.

During the past 80 years, the Fed has never lowered inflation as much as it is setting out to do now—by four percentage points—without causing recession. In this case, the central bank will need a number of factors out of its control to break its way.

Still, Fed officials can find reason for both optimism and caution from history. In seven different episodes during the past 80 years, inflation has fallen as much as the Fed bank wants it to drop now, with varying outcomes. The episodes suggest that the desired scenario is theoretically possible though the risk of failure is high, especially because the bank is chasing inflation that already exists, rather than addressing the problem before it arises as it did in some earlier episodes.

“No one expects that bringing about a soft landing will be straightforward in the current context—very little is straightforward in the current context,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last month. The central bank, he added, faces a “challenging task.”

During the early 1980s, the U.S. experienced a classic hard-landing as economists dub it—falling into a deep recession with double-digit unemployment after the Fed pushed its benchmark interest rate to nearly 20% to tame stubbornly high inflation that had been rising for more than a decade.

The U.S. had less severe, but bumpy landings during the 1950s, characterized by short-lived inflation spikes and recessions. During that period, the unemployment rate rarely got very high even when economic output contracted.

The 1970s delivered aborted landings, when inflation fell and then lurched higher, beset by outside shocks such as OPEC oil embargoes and policy missteps including a central bank that hesitated to raise interest rates aggressively.

The U.S. has had soft landings, too, most recently in 1994. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan sharply raised rates to 6% in February 1995 from 3% one year earlier, and the unemployment rate kept going down. Unlike 1994, however, the Fed today is trying to reduce inflation that is already too high rather than prevent it from rising, as Mr. Greenspan did back then.

In the scenario Fed officials mapped out, their benchmark interest rate will rise to around 2.75% by the end of next year, just above estimates of a rate that neither spurs nor slows growth.

They project inflation will drop to slightly above 2% by 2024, a rare four-percentage-point decline in less than three years. They see economic output growing at a rate between 2% and 3% while unemployment holds below 4%.

John Taylor, an economist at Stanford University who is the author of an influential policy-setting rule of thumb called the “Taylor rule,” says his formula calls for the Fed to set interest rates at 5% right now. Because the Fed is unlikely to lift rates so dramatically in one year, he said officials instead ought to raise rates to 3% by December and signal more increases after that unless inflation comes down.

“This is not the only time in history that they’ve been behind, but they are strikingly behind,” said Mr. Taylor. “They need to catch up and do it in a systematic and understandable way.”

The Fed’s success will depend on several factors outside its control. Those include whether global energy supplies recover from the shock of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reducing energy prices; whether sidelined U.S. workers rejoin the labor force, easing the labor shortage and wage pressures; whether Chinese plants reopen in the face of more Covid-19 lockdowns, clearing supply bottlenecks; and whether Covid itself recedes for good in the U.S., ending related pandemic-related economic disruptions.

The Fed’s job will be easier if these supply constraints ease. If they don’t, the central bank will need to push rates higher to squeeze demand, with a risk of more damage to the economy.",finance,1650312356.0

personalfinance,Can I buy a condo this summer?,"I have been passively planning to buy a condo for the last 6 months. I am making around $70,000 right now (soon to be 75k) so I thought it was a good time to become a homeowner since I can save a lot with my higher salary now. The only thing is between paying off credit card debt and moving and starting over, all my savings is going towards an emergency fund and sinking funds. 

With interest rates going up and the cost of housing staying pretty stable in my area I wanted to know if I could get a condo in a short time frame. I would need to rely on down payment assistance programs. I could probably get $4-5,000  dollars saved by the time my leases up in August and I just wanted to know if that would be feasible for me to buy a property around $200,000.  My housing counselor says realistically I would need around $20,000 (for a 250k property) by closing. Has anyone had down payment assistance pay in the range I need: 10 to $15000?

For reference, I'd like to buy in Illinois.

Eta: Sorry I wasn't clear about the CC debt. I have no more CC debt! Half I paid aggressively down and I paid off the rest with a small personal loan. Interest is 7% and I plan to pay it off early. Its only 100 bucks a month. I've talked to a loan counselor and they know my debts. They believe I'd get approved for 250k.

personalfinance,My plan after learning from this community.,"So after a month of researching, asking questions, and learning from other threads in this community. This is the plan that I've come up with. Would love to hear your comments or even ways that I can improve. And this is not what I recommend everyone else do but if you were in my position a month ago where you had no idea what to do with your money that was sitting in your account then maybe this can act as a guideline. Best of luck.

Background: I am 24 y/o (in a week) and make 120k as a SDE. I live at home and bring in about $7500 a month after taxes. My main goal is to save up for a downpayment on a home (I still need to learn and research if FHA would be my best option). But here is how I'm budgeting and saving/investing my money.

Maxing out my 401k - I choose a Vanguard Target Date 2065 fund through Fidelity and my employer. And although I want to retire much earlier than 2065 I learned that choosing a later target date will help me achieve that because the risk is less the closer you get to the target date.

Maxing out my Roth IRA -  I choose M1 and I'm 100% VT. I'm aware that VTI &amp; VXUS may yield more long-term gains. But I really just want to set it and forget it and that's what I do with VT. Plus I have some bias towards the international market and think it will do good in the future. But yeah pretty simple $500 a month towards VT.

House Fund - I-Bonds. This is the area I spent the most time on. So my initial plan was to use Ally and it's .5% apy for my house fund. But then I read up on I-Bonds and realized this was my best option. I won't need the money for a while and I-Bonds protect against inflation and give me a solid interest rate. So a majority of my house fund (10k a year I buy 1k a month) will be in I-Bonds until I begin house looking. Then to make sure I don't lose interest I will need to find the best way to do that (would love recommendations on that). The rest of my house fund will be inside the Ally HYSA.

Emergency Fund - Ally HYSA. This is pretty simple I just contribute a part of my monthly income into Ally to act as my emergency fund. This Ally HYSA also holds the rest of my house fund after I've maxed out my I-Bonds for the year.

Monthly Expenses - I just opened a Chase Sapphire Preferred Card that comes with 80k points if I spend 4k in 3 months. This ""credit card"" is really acting as a debit card for me. All my purchases that don't fall into the above categories will be on this card but will be paid off almost immediately through my checking account. I will leave some debt because I learned that can go a long way in building your credit score (currently 750). But this Chase card is great because I've had a credit card that I wasn't getting any benefits with and this new card will give me rewards that will pay for some of my future travels.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is my plan for the foreseeable future I appreciate everyone in this community I really learned a lot and hopefully I can continue to learn. Thanks again.",finance,1650319727.0

&amp;#x200B;

With the uncertainty that was beginning the last couple months, I have been allocating more of my money away from individual/growth stocks and over to ETF/dividend or 'safer stocks' as I see them (I know that definition can vary wildly).

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I have been investing more into Canadian Financial stocks through a BMO High Dividend ETF. I have run some Tangible Book Value multipliers on RBC/TD/BMO etc to get an idea of how undervalued they might or might not be. I have heard for years that the Canadian financial sector is one of the best ones to invest in (could be anecdotal, but I'm also Canadian so super convenient for me when I invest on WealthSimple). I am more in the BMO ETF for the dividends as opposed to the growth.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Are their any metrics to look out for which will signal a financial institution may be due for either a draw down, or a full blown collapse? I'm not looking to hop in and out to time the market. Looking for indicators I should keep an eye on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had thought with higher interest rates, and the Canadian housing market still high, this would create a huge bump in a bank's revenues and profits. The reason I am a bit nervous is I had multiple people at my Easter gathering mentioned something I didn't understand about Canadian banks in particular having worse liquidity than in 2007, suggesting if a recession does hit, it will hit the financial sector harder than a) other Canadian Sectors or b) Worse than 2008. Are there any rule of thumb metrics to watch/judge a banks health? I have been learning about certain methods to try and find intrinsic value in financial stocks as opposed to growth stocks, and would like to learn what is important to look out for. Still new to investing in general.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: What are some metrics I should watch when investing in Canadian Banks that do a better job of showing the business' health than just FCF, Revenue and Share Price/Tangible Book Value?",finance,1650320937.0
personalfinance,How soon can I close/change HELOC?,"Hello,

Couple of months ago I applied for HELOC from two different banks. Bank A was super quick to process my loan and Bank B was too slow. Once Bank A finished loan processing, they have me 10 days to make a decision to either accept the loan or withdraw my application. Bank B didn't even complete my appraisal by that time. So I ended up accepting Bank A and opened HELOC with them. This was about 2 weeks ago.

Now Bank B said they finished their process and they are offering a HELOC for the same amount ($150,000) at significantly lower interest rate (lower by 0.6%). All the other terms are more or less the same between both the banks. The lower interest rate is very tempting as I might end up saving a lot over a few years.

Bank A is will charge me $1,800 in closing costs for early closing but I think I might recover that amount with lower interest rates from Bank B. 

I was planning to close Bank A HELOC and open HELOC with Bank B. Is there any disadvantage to that other than Bank A's $1800 closing costs? Is it ok to close Bank A'a HELOC within one month of opening?

I apologize for the really long post. TLDR at the end.

So I'm a single 25F in a HCOL area. I can potentially earn 150,000 per year if I work full/over time hours at my new job. I have been staying at my parents house instead of moving out so I can save money. However, I have been doing this since I was 21 years old and commuted while going to college so in essence I haven't really lived on my own yet. I have no debt since I paid off my car that parents got me when I was 18 (took on the payments after getting a stable job), and also my student debt (took advantage of the 0% interest during the pandemic). The only debt I have is my TV (1.9k) with monthly payments with 0% interest. 760 credit score.

Housing has been going up and up and I was only able to save up 70k cash and half is to my investments (401k and Roth IRA maxed out). I have been looking at homes and adjusted and originally wanted to buy a house/lot but with the current market I may be only able to afford a condo/townhome. I can apply for FHA alone but when I was looking at my area of interest (I have to stay for seniority purposes for my union job) the cheapest new home I can buy is $785,000 for a 2bd 2bath +Den undetached townhome. With interest rates at 5% now I don't think I can afford it unless I rent out the other bed. I'm afraid to buy an older home due to unexpected repair costs.

All in all, I keep getting depressed because I want to move out but I don't know if I can afford it. I don't know if I can be as independent as one would think. I also work a non-benefitted position so I don't have benefits yet and only paying healthcare out of pocket ($8,000 deductible). My new work environment is still new to me so overall I think I'm not stable with my job yet (although I'm liking it so far). In regards to FHA, I'm an RN for 4 years, 3+ same employer, but in a new unit/environment for +2 months. in the past two years my income has been at least 100k/yr.

Staying in my home has been detrimental to my mental health. I have sought help but my insurance is not great with mental health. I still have a curfew. I try to mitigate it by exercise but sometimes it's not enough. I also want to be independent as possible. 

So my question is, should I bite the bullet and move out and rent, or stay until the housing market crashes? LOL 

My options are:

\-stay longer at home  (-$400 per month/contributing to pet costs/groceries/mental health) and save a lot of money, wait until I have a benefitted position at my new job (better insurance).

\-move out to an apartment (-$1500-2000/month) but still have some $$ left to save; my boyfriend can move in with me and be under his insurance as a domestic partner.

\-buy a townhome with FHA loan by myself, rent out the other bedroom (+$1k/month), BF can live with me and be under his insurance, before homes hit an average of $1M and I can't afford anymore??

TLDR: I can potentially make 150k per year however still new and no benefits. With $70k saved up, do I take advantage of FHA loan to buy a townhome/rent out the other bed to help with mortgage? Or stay at home and pay with my mental health &amp; wait for the market to crash so I can swoop in and buy a house? OR move out on my own and rent but be mentally freed?

Bitcoin,"How will BTC adoption impact the current capitalistic, credit-saturated growth model ?","WHEN bitcoin becomes a major form of monetary value recognised by businesses and governments, how will technological progress continue at its current pace? 

At the moment, a vast number of risky startups and individuals are able to get considerable loans with relatively cheap interest rates from banks thanks to 1) the banks’ ability to lend out more than their actual holdings (i.e: fractional reserves) and 2) the safety net which is the Government and which will print more money in the event of national financial distress. But on a Bitcoin Standard, banks will not be able to lend out more Bitcoin/Satoshis than are present on their accounts, and governments will not have the ability to bail anyone out by printing more bitcoin.  

**Banks, VCs and even individuals investing in publicly traded companies will therefore have to** **massively** **reevaluate their risk/reward models and this in turn will have large consequences for the pace of growth of businesses and ultimately technology**. In part it is thanks to our current credit-intense and fiat based systems that we have seen the rapid rise of a number of companies which have produced some truly extraordinary technology (SpaceX, Facebook, Google, Apple, etc...). Yet on a bitcoin based system, I do not see how this can continue. 

Would love to hear this community’s take on this. 

Side-note: When I say “Banks” I am not referencing our current-day institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, BOA, HSBC, BNP, Citi, Goldman, Credit Suisse, and so on. Unless they start taking bitcoin seriously and aggressively stacking sats soon, I do not think they will survive the paradigm shift that is going to take place during the next couple decades.

My mortgage company doesn't work with that. I looked into other loans. I can get personal loan with no collateral from my bank for the closing costs with no issues (given one of my student loans was from them and it's been paid off). The amount I would spend to pay back will be the same amount I currently spend for a storage unit. Said storage unit will no longer be needed after getting a house.

My question is how badly will getting personal loan at the last second to help with closing costs damage our FHA mortgage approval? Does changing mortgage companies affect how much you're pre-approved for when using the FHA loan. For instance if you're pre-approved for 300K FHA loan can it decrease to 200K when you change mortgage companies? 

I'm asking all of this because I don't want our credit scores to go down when these companies keep checking.

We can very easily afford to continue putting the $1700 towards their loans, as interest is obviously still accruing.

Do we risk them automatically coming out of deferment if we restart payments, even if they were deferred because they are in school?

When I log in to my account on H&amp;R Block's website or use H&amp;R Block's ""check your tax refund"" tool, it says that nothing is found for my information.

personalfinance,I am the employee of a temp agency. I have some concerns about my tax information as displayed in Quickbooks. Help/advice appreciated,"Last month, I was hired by a temp agency. After finally gaining access to my pay stubs online through Quickbooks last weekend, I noticed some issues. 

* My federal taxes withheld were $0.00 for my first 3 checks (I am paid weekly with 1 week of lead time)
* My social security and state taxes, however, were withheld at approximately the right rates.
* My filing status was set to Single/Married Filing Separately instead of Married Filing Jointly. I was able to get them to change the federal status, but not the state. They told me to ""give it a few days and \[they\] will confirm.""
* My SS# was wrong. The displayed social was XXX-XX-1112, with only the last 4 digits showing. My social does not end in 1112. When confronted about this, the agency said they ""apologize for using a dummy Social Security number,"" and that they ""had to put in a dummy number because it took so long to get \[my\] hiring papers back and \[they\] had to get \[me\] paid,"". (And then they corrected it.) \*\*
* My birth date is wrong. I'm not sure if this is necessarily an issue, but it was definitely odd to me that the date that is set (Jan 01 2011) makes me look like an 11-year old. I asked them to correct it and they told me they would **not** due to some anti-discrimination policy. (My gender is also missing, so that sorta tracks?)

When I first asked about my federal tax withholdings, they told me they ""had nothing to do with that at all"" and that I'm ""the first person to ever tell \[them that they'd\] had a problem"". Then they told me to ""Google it or look online"". 

Am I being paranoid? I work in Accounts Payable at my current assignment, and I'm not very familiar with small business payroll practices. 

I asked both of my parents about it, and they were upset that my income wasn't being reported to the right social. Now after they've changed it, will that retroactively fix it on those stubs?

My partner is concerned about being charged with tax fraud, and thinks I should report the agency to the IRS.

Can somebody with experience provide some context or perspective? I'm hearing a lot of conflicting opinions (from laypeople) that range from ""No big deal"" to ""felony tax fraud.""

Definitely willing to provide more information if anyone has questions. 

Thanks for reading!

personalfinance,Married filing Jointly. Is MFJ too good to be true?,"The deed is already done. I waited until the last minute obviously. I got married in September 2020, and filed MFS for that year - being ignorant in retrospect if this is legitimate. 

Doing my 2021 taxes this evening, I was stricken by the difference in filing MFJ. This is all through TurboTax, but with MFS as my filing status it showed me getting a whopping $44 Federal Refund, and owing one state $600 (Missouri) and a $150 refund from another state (Oklahoma). My wife is a cancer patient at the moment and she has not worked since June 2020. I do not believe that she filed a 2020 tax return. I know she didn't for 2021. 

So long story short: Wife has no AGI for 2021. Waiting on a disability hearing this July. When I changed my filing status to MFJ with her permission the refund jumped up to $2900. I did some heavy googling and every thing says that the tax brackets are a lot lower if you file MFJ - which makes sense. I was just shocked at the jump in my refund. So my question is, is this normal? It almost seems to good to be true, but I could really use almost $3000 right now to get bills caught up and stock the house full of food. 

Bonus question: If this is all above board, would it be worth it to amend to MFJ for 2020? Granted we were only married for those three months and she did work the first half of the year so we would definitely need her W-2 of course.

Thank you for taking the time to read. I did some searching around the sub but couldn't find anything that specifically asked or answered this question. If there is something please accept my apologies. I'm new to being married so when it comes to taxes, I'm a little ignorant. We'll see if they accept my returns in the morning.

cardano,Decentralization is at the heart of Cardano,"For the IOG team, the high decentralization of the Cardano protocol is both a top priority and a technological challenge that they are enthusiastically exploring. Decentralization is a key feature that brings disruption to current financial and social services. Without insistence on basic principles and innovation, the decentralized revolution makes no sense. In the article, we will show you why we think so.

### TLDR:

* The very same reasons that led to the loss of trust in current centralized services or authorities prevent us from trusting blockchain with a poor decentralization.
* Private or poorly decentralized blockchains leave a huge space for minorities to control the majority. Cardano will be an independent intermediary that will always prefer the voice of the majority. 
* People should see the use of Cardano as a direct investment in an infrastructure that is owned by the users themselves. It is an investment in the protection of the basic principles of decentralization and thus the rights and freedom of users.
* Nothing could be better than an infrastructure that is taken care of by all users who have skin in the game. This only applies to decentralized infrastructure. In the case of centralized services, the minority benefits, but the majority has skin in the game. 

### What blockchains we don’t need

The parameters of different blockchain projects vary. Imagine a blockchain named X, which is maintained by 20 super-fast nodes owned by a single entity. These 20 nodes are responsible for the production of blocks in the network and no one else has permission to join. The X network has high scalability and does not need second layers. All operations, including DeFi services, are very user-friendly. 

How secure is blockchain X? Let’s say it can be similar to that of conventional centralized services. Protected assets will be safe until someone manages to break the protection of the nodes or until the owner abuses his position. We believe you could find similar blockchain projects on your own.

Do you think a government could adopt blockchain X and build its financial infrastructure on top of it? Could a new global bank be built on blockchain X? Could a company use this blockchain for its services?

Decentralized networks bring disruption mainly due to changes at the trust level. There is a close relationship between the characteristics of technology and the potential for trust enhancement at the social level. The world faces problems that are directly linked to the loss of trust. People are losing trust in banks, companies, institutions, authorities, and even governments. Decentralization can help solve these problems. However, if the blockchain is not decentralized enough, it loses the potential to solve these problems.

How can you trust the government that it can’t tamper with the data on the blockchain if the government can make a deal with the owner of the blockchain? The inability to make such an agreement is what changes the rules of the game at the trust level.

We don’t need blockchain X if we need to trust a single entity that holds direct control over key nodes in the network. The owner of network X is a single point of failure. The risk of failure is very high. The very same reasons that led to the loss of trust in current centralized services or authorities prevent us from trusting blockchain X.

We don’t necessarily need to get rid of all authorities and centralized services. At the same time, we don’t need another third party. In fact, we need to increase the mutual trust between us and our counterparts, whoever they may be. At this level, technology can help to improve relationships. We need to increase the credibility of the current authorities and services. Alternatively, we can create alternative decentralized services.

A blockchain network without a high degree of decentralization does not bring any qualitative change. There is no significant difference between blockchain X and a company server. Decentralization is about the distribution of decision-making power. Decentralization is about cutting out the middlemen and putting more trust directly into the technology. Decentralization needs to be defended and its growth needs to be pursued. Individuals cannot have a strong position in the network. If they gain it, all important characteristics are lost.

Imagine if a global company decided to use blockchain X and issue its own shares on it. The company and all shareholders would have to trust the owner of blockchain X. What if a government decided to issue a national currency on this blockchain? Should the government and all citizens trust a single person or a company? Absolutely not. The liability would be too high for one entity that could become an easy target. A decentralized network will not leave an attacker an easy target. The risk is thus ideally distributed among all network owners. If there is no easy target, the risk of abuse of power is significantly lower.

Blockchains without a high degree of decentralization are just toys that take advantage of the scalability problems of current projects. They bet on user experience and marketing. It is possible to quickly deliver attractive services and it works. However, this is just a misuse of hype and an attempt to take over the business from the current established companies or authorities. A DeFi service without decentralization is just another financial service competing with existing banks. In the long run, however, these projects will lose their meaning of existence. Technological progress and innovation will allow Cardano and a few other networks to improve scalability and maintain high decentralization. It is more than likely that adoption will reflect the quality of decentralization. 

The current problems are related to the abuse of power and the ease of attacking a centralized entity. If we can decentralize control over infrastructure, we can solve many problems hopefully forever.

### Why do we need public blockchain networks?

Imagine a bank running blockchain X. In that case, it’s essentially a private blockchain. The bank can increase fees, censor transactions, restrict access to services, prevent the spending of assets, change contract terms, or even stop the service. In addition, the bank gets all the fees for the services provided. If one party can arbitrarily change the rules without the consent of the other party, sooner or later it will do so. The unequal status of the participants is to blame. It doesn’t matter that a bank may have millions of customers. The management of a bank that has a minority position may make decisions that harm the majority.

Only decentralization can solve the problem of the unequal status of participants. Let’s go through all the points individually.

In a decentralized network, the bank cannot decide to increase service fees. Fees are set at the Cardano protocol level. Only the team is able to implement a change at the protocol level and will only do so if a majority of the network participants agree to it. Cardano distributes decision-making power among all ADA coin holders. Thus, all stakeholders could vote on the change. It is hard to imagine a minority being able to push through a change that would be disadvantageous to the majority.

Is it possible that a bank could own such a large number of ADA coins that it would push the change through? Theoretically possible, but unlikely in practice. Moreover, the network collects the fees, not the bank. The network would pay higher rewards to all stakeholders. If the network became expensive for users to use, they might go to a competitor. Competitive pressure among blockchain networks will not allow users to make irrational decisions. It is therefore in the interest of all users, including the bank, to keep fees low.

Pool operators operate a Cardano node and can influence the selection of transactions within a block that they can create. It is technically possible to censor transactions based on, for example, blockchain addresses. However, one pool operator cannot influence the behavior of another pool operator. The public network prevents transaction censorship by allowing each interested party to operate its own pool. Pools select transactions for the block and follow protocol rules. A pool violating the rules would be considered dishonest by the community. Stakers would stop supporting such a pool and delegate ADA coins to another honest pool.

A decentralized bank can influence its own smart contracts, but it cannot influence the behavior of other services running on the decentralized infrastructure. People who understand the point of decentralization are unlikely to trust a bank that censors transactions. Thus, the bank is incentivized to honor the rules of the Cardano infrastructure. Moreover, in an open-source world, it is relatively easy to create a competing service that will suit the majority.

From the bank’s point of view, trying to prevent access to a service is very similar to censoring transactions. Anyone is free to choose to use the Cardano network and does not need the permission of a third party or provide KYC information to do so. Anyone who installs a Cardano wallet can start using the network. Users expect all services to honor the principles of decentralization and anyone going against the rules will be considered an untrusted entity. 

There may be relevant cases where it makes sense to restrict service. For example, on the basis of age or nationality. With the increasing integration of blockchain services with the physical world, it is conceivable that DeFi will make use of real user identities. This will make it possible to leverage the legal system. For a DeFi service to make a loan that accepts US real estate as collateral, it only makes sense for it to operate where the US legal system can reach. However, this access restriction is tied to the nature of the service and is understandable.

A decentralized infrastructure can ensure that users are always able to spend their coins and tokens. Furthermore, the terms of a contract, such as a loan, cannot be changed by either party. Anyone who has coins or tokens in their own wallet can spend them at any time and no third party can prevent this. If the coins are locked in a smart contract, the terms of possession and release will be clearly defined. It is difficult if not impossible to stop the global network maintained by thousands of people around the world. All transactions will be settled and deployed smart contracts will be executed as expected. Even entities with very powerful positions can do nothing about it.

We can imagine a hybrid bank whose officer locally assesses the risks associated with a real estate loan where the real estate serves as collateral for the loan. It is possible to create a digital contract and tokenize the property. With each individual repayment, the new owner of the property can receive a portion of the token. Once they have paid off the last installment, they get the whole token. Local authorities can monitor the repayment process in a completely transparent way. The bank could not change the terms of the contract. Each installment would be completely transparent and neither party could cheat.

A decentralized infrastructure can ensure transparency and prevent fraud attempts. A borrower cannot claim to have sent a repayment without the transaction being traceable in the blockchain. Similarly, a lender cannot claim that an installment has not arrived if the lender has sent it. Note that Cardano can provide trust between two parties who do not trust each other. Moreover, the blockchain ensures that both parties are on equal footing and the bank is no better off. It is very easy to audit transactions and contracts on the blockchain. It will be easy for the legal system to judge whose side the truth is on.

The principle difference between blockchain X and Cardano is the level of decentralization. Blockchain X leaves a huge space for minorities to control the majority. Cardano brings the opposite. Cardano will be an independent intermediary that will always prefer the voice of the majority. The challenge for the next decades will be to bring this abstract concept to concrete cases.

We are at a stage where centralized institutions have to deal with the possibilities of decentralized technologies. The initial resistance and mistrust are overcome. New laws and regulations are now being defined to allow closer integration of decentralized technologies with financial and social systems.

The emergence of decentralized banks today need not be doubted. The question is when we will see them in practice. There will be a lot of competition between banks, but also between those who want to compete with traditional institutions. The incentive to succeed will be strong.

The original mission of blockchain technology, i.e. to bank the unbanked, but also to unbank the banked, will be realized. Both groups, today’s banked, who are not satisfied with traditional services, but also the unbanked, people from the developing world who do not have access to banking services, will switch to decentralized services. Both groups are happy to do this because it will be advantageous for them in many ways.

### Will blockchain adoption be driven by the quality of decentralization?

Will the quality of decentralization of individual networks really be what determines adoption? This is a complex question. Currently, we can observe that blockchain X can very easily compete with more decentralized blockchain networks because it is more user-friendly. People may prefer user comfort over the quality of decentralization. This is a perfectly understandable behavior and completely in line with how we use technology today. Speed, price, and quality of service are more valued than a difficult-to-understand feature like decentralization.

Let’s show this with a practical example. You hold $1000 in your digital wallet and want to send it abroad. Would you rather use a centralized service that delivers the transaction in 1 second and you pay $0.01, or a decentralized service that delivers the transaction in 10 minutes for $3?

Assuming the use was similarly simple, most people on the planet would choose the faster and cheaper option. Decentralization is not free and there will always be a price to pay. It seems that a centralized service will always be preferred.

Technological advances can increase the quality and at the same time reduce the cost of decentralized services. Running a centralized service will also never be free, so costs may be similar over time. The fundamental difference is that in the case of a centralized service, the service owner gets all the fees. The owner can keep most of the profit for itself and only put a part into innovation. The owner can raise the fees at any time if he is too greedy and confident in his strong market position. In addition, he may start to abuse his position and misuse users’ data. He can censor transactions at the request of the authorities or provide better services only to selected customers. A centralized service will always be prone to abuse of power.

In the case of a decentralized network like Cardano, the whole ecosystem can benefit from collected fees, including the users themselves. People should see the use of a decentralized service as a direct investment in an infrastructure that is owned by the users themselves. Moreover, in an infrastructure that will continue to evolve according to the wishes of the majority. It is an investment in the protection of the basic principles of decentralization and thus the rights and freedom of users.

Changing the perception of the differences between centralized and decentralized infrastructure is very important. However, it is only possible if the quality of service is similar. Users must not feel that they have to pay too much for decentralization.

Centralized services can work well until they are new, competition is high and the world is stable. Once any service gains dominance, it is unhealthy for the ecosystem as a whole and the service can degrade. If there is any instability at the government level, authorities may demand restrictions at the level of financial or social services. The banking system does not innovate because innovation is expensive and because a small group of people thinks the status quo is sustainable forever. Over time, disruptive technology will always emerge to change the existing order. A decentralized ecosystem that is economically and socially motivated to innovate may be much more easily sustainable in the long term and resilient to external pressures. Users’ rights, wealth, and freedom will be better protected.

People will only use and thus essentially subsidize the existence of decentralized infrastructure if they understand the importance and have access to useful services. Furthermore, they must be confident that they can collectively change the infrastructure according to the wishes of the majority. In other words, they can sustain a high level of decentralization in the long term. Decentralization is like democracy, if people don’t care about it and stop demanding it, they may lose it. People need to understand that caring about the quality of technology is similar to caring about democracy. If the current institutions, banks, authorities, and governments start using decentralized technology, and this is quite likely, technology will be one of the guardians of freedom, rights, fairness, transparency, and democracy.

People are not used to worrying about the quality of service at the level of technology. We are used to using a service and will only leave it if it no longer suits us, or if significantly better competition comes along. It’s similar to choosing a political party. The community should spread awareness and explain to people the importance of decentralization.

Decisive power in all current public blockchain networks is distributed based on the ownership of an expensive resource. For PoW networks it is electricity, for PoS networks like Cardano, it is ADA coins. The difficulty of controlling a significant share of the resource prevents individuals from gaining dominance.

In the future, ADA coins may not be the only expensive resource needed to gain decision-making power. As such, the system must prevent decision-making power from being bought with money or the accumulation in the hands of a few. This is a very difficult task, as the world naturally tends towards centralization. Maintaining a high degree of decentralization will thus be a never-ending process. Even those who do not own ADA coins or find it economically unviable to acquire and operate an ASIC miner should be able to gain their share of power. In theory, the primary decision-makers should be the users of the network, not those who can buy an expensive resource with money.

A different economic model and a different distribution of power are what distinguish a centralized system from a decentralized one. The base layer of the new system must be decentralized. Only above this layer can more centralized systems emerge. This is happening today and second layers are being built, which will always be less secure and decentralized, but cheaper and faster. However, people must always be able to rely on the decentralization of the first layer.

The underlying monetary policy of ADA coins will always be controlled by the Cardano network. Similarly, the first layer of the Cardano ecosystem will control the issuance of tokens and the deployment of smart contracts. The second layer will deliver the necessary speed and cheaper transactions. Only fees paid at the first layer can keep all public networks secure and decentralized in the long term. Second layers must not siphon off all revenues from service fees. If the need for the most decentralized and secure layer disappears and people stop paying for its services, we will go back to centralization.

If you encounter an ecosystem that has no or very low fees, you are likely to find a problem with the quality of decentralization. If the ecosystem has no revenue, it cannot have expenses. No one has an economic incentive to provide quality services to the network and behave fairly. It is not economically possible to drive an entity that behaves dishonestly out of the system.

Sooner or later it will become clear that only a decentralized infrastructure can solve the problems we face today. While centralized blockchain X may be popular for a long time, it will likely fail in the long run. The reason for failure will be the greed of the owner, who will prefer his own profit at the expense of costly innovation or delivering the improvements that users want. It is easier to attack centralized networks and break their protection. There may be hacks that will be difficult to prevent in the future unless resources are spent on increased protection or major infrastructure improvements. 

Nothing could be better than an infrastructure that is taken care of by all users who have skin in the game. This only applies to decentralized infrastructure. In the case of centralized services, the minority benefits, but the majority has skin in the game. If some unfortunate event happens, usually only the majority will suffer.

Cardano is owned by literally everyone who holds ADA coins. All of these people may be users of the network at the same time and care about protecting ADA coins because it represents their property. Cardano can tokenize stocks and other assets. All companies that take advantage of tokenization will care about the quality protection of all tokenized assets. They will want to have some of the decision-making power and therefore will need to acquire ADA coins. Banks that will use smart contracts for their new decentralized services will want the same. One day, states will have an interest in holding part of the decision-making power. Everyone will have a vested interest in keeping the ecosystem decentralized. Once we reach this stage, we can declare that decentralization has succeeded. However, it will be a very long journey.

### Conclusion

Decentralization really matters. Do not underestimate its importance in the long term. Decentralization will allow us to redefine very fundamental things such as freedom, the right to privacy, the right to equality, ensuring transparent processes, weakening the possibilities of corruption, etc. Decentralization, i.e. the distribution of power, is what can change the rules of the game and fix trust issues. Many people still don’t understand the importance of technology that we can rely on 100% when it comes to trust. We use trust every day in many of our financial and social interactions. Often we are not even aware of the abuse, or we think that if it doesn’t bother the majority, it must not bother us either. Trust operates primarily on a social level but can be significantly enhanced by technology. It is up to us how and where we use Cardano’s infrastructure.

personalfinance,"Buying a home next year- questions about mortgages, down payments, and more","Hi all,

My partner and I are planning on starting the home buying process sometime early next year, so we're trying to get all our ducks in a row. I have a few questions that make the standard down payment/affordability guidelines and advice a bit confusing, so I'm hoping to get some clarification.

1. I've seen 25-28% of income as a maximum mortgage payment, but does this include mortgage/house insurance and property tax? Does it also include the monthly savings for home maintenance or does that make up the rest of the \~30% max to spend on housing total? Is it gross or net income?
2. My state offers a first time home buyer program that we will likely be eligible for. They offer conventional loans for as little as $1000 down with a separate 10 year loan up to $17,000 for the down payment and closing costs at the same interest rate as the mortgage(at this point it's between 5-6%, will likely rise in the coming months from my understanding). We will have around $20,000 saved by the time we begin looking at houses, which I thought would be an appropriate amount for 5-10% down plus closing. Does it make sense to take out the extra 10 year loan for the down payment/closing costs and save or invest the money we have currently have?
3. How much home can we *really* afford? Rising interest rates have sort of thrown my frame of reference out of whack- we've been thinking max $250,000, min $175,000 (which gets a fairly decent 1-2 bedroom home where we live), but is this really the case? Our gross income is around 100k/year. We currently pay $1200/mo to rent and that's been very affordable, we don't have any other debt or major expenses at the moment.
4. If we wanted to avoid paying mortgage insurance, is it a smart idea to withdraw contributions from our Roth IRAs for the down payment? There's an extra $10,000 or so that we could withdraw if need be. We are both quite young and have 401ks through work as well, so it wouldn't be a huge loss.
5. We also will most likely need to purchase a new vehicle within 5 years or so- both of our current cars are nearing 20 years and 200k miles, we are currently putting money aside for a down payment when we need it. Would it be smart to calculate a potential car payment in the budget? Or is that putting the cart before the horse?
6. Any potential issues with getting a mortgage with around only 2-3 years of credit history?
7. Our plan is to get married before looking at mortgage lenders and houses, but is there any reason or benefit to put marriage off until sometime during or after buying the home?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.",finance,1650381463.0

This is not the performance I was expecting. I did initially buy in when rates were poised to go down which, as I understood at the time, meant Bond Funds would lose value. So some decline was expected (hence reinvesting dividends).

Ripple,My analysis of the current state of the lawsuit and three pending crucial issues,"##Summary: 
*Ripple is looking to be in a decent position for a favorable ruling pending 3 outstanding issues. I do not believe we will see a settlement. Lawsuit finished after summary judgment with a rough estimate of August to September.*

The SEC vs Ripple case is actually in an incredibly important status now, more important than any other time we have seen. This is due to 3 outstanding issues that have yet to be settled by the judges:

* The Hinman emails
* The Metz report (edit: has just been settled, Judge Netburn denied Ripple's motion to strike)
* The Estabrook notes (edit: has just been settled, Judge Netburn denied Ripple's motion to compel)

These 3 issues have prompted the SEC to take extraordinary measures in federal court, implementing a strategy that is almost guaranteed to annoy the judges presiding over this case. This demonstrates, in my perspective, the SEC's desperation at this stage of the lawsuit and how damaging each of these issues could potentially be. I want to examine these 3 issues in further detail.

###The Hinman Emails
The SEC vs Ripple case as a whole will be studied in law textbooks years from now, but even more importantly, the issue of The Hinman Emails will be examined in-depth. The SEC strategy here has been not only desperate, but chaotic.

In a reckless attempt to keep crypto as a whole in a realm of regulatory uncertainty, the SEC, in federal court, stated clearly and plainly that the Hinman speech was personal opinion and nothing more, despite widespread interpretation of it being official guidance (there are plenty of video recordings of SEC officials pointing to the speech as official guidance).

When this stance backfired in a massive way and Judge Netburn ruled that since the speech was personal opinion, the Deliberative Process Privilege (DPP) did not protect the emails, the SEC submitted one of the most desperate motions in this case to date: their motion for reconsideration.

This motion in itself attempted to obfuscate their actual position on the Hinman speech, but to add enough language saying it was somehow ""official guidance"" but also ""not official guidance"", *but* official enough to grant DPP to protect the emails from discovery. Fortunately, the judge rebuked this attempt, but we are still now pending further actions from the SEC to prevent these emails being handed over at all costs: a declaration that they will renew a different argument to protect these emails, and indications they will file an objection up to Judge Torres.

Jeremy Hogan has overall been a great reviewer of this case, but I have one issue: he missed the mark on his comments regarding Judge Netburn's rebuttal of the SEC's motion for reconsideration, citing that her allowance for the SEC to redact certain parts of the emails relating to their actual deliberations might suffice and settle the issue for the SEC.

The problem is this: there was *never* any chance for that to be the case. Why? Their motion for reconsideration was so reckless from a litigation strategy standpoint and will potentially harm even the outcome for them in *this* case (and potentially future cases), that it would be complete insanity for them to file it if their true issue was just the ability to redact some smaller parts of the emails.

Their motion for reconsideration clearly demonstrated that their concern is the content of the emails as a whole. And now that they've made an official filing in federal court stating that the speech was actually somehow related to SEC policy on cryptocurrencies, those emails will be even *more* damaging even if their original position in the case was that it was all personal opinion.

**My prediction for the emails:** The SEC will lose in their attempt to renew DPP or Attorney-Client Privilege arguments even if the judge initially allows them to proceed with filing them. They will use this attempt to further delay the case, as they don't believe they will win on this renewal. After losing the renewal attempt, they will then proceed to file an objection up to Judge Torres. She will stand by Judge Netburn's ruling. If forced to hand over the emails, the SEC will attempt to redact portions of the emails that are relevant and it will be up to Judge Netburn to perform a review of their proposed redactions and to stop them from getting away with those attempts to redact things beyond what she stated they could.

###The Metz Report
Expert reports are an incredibly important part of the litigation process in cases like this. So what's happening here? The SEC is attempting to circumvent the court schedule for expert report filings due to how weak Dr. Metz's original report was. Essentially, they used Dr. Metz's original report to try to demonstrate how Ripple was a primary and key driver of XRP price, and Ripple's own report exposed how weak this original report from the SEC was.

Trying to file a new report at this point in the case is another clear sign of desperation for the SEC. They waited until after all depositions (so they had extra information) and until after all other expert reports were filed so they could specifically tailor a new response to try to bolster their argument. 

It might seem that this issue is less important than the Hinman emails, but I would say it's fairly close in importance. These types of reports are used for the basis of defining facts and evidence, particularly in Summary Judgment, and if the judges allow this new report (falsely described as a ""supplemental report""), it will bolster the SEC's position and also draw out the case even further as Ripple would have to be allowed to also create a new report, which they were not anticipating having to do.

The SEC is rightfully worried about Ripple's original reports and undermining of their own expert, so this is a desperate attempt to fix their shortcomings. Their position heading into Summary Judgment will be much weaker if they are not allowed to officially file and keep this report.

**My prediction for the Metz report:** I believe Ripple has a strong position in their move to strike this supplemental report. Established case law is pretty clear on what constitutes (and more importantly, what does *not* constitute) a supplemental report. That case law states that supplemental reports are not opportunities for a party to attempt gamesmanship in bolstering original reports. Given that, I foresee Judge Netburn granting Ripple's motion to strike the supplemental Metz report. I would be surprised if she allows the report to stay, but if she does, I do predict she will order the SEC to cover Ripple's costs in having to create a new report.

*Edit: Judge Netburn has just released her ruling denying Ripple's motion to strike. This is unfortunate given that it seems case law is fairly clear here regarding what constitutes supplemental reports. She even goes so far to criticize the SEC for improper conduct, but has stopped short of striking the motion. She has however, as I predicted given this scenario, ordered the SEC to cover Ripple's cost. Further evidence that I do not believe we will see a settlement*

###The Estabrook Notes
These notes, in my opinion, may actually be one of the most important set of notes to date in this case. It comes as no surprise to me that the SEC attempted to hide these notes until the very last minute and is desperately trying to keep them from Ripple. 

Why are these notes potentially devastating for the SEC? Think about how it will look if the SEC has been stating Ripple knowingly sold unregistered securities, yet notes written by the SEC document a meeting between the CEO of Ripple and an SEC commissioner and contain language that clearly shows active discussion around the future of XRP. If the notes contained language that Garlinghouse was told that XRP is definitely a security, the SEC would have no problem handing over those notes. No, these notes contain something else. Assurances that the SEC will work with Ripple, that they understand the need for innovation, etc. They will show that the SEC was giving Ripple one message, while then later backtracking and bringing this lawsuit out of nowhere.

**My predictions for the Estabrook Notes:** Judge Netburn has *already* ruled that notes between the SEC and 3rd parties are not protected by the DPP. Garlinghouse has also clearly stated there is no Attorney-Client privilege to apply here on his side. As such, there is no reason for these notes to be withheld. Given her previous rulings, I would be surprised if Judge Netburn lets the SEC keep these notes hidden. I believe she will rule that they must be handed over.

*Edit: Judge Netburn has just denied Ripple's motion to compel. Her thoughts here: ""The SEC’s fact-gathering from third parties is not an inherently privileged activity, but having reviewed Estabrook’s notes, I find that they could reveal to Garlinghouse the SEC’s internal thought processes during his meeting with Commissioner Roisman. The privilege applies."" Essentially, Estabrook took the notes in such a way that obfuscates the actual meeting minutes, adding his thoughts and other items that would provide, in Judge Netburn's opinion, too much information to Ripple. Unfortunate, and I do believe the SEC is getting away here. Still, this furthers my opinion that we will not see a settlement with this case.*

##Final Thoughts
Despite how damaging these 3 issues are, I believe the SEC has almost lost all sense of reason in this case. With how things are going, if we were going to see a settlement we would have seen one by now. The SEC is frenzied in their desire to kill Ripple's business. We already know that Ripple will not settle if XRP is not granted regulatory clarity and deemed a non-security. This is unacceptable to the SEC. I truly believe they are willing to now compromise even their potential future enforcement capability to have a minuscule chance of this case ending in their favor.

We will *possibly* only see a settlement if all 3 of these issues discussed here are resolved and final in Ripple's favor. Still, I think that's unlikely. If the SEC succeeds in any one of these, we will see this case 100% end in Summary Judgment.

On the contrary, Ripple is in a decent position. I think if any *one* of these issues is resolved in Ripple's favor, it could provide the ammunition necessary to cement a win in Summary Judgment. That's how critical each of these issues are and why we're seeing them being fought over hard at this stage of the lawsuit.

I am cautiously optimistic. These next two weeks will be pivotal as we hopefully get rulings on the Metz report and the Estabrook notes. Those two rulings will really set the stage for how Ripple will fair heading into the final battle.",cryptocurrency,1650386453.0

solar,What to do?,"Massachusetts resident.

I kind of went into this a bit blind and it's starting to show. So it all started with a coworker telling me all about his solar panels covering his entire electric bill and getting his 26% check from the federal government. Now if there's one thing I love, it's getting some of my taxes back. I even bought a Plug-in hybrid a few months back for the same reason, $7500 federal tax credit.

So anyway, I was put in contact with SunPower and all was going well. I own and live in a three-family property, and one side of the roof is very ideal, south-facing and all of that. It will generate way, way more than I use. The plan is to give my parents the excess credits as they live nearby and are with the same electric company (confirmed the electric company allows this). $28k before incentives, 16x 435 W panels. I don't have $28k laying around, so I was going to finance it.

So all was going well until... the financing team came back and said they don't finance rental properties, even if they're owner-occupied. Bummer.

So it's kind of dead in the water at this point. I know I could seek financing elsewhere, but it seems like everyone shuts down the conversation when they find out it's a multifamily. I'm also starting to wonder if the tax incentive doesn't apply to multifamilies or something. What's up with multifamilies being treated differently? It's residential. I live here too!

personalfinance,Continue with debt settlement program or take out a debt settlement loan?,"Hi, I’ve been participating in a debt settlement program since August 2021. 

The program estimated 48 months to settle my various debts totaling $20,000. I have paid my monthly $337 payment on time for the entire program so far. 

Also important to note, we are expecting our first child to be due this August, so our finances have been extremely cautious since finding out I’m pregnant. 

We are really working to get out of the debt hole and build my credit back so that we can afford a house or at least an apartment with more space. I make $80,000 annually and am comfortably able to pay my monthly settlement payment along with rent, bills, depositing to savings account, etc. 

Basically I feel like I’m finally financially stable for the first time in my life. It’s a great feeling, BUT my credit score took an enormous hit to get to this point, as through a debt settlement program you ghost your creditors and my credit score is now an abysmal 510. And it will take forever to crawl back to the good side. 

In other words, everything we need to use credit for in our near future whether it be a car or a home will have to be in my SO‘s name.

Today I received a call from my debt settlement program offering a complete settlement loan. 

I’ve been preapproved because I have made all of my payments on time to the debt settlement company. This loan would pay off all of my current balances and settlements in full and would apparently give my credit an enormous jump as well as showing the only loan I have as their loan (which would be in good standing instead of uber delinquent like my credit cards currently in settlement). 

They claim it should work out to be the same payment amount I’ve been making monthly and it will auto draw and I won’t notice a difference. 

However, this loan has fixed interest at 24% which is a lot. Right now I pay no interest in my debt settlement program. The estimate is that doing the loan can add 2 years to the time it takes to settle everything and pay off the settlement loan. They said there is no penalty to paying everything off early, but right now any extra money we have is going to saving for the baby so I don’t foresee throwing a bunch of money at paying off this loan early.

I can’t help but feel like the loan is a bad option. The thought of boosting my credit is so appealing right now but adding more interest at such a high interest rate sounds like moving in the opposite direction from financial freedom. I can’t help but feel like they are being predatory and going for vulnerable people such as myself who desperately wish for a better credit score. 

Has anyone gone through debt settlement and elected to do the loan or elected to refuse? Is it actually a good option and something I should consider to get in good credit standing with a baby on the horizon and purchases like a house or car in my near future dreams?",finance,1650389646.0

personalfinance,Seeking advice on my situation. Loan? - Reverse Mortgage? Other Options?,"I need some financial opinions on how to approach this situation.

Currently  I am a retired military vet doing the stay at home dad gig while my  wife is finishing her degree.  We have enough money saved up for her  last year of tuition to pay it out right if we chose to.  We also opted  to utilize federal stafford loans (both sub/subsidized).  If we choose  sit on the education loans for a little bit (post graduation), it will  leave us about $20,000 of liquid cash. Or we can just pay off the higher  interest rated subsidized loans first). The determination of when we  pay her education loans off is a decision yet TBD. The education loans  are a non-issue but are being used as context to provide a financial  overview. If we pay off all the loans there is no liquid cash.

I  do have enough income via retirement to pay for all my bills and  groceries. So living expenses are covered. We bring in just enough to  not worry about that.

I also own a  rental property in Florida that I rent out to snowbirds. It pays off as  my tenants have been staying every winter for 10 years - they pay my  mortgage and a little extra. This income is reliable (contracts). But, I  wont see that money for 6 months so I do not have that money now.

I  have some unexpected expenses with my rental property around $5,000  with jacked up HOA fees for the year and appliance that need to be  replaced before next winter.

My  wife and I are big savers - I focus on retirement accounts and she  focuses on liquid savings. I (regrettably?) maxed out my ROTH IRA in  2020/2021 (made just enough W2 income in 2021 to contribute) and it  seems to be biting me in my ass now with these unexpected bills.

My wife and I are planning to move cross country post graduation (about a $10,000 move).

I  am looking for advice on if it is wise to take out my AMEX loan (4.98%)  interest. I ran all the scenarios and cost of taking out various  amounts (up to $20,000) @ 12/24/36 month payment terms. If I opt to take  it out $20,000 @ 4.98% for 36 months it will be  a $600 per month  payment with a end cost of $1,600 interest if I pay the minimum.

Paying $1,600 for some breathing room doesn't bother me especially since we will be both working again in about 1.5 years .

My major questions are as follows:

1. With  the feds most likely jacking up there minimum interest on loans to  combat inflation what would I expect my APR to be in a year if I wait?
2. Is this AMEX loan wise at this point in time given my circumstances?
3. If  I need $5,000 now and take out an AMEX loan tomorrow - will AMEX allow  me to take another loan in a year if necessary (I am afraid since I am  not working although my credit score is a 835 they may not have such a  good deal down the road).

personalfinance,Best rules to abide by when buying live-in house?,"I also posted this in a separate subreddit, but this is probably the most ideal sub to ask!

What are the general rules to abide by when buying a home (to live in, not an investment — though we don’t want to be house-poor). Additionally, what do you feel is the necessary amount to save or have left over after paying your mortgage bill, utilities and other needs?

Background: My wife and I are in the Nashville (and adjacent suburb) markets and are currently searching for a live-in home to purchase. We make good money (little over $100K net after taxes) and have zero debt other than student loans (around $35K total between us both). We have no car payments yet, or any other outstanding monthly debt.

We want to buy a home really badly and believe we’re in a nice spot financially, but rising interest rates and low inventory are brutal right now.

I’ve talked to a (fairly bad) financial adviser and close friends — in addition to scouring Google — to find a concrete answer to best practices, and there’s just nothing other than “Do what you can afford.” As someone who is just so cautious, I don’t know how to approach that! I understand that it’s case by case, but I’m really unsure about the “safe” amount to have left over per month.

Please feel free to ask probing questions about my income or expenses. That doesn’t bother me.",finance,1650392421.0
personalfinance,Taking out a loan for a wedding?,"Hi there. My fiancé and I plan to get married next year. Her mom has pledged $50k to help us out. However, she mentioned it might be smart to take out a loan for the cost of the wedding (we are shooting to stay in budget) and then pay off the loan. Is there any downside to this besides paying interest? Given we will have the cash from her mom I assume a benefit would be we can build credit, but not sure of any other benefits to this approach. 

Thanks for any advice.

EDIT: to clarify, MIL has decided to gift us $50k. This is her decision and comes with no strings attached. Was just curious if there were any ancillary benefits to taking a loan for $50k and paying off over time. 

Based on most on topic responses, it seems an unsecured loan for $50k would be at a very high interest rate and so any potential ancillary benefit from the loan would get eaten away by interest payments. 

Appreciate all the input so far.

I have two bank accounts, X and Y. I asked the IRS to withdraw funds from Y to pay for taxes via EFT. I started a transfer of funds from X to Y to pay for federal taxes last week, but because of a mixup over the phone with my bank, the transfer from X to Y didn't happen last week, and will only happen 2 days from now. The IRS tried to withdraw funds from Y the _very next day_ after the filing deadline (I filed using TurboTax, not sure if it was TT who decided this or IRS). That EFT from Y to IRS is going to fail, because account Y does not have enough funds before the transfer from X.

From what I understand, I now owe the IRS 2.5% more, which is 2% because of a ""dishonored check"", and 0.5% for late payment fees. Should I wait until I get a letter from the IRS? Should I just do the math myself (`newtax = oldtax * 1.025`) and send the IRS a money order 2 days from now? Or perhaps pay them via their website, before I get a letter from them?

I tried calling TurboTax, they told me to call the IRS. The IRS just replies they can't take calls right now due to high call volume. Sigh.

Apple is fine, Amazon.... is iffy but I still overall in general like them for their diversification.

Netflix is clearly dead. Projecting to lose 2 million new subscribers next quarter, going lower from 200K this quarter. If the war in Ukraine continues to go on, those numbers will be even worse.

Google is fine.



But overall, the ""Own FAANG and prosper"" at least for THIS YEAR is just not going to be it folks. Sorry to say. The play this year is in commodities, energy, and utilities as well as safety stocks (REIT's, Healthcare, snacks and supermarkets etc) which all scream a bear market historically.

FAANG stocks do well when the market is not handicapped by the FED, inflation and a looming (but doubtful) recession that has Biden and his team terrified of the midterms. Make no mistake, Powell will do what looks ""appropriate"" politically in order to appease his boss.

personalfinance,Is a 5-7 Year ARM loan a no-brainer in my situation?,"Current situation: My fiance and I live in a HCOL city. Together, we take home \~$170,000 a year. Our current price of a 1-bedroom rental is $2,200. We’ve talked about renting a 2-bedroom around the $3,000 mark, but decided to keep it cheaper and forget having extra space.

In September, we went under contract to purchase a new build 3-bedroom townhome for $563,000. ($520,000 base price + $43,000 in upgrades). At the time, our estimated mortgage payment with 5% down on a 30-year fixed mortgage was $2,800. At the time, interest rates were 2.9%.

Due to supply chain issues, the closing date has been pushed out from April to a moving target around August/September. The builder won’t commit to a closing date yet, so we can’t lock in. a mortgage rate. With current interest rates, we are anticipating our housing payment cost to hover around $3,600. Obviously, this could go up or down over the next few months as we wait. This is higher than we preferred, although doable. After going through our budget, I believe we’d have roughly $3,200 leftover monthly with a $3,600 payment. This is after all bills, groceries, gas, student loan payments, utilities, etc. Seems manageable, although not preferred. 

However, this entire time we were anticipating only living in this home for around 3 years, selling, and moving out of the city into the suburbs to start raising a family. Obviously, anything can happen with the housing market, but the base price of our same townhome layout has already raised $50,000 since September.

In this situation, is going with a 5 or 7-year ARM loan a no-brainer? Currently the interest rates would be about 1% lower, which would be huge for a monthly payment.

financialindependence,"Cut Your Retirement Spending Now, Says Creator of the 4% Rule","I thought FIRE would be interested in this WSJ article today: [Cut Your Retirement Spending Now, Says Creator of the 4% Rule](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cut-your-retirement-spending-now-says-creator-of-the-4-rule-11650327097).  I’ve never heard of this guy, and I’m surprised the report didn’t reference the Trinity study.  His stock and bond percents are also shocking too at a total of 30% of his total portfolio.  Thoughts FIRE?

“For decades, retirees have relied on the 4% rule to determine how much was safe to spend in retirement. Now, the rule’s inventor says current market conditions may require an even more conservative approach.

The combination of 8.5% inflation with high stock and bond market valuations makes it difficult to forecast whether the standard playbook will work for recent retirees, said retired financial planner Bill Bengen, who first devised the 4% rule in 1994. 

He now recommends retirees take a less aggressive approach to drawing down their nest eggs, at least until we determine whether the current surge in prices that has been particularly stressful to those on fixed incomes is a long-term trend or a short-term blip.

The longstanding method calls for spending 4% in the first year of retirement, and then adjusting that amount annually to keep pace with inflation. Such an approach would have protected retirees from running out of money in every 30-year period since 1926, even when economic conditions were at their worst, Mr. Bengen said. 

“The problem is that there’s no precedent for today’s conditions,” he said. His concern echoes a recent report from Morningstar Inc. , which recommends a 3.3% initial withdrawal rate for those retiring today who want spending to keep pace with inflation over three decades and a high degree of certainty their money will last.


Retired financial planner Bill Bengen, who first devised the 4% rule in 1994.
Mr. Bengen’s latest revision doesn’t necessarily mean going below 4%, he said. That is because the 4% rule hasn’t really been the 4% rule for some time. His original research was based on a portfolio with 55% in U.S. large-cap stocks and 45% in intermediate-term treasury bonds.

Since 2006, he has revised that portfolio to add international stocks and midsize, small-cap and microcap U.S. stocks as well as Treasury bills. That raised returns and supported a safe withdrawal rate he increased to 4.7%.

Given the challenges of making forecasts right now, Mr. Bengen suggests cutting spending, if possible. New retirees with highly diversified portfolios that would normally support a 4.7% withdrawal rate might want to start around 4.4%, he said.

Mr. Bengen, who retired in 2013, said he plans to do just that. 

“I won’t eat in restaurants as much. I live a fairly simple life. I don’t take a lot of trips and I’m happy with a deck of cards and three other bridge players.”

In historic 30-year periods, Mr. Bengen said, a 4.7% initial withdrawal rate was a safe starting point. Those who retired in the best of times, when stocks were cheap and interest rates and inflation were low, could have taken out as much as 13% to start without running out of money, he said, adding that “we haven’t seen anything like that since the 1930s.” Since 1926, Mr. Bengen’s research indicates that a 7% withdrawal rate has been successful on average.


When inflation is high, withdrawals made under the 4% rule “grow by leaps and bounds,” said Mr. Bengen. That means the portfolio must earn a higher return to prevent depletion, Mr. Bengen said.

Another threat is high stock valuations. Stocks are currently trading at roughly 36 times corporate earnings over the past decade, according to Nobel laureate Robert Shiller’s CAPE, or cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings, ratio.
“That is double the historic average,” said Mr. Bengen. “While low interest rates justify higher stock valuations to some extent, I think the market is expensive.”

In past periods of very high stock valuations, he added, “it usually took a bear market to adjust prices back down to the mean.” As a result, he said, “we could be facing an extended period of subnormal returns.”

When bear markets occur, retirees have to take money out of a portfolio that is shrinking. That is especially dangerous early in retirement because most retirees need their savings to last years, Mr. Bengen said.

In contrast, if a bear market comes along after 20 years in retirement, “your portfolio has likely already increased in value, giving you a larger cushion,” Mr. Bengen said. Plus, the retiree may not need the money to last as long.

How have you adjusted your retirement portfolio to address rising inflation? Why, or why not? Join the conversation below.
While high short-term inflation poses some danger, the risks multiply when high inflation sticks around for longer, as was the case in the 1970s. 

“We have had bursts of high inflation in the past, including after World War II, that have lasted only a year or two,” said Mr. Bengen. While these bouts of high inflation reduced the safe withdrawal rate, “it wasn’t by a dramatic amount,” he said.

Mr. Bengen’s research indicates that the worst 30-year period in which to retire started on Oct. 1, 1968. It wasn’t 1968 itself that was the problem, he said, but the years following, “which were awful.” Inflation was high for much of the 1970s and stocks encountered back-to-back bear markets that started around 1969 and 1973. From the end of 1965 to the end of 1981, the annualized return on the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat without dividends.

Aside from cutting spending, retirees can try to protect their nest eggs by reducing their exposure to stocks and bonds, he said. While Mr. Bengen said he would normally invest about 55% of his savings in stocks and 45% in bonds, his concerns about both markets have left him with closer to 20% in stocks and 10% in bonds, with the rest in cash.

 “I’m uncomfortable holding that much in cash,” he said. But with the Federal Reserve announcing its intention to aggressively raise interest rates, “it’s not a great time to invest in financial assets,” said Mr. Bengen, who said he plans to buy stocks if the market drops significantly and stocks become cheap. 

Mr. Bengen warns that attempts to time the market can backfire on investors. “It’s hard to buy stocks during bear markets. There’s an emotional obstacle to doing that since investors fear it can lead to more losses.”

“I retired nine years ago, so I’m probably safe,” he said. “But I’m not comfortable because I am still early enough in retirement that the combination of threats we face could be damaging.”",finance,1650408709.0
personalfinance,Looking for the cheapest option to borrow up to $25k.,"Hey everyone,

Throwaway account due to some friends knowing my regular account. Long story short I’m looking for the cheapest way to borrow $25k. 

The issues I’m dealing with currently are I tried pulling equity out of my home (have $98k), but I’m not able too because of my fiancés credit score being too low. My credit score is 748 but I’m not able to add another co signed as no one else is on the title other than her, and my income isn’t enough to pull that much out due to dti. 

I’ve looked into personal loans and my dad is willing to co-sign, but my payments will be more than what I’m wanting them to be. I’ve looked at various banks and can’t find local credit unions under 11%, and haven’t ever used something like Sachs or SoFi. I’ve never looked into 0% balance transfer cards either and I don’t know if I’d qualify for $25k in credit. 

My issues that came up were almost all unexpected. I’m in a masters program and prior to starting classes, I wasn’t told that I couldn’t use federal loans for the certificate program i was enrolled in the last 2 semesters. Now that I’m fully enrolled, I’m able to get federal loans but that doesn’t do me good when I have a $10k bill to pay for for the last 2 semesters before i can enroll in future classes. We have a $2.3k medical bill, and then some small debt consolidation I’d like to clear as well. And lastly, a small house project were wanting to complete. 

TL;DR: looking for the cheapest way to borrow $25k. Co-signing with my dad and can’t borrow against the house due to fiancés credit score.",finance,1650409761.0

We're currently renting in a HCOL area for $3000/mo. We've been wanting to buy a house in the same area, and we're finally able to do so. We found a house we like for $700K and we're in a position to purchase, however the rates have been rising very steadily and currently sitting at 5.5% (probably will be even higher next week). The monthly payment at this rate does stretch our budget, but we're able to make it.

Another thing is, two years ago, this house's value was ~$500K.

The unstable interest rates and housing prices got us worried and we're getting cold feet. We're afraid of the housing prices coming back down and scared that the equity we will build may dissipate. 

In your opinion, should we pull the trigger and purchase this house? (We're planning to live there for at least 5 years)",finance,1650410885.0

We are preparing to offer up to $420,000 with 10% down. We are pre-approved for more but don’t want to spend over that. Local Lender quoted 5.5% interest today but I plan to shop around.

Income: 

* Pre-tax annually: $140,000
* Monthly take-home: $7750
* Other income: $30-50,000 annually from a recently created trust (This has paid out the last two years and should continue but we aren’t counting on it)

Liquid savings: $68,000 (Down payment/closing costs will come from this. Want to have around $18k left over for E-fund)

Debt:

* $103,000 in student loans, average 6% interest. Once the forbearance ends this will be something like $600-800 monthly. Yes this sucks but we didn’t want to put a house on hold. 
* No credit card debt. No car payment but we’ll likely have to buy a second car at some point.

No kids but we are planning on it soon, so I am *trying* to factor in childcare costs (daycare costs still make me want to throw up)

personalfinance,Unsure what to do about current housing situation... looking for opinions. I put myself in a rough spot by buying a project house at the top of my budget and it's effecting my sanity.,"Hello all,

(Numbers below rounded for sake of anonymity)

\- I bought a house in California in the SF Bay Area last year for $850k.

\- I've been in the house now for 6 months.

\- Prior to purchasing, I had 30% saved up for a down payment. I put 20%  down and reserved the remaining 10% for projects (and for peace of  mind).

\- I got a 2.94% loan and borrowed $700k.

\- My monthly payments (PITI) plus utilities total $4,000/mo.

\- My gross income is $11,000/mo.

\- After deductions (taxes, retirement, etc.) and housing expenses, I'm left over with $3,500/mo for everything else.

\- I'm a generally frugal guy, so this kind of budget isn't highly limiting to my lifestyle.

\- Assume I've got $1500/mo left over for whatever else.

\-(My voluntary investing-IRA, 401k, taxable--rate is now $0/mo. In the  past, before buying the house, I'd invest $4k/mo easily.)  

So far it probably doesn't sound so bad. Not great because my housing  expense are 36%-40% of my income, but it could be worse.

Here's the kicker. The house is a total fixer upper. It needs an easy  $100k in renovations, likely more. And this is assuming I do much of the work DIY. If contracted, the expense would be ridiculously more  expensive considering labor in this area.

To make matters worse, the house is basically on a cliff (which on the  plus side gives it an amazing panoramic view), but on the down side  makes it extremely costly/difficult to work on. It's basically a 3-story house and there is not really good ground to establish yourself to work on it via ladder. Most serious work would need scaffolding for general access.

Here's where this gets tricky. The house needs exterior paint, all new  windows (existing are all damaged) and trim (expectable amount of rot),  some various other exterior repairs. The house also has all of its  original features to the mid 1980s, so its super dated. The house also  has an awkward layout, lot placement, parking situation, and backyard.  It has expansive decking (probably 1,000 sq ft) and unfortunately it  wasn't constructed particularly well--it gets by, but for most people,  it's not a confidence inspiring deck.

The saving grace is the views are amazing. It's why I bought the house.

So here's the bit where I just feel stuck and without a good plan going forward. I've  tried calling contractors to help me out, and they all basically tell me the same thing--""you can't afford me"" (at least that's what I hear).  $30k for windows. $8k to paint the building. $40k-100k to fix/replace  the deck. $2k to do landscape/tree care. $1k to keep the weeds down for fire abatement.  I recently called a general contractor to try to help give me an idea for a price to handle some of these projects on the interior because I wanted him to put a nail in the coffin--that for the reality check so to convince me that I'm way more underwater than I think I am.

So back to the budget and stuff. The house is really more of a $1m house after repairs that I ""got a deal on"" for $850k because of the existing condition. On the other hand, I have to consider what others are buying for $850k-$1m in the area. In this market, as most of you should be aware, people are spending $800k on some really questionable homes (for example, I did!); others are getting lucky with some respectable fixed up homes.

The difference in my case, is I bought what I think is an amazing once-in-a-lifetime kind of view. I'll never own one of the fancy designer/architect $1.5m-$2m Bay Area homes with impressive views, but I could own a modest $850k one!

So here's the grind on my sanity... Circling back to the numbers up top, I have a cashflow of $1,500 a month I can sink into renovations around this house. At the rate I am currently saving, I will never finish this house, lol, especially if I solely depend on contractors. If I do the work myself, I can get a lot done for pennies on the dollar, however, once I really start tearing this place apart, I'm putting myself in a really vulnerable position. With the house an active construction site, it would make  unloading/selling the home a challenge (That to imply potentially being stuck with the house). Plus, there is so much that needs work on the house, even if I fix or improve 20 things, there will still be another 20 things that would be major red flags to a picky buyer. That to say,  some buyers want turn-key homes, and if you reno a home 50%, it's almost as good as not reno'd because people will see all the remaining/incomplete work. For me to get it 100% reno'd, I'd need to  enlist the assistance of those contractors I can't afford...

So it's a total cluster. I feel like this is really too much for me to chew.

I've gotten an as-is offer for the house (off market) that would result in a net loss of $100k.

I could try and list the house on the open market, but I'm very skeptical this house will sell well as-is because of its current condition--I very well might have been the only person who put an offer on it. Plus, if I try to fix it up a little bit and stage it for sale, and go the full realtor route, we're talking paying expenses probably close to 10% of the value of the home (6% for realtor fees, 4% at least for cost of improvements, cleaning, staging, etc.), so that do-nothing ""as-is"" offer isn't that absurd in my opinion.

Alternatively, I can just not improve the house and live in it as-is (like I have been doing so far). It feels a bit bad to live in a high maintenance  house that's seen so much neglect over the years because it makes me really want to fix it up. But as I said, once you start fixing things  up, you're basically committed to finishing, and then I'd feel the sting of the money pit I'd open up.

I've got to balance so many things. My time, my money, my sanity, my social life, etc. My gut instinct is that this is really too much and that getting out of the house, even for an exorbitant loss is not a bad idea. All that said, I do know there are alternatives, but it doesn't even make a lot of sense to me for example to rent a room to me because 1. The rental income is not that significant compared to my  regular income, and 2. Renters don't want to live in a house that is getting torn apart for construction projects--plus from my perspective, they'd just be in the way!

Then, factoring in the current economic situation, interest rates, as most of you know, are really messing with things. I'd have to pay another $750 a month in interest if I were to have financed this home today--which is insane, I couldn't have done it! Plus, with people being extra strapped for cashflow, an expensive fixer upper project-house is likely not high up on the list for most people.

I was hoping to target the investor market. I've tried iBuyers and the such, but most say they aren't interested because there aren't enough comps due to the house being so unique. That said, a comp (square footage, lot size, etc.) DID just sell for $200k over asking, selling for over $1m. So to me, I feel  there should be a investor/buyer out there interested in taking on this project because I could imagine this house going for $1m for the right buyer if fixed up.

My alternative if I were to get out of the house would be to rent my parent's house down the street (it's where I was living before this). This would reduce my rent by $2k/mo, so from one perspective, if I took a $100k loss, it'd take me 4 years of renting for cheap to makeup that loss. From another perspective, it'd only take 3 years to recover because I'd be cutting the deadweight of the  irrecoverable expenses (of $22k/y of interest, and $11k/y in property taxes).  (In that comparison, rent paid to my family isn't necessarily dead weight because it goes to helping support the family)

From another perspective, inflation and demand are really messing with things. As much as interest rates seem bent on tanking this real-estate market, I could totally foresee price appreciation in the  short term.

So its all whack.

No matter what I do, keep it or sell it, I'm exposed to tons of either burden or loss.  Best case scenario, general price appreciation helps this place find another as-is buyer like me. Worst case scenario, the market tanks and  I'm negative equity PLUS saddled with all the burden of the home.   In my mind, I wouldn't mind getting out of this place and renting a shitty cheap condo, but which is really hard to reconcile because I'd have to be at that condo for a long ass time before it made dollars and cents  sense to sell a house for a loss...

From a final perspective, I think my gut is telling me to get out  because I value the freedom of not being saddled to the house. I like the flexibility of being able to move freely. Plus, I'm seriously  considering pursuing a long distance relationship and possibly leaving California all together.

The silver lining to it all, is even though there's a lot of things that need being improved at this house, and despite all its quirks, I can always go outside and enjoy those amazing top-of-the-world views.  Honestly, the short time I've been here has been magical. The sunrises/sunsets/storms/clouds/city lights/moonrises/rainbows I've had the luxury of soaking in have been so jawdroppingly amazing to me, I almost feel that experience was worth the price of admission alone. I bought the house because I've always dreamed of owning a house with an amazing  view. And now I can absolutely and definitively say I have achieved that life goal. Whether or not I want to fix up a neglected house is another story altogether, lol!

P.s. I've posted about my situation before because (in my opinion) there were issues with disclosures of the propery during the sale--I'm ignoring any legal opinions at the moment as I'm trying to look at the situation  from a different perspective right now. I don't want to sue anybody. Any money and effort spent fighting a silly legal battle would be better invested in the house.",finance,1650424578.0

deeplearning,A little thought about the unification of dynamic and static graphs,"This post is reproduced from Zhihu and translated using Deepl for all enthusiasts to communicate

I've been writing samples for the past few days, mainly referring to the Pytorch implementation, and inevitably encountered some problems caused by the differences between static and dynamic graphs again. In addition, MindSpore has recently made some progress on static graph syntax support, but the ease of use is not so obvious, which triggered the impulse to write this article. Since it is a random thought, there will be no structure, so I wrote it wherever I thought of it.

Supernatural dynamic graphs, obsolete static graphs

From the emergence of Pytorch to the present, the user-friendliness of dynamic graphs I believe no one will have any questions, freedom of writing, debugging convenience, code that is the formula of the cool. The toiling public who have been suffering from TensorFlow for a long time are looking forward to it, and the students who want to start deep learning with a low threshold are also looking forward to it. To some extent, the lowering of the AI threshold (and involution) is actually accompanied by the popularity of dynamic graph frameworks. I personally do not use many frameworks in depth, because the beginning of the AI years have been Keras, and then Pytorch open source has been using Pytorch. Later, I also had a shallow taste of the old version of Paddle, as well as MindSpore since 2020.

Pytorch has been eating up TensorFlow's share step by step, and then TF2.0 has shifted to eager mode across the board. And as dynamic graphs continue to gain popularity, the concept of dynamic and static graphs is in fact little known among most people engaged in AI (perhaps I'm just ignorant). Looking back at these several domestic frameworks, unfortunately, whether before or after the birth of Pytorch, most of them have taken the TF-like route, and then desperately trying to make up for it.

It's been 2202 now, and there are still people experimenting with static graphs?

In fact, we all vote with our feet, when I write a bit of wrong code, the C++ stack overflows; when I want to change a model, but also need to pay attention to the syntax restrictions; when I want to manipulate the gradient, but to go around to complete; when I want to write a brand new Layer, but have to care about how to write the code of control flow. Each of the above is a reason to stay away from static graphs. When I tried the old version of Paddle, this is how I was discouraged, even with the free V100 GPUs, I really can't carry this learning threshold. Later MindSpore encountered the same problems, even if the morphology has been optimized a lot.

Dynamic and static graphs, really need to be unified?

So MindSpore is playing the slogan of dynamic and static unification, and is practicing it physically. In the current environment of mainstream motion pictures, it is still worth a compliment to be able to motivate a group of people to use it. But we also face the dilemma of migrating after the experiment is completed with Pytorch.

Back to the topic, do dynamic and static graphs need to be unified? In terms of MindSpore's practice, it is to let the compiler gradually support the full Python syntax, and then translate it to computational graphs and send it down to device for computation. Pytorch has been criticized for being too flexible and then difficult to deploy, although there is now a good deployment path with ONNX as an intermediate IR. The common perception is probably that dynamic graphs are suitable for academia and static graphs are suitable for industry.

Dynamic and static unification from an AI full-scene perspective

The first thing to clarify is that the full scenario mentioned here is not the same thing as the one advertised by HW. the full scenario of AI must cover scientific research. Moreover, the development of the whole AI field is probably like a coin pusher, constantly throwing coins in, quantitative change triggers qualitative change, and then a milestone piece of work appears and drops a bunch with a clatter. And only after that, these milestone models will be enshrined by industry and deployed everywhere.

Obviously, the full scenario of AI is research + deployment, with the former being versatile and the latter being stable. That's why there are numerous inference engines, but not many make training frameworks. The success of Pytorch is then best explained by the fact that it responds to the needs of the people who use it the most, rather than focusing only on the almost stable and customized deployments in industry.

So following the trajectory of this AI field to see the role that deep learning frameworks should play, it probably looks like this:

Satisfy the need for a magic model for a large group of scientific people

Support or even derive a new milestone model

Support the export deployment and large-scale application of milestone models

Looking at the matter of dynamic and static unification again, the dynamic graph is unstoppable and the inevitable choice for the scientific research scenario. Static graphs are more suitable for exporting and deploying models generated by scientific research. The industry frameworks seem to be choosing to let one side gradually approach the other. I think the gap between the two is better to be bridged by something, rather to be forcibly eliminated. In other words, people are not very resistant to secondary code modifications when exporting models and deploying them, and a one-click export is good, but adding a conversion is not unacceptable. So training using Pytorch then exporting as ONNX for deployment is not a bad choice.

A few thoughts on MindSpore

Static graphs as defaults will not appeal to the research crowd.

Static graph syntax cannot and does not need to support the full range of Python syntax.

As a framework with almost optimal support for static graph syntax, it should actually encourage users to use dynamic graphs first until they need to deploy the model (80% of people don't), at which point the compiler should give enough guidance information to guide modifications to the model (the modifications here are non-destructive to the model).

In industrial training scenarios, using static graph to train (milestone models have enough impact, at this point the model is fixed and more stuffed with data).

Static graphs can be exported directly for deployment.

So a more reasonable approach should be, dynamic graphs as default, static graphs for deployment requirements, guidance provided for compiler errors, static graph training export. The biggest advantage of MindSpore is that it is compiled by way of AST parsing and this tool that can bridge the gap.

I found it to be an almost faultless process from the time I came across MindSpore. Later MindSpore changed the default mode to graph mode. Looking at the people using static graphs painfully, I thought, why bother?

Summary

Finally, a few more words. Few people can answer the question - why should I use MindSpore when I have Pytorch.

If the above approach is implemented, the reasons I could give would probably be something like:

Freedom of science: how free Pytorch is to write models, and how free it is to use me.

Seamless deployment: no need to convert for deployment, just convert to static graphs according to guidance.

Finally, in fact, quite want to spit a few more words. Still hope that no matter what deep learning framework is, it can be honest about the fact that it is a tool rather than core. respect AI science, respect AI researchers. That's all.",technology,1650438974.0

CryptoCurrency,"Blockchain Basics &amp; Consensus (summary of MIT lecture 2018 by Gary Gensler, lecture 4)","For this week, you had to read “A short guide to Consensus Protocols” on CoinDesk. 

This subject of this lecture is **“What makes a block on the blockchain valid”?** 

**China (2018) problem**

The blockchain relies on a good working internet; that internet prorocols are adhered and it’s not walled off and not corrupted. But what would happen if that’s not the case? For example, if you are in China (remember this lecture is from 2018!) and someone manages to capture a large part of the internet there? If they wall-off the internet there, what will happen?

What if a corrupt miner in China mines a new chain and other Chinese miners start to build upon that block?

This is an example of the Byzantine Generals Problem; you have to rely on actors and you don’t know if everyone of those is reliable and honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Keep the network honest (x2)**

In his email of 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto proposes two solutions to keep the majority of the network honest:

1) consensus protocol

2) native currency

&amp;#x200B;

**Consensus protocol**

The consensus protocol is proof-of-work (an idea of HashCash’s Adam Back in 1997 that was aimed against spam email, but was never widespread / implemented). POW requires a bunch of computational work using hash functions. The difficulty of finding whether a block is confirmed, was in a certain range of hashes. The difficulty is determined by leading zeroes. A leading zero is any 0 digit that comes before the first nonzero digit. In 2018, the blockchain requirement of Bitcoin was to find a nonce that crates a block-hash with 17 or 18 leading zeroes.   
 The actual hash difficulty is not about the leading zeros; it is about finding a hash less than the hash target set by the network. In Bitcoin, the SHA-256 hash algorithm generates a 64 digit hexadecimal hash value.  
 

It should be difficult to solve, but easy to validate. Finding the specific hash is difficult, but validating is just running 1 hash function.  
 

In this system, nonces are needed. Nonce = a number used once.   
 You need to try many random numbers to get the right number of leading zeroes.

The hash is based on the data. If you change a little piece of data, the hash will look completely different.

Back to the China question. If someone who has captured a large part of the internet in China starts to mine unvalid blocks, and others start to build on top of that, what will happen?   
 The consensus in Bitcoin is that the longest chain is the only valid chain. If someone in China who doesn’t have the majority of nodes starts mining, it probably won’t be the longest chain, thus rendering the new side chains invalid.   
 The other miners will probably get word of the fact that they are mining on top of bad blocks which are not supported by the majority of nodes, and will therefore stop putting their equipment and energy into this futile endeavour. 

There will be a coinbase transaction (coinbase transaction = the first transaction in a block. If a miner “wins” a block, a minder can create a coinbase transaction with which he or she will collect a mining reward).

The transactions will be useless, because they will not be on the main blockchain.

(My personal opinion: this is not a protection against 51% attacks! This is only a protection when bad actors have less than 51% of the network in hands).

What happens to the blocks outside of the main chain? 

1) The bad blocks become stale blocks. They are not being used, but they are still in the mempool (mempool = pool of unconfirmed yet validated transactions)

2) A whole new chain is created, like Bitcoin cash. And that hard fork also has also gotten a new native currency (Bcash).

&amp;#x200B;

**Native currency**

It takes about 10 minutes to mine a block of Bitcoin. The difficulty of the puzzle is adjusted based on the average solving time of the previous 2060 blocks. If there are less miners and the average time to solve the puzzle is 14 minutes, the puzzle becomes easier. If there are more miners and the average time to solve the puzzle is 6, the puzzle becomes harder.   
  Because of miners that get better equipment, in 2018 it was 7 trillion times more difficult to mine a block than in 2009. In the past, people mined with CPUs (2009-2010), GPUs or GPU rigs (201002013), and from 2013 to 2018 and beyond with ASICs. The latter ones have to compete against Modern Mining Factories, that are usually in countries where the cost of electricity is very low. The energy use is a problem; in 2018 those mining factories’ use of electricity was comparable to the use of electricity in countries like Ireland or Denmark!

Why would you buy expensive equipment to mine, if your chance of mining a coin is quite low (like 1 in 10 years?). A found solution is to join a mining pool. In this, a mining pool operator, who charges about 1-3% of the returns, facilitates the collaboration of many different actors. Unlike the inidivual miners in the pool, the pool operator has the use of all the miners and probably has 1 whole node or more to her use The mining pool operator can create a Merkle root, so that the computers of the individual actors don’t have to do many extra things. This system of mining pools smooths out economics for all mines that participate in it.   
 Why won’t all mining pools come together and start a kartel just like OPEC does in oil? This would form a potential 51% attack. It just hasn’t happened yet.  “Dr Doom” Nouriel Roubini thinks Bitcoin is centralized because of these mine pools, because you only have 20-30 mining pools. But nodes also do non-compensated work by validating many transactions beyond their own pool. This is the economics of freeriding in which non-pool-miners can profit from.

A native currency is an economic incentive system.   
 The monetary policies vary wildly, but usually it limits the supply of the currency (some Initial Coin Offerings don’t do this).   
 

BTC is created in the coinbase transaction of every block. The reward for mining a block was initially 50. In 2018 it was 12,5. Every 210.000 blocks, this reward will be halved.   
 In 2018 the inflation rate was about 4%. Because of the halvings, the inflation rate will become 2% to 1% to 0,5% and it caps around the year 2040. This monetary policy was put in place in 2018 and will be there forever to cap Bitcoin at 21 million BTC. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Networks**

This part didn’t go into great detail.

Characteristics of the Bitcoin network are:

\-Full nodes

\-Pruning nodes (less so for Bitcoin)

\-lightweight nodes (only using the headers, like Bitcoin wallets on your phone)  
 \-miners that perform POW and create blocks (do not need a full node, but pool operators probably have 1 or many)  
 \-mining pool operators

\-wallets (to store, view, send and receive transactions and create key pairs)

\-mempool (pool of oncofirmed, yet validated transactions)

&amp;#x200B;

**Alternatives to POW**

In the CoinDesk reading alternatives to POW were mentioned.

Proof of stake – coins are not mined, but the actor who has the biggest amount of staked coins has a bigger chance to become a validator of transactions (which they get rewards for)  
 Proof of activity – a combination of POW and POS. In mining, POW and their rewards are used. After the mining, it goes to a system of POS

\-Proof of burn – the bigger amount of coins you burn, the more chance you have to be permitted to mine the next block. Burn = send the coins to an address where they can’t be retrieved.  
 \-Proof of capacity – the bigger the hard drive, the more chance of mining. Software puts plots on your harddrive. The more plots you can store, the better your chances to find the next block

\-Proof of Elapsed time – made by Intel. There are no elaborate puzzles to solve, so the energy waste is far less. Who gets to mine the next block is like a lottery, however, this goes through a central authorization (TEE Trusted Executed Environment, of Intel) which defeats the purpose of decentralization.",cryptocurrency,1650445400.0

personalfinance,Unwise to make loan payments while interest rate is 0%?,"From this [article](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Paying_down_loans_versus_investing):

&gt;Here is the most likely order of priority for investments versus paying off loans; it does depend on the rates, so these examples are based on typical rates which may not be accurate at any specific time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Invest in 401(k) to get maximum employer match (rate may be over 100% in the first year)  
&gt;  
&gt;Pay down credit cards (rate 10-30+%)  
&gt;  
&gt;Pay down non-deductible auto or student loans, or other medium-rate loans (rate 5-8%)  
&gt;  
&gt;Invest in [Roth IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Roth_IRA), deductible IRA or decent 401(k) (rate 5% on Treasury bonds)  
&gt;  
&gt;Pay down deductible mortgage or student loans (rate 4% after tax)  
&gt;  
&gt;Invest in taxable account (rate 4% on municipal bonds)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Do not pay down subsidized loans as long as subsidy lasts (rate 0-3%)**

Before the pandemic, the combined interest rate on my federal student loans was around 4%. However, rates are currently still at 0% due to the pandemic... So, does this mean that I should be diverting my federal student loan budget elsewhere? (e.g. open up an HSA or Roth IRA)?

Note: Already have an emergency fund, already taking full advantage of my employer 401k match. No CC debt.

EDIT: 

So after reading several dissenting opinions (thanks to everybody who weighed in), I decided that I'm going to forego investing in I-bonds or a Roth IRA. I'll probably make a small contribution to my HSA, just to cover my bases a bit. But I'll mainly be focusing on paying down the principal on the loans as much as possible while interest rates are 0%.

My reason for not investing in I-bonds right now is because my loans will likely only be paused for another 4 months, and I-bonds can't be cashed until a year after purchase. Also,  if I were to purchase I-bonds for the sole purpose of using the returns to help pay my loans, I'd probably aim to cash them before 5 years. The penalty incurred would effectively reduce the return rate on the bonds. In other words, the amount by which I would be getting ahead would probably be somewhat negligible. 

My reason for not investing in a Roth IRA right now is because I get a pretty generous employer match on my 401k, so I can at least feel like I'm doing something for retirement.",finance,1650461710.0

energy,Politico Morning Energy on the Politics of the Social Cost of Carbon,"This was in their 4/20 newsletter. I disagree the social cost of carbon is wonky, though.



""The social cost of carbon was initially a wonky metric that  Barack Obama's agencies used to help guide policy with the economic  consequences of climate change in mind. But it has grown into a major  political focal point among Republicans set on derailing the Biden  administration’s climate agenda, POLITICO’s Alex Guillén reports.

The  metric — an estimate of the economic impact of adding carbon dioxide the  atmosphere — has become an increasingly crucial foundation for  President Joe Biden's climate actions. It guides climate considerations  for issues such as public transit grants, oil and gas lease sales and  energy efficiency regulations, and it offers an economic baseline that  the administration can use to defend its policies in court. And its  importance has grown after Democrats' Build Back Better bill stalled in  the Senate, which left regulations as a major avenue for pushing climate  action.

That  makes the tool a huge target for Republican attorneys general, who won a  court injunction early this year that temporarily blocked federal  agencies from using the metric — a decision that ground the government's  regulatory machine to a halt. Another court later reversed that  decision, but red states hope to take the fight to the Supreme Court.

How  to calculate the social cost of carbon has also become a deeply  political question: The Obama administration set it at $43 per ton of  carbon dioxide, but the Trump administration whittled it down to $1  before Biden raised it back to $51 per ton. With better understanding of  how climate change is affecting the world, some experts are calling for  a price closer to the $200 range, a number that would make it vastly  easier to justify efforts to throttle greenhouse gas emissions.

“The  reason that you have this sort of ping-ponging of the social cost of  carbon is that it's being utilized by the bureaucracy to achieve an  end,” said Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, which  supports fossil fuels and is critical of the social cost metric. “Each  administration has its own ideology about what they want to accomplish,  and the way that it was constructed, it's so subject to gaming that  you're witnessing the result.”""",energy,1650466311.0

I usually pay off about $300 towards credit card debt, and before this month I was paying off school. So around $2,200 towards my hard bills. I also give myself a biweekly allowance of $200 to spend, I go over this limit often as I'm still working on creating healthy spending habits. I'm not buying extravagant things, just eating out too much as my commute is 1.5 hours a day every day, and I'm a full time student on top of being a full time employee so its hard to make time to cook.

I have 4.3k in credit card debt between 4 credit cards, and one more school installment of $750. The credit card debt is from being sick with covid and having a significant delay in my employment, I lived off of my cards for a few months as PUA was over by the time I was affected.

I'm going on a family vacation soon, so I've spent around $300 towards that in the past couple weeks preparing, i'll end up spending around $500 in total. I have around $1200 total to my name, and get paid again next Friday, most of that will go towards my bills and living expenses, I anticipate to have around $300 leftover from that paycheck, so hopefully around $1100-$1300 leftover total.

I move out of my current lease soon, to a free apartment provided by my job. I'll be saving an extra $1200 a month between my rent and my gas, and I'll receive $800 in my security deposit back at the end of the month. But I have to buy furniture for my new place too, I'm not expecting to spend more than $1500 on this.

My accountant finalized my tax return, and I'm expected to receive $4.4k back from federal taxes, and owe around $50 to the state. 

My head is spinning because this is so amazing for me to be able to pay things off, or save, but I don't know what to do with it. I don't know if I should pay off all of my debt and have a clean slate, if I should split it up, some towards debt, some towards school, some towards savings and some towards my furniture. I just don't know what to do here. I'm excited and hopeful and grateful but I just don't know how to move. My boyfriend is suggesting I try not to think of it until my return is in my account and I have the money for sure, so I don't get ahead of myself, but I want to plan and prepare. Any advice?

personalfinance,How to Deal With a New Build House in a Divorce,"My wife and I (no kids) are getting a divorce and she will be moving to another city, so what to do with our new build house is kind of up to me.  I expect things to be very amicable, so I don’t think any gamesmanship is necessary.  We still have the utmost respect, trust, and love for one another and there was no foul play leading to the divorce.  We live in California but were married in Texas (community property).  Neither of us has any debt (except the house) and I make about $120K/year.

We bought the house in December for $560K, it’s probably worth about $590K today, and we owe about $530K on our VA loan.  Our mortgage/taxes/fees are $2900/month, so I can afford it, but it’s more than I’d be paying for rent if I left the house since I don’t need a 3/2 for just me.  I’m not sure if I want to stay in the house or not, but I definitely don’t want to walk away with essentially nothing after the stress of getting the house and moving in.

I’ve thought about a cash out re-fi like I see often recommended, but our interest rate was for 2.375 and now rates are double that, so that doesn’t seem like a great option (if it’s even possible based on how much we still owe).

I need cash on hand because I will be transitioning from the Air Force to the airlines in the next few years (end of 2024 latest or as early as early 2023).  Due to the frequency of furloughs in that industry (and the fact that the most junior pilots are the ones who get furloughed first), I want more like 12 months living expenses on hand.  After the divorce, I expect to have about $55k in savings with a desired goal of $75k.  I also want a good sized down payment for a new car in the next few years which is achievable with my current savings rate and balances.  Consequently, I don’t want to dig into my cash to buy her out.

I’m debating a career move some time in the next year that would involve me moving (and therefore selling), but I’m very uncertain if I will do this.  The alternative to this is that I stay in the house through the end of 2024 and then sell.

Co-ownership probably could work, but I feel like it would be cleaner long term to just have her out of the picture.  I am not opposed to this idea.

I am unsure of all the rules regarding retirement accounts. Can I take some extra money out of my IRA/401k to pay her equity given some of this money is going her way anyway?  This doesn’t strike me as a great idea, but if there’s a trapdoor I can use since I have to give her the 50% of the gains anyway, it seems like a possible option (if it’s legal).

My first thought was trying to come up with some sort of quasi-co-ownership where we can divorce but I essentially am obligated to pay her the fair share of equity she’d be owed whenever I do sell, without being under the gun to do something now.  I’m not sure if this is possible.

personalfinance,"Should I pay off our house, or..?","TL:DR; should 2 DINKS in SE US pay off our house (~$50k) with extra cash this year, or do something else? 


Husband and I, no kids, no debt, ~30s. Live in SE US. 

Recently got high paying but temporary employment. What should I do with the extra cash? For the sake of argument let's say ~$50k extra over the course of remainder of the year.


I'd like to pay off our house (purchased 2016, 15 year mortgage, 2.8% interest rate, have been paying extra up to now). If we paid it off now, we'd ""save"" about $10k of interest that would've been paid off the remainder of the loan.

He thinks there are better-yield savings we could invest in, which makes sense and I agree with, but I'm not sure what. Personally I just love the idea of paying off our house bc it sounds awesome.

Other info to note:
He contributes to his 401k
As a non-FT employee, I do not have as much in my 401k. I'm unsure what the balance is tbh, and currently am contributing $0 to retirement with my income (my current employer doesn't allow it). 

We typically have $10k + floating in our checking account. We don't really have any other savings. 

More stuff:
My mental health costs are high, and I originally accepted this job to fund a $25k-$30k treatment center stay that has since been put on hold due to my status improving a good bit. 


We also want to build a small addition to our house at some point which will likely cost $30-$40k ish.

personalfinance,Talk to financial advisor about HELOC to buy rental property? Other investments?,"Hi all. My wife and I were very fortunate to purchase a house a little over 3 years ago in a HCOL area of Southern California at a very low interest rate of 3%. Our housing expenses make up ~25% of our gross income. Since buying the house, the market has exploded and based on the value of the home, our equity now exceeds what we owe.

We’re young with no kids (yet) and feel like this could be an opportunity to leverage the large amount of equity that fell into our laps to set ourselves up for the long haul. I think it makes the most sense for us to take a home equity loan or a HELOC. I’ve done a lot of math to weigh out options like purchasing a multi-family home in a lower cost of living area, investing in the S&amp;P (where most of our money is), investing in a single family home nearby, etc. I just keep balking at the size of the pile.

personalfinance,Helping my mom crunch the numbers for retirement,"Trying to help my mom come up with options as she approaches semi-retirement. She can't fully retire yet because she hasn't saved enough, but her body can't handle her RN 12 hour shifts and she's about to hit her 3 year high with CSRS of 80k here in November (civil service retirement - it's a grandfathered federal retreiment plan she started in the 1970s.) She's emotionally and mentally exhausted and has a lot of anxiety about lack of future income so I'm trying to help her navigate retirement waters best she can.

Debts ---   

Mortgage: $118,500  4.25% 21 years left on the mortgage. Comes out to $1288 each month    

Truck: $7K    

RV Camper: $19k


Assets---    
House is worth $290k which puts equity at $172k    

Investments $150k    

Total Networth: $322k    



Her big retirement idea/plan: She's attracted to the idea of selling the house, paying off the truck and RV and doing full time RV living this December when she qualifies for retirement with CSRS. She's done a lot of research into this and has aligned herself with a variety of retired RV community groups that she already does multi day RV stints with at texas state parks. If she did this full time she would park somewhere for a few months at a time. She'd work remotely doing medical translation (bilingual) bringing in no more than ~$19,500 a year to meet social security income ceiling limits.

My big concern is that she could easily live another 25-30 years. All of our family on that side turns into tiny little abuelitas that live forever and need extensive care the last 5-10 years of their life. This doesn't seem like a great long term plan to me because even if the house appreciates at 2% a year (half the national average of house appreciation) then she could very easily be priced out of home ownership in a couple of decades.

stocks,"If ""be greedy when others are fearful"" is a valid philosophy, which beaten down stocks look good?","For example, one of my holdings, Roblox, has been getting pounded consistently and down 60% in 2022. Investors seem to be afraid of this stock

Despite that, revenue grew 102% year over year and it's clearly a hit with kids, who are playing, and spending, more and more.
This last quarter featured an 18% increase in experiences where the majority of users were 13 and older, an important statistic for a company that runs the risk of losing users as they get older.  With impressive growth metrics and a clear plan for keeping its users and expanding its offerings, Roblox could be a buy right now for investors looking to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the metaverse.

Now this is just one example, and obviously there is a big bearish sentiment, but when everybody goes one way, it sometimes pays to be a contrarian.

I currently rent a 2BR apartment for my son and I in Orlando, FL for $2100/month. I’d like to buy a house sometime in the next year or two and start gaining some equity, but I’m not sure if I should prioritize some of my debt first.

I am a travel nurse and am currently bringing home $2750/week. I currently have $13,000 in cash. I am not sure if I should pay for the car in cash or finance it and put that cash towards my student loans. Or, finance the car, leave the loans until they are out of forbearance, and just continue to build my savings?

personalfinance,Retirement milestones when your income goes up rapidly?,"It seems like the vsst majority of retirement advice out there uses milestones like ""you should have 2x your annual income saved for retirement by 35"". I get that works well for a lot of people since income tends to go up gradually, but it seems like a pretty worthless metric for me. I made about $30k/year from 24-30 so saving for retirement was hard but I at least always put in enough to get the full 401k match. Then starting at 30 my income did this:

30 = $42k

31 = $65k

32 = $150k

33 = $155k

34 = $240k

Needless to say, there's no way in hell I can have $240k saved up for retirement by the end of this year. I mean, shit, I'm now set to make more in a year than I did in my entire 20s.

I'm trying to catch up. Have $50k saved for retirement now, that should be about $70k EOY after maxing 401k (roth IRA already maxed). I also plan to save $30-50k this year towards a house downpayment. EF already has 5-6 months of expenses saved ($30k), got $30k of federal student loan debt that's paused.

My thinking is that since I live a very comfortable lifestyle on $50-60k/year (which includes $3k/month rent), I should use that as my income for retirement targets. I plan to (and better) have a house paid off by then and don't see myself ever having kids, so I think even $50k/year would be more than enough. Does that sound reasonable?

Sorry if I am posting in the wrong sub. I am in the process of applying for a home mortgage for a new house (yet to go under construction). I was given an estimated delivery time of FEB 2023.

Given that the interest rates are climbing rapidly, I am trying to decide whether it is a good time to lock interest rates right now!

 One lender I spoke to can do a 12 month lock at current rate + 0.375%, and if rates go down 60 day before closing then I will get the lower rate. The upfront fee for 12 month lock  is 1% of the loan amount (which is $310,000) and 50% of that fee will get refunded to me if I close with said lender. That lender advised me to lock since Feds are expected to raise interest rates multiple times this year. I was given two rates, one at 5.75% and a higher cash to close, the other option is at 6.25% and a lower cash to close. The difference in closing cost is about 3000 dollars. 

A different lender I spoke can only do 270 days lock and advised against locking. He said interest rates are eventually going to stall otherwise it will hurt the housing market bad which in turn hurts the US economy. He suggested waiting until 60 day before closing and seeking the best interest rate then since a lot can happen (including a recession). He also said that usually when a lender locks an interest rate for you, if the rates drop, they will still not give you the lowest rate that is available in the market (i.e. what other lenders could provide).

Also this will kinda be like a guide for new people that are just enetering the Algo DeFi world. I will only write about projects I personally use and I know how they work. Let's start.

\-----------------------------

DEXes - used to swap ALGO -&gt; ASA; ASA -&gt; ALGO; ASA -&gt; ASA. Also used to provide liquidity to liquidity pools and earn a percentage on trading fees. Be carefull of *impermanent loss* and low un-verified pools always! 

**Tinyman** ([https://app.tinyman.org/#/swap?asset\_in=0](https://app.tinyman.org/#/swap?asset_in=0)) - most popular DEX atm the moment although it's TVL is not highest, but that will be explained shortly, but it's most used DEX for swapping. It did had kinda breach after start of 2022, but team handled situation very well and transparent and when compensation kicked people were very happy and team behind it is doing a great job. Tinyman provides Aeneas liquidty program as well in  **gALGO3** **/** **ALGO,**  **USDC** **/** **ALGO,**  **USDC** **/** **USDt** &amp; **USDt** **/** **ALGO** pools with more than 20% APR. Rewards last until 31st of May. Website is very smooth like UI and our Tinyman is becoming really big man! TVL sits at $34,01m. 0,3% fees trading fees.

I use it for most of my daily swaps, because it has most filled ASA pools for trading. Also benefiting Aeneas rewards in USDC / ALGO pool with over 28% APR.

Tinyman Discord - [https://discord.gg/eX3v7Tns](https://discord.gg/eX3v7Tns)

**AlgoFi** ([https://app.algofi.org/](https://app.algofi.org/)) - also has a built in DEX, but it has some new DeFi integrations like Lending, Borrowing and that stuff. Also AlgoFi provides new ""Vault"" system which enables you to lock your ALGO to Governance and borrow up to 75% of your ALGO and have that vaulted ALGO as collateral. That is just awesome, which gives Algorand much more room for DeFi stuff. But there's always a risk of liquidation and high interest rates, specially with stable coins, as we can see these days. So people need to manage coins very well and be smart to see how they will operate them to get most out of period. AlgoFi also has swap called ""NanoSwap"" which is AMM for stable assets which gives you 1:1 swap ratio between stable coins. Website is very simple, some people like it, some people don't, but idc, because if thing works, then don't change it. TVL sits at $185,58m because of all lending, locking and borrowing. 0,25% and 0,75% trading fees.

I use it for Vault system. Partially, because I didn't lock all my Algos to governance. Also NanoSwap is super easy to use to get 1:1 ratio between stable coins which for large amounts is huge benefit! Also lending some wrapped assets which are left out of liquidity like GoETH and GoBTC. 

AlgoFi Discord - [https://discord.gg/dXJmmf5x](https://discord.gg/dXJmmf5x)

**PactFi** ([https://app.pact.fi/](https://app.pact.fi/)) - new player in town. Also a DEX and AMM. Mobile friendly, very easy to navigate with mobile on it. Launched recently, but rewarded Testnet users with their NFTs regarding to trading volume on testnet. Pact also has Aeneas liquidty program and ALGOMINT boost for certain liquidity pools specially for ALGO / GOETH, ALGO / GOBTC, ALGO / GOMINT, because ALGOMINT is a platform for bridging your BTC/ETH to ALGO network and getting wrapped assets on ALGO blockchain. APR for those pool currently sits at around 60% or more and rewards last until 2nd of June. Also PactFi is the only AMM currently offering liquidity providers back 100% of liquidity pool fees they accumulate. TVL is at $19,56m.

I use it for Aeneas rewards and Algo pools with bridged assets. Those sweet APR I just couldn't resist.

PactFi Discord - [https://discord.gg/QuheezVa](https://discord.gg/QuheezVa)

Now on to impermanent loss. I see a lot of people get mad because they lost their tokens, but in reality providing liquidity is very good to system and IL is only acquirable if you pool out your tokens. Tokens always remain at 50-50% ratio regarding the price. You should be carefull only of low liquidity pools where creator has more than 90% of tokens locked in a pool.

Now on to staking your Algos/ASAs.

**AlgoStake** ([https://app.algostake.org/](https://app.algostake.org/)) - platform which enables all ASA creators to create staking plan for their coin staking. Brilliant idea which is just few months old and only good words coming out of my mouth. Team is working very hard working, pushing new pools and updates every week, very transparent and responsive on Discord. Very sweet APYs on staking, mostly above 50% and some up to 100%! Their native token is AlgoStake ASA ID 511484048. 1B tokens in total, but not all are minted. 50% APY on AlgoStake staking and even more on LP tokens. And the best thing about this platform is that coins never ever leave your wallet. You just check if you qualify for pool staking and opt-in asset you want to receive and boom, that's it. Every day you get your IN transactions. Team takes several snapshots during day to ensure no one abuses the system. No Teal5 smart contracts, no problem!

AlgoStake Discord - [https://discord.gg/YpdFBQaf](https://discord.gg/YpdFBQaf)

**AlgoFund** ([https://app.algofund.co/](https://app.algofund.co/)) - new yet cool platform for staking. Been only using AlgoFund staking program which gives you around 30% APY more or less. Also has 2 farming pool. They still need to develop new programs to become more atracted to people.

I won't talk about Yieldly because I've been using it there and so and my experience was good, but I left them just before that storm happened a month ago, so my story is different than other peoples and my bias as well.

Where I check my stats you ask? Well here it is. My every day links.

**TinyChart** ([https://tinychart.org/](https://tinychart.org/)) - soon rebranding to **Vestige.** Only the best for the team and website!

**My ASA Stats** ([https://www.asastats.com/](https://www.asastats.com/)) - atm best for quick look on your porftolio value, ASA stats and NFTs.

**Asset1** ([https://asset1.io/](https://asset1.io/)) - similar to ASA Stats, but kinda more futuristic. NFTs are moving, more detailed look on your stats, but that's all due to preference. Both project need updating and upgrading and will only be better with time to time.

**Algorand Governance Platform** ([https://governance.algorand.foundation/governance-period-3](https://governance.algorand.foundation/governance-period-3)) - checking if I'm still eligible and for voting.

**Algorandstats** ([https://www.algorandstats.com/governance-period-3](https://www.algorandstats.com/governance-period-3)) - detailed info on my governance stats and to check APR and total number of locked Algos and everything in graphs.

**DefiLliama** ([https://defillama.com/chain/Algorand](https://defillama.com/chain/Algorand)) - my go to TVL page. Hopefully TVL will skyrocket soon!

To wrap it all up, Algorand is beautiful! I just enjoy using this whole ecosystem from day to day and each and every day. Green as green it can be! I personally see it as the future of finance, because this is how currencies should be. Fast, green, cheap and being able to handle a lot of users without sacrifing anything.

personalfinance,Should I pay off an Older Loan or Newer Loan first? (Same Interest Rate),"I have two loans with about the same balance and exactly the same interest rate. One was opened in June 2019 and the other was opened a couple months ago (February 2022). Considering average age of credit as a credit score factor, which loan does it make sense to pay off first?

Another factor to consider:

The older loan has a higher monthly minimum payment by about $100 and is about 50% paid off. Paying this off would open up more cash flow to put to the newer loan, but would I be sacrificing the age of that older loan and the slight benefit it has towards my AAoC versus the newer loan?",finance,1650488108.0

personalfinance,Housing Prices vs Mortgage Rates,"[Graphs of Housing Prices vs. Mortgage Rates](https://imgur.com/gallery/G8LO2NR)

Note: Data for average housing price sales and average rates for 30-year fixed mortgages were pulled from FRED on the St. Louis Federal Reserve's website, and can be accessed by anyone.

It seems like this sub has been getting a lot of ""Should I buy a house with prices the way they are"" and ""Mortgage rates are up, should I wait for prices to come down before buying?"" posts lately. As someone who enjoys statistics/data/trends, and is barely proficient with Excel, I wanted to take a look to see if there is any truth in the historical trope of ""when interest rates rise, housing prices fall"". So I did some googling to find data of average home prices as well as average interest rates, and attempted to take all the numbers and put them in to a pretty picture or two to determine whether this really is the case or not.

I downloaded the data and opened it up in Excel. The sales price data was averaged per quarter, but the mortgage rate data was averaged per week, so step 1 was that I needed to take the mortgage rate data and convert it in to a quarterly average so that we could compare the two pieces of data over the same temporal period. 

Once the mortgage rate data was converted to a quarterly average, I could compare it to average sales price per quarter for homes in the US. But I wanted to go a bit deeper, and also look at the changes in sales price and mortgage rates year-over-year as well, to see if that would yield any other pieces of information.

The link provided at the top of this post contains two graphs:

1. Average Sales Price (ASPUS) vs. Average 30-Year Mortgage (A30M) rate, per quarter, from 1971 through 2021.
2. Year-Over-Year changes for ASPUS vs A30M

Having generated the graphs, I noticed the following looking at the first graph:

* People seem to be in hysteria about interest rates being above 5% now, but historically rates have always been above 5% until the great recession occurred  (which probably is why historical advice from the Silent Generation/Boomers/Gen X was to pay off your mortgage sooner, as interest rates were significantly higher)
* Short of the great recession in 2009-2011, there has never been a large, sustained drop in the prices of houses. There have been some dips in housing prices in the mid 2010's, but those price quickly recovered to higher levels.
* Even looking at the average sales price drop that occurred as part of the great recession, prices dropped from their peak of \~$320k down to \~$260k, only about a 20% decrease in value.
* There have been periods where interest rates spiked (94, 99, 05, 13, 18), but we didn't see a big drop in housing prices. Instead, prices tended to just level off (the exception being 2013, where people were able to scoop houses up at lower prices coming out of the pandemic.

Now, it'd be easy to look at the graph and say ""WTF, housing prices don't come down when interest rates go up, I've been fed a lie all along!"", but not so fast. This is why I created the YoY graph, as it gives us a bit more of a microscopic view in to what's occurring with pricing relative to interest rate changes from one year to the next:

* When looking at the YoY graph, we do begin to see that when interest rates rise, housing prices tend to slow down (and it really is only a slow down, as the only times prices actually dropped YoY was in late 1990-late 1992, from 2008-2012 as part of the great recession, and in late 2018/early 2019).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure that people much better versed in statistics/economics/data analysis can punch holes in my analysis, and that's fine, I'm all for learning (like I said, I enjoy looking at things like this), but in general, my TLDR is:

* If you're sitting on the sidelines, waiting for housing prices to crash so you can score a deal, don't hold your breath. Even with interest rates rising, a significant correction of 10% (which won't happen, given the historical behavior of the US housing market), prices are still going to be above 2019 prices, and with inflation running rampant, don't expect rates to drop anytime soon.",finance,1650488955.0

People forget that it's simply an acronym for ""Fear, Uncertainty, &amp; Doubt"". If you are playing around in the more degenerate side of DeFi you are most certainly going to experience all of those emotions at one point or another.

   There are many of us seasoned degens out there that turn our nose up at newer investors and want to belittle them when they go in a chat and start expressing the three emotions I mention above. They are then scoffed at, belittled, or accused of fudding. Simply for having emotions like every single person.

   I don't care how seasoned you are, no one likes buying into a project only to watch your investment go down by 50-99%. However I am aware that there are people who purposefully go into a chat and start dropping negative comments and saying things to plant little FUD seeds inside of everyone that reads their comments.

   I just think that we need to change the discussion. Rather than FUD being this horrible thing, that only idiots do, simply educate people on the right way to experience fear, uncertainty, &amp; doubt when investing VS the wrong way. Where you simply become a panic selling pansy ass fudder ;). My point is just that education is key. I'm currently making a YouTube video about FUD.

stocks,Tech Stocks Are Absurdly Cheap Now: putting my money where my mouth is,"Buckle in.

Investing isn't easy, and yet people are--and always will--try to act like it is. Just like every other period in stock market history, retail 'investors' are being lazy and emotional and valuing businesses based off the direction their prices are heading rather than long term fundamentals. Volatility is the price you pay for performance. Thinking it's time to sell tech and buy Kellogg, with corporate profits RISING, will get you into deep trouble. 

No, being a good investor has absolutely nothing to do with being 'contrarian'. It just so happens that retail is too lazy and emotional to notice that prices tend to head fake away from where people should be buying at any given timeframe. Sometimes these head fakes point to different asset classes, other times to different assets within any given class. 

Right now, it's both. 

People think tech is in 2001 territory strictly because of price action, when we are in literally the opposite place outside a handful of overvalued and overhyped names; and people think bond yields are becoming attractive, when bonds are in the worst bear market in years (though this could change at any time considering the overreaction we've seen in Fed rate predictions). **This is precisely when you should be buying reasonably priced tech with strong cash flows, pricing power, quality earnings growth, barriers to entry (either a difficult industry to break into or an outright moat, which is very rare and hard to predict but** ***Facebook has one*****), network effects, and demand inelasticity.** Your stocks don't have to have all of these elements, but the more, the merrier. 

**\*\*\***

**Here's some oversimplified but VERY true deductive reasoning that 99% of 'investors' fail to heed:**

\-Companies with higher earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with better pricing power deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with higher quality earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into  
\-Proctor &amp; Gamble has a 40% higher relative valuation than Netflix  
\-CAMPBELL'S SOUP has a higher valuation than Facebook  
\-So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'. 

**Okay...**

\-Corporate profits drive stock prices--literally in lock step--over the long run  
\-Inflation is good for corporate profits  
\-Inflation requires higher interest rates  
\-Higher interest rates are a headwind for stocks  
\-Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS  
\-Holding cash *is basically taking a financial gun and pointing it at your face and pulling the trigger*  
\-The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.

**Millions of retail investors are absolutely convinced that tech is overvalued--but it's not because of poor fundamentals. Honestly, it's not even because of inflation, interested rates, or Ukraine. It's simply because prices are going down.** Do yourself a favor. Look at sentiment from one year ago today. Facebook to $600 was a done deal. Netflix was overpriced, and I wouldn't have bought it at near $700, but if anyone thought we would be below $230, we'd be minting new billionaires by the second because of their OTM puts. Amazon is more underpriced than I've maybe ever seen based off what we can easily see (the market has never understood Amazon, and AWS ALONE is clearly a multitrillion dollar valuation by 2030). 

**FACTS:**

\-**Amazon** PE is lowest ever while its future core businesses--AWS and ads (they are doing more ad revenue than YOUTUBE now, and AWS brings in more profit than any business line now, so if you think Amazon is a retail business you should be buying index funds...)--are growing at 40% or more.   
\-**Facebook** PE is lowest ever--last time this happened was three years ago, their stock price crashed to $131, and with this incredible overreaction they're STILL up 54% since then.   
\-And now to my favorite part: **Netflix** is at its lowest valuation since the 2000s and perhaps ever--who cares before then, it wasn't Netflix, it was a frickin' mail-order DVD company. Its PEG is .84. Its earnings have plateaued on SEVERAL occasions only to leap, over and over again. Just like Facebook, they were bound to hit a plateau for their core use base at some point. But if you think that means they're done growing out earnings--not to mention expanding other business lines, like Amazon did with AWS and ads, and Microsoft did with Azure--you need to ask yourself whether you have enough knowledge and experience here. 

In a way, investing really isn't that hard. **You just have to actually buy businesses and not obsess over the value of your portfolio every day**. If you do that, you're smart enough to see that tech could fall another 30% right now--and it would only present an even better buying opportunity with even more upside. As Buffett said after 2008, he might've been early, but he still got rich. And trust me, buying now might be early, but it will be INSANELY lucrative. 

SO SO SO many companies are just dirt cheap. People think DropBox is a shitty cloud business, when its top line is growing double digits and they're priced like Campbell's f'kn Soup. People think GoPro is a shitty camera business when it has begun adding software with INCREDIBLE margins and is growing rapidly again. Upstart is literally the only company in the market with the triple crown--triple digit growth, massively profitable, and BUYING BACK STOCK--yet its price was cut by 80%. There are just so many tech companies getting caught up in this indiscriminate selling, as if they're DoorDash or Rivian or Nikola or Snowflake, or any of the incredibly overpriced businesses, good or bad, that deserved to be cut in half.  

People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was. This is the literal opposite of the tech bubble. We have companies with tens of billions in FCF being repriced as if they're going out of business. Earnings are GROWING. We are in a BOOM cycle--IN TECH. You are being fooled--AGAIN. During the tech bubble, it's not that companies weren't making money...**THEY WEREN'T EVEN BRINGING IN REVENUE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE?** Not even the most overvalued companies today (aside from Rivian and Nikola) can attest to such an atrocity. 

I pity the people who need to see instant green in their portfolios, and I hope to see your sea of !Remind Me! posts for five to ten years from now. **For those of you who take anything away from this post, here's putting my money where my mouth is:**

Here's my portfolio weighted by notional impact--i.e. ITM calls carry more leverage despite moving the same amount as 100 shares of a stock, or ATM short puts I've written to buy at a lower cost basis or just hold the premium. (**I plan on opening a Netflix position at some point soon.**)

**$UPST:** **16.9%** (Pretty much the perfect stock: AI lending company that's barely unaffected by rates and loan origination volume; already profitable by a mile; reinvesting capital into massive TAMs; and already has permission from the board to buy back stock. Hope you don't judge a stock by its PE because that's how you miss pretty much every single winner, from Amazon to Salesforce to Netflix.)  
**$CIM:** **7.7%** (Retracing like a tech stock right now with fortress balance sheet and 12% dividend yield--and climbing. Chimera did even better following the pandemic after cutting its dividend yield, which made for the perfect time to buy.)  
**$OSTK:** **7.54%** (Retail furniture business that's stealing market share from Wayfair and growing rapidly yet with a stock price selling as if it's going out of business--oh yeah, and they've got Medici Ventures, which is priced at zero.)  
**$Z: 6.56%** (Vertically integrated media business of which people seem to have zero understanding. It's literally in the best shape it's ever been: shed of its worst business segment and raising capital from home inventory; growing at over 20%; and selling at a 75%+ discount...yet people hate it infinitely more than when it was up near $200...LOL)  
**$AMZN: 5.97%** (Enough said above. This is a multitrillion dollar business that checks every box listed above selling at less than half its true value.)   
**$APPS:** **5.25%** (Growing triple digits, profitable, and with insane barriers to entry--not quite Upstart, but this is a 5x play.)  
**$URI:** **5.12%** (Picks and shovels play for infrastructure boom ahead. Someone will pass a version of build back better, and this company is a gem even without government subsidy. Also, United Rentals helps balance out my insanely tech-weighted portfolio just a tad bit, though that's not at all why I bought it--because I could care less how much money I lose in the short term to maximize long term gains.)  
**$FB:** **5.2%** (The greatest network company of all time--a company whose business model will never be repeated--is trading at a multiple 7% lower than the Campbell f'kin Soup Company. Enough said.)

**$STNE:** **4.37%** (A big boo-boo in their long book and concerns about the Brazilian economy are apparently enough to crash the stock over 90%. Like several other stocks on this list, earnings give a HUGE temporary boost because of how incredibly strong they are, only to watch the gains wither away because of indiscriminate selling in the tech space.)  
**$AMAT: 3.14%** (Picks and shovels play for the semiconductor bull market that will last for decades to come. Probably the only company on this list that I'd call fairly valued, but it's such a great company it's worth every penny.)  
**$PLTR: 3.09%** (It's apparently fun to hate Palantir because it was a meme stock. But if you can do math, 30% compound interest for 10 years does not a meme stock make. Probably the only stock on this list that I might even call *over*priced, but I also think it's worth every penny with a smaller position.)  
**$AMD: 2.97%** (Trading as if China is going to invade, tear down TSM, collapse the market for chips, and send interest rates to 50%. Beyond idiotically cheap.)  
**$MU: 2.85%** (Micron's pricing power is unmatched in this industry. Very few companies do what they do and none do it as well--and they're trading for pennies on the dollar.)  
**$DBX: 2.66%** (Apparently it's cool to hate Drew Houston? I don't know, but in addition to what was mentioned above, this company is set to buy back half it's MFing float. Like, are you kidding me?)  
**$NVDA: 2.61%** (Only reason I don't have a bigger allocation is because NVIDIA puts my total semi allocation at around 9%. I also owned Intel for a hot second before I rolled it into other plays. Think The whole space is going to continue to skyrocket, but no one has the creativity or talent that NVIDIA does.)  
**$BNTX: 2.6%** (The market thinks that this company stumbled upon vaccines, that covid is ending tomorrow, and that they have no other pipeline. The reality is that BioNTech is set to sell billions more in vaccines for a long time coming, and all of this is an incredibly massive tailwind to their rare diseases pipeline.)  
**$WBD: 2.22%** (It's always funny when some jackoff at BoA comes out with a report about how the merger between Discovery and Warner Brothers will create synergies that make this a $45 stock--6 months after the deal is announced. The stock rocketed above $30, then was indiscriminately sold off back to where it started--for no reason. The market is so efficient.)  
**$GPRO: 2.2%** (As mentioned above, this has become a software company with total control over its market and prices. 96% of action cameras in America are GoPros. The recurring revenue on that software makes this at least a $30 stock. But nobody wants to own it because RemEmBEr tHat TiME WheN iT SolD OfF?)  
**$NOK: 2.1%** (5G is them and some other guy. Enough said.)  
**$CRM: 1.81%** (This company does not stop growing. One of the best companies in the world and there is no end in sight. Personally think the Slack purchase is being totally swept under the rug. It's just that time of the cycle when you're supposed to doubt Benioff.)  
**$NLST: 1.33%** (Very unknown memory company with massive lawsuits against a bevy of huge companies and great prospects outside those lawsuits. They settled the lawsuit with SK Hynix and still have pending cases for patent infringement against the likes of Samsung, Micron, and Google--all of which are entirely legitimate.)  
**$AMRS: 0.8%** (A deep future play for molecules-as-a-function. This one is very nuanced and I'm getting tired of writing. You'd have to look into this one yourself to truly understand the importance of synthetic, sustainable molecules used in the place of limited and/or endangered organics at far cheaper prices across the cost spectrum.)  
**$SFT: 0.29%** (Kind of a random little lottery bet on a company with a market cap lower than its fourth quarter revenue alone. But with no path to profitability in sight, that's all it is: a lottery ticket with a VERY small amount of AUM allocated.)

I split the notional values of being assigned each put in half to represent the fact that Upstart is currently ITM for my 100 puts, ATM for the 80, and OTM for 70.

personalfinance,Appraisal ~9% Under Sale Price -- Am I Missing Anything? (First Time Buyer),"Hello PF -- Looking for guidance from the community that has helped me so much over the last 5 years. 

We were in the market for a few months and placed an offer on a home in mid-February. We lost two offers in the area on the same 2400 sq ft floor plan, one at list price of $665k (\~.14 acre lot), then another at $681k (\~.18 acre lot). On the one for $681k, there were two other offers with ours and the seller asked for a 'best and final' from each. We made a $706k offer which was beat out, but a third house was available, same floor plan (\~.19 acre lot). We were offered the house at the prior bid and agreed to the price. With interest rates going up and local supply lowering, we were excited to secure a house in the neighborhood and move to a our desired area.

For reference, this is new construction and the closing date is in a few weeks. From an affordability standpoint, our monthly fully-loaded mortgage (property taxes, insurance, principal and interest) is \~30% of our \*post-tax\* income, before bonuses/stock. This is roughly what we'd pay for a 2 bed 1 bath apartment in our current HCOL area (we're moving to a MCOL). 

We ordered an appraisal for the house and as the title states, the appraisal came back at $640k. We knew we were likely over-paying for the house by some amount after being in a bid war. A few things stood out in the appraisal notes -- one being that they used sales prices from 9 months ago of similar houses. Other houses with similar floor plans (some with smaller yards) have sold for the same or higher, but the $66k gap between appraisal and sale is a bit more than we anticipated. For example, two doors down sold for \~$10k more with a slightly smaller yard and their appraisal came in *at sale price* for the house. 

We have two parts of an appraisal contingency in our sales agreement:

1. If the appraisal &lt; sales price, the seller will order a new appraisal at their own cost. However, my lender only accepts 1 appraisal. No exceptions (wasn't aware when I went with them, they are a well established credit union in the area that I've used for years). Not ideal, but I get it. 
2. If the appraisal &lt; sales price we can walk away and receive earnest money back

We tried using the low appraisal as a form of leverage to negotiate price down, but the seller has no intention of lowering price. Not ideal, but I get it (again...).

My understanding is this will increase our monthly payment by \~$85 in PMI, and will also decrease our initial equity stake in the house going from \~17.5% on $706k to \~10.5% on $640k. Not ideal, but I get it (again, again...).

I'll be the first of my friends to buy a house and my parents haven't purchased in 20+ years, so my personal pool of experience to draw from is pretty limited. I also acknowledge that we've been in a market where prices for homes have far exceeded appraised values (TFW a house in my town went for 70% over asking recently). So a few things:

1. How normal has it been in the last \~3 years or so for appraisals to come in under value of the sales price?
2. How often do appraisals vary by \~10% between different appraisers in the same geography?
3. Will this create any other implications for myself aside from PMI increase and a lower starting equity stake in the house?

TL;DR -- Our low appraisal isn't ideal, but is understandable. I want to make sure I don't face any other unforeseen problems in the future outside of PMI increase and lower initial equity stake in house.",finance,1650519629.0
personalfinance,AMEX Loans? Where are they?,"So, looking to consolidate some cc debt. Was manageable until rates went up and up. Excellent credit history and scores, so I can only attribute the rise in APR (across all cards) to rising interest rates.

I have a $8800 balance on AMEX. I managed to temporarily get my rate dropped 5 points, but it’s now back up to 18.9%. My husband has a couple smaller cc balances at higher rates. We’ve managed to pay off all other high interest cards with balances and they are locked in the safe (we don’t use them regularly). 

I keep hearing others talk about AMEX loans and I can’t find that on my account. Could that be because I have freeze on all the credit bureaus? 

Scores range from 751-801 between the two of us amongst all bureaus. Spotless credit. 

Had the AMEX for about 9 years now, high limit, no missed or late payments. 

Is there a secret to finding the loan options? Do I need to call them? Are they even competitive? 

Best I’ve found is 5.5% on a $10k loan. But I noticed fees and interest are around $2000! 

What’s my best option to pay off rising APR cards if I don’t have cash on hand (we used a good amount to pay off the highest rate cards and don’t want to dip into emergency savings).

Yes, we do have a handful of lower rate cards, we just never use them because of lack of rewards, benefits, etc. 

Plan going forward is to not use *any* unless it’s an emergency, but keep them open to not tank our scores by losing the dti (we have total  available credit over $100k and use a small % of that) and age of the accounts. 

TL;DR: Amex card holder with very good credit trying to find their loan offers or other competitive rate loan offers for consolidation.",finance,1650529866.0
MachineLearning,"[D] Interview w/ Google Brain researchers on Sparse Expert Models (Switch Transformers, GLAM, and more...)","[https://youtu.be/ccBMRryxGog](https://youtu.be/ccBMRryxGog)

This video is an interview with Barret Zoph and William Fedus of Google Brain about Sparse Expert Models.

Sparse Expert models have been hugely successful at distributing parts of models, mostly Transformers, across large array of machines and use a routing function to effectively route signals between them. This means that even though these models have a huge number of parameters, the computational load for a given signal does not increase because the model is only sparsely activated. Sparse expert models, such as Switch Transformers and GLAM can scale up to trillions of parameters and bring a number of desirable properties. We discuss everything from the fundamentals, history, strengths and weaknesses, up to the current state of the art of these models.

vet,"Vague symptoms, unknown diagnosis","Took my dog to the vet today, the doctor there said her symptoms are very vague, but I wanna be sure I know all the possible illnesses we're dealing with.

My 7 year old female shih tzu Elsa started having symptoms yesterday morning (GMT+8). She lacked energy and had a fever. I wiped her with a cold towel and fed her dissolved wet food in water because she didnt have any energy go eat. Then she started having chills so I gave her a hot compress. The chills didn't return after that though. 

The following morning, today, the doctor took her blood and saw that her RBC and WBC was lower than average but not as drastic. Her lymphocites were a lot so it may be an infection. The worrhing part is her platelet count. The paper she gave said 200 was normal but our baby only had 67. The doctor also said she was not that hydrated.

Doctor prescribed us antibiotics, a medicine to regain blood, and a powder to help in rehydrating her. So far, her fever hasnt returned but she's still lethargic. What could it be?",cryptocurrency,1650536571.0
Bitcoin,"How I store store my seed phrases for eternity, a less painless approach or manual","Hello dear Hodlers,

here one method of storing seed phrases on metal plates for a rather long time horizon. ""Eternity"" in the heading was just click bait, sorry for fake info. I learned some things that will seem obviouse for most, but I had to learn it the hard way #hammerHurtDuhh. I basically decided that my seed phrases consisting of 12 or 24 words on a sheet of paper are not safe enough for me. I was never sure whehter ppl such as friends, cleaning lady or who ever could accidently find my complete phrases and well... the rest is dystopie for me. Furhermore I was worried of losing the paper sheet with the seed phrases itself due to it aging or house burning down or what ever.

I decided to split my seed phrases up into two parts and carving the seed information onto two metal plates. One metal plate stores the order of the original seed phrase, the other metal plate will store all 12-24 words in a disordered manner. You would need both plates for decyphering. If you want to restore your wallet and one plate is missing you are effed! A quantum computer would still need like ages to get the order straight even with all words available. Safety goes up somehow by storing the two plates decentralized at two different places, but risk of losing one piece is basically doubled. A prime example of a tradeoff and contradicting targets.

Here an example with a fictional 3 word seed phrase: #1: phone #2: universe #3: leg

Plate #1:

\#1: 2

\#2: 1

\#3: 3

Plate #2:

\#1: universe

\#2: phone

\#3: leg

Reconstructing the seed words:

\#1 from plate #1 leads to seed word 2 on plate #2: phone

\#2 from plate #1 leads to seed word 1 on plate #2: universe

\#3 from plate #1 leads to seed word 3 on plate #2: leg

Since I needed to store seed phrases for 3 Wallets, this makes 6 steel plates for me. Here are some pics from the tooling and setup I used. After some hammering the plate starts bending, a vice would be advice but not 100% necessary. Actually I started differently, but the engraved words did not look very clean and I hit my thumb one or two time too often... To safe you the pain maybe you wanna start here. My GF thinks I am 100% crazy by doing this, what do you think? Too much overthinking and over engineering here?

personalfinance,Inherited IRA placed in my name…,"In 2019 my father passed away leaving me a portion of his state of Iowa retirement IRA. I quickly got a financial advisor to help with things and got everything squared away, or so I thought. Recently I’ve been moving my investments to another company (and another advisor) only to find out that my inherited IRA was mistakingly placed under my name and not an inherited IRA under my late fathers name. 

I’m wondering if anyone can help me understand the repercussions of this, as I’m now going back to my original company, asking them to resolve the problem, and place this money in an inherited IRA as it should have been. 

For the first time since I was 20 and waiting tables I owed the state and barely received anything back from the fed for my 2021 taxes, would this have caused this or are there other hits I can expect financially? 

What a mess, happy I’m ditching my original advisor as it’s clear he wasn’t up to snuff, but wondering what I have to deal with for his mistakes.",finance,1650539342.0
CryptoCurrency,How I Find Oversold Altcoins Likely to Bounce Hard,"Now that the market has decided its time to mean revert it's time to find some altcoins that are likely to bounce hard.

I know a lot of cynics troll these boards either because they are down bad in the market or they just don't believe in short-term trading. But my process is pretty simple and if you just take a fresh approach you will see that it is possible to extract profits consistently in the market on a regular basis.

1. Screen altcoins using [coinrotator.app](https://coinrotator.app) advanced settings. Put the Trend streak on 20 +  so you can find coins that have been trending down for at least a month or more. Depending on your risk profile you could even sort by lower market cap (0-100m). If we bounce at all the smaller caps usually bounce the hardest. But as you can see in the current market today, even the big caps are up nicely.

https://preview.redd.it/3x5js3kvkvu81.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05af8961b481f101a63ecec6b4371fe72dae80aa

2. Depending on your broker, head to [ftxpremiums.com](http://ftxpremiums.com/) or [Binancepremiums.com](http://binancepremiums.com/) and see if the futures funding have been excessively negative for a few days recently. For a less granular view, you can try [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate) or [Coinanalyze](https://coinalyze.net/futures-data/coins/?order_by=fr_avg&amp;order_dir=asc). Both are reliable sources for futures funding data.

3. Then it's important to wait for the market to level off (don't buy into euphoric spikes). Set an intraday alert for the price to close above the Supertrend. This can be done via Tradingview alerts. I like to use 45 minute charts to establish the next UP trend. Some people prefer the 5 minute, some prefer the 4 hour, it's really up to you.  The standard Supertrend works fine for setting alerts. My settings are (5 and 1.5) vs the default (10 and 3) that most people use.

https://preview.redd.it/4pv249golvu81.png?width=856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d6d67c99484bf86b9a86fdc77628d5577612c10

4. If the list is too large to monitor (and on days like today it will be), one further refinement is to check for upcoming news events. For example, now there is a conference in Amsterdam for crypto devs. A lot of positive news has been released since the start. Coins like DUSK and, yes, even MATIC are announcing positive events which will put upside pressure on their coins.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my oversold setup. I will keep this watchlist for a few days unless BTC crashes, I will be waiting for buy alerts and then consider the overall sentiment of the market (no FED drama, I am a buyer).

Curious to hear others' feedback about how they buy into an uncertain market these days.

# [Stock futures advance as investors digest earnings, await speech from Fed’s Powell](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/20/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose in morning trading Thursday as investors digested more quarterly reports from the likes of Tesla and United Airlines and awaited a policy speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 236 points, or 0.7%. S&amp;P 500 futures ticked up 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 1.2%.
*****
&gt; First-quarter reports drove premarket moves. Tesla rose nearly 7% after better-than-expected earnings, while United added 7.5% after the airline forecasted a profit in 2022.
*****
&gt; Investors were looking to a speech from Powell, who will talk at 1 p.m. ET during the International Monetary Fund Debate on the Global Economy. The discussion will be moderated by CNBC’s Sara Eisen.
*****
&gt; Despite market expectations for a series of aggressive interest rate increases, Fed officials in recent days have talked down making any dramatic moves.
*****
&gt; Regional presidents Mary Daly of San Francisco, Charles Evans of Chicago and Raphael Bostic of Atlanta all have said that while they see the need to hike rates to tame inflation, they don’t want to do anything that would halt the expansion. Daly did concede that tighter policy could trigger a mild recession but she said that’s not her most likely case.
*****
&gt; St. Louis Fed President James Bullard has been the outlier, saying earlier in the week that he’s open to a 0.75 percentage point increase at the May meeting to help temper inflation running at a more than 40-year high.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a mixed session Wednesday. The Dow rose 280 points, or 0.8%, boosted by strong earnings from Procter &amp; Gamble, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was dragged down 1% by Netflix’s post-report plunge. The S&amp;P 500 finished flat.
*****
&gt; Netflix shares on Wednesday posted the biggest one-day decline since 2004 after the streamer reported its first subscriber loss in more than a decade. Other streaming companies like Disney and Roku also fell, and other tech stocks were lower.
*****
&gt; “It continues to be a pretty bifurcated market,” said Dave Grecsek, managing director in investment strategy and research at wealth management firm Aspiriant. “Some of the more defensive, value-style companies are enjoying good returns. The flipside is some of those more growth-style tech names are going to be struggling.”
*****
&gt; Investors are awaiting quarterly reports from companies like AT&amp;T, American Airlines and Snap on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Weekly jobless claims are also slated for release Thursday morning.

btc,Bitcoin is our greatest weapon in the fight against climate change. Here's why,"Hi Everyone! Bitcoin’s been catching a lot of heat lately over its energy consumption. Article after article comes out that decry its harm to the environment. 

But the truth is far more comforting than a handful of seemingly harsh data points about Bitcoin and the environment. I wanted to create this post to equip every miner and Bitcoiner with the arguments they need to spread the truth about Bitcoin’s impact on the environment.

How could such an energy-consuming technology benefit the Green Movement?

In short, there’s more to Bitcoin than its critics appreciate.

**Bitcoin mining renders renewable energy sources viable.** 

In April 2021, Jack Dorsey’s Square released a white paper boldly titled, “Bitcoin is Key to an Abundant, Clean Energy Future”. Early in the memo, the authors explained that the costs for solar and wind energy have recently dropped by 90% and 71%, respectively. Suffice to say that green alternatives are rapidly gaining steam on the cost side of the ledger.

But as explained above, it’s difficult to match supply of solar and wind energy to demand. Demand for energy peaks in the early evening, when people are home and using appliances. At that time, though, the sun is already setting, and wind is always unpredictable.

**Enter Bitcoin mining**

Miners can work from anywhere, so long as they’re connected to a power source and the internet. Because of this, they can act as ‘an energy buyer of last resort’: whenever supply of wind or solar exceeds demand, miners can jump in and pay for the privilege of using the energy to mine Bitcoin. This will render renewable energy far more profitable, and will therefore incentivize the creation of *more* green energy sources.

Square’s white paper puts it succinctly: “Bitcoin miners…offer highly flexible and easily interruptible load…and are completely location agnostic, requiring only an internet connection. \[They are\] an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moment’s notice anywhere in the world.”

**Bitcoin is one of the cleanest industries on the planet**

In 2021, the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) published the results of a voluntary survey that investigated the electricity consumption and sustainable power mix of about one-third of the Bitcoin network. They discovered that those surveyed used electricity fed by 67% sustainable power. The surveyors inferred that the entire Bitcoin network’s sustainable electricity mix had increased to 56%, making it among the greenest industries in the world.

In contrast, electricity in the United States is only 30.5% sustainable, and electricity in China is less than 15% sustainable. 

**Bitcoin mining employs energy that would’ve otherwise gone to waste**

As Caitlin Long, CEO of Avanti Financial Group, said in a recent documentary, “More than 2/3 of the energy produced in the world is waste energy, because it’s produced during the hours of the day when there’s not demand to consume it…it’s also produced in a place where there’s not transmission to move it across space and time, and so that energy goes unused and wasted.” 

Crusoe Energy and others are tackling this issue with bitcoin Mining. The company raised 128 million dollars in 2021 to build data centers and Bitcoin mining operations that use this wasted energy and reduce methane emissions.

Crusoe Energy operates out of North Dakota, where 500 million cubic feet of gas are flared daily. The company runs forty data centers that harness flared natural gas as of 2021. Soon, they expect to operate 100 units across six states.  

Co-founder of Crusoe Energy, Lochmiller, said that “Where we view our power consumption, we draw a very clear line in our project evaluation stage where we’re reducing emissions for…oil and gas projects.”

**Energy consumption drives progress and so doesn’t require defending**

Professor Vaclav Smil’s *Energy and Civilization: A History* traces the relationship between energy consumption and human progress. To take one example, he explains that a typical 1900 Great Plains farmer employed at most 5 kilowatts of power to plow his field using horses. In 2000, a farmer couple can employ over 250 kilowatts of power with a diesel engine, all while “sitting high above the ground in the air-conditioned comfort of his tractor cabin.”

Smil’s thesis aligns with our common sense. There is a reason that modern cities consume more energy than ancient villages, that airplanes consume more energy than horses, and that calculators consume more energy than abacuses. Seen in this light, even *if* Bitcoin was the most energy-intensive money ever invented, that does not mean that we should continue using gold and fiat currencies. A more comprehensive comparison should compare all of the costs *and* benefits conferred on humanity by each money. 

To critics of Bitcoin who appeal to its energy consumption, I ask: why is environmental impact the standard by which you judge an innovation, rather than the benefit said innovation would confer on humanity? 

If you are interested in ways of pushing this movement and have more questions regarding changing the current paradigm around Bitcoin mining and the environment, Sazmining, a renewable energy Bitcoin mining venture, is hosting an [AMA](https://investor.sazmining.com/ama-sign-up-page/) today at 1 pm ET. Their AMAs are super interesting to listen to, and they love to get questions from fellow miners and Bitcoiners.",cryptocurrency,1650546095.0
personalfinance,How bad is it that I use Edward Jones?,"I've recently decided to try to learn more about investing, but currently know next to nothing. I just found out that apparently people really dislike Edward Jones, so I'm trying to figure out what to do.

My sister and I inherited some money when our dad died in 2015 (it's less than $250k split between each of us). I'm 36 now, and my sister is 25. Since we had no idea what we were doing, we opened accounts at the Edward Jones in the very small town where we're from. I think there is only one financial advisor there, and I've always thought he was great, but again, I don't understand what he's doing at all. I just watch the accounts grow, and have trusted him to do whatever he thinks is best, because I haven't known any better.

Now, I have two traditional IRAs, a Roth IRA, and 2 Custodian accounts for my kids' college funds. I've tried to look through my accounts to see what fees I've been paying, but everything says $0.00 under fees. I'm not sure if it's even possible that I'm paying no fees? It looks like my rate of return is somewhere between 9-14% on everything except the Roth IRA, which is -7.28%, for some reason.

personalfinance,Drowning in student loans.. second job or further career??,"Hey all. i love this thread and all the discussions. I know things like this have been discussed but i wanted your opinions on my personal situation. 

I am graduating this year. I have a job lined up and will be making about 60k a year. I'm a pretty financially savvy guy and extremely good with budgeting. The cost of living is high in my area (its high everywhere around where I will work). at 60K and after taxes I will be able to save probably about 15k per year. 

Here's the part that rips my soul out.. my student loan breakdown:

28k at 10.5%

14k at 8.5%

6k at 8%

14k at 5%

14k at 2.5%

**Total of $76k :'(**   (I didnt know much about student loan debt when I first got into college and my parents didnt know much either)

the last two listed loans are actually multiple small loans of about 3k with those interest rates. I plan on paying off the debt in the order I've listed. any additional income pay raises I get will also get tossed on to my debt and I wont be changing my lifestyle

this is my dilemma.. I will work a straight 40hrs a week and I've thought about getting a second job to get maybe an extra 10k-15k per year. I dont mind working 60 hrs per week, but I will be in the financial field so there are certifications I can study for to further my career quicker and my company will pay for continuing education. 

These are my questions: 

1. should i work two jobs for a couple years to help pay off debt quicker or should I focus on my career to help get salary increases as I get more experience and can focus on certifications and education?
2.  I will max out my 401k to what they match. Should I also max out a roth IRA every year too to take advantage of compound interest or pay off debt ASAP? 

I'd appreciate any help everyone. thanks in advance.",finance,1650550760.0
personalfinance,Considering a home in CA,"I’m in desperate need of advice. I don’t know the first thing about homebuying and investing, but after years of renting in LA I’m really sick of giving away many thousands of dollars every month in rent and have decided I need to buy a house at some point. I’m 40 and my fiancée is 47, so we’re not spring chickens. Our rent is $2,200, which is about as cheap as it gets in LA.

The biggest obstacle is his debt; he’s got \~$26,000 in credit card debt on two cards. The interest rates are both around 10% so it’s not awful, but certainly better than any gains I’m making in my mutual fund. I’ve been putting $1,000 into a retirement fund through work for a couple of years, but just stopped and am not sure what to do. My fiancée can save around $800 a month, and if I really try I can save about $1,800 a month, but do I use it to help him with his cards or continue putting it into my Individual Schwab account?

I put everything in Schwab into ACFOX (both the retirement and my Individual) on the advice of a money manager, but after 1.5 years I have lost about 2%. Now I’ve got $28k in the retirement fund I can’t touch and around $7k in the Individual fund that I could withdraw. Someone told me that I should take that out and get Treasury I bonds next month when the rate will likely be around 9%, but that would still only get me around 700 bucks at the end of the year.

I hate stopping the retirement fund because I know time is so important when trying to build it up, but I also know CA real estate is going to be a better investment than any of it. We’re in a lease until December, but I can’t see any way we’ll be thinking about buying then so we’ll probably stay on month-to-month. We’re tied to CA unless we want to quit our jobs, but when we are really looking to buy a house it will either be a crappy condo around here or a small house somewhere else in the state. We both have to go into the office from time to time, so if we go far we’ll have to fly in. I make about $90k a year and he’s at around $70k.

Wow, thanks to everyone for the feedback! I am realizing I understand all of this even less than I thought I did.

So  I guess the new plan is we both live like monks and he pays off the  cards as fast as possible. My new question is what I should do; should I  start putting my $1,800 a month into the retirement fund? Or into the  Individual account? Some split of both?",finance,1650552047.0
stocks,Fed Risks Shattering Pro-Jobs Policy by Taking Hammer to Prices,"Jerome Powell wants to quell inflation without sinking the labor market. Success or failure will be a defining part of the Federal Reserve chair’s legacy and the pro-employment policy he’s championed. 

 “Can we cool down -- sort of -- labor demand without causing employment to fall?” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on April 11. He sounded cautious, calling interest rate policy a “brute force” hammer that sometimes breaks things: “That’s the tricky road that we’re on.”

What happens to the U.S. job market, where unemployment currently stands at an ultra-low 3.6%, will rank alongside Powell’s widely-praised emergency pandemic response in dictating how history records his two terms at the helm of the world’s most powerful central bank. 

Powell will have one of the final words on the imminent policy outlook before the U.S. central bank enters its usual pre-meeting blackout when he addresses an International Monetary Fund panel on Thursday. The Fed next meets May 3-4.

stocks,Keynesian's beauty contest.,"When everybody starts saying that the market is going to tank as soon as the market starts raising rates, doesn't that mean they have sold or are selling their positions before that happens? If that is the case, when the fed does start raising rates (granted it isn't higher than expected) then short-term investors who would have sold already have. 

This is a classic Keynesian beauty contest scenario, where people are trying to time the market. But what you should be doing is not trying to time the market as well, but time the people trying to time the market. This could obviously go on forever (trying to time the people trying to time the people who are trying to time the market etc) but given how oversold certain stocks are compared to others, I don't believe it is in this situation.

Forex,DONT BUY YEN,"Please if you dont want to lose your money stop buying YEN.

All youre doing buying the yen right now on any pair is guessing tops. For the sake of keeping it short ima specify USDJPY.

The Yen has always been and will be a weak currency but right now after BOJ (Bank Of Japan) bough unlimited amounts of Bonds the YEN became extremely weak (too weak.)

The dollar on the other hand is a the world reserve currency and we have a war in Europe that although it isnt blowing up right now it isnt dying down. You have China doing incredibly stupid things to their economy and the dollar will just continue its bull run with interest rates getting higher.

&amp;#x200B;

When to expect a correction on the YEN:

If you are trying to short the yen intraday (go ahead you adrenaline seeker) if you want to short it for possibly the best sell of your life WAIT for BOJ to announce or for rumors from good sources regarding BOJ raising interest rates. If that isnt announced or it doesnt happen all you are doing is trying to guess for tops (gambling)

personalfinance,Advice: Should I sell my car or take out a loan?,"Hello all, 

I’m in a weird place in life and need some advice. I’m graduating law school soon and have to spend all summer preparing for the bar. This means for the first time in over a decade, I’ll have no source of income. I know I should’ve saved more, but I underestimated how expensive taking the bar is and honestly life is expensive lately. Too late to worry about that now. So here are my options: 
1. I can sell my car. I got an offer of $24,000 on it since there’s a used car shortage. I bought the car 2 years ago for $25,000 and there’s $16,500 left on the loan. I have a boyfriend (stable relationship, live with him) with an extra vehicle that he said I can use for awhile. Plus I won’t be driving much until basically September when I start my job. 
2. I could take out a loan from my chase credit card. I’ve always been hesitant about this, but I could borrow anywhere from $500-$6500 for rates from 7%-9%. (Thinking about borrowing around $5k) It’s not the best rate, but once I start work I can pay it off quickly. But it beats racking up the credit card and dealing with that interest rate. 
I have a job lined up for September with the salary being enough that I’m not worried about paying off the loan or putting a down payment on a vehicle and starting payments. I do have student loans as well, but I don’t think either of these options will be financially devastating. 

Other factors that might influence your advice:
1. If I sell the vehicle I have now, the replacement car I buy 6-9 months from now would likely be a more gas efficient car. I will be commuting 40 miles each way once I start my job and my current vehicle is a larger SUV. 
2. I am unsure if using my boyfriend’s car will cause insurance issues? Or what that all entails.
3. I don’t really want to go through the hassle of getting a personal loan through some other lender. My Chase Loan doesn’t do a check and just lets me borrow from my unused credit line. The convenience is nice.

Initially I was planning on just selling my current house that I live in but now there are some compelling reasons for me to just rent it out. 


**Reasons to sell:**

* I'd have access to an additional 300k in equity, which I could use some to pay down the mortgage / do reno if I would like. Just a nice safety cushion.
* I would pay no capital gains, since it was my primary residence and the profit from the home sale is just around 250k. 
* My homestead exemption goes away so my breakeven point when leasing is ~$269 higher. 
* I can take advantage of this insane sellers market that has happened over the pandemic.
* less headache / stress with being an out of state landlord

**Reasons to lease:**

* My area is experiencing a lot of growth (Austin). It’s a great investment and has room to grow
* I locked in a 2.75% 30 year interest rate. rates may never be that low again. I am essentially allowing inflation to eat away at my debt
* Potential to cash flow more in the future. Right now cash flow would be about $200 a month.

The apartment we're looking at is $1.2M in the same neighborhood, also a 2BR/2BA of similar size, slightly nicer building. Other costs:

* The maintenance is $3k/mo, or $36k per year. Half is building costs and the other half is real estate tax. None of this is deductible thanks to SALT.
* We heard they do an annual assessment equal to the maintenance, so that's another $3k.
* Down payment is 25%, which is $300k less in liquidity.
* Closing costs from buying/selling will be at least 10% of purchase price: 6% to broker when selling, 2% flip tax paid by buyer, 2% ""mansion"" tax, 2-3% bank-related fees.
* Apartment repairs, building/capital repairs, and construction costs fall on the owner.

The mortgage plus maintenance will be close to **$8k/mo** ($5k mortgage + $3k maintenance). The only piece that is tax deductible is mortgage interest. We have enough saved up to meet the board requirements and downpayment, and we meet the nutty 40x income requirements for renting and 28% DTI for buying.

The argument I keep hearing is that rent will keep going up, which is true, but so does maintenance. Our landlord is pretty chill and we talked him down from rent increases 4 out of 5 times. Meanwhile, the same family members who are telling us to buy have had their maintenance increase 3% every year.

In all honesty, I also can't get over the fact that we missed the window for 3% mortgage interest rates, and 5% adds an extra $1k/month in many cases. Monthly maintenance would be all cost to us, and most of the mortgage is interest upfront. While deductible, most of it will go to the bank in the first few years.

*Am I overlooking something? Do we stand a better chance investing that extra $3k/month and buying outright later?*

personalfinance,Issues creating an ID.me account to access the IRS website.,"After trying unsuccessfully to create an [ID.me](https://ID.me) using the automated method, I decided to try some things.

The process went fine until I need to enter my cell phone number at the end. The it always failed and asked me for another number that may be in my name.  So, I put in my home phone number and that failed also.

I have a family plan for my cell phone, which has 4 people on it, me, my wife, my 19 year old son, and my 21 year old son.

So, I decided to ""number roll,"" and finally got the [ID.me](https://ID.me) to create an account using my 19-year-old son's phone number.

I log in and try to change my cell phone number and that's the ONE field I can't change.  I can fill out a form to change my address. I can fill out a form to change my name. I can change my password.  I can change my 2FA, but I can't change my phone number.

Then I call AT&amp;T and ask them to please make my phone number the primary on the account and not my son, thinking that's the issue. The AT&amp;T rep tells me that my phone IS the primary on the account, and then reads off each phone number on my account and which name is associated with each number.

So, then I open a ticket with the IRS asking that my cell phone number please be updated. I give them the existing number, the number it should be and attach a copy of my cell phone bill to prove who's number is who's.

An hour later I get a reply back that they will not update my cell phone number. I have to use the number that I use when I created the account. Well, this makes NO sense to me. What if I get a new cell phone number?  What am I supposed to do then?

Somehow, my 2FA is texting me with a six digit code and not my son's number. Thank God for that at least.

After a bunch of emails going back and forth, the rep cannot understand why I care about which phone number is listed on my account.  She says that, if the 2FA codes are going to my number, then why do I care?

The message I sent back said that:

1. This is going to prevent my son from creating his own [ID.me](https://ID.me) account.
2. I don't want my son getting phone calls from government agencies about me.

The rep told me there is nothing that can be done.  My account will always be associated with that number.

Federal Reserve officials have broadly signaled a desire to raise interest rates to levels that don’t provide stimulus

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the central bank was likely to raise interest rates by a half percentage point at its meeting next month and indicated similar rate rises could be warranted after that to lower inflation.

A rate increase in May, following the Fed’s decision to lift rates from near zero by a quarter percentage point last month, would mark the first time since 2006 that the central bank increased its policy rate at back-to-back meetings. A half-point increase would be the first such move since 2000.

The Fed has indicated it will also formally announce plans at the May 3-4 meeting to begin shrinking its $9 trillion asset portfolio in June, a double-barreled effort to remove stimulus to curb price pressures that are at a four-decade high.

“It is appropriate in my view to be moving a little more quickly” than the Fed has in the recent past, Mr. Powell said Thursday. “I also think there’s something in the idea of front-end loading” those moves.

Investors in interest-rate futures markets have in recent weeks bet on increases of a half percentage point, or 50 basis points, at each of the Fed’s next two meetings. “Markets are processing what we’re seeing. They’re reacting appropriately, generally,” Mr. Powell said, though he said he wasn’t endorsing any particular market pricing. Still, he concluded, “Fifty basis points will be on the table for the May meeting.”

Mr. Powell warned of growing supply-and-demand imbalances in the U.S. labor market that some economists worry could fuel a wage-price spiral that drives inflation higher as workers bid up wages.

In July 2019, as the unemployment rate was falling to a half-century low of 3.5% but inflation drifted below the Fed’s 2% target, Mr. Powell dismissed concerns that the labor market might be overheating. “To call something hot, you need to see some heat,” he said.

Today, wage growth is running at its highest levels in years and the labor market has tightened rapidly, with the unemployment rate tumbling to 3.6% in March from 5.9% last June. “It’s too hot. It’s unsustainably hot,” Mr. Powell said. “It’s our job to get it to a better place where supply and demand are closer together.”

Mr. Powell said the Fed is focused above all else on bringing down inflation. “Economies don’t work without price stability,” he said.

The Fed is trying to engineer a so-called soft landing in which it slows growth enough to bring down inflation, but not so aggressively that the economy slips into a recession. “I don’t think you’ll hear anyone at the Fed say that that’s straightforward or easy. It’s going to be very challenging,” Mr. Powell said.",finance,1650590295.0

CryptoCurrency,Lending Stablecoins at 58.35% APY!,"# We All Know That Stablecoins can Reliably Pay Out A Fair Amount of Interest

On Blockfi this comes out to be about 6-7.25% on USDC. But there is another stable coin which you may or may not have heard of called UST (Terra USD). This coin pays out 19.5% APY when lended. Given that this also happens to be the third largest stable coin by market cap according to [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/stablecoin/) I would say its large enough to be reasonably safe by investing in (you might already have done this)

Just as a quick note for those who don't know, Terra keeps its price stable via an algorithmic process rather than by being backed by fiat. [The video on their website does a good job of explaining how exactly it works](https://youtu.be/KqpGMoYZMhY).

&amp;#x200B;

Now that's great you might say, *but I already knew that. Why are you telling me about how I can make 19.5% on one of the largest stablecoins?*

Here's the reason why: we can borrow money to buy UST to increase our staking yield.

But now I hear you say *borrowing costs on UST are super high, I will hardly make any extra money by borrowing.*

And that is also right, which is why instead of borrowing on platform, we will borrow our money off platform.

Outside of crypto a 20% interest rate is viewed as insane, nobody would pay that to borrow money. Because of that, there is an arbitrage opportunity for us. Here's how it works:

&amp;#x200B;

* Go to your stock brokerage and execute something called a [box spread](https://premiumincomeinvestments.substack.com/p/using-box-spreads-to-get-cheap-leverage?r=1awcwu&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web) to borrow money using options at sub 3% interest rates (you could also use a margin loan but you may or may not get a good interest rate on this based on the brokerage you use and on top of that the interest rate is not locked). If we only borrow against 10-20% of our total holdings then our margin requirement does not budge by very much and we will keep our risk of getting a margin call very low.
* Pull the money that you borrowed out of the brokerage account and deposit it into UST. From there we use [anchor protocol](https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn) to lend our newly purchased UST.
* Sit back and earn more than 50% a year on your UST.

&amp;#x200B;

 Say we have 100k worth of investments sitting in a brokerage outside of our crypto holdings. If you hold say 10k worth of UST you would earn about $1950 per year on that amount. But now let's say we get a box spread loan for 20k against our investments and put that money into UST as well. Now instead of earning $1950 per year we will be earning $5850. If we assume a 1.2% interest rate on the 20k we actually are netting $5610. Not bad at all! Across all of our investments (110k) we are averaging a leverage ratio of 1.18:1. For reference, that's lower than the amount of leverage Warren Buffett uses (1.7:1)! One of the most old school investors out there!

&amp;#x200B;

# Some Caveats:

* This isn't free money obviously, this strategy is assuming you have a significant part of your assets tied up in a **taxable brokerage account.** (If you try this on a tax advantaged account prepare to have the IRS hitting you with a hefty withdrawal penalty)
* UST has talked about lowering its interest rates in the near future. It's likely that if this happens, your returns using this strategy will be lowered.
* Leverage magnifies any gains or **losses.** If you bite off more than you can chew you can expect a margin call from your broker and your stock positions being liquidated. Be smart, don't over leverage yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said though, this is a strategy I have not heard about anywhere else. I tried searching on Google and other places to see if anyone else had used a box spread to finance some of their crypto purchases and found nothing. So take some pride in the fact that if you do end up doing this, you will probably be one of the first!

personalfinance,Buying vs leasing vs financing a car if I will own it only for 1 or 2 years max,"Hello everyone, 

I am in need of buying a car. My current vehicle is not very reliable and it is approaching end of life. I want to get another car, but the current market is in shambles it seems. I live in a suburban area in Southern California and my commute to work is not that long, but walking, biking or taking the bus are not an option due to the way the area is structured and lack of public transportation. 

The caveat is that I will most likely be moving abroad in a year or two. 

I'm trying to decide if it would be better to:

A) buy a used car from owner (6-10yrs old)
        -&gt; As we all know, prices for used cars are insane right now, but from my research, reliability for cars made in the last 10 years might not be such an issue (please, correct me if I'm wrong)

B) buy/finance a used car from dealership 
        -&gt; seems like interest rates are plummeting and the preferred r/PF strategy is to finance and invest what you would originally spend in the stock market

C) lease a new/semi-new car
        -&gt; same story as above, plus just selling it back might be an option

In terms of specs, I just need my vehicle to take me to work and handle the occasional camping trip.

I know this topic has been discussed in here ad nauseum, but I would really appreciate any feedback/input/opinion.

Also, please let me know if I am overlooking any opiton.


Thanks!",finance,1650598759.0
personalfinance,Refi at higher interest rate to cash out,"Would these variables make it reasonable to take equity out of my home at a higher interest rate than what I currently have? I got a job that includes free boarding and am not currently living in my primary residence. I would like to rent this out as soon as possible so that my current free boarding situation truly makes sense and I can begin saving that monthly payment. However, I HAVE to put in a substantial amount of money to remodel before I can rent it out and I just don’t have that kind of cash on hand. I looked at refinancing with a cash out. It would pay off all current debt (which is at much higher interest rate) and provide cash to remodel. My mortgage would increase but I would immediately be able to rent it out and then save that monthly living expense as long as I have this job. In this market I would be able to rent it out for the new total mortgage and essentially no longer have any monthly bills. However, my current interest rate is 3% and new interest rate would be 5.7%. I do not plan on selling this home at any time and consider it a “long haul” investment property. If I do not have the option of taking equity out I will have to keep my current free boarding while paying mortgage for a home I don’t live in while very SLOWLY remodeling it over what will likely take close to a year at least. I know on the surface the increased interest rate is terrible, but with all of these factors would it make sense right now?",finance,1650600309.0

vet,Two sick cats and behavior changes,"I'm sorry in advance for this being long.  I want to be descriptive to capture everything that has happened, because the vet has ignored and downplayed my concerns for over three years and now it's a crisis.

tl;dr My cats are puking like crazy, hate food, and aren't happy.  My vet has ignored me for years.  I don't know how to help them and I don't trust the vet anymore.

Background:

* I have two cats, no information about breed but one looks like a Tiffany and the other is probably an American short hair.  Both are the same age, adopted at the same time, over 13 years ago; at the time, they were reportedly about 6 weeks old.
* Tiffany is female (named Casper), ASH is male (named Leo), both spayed/neutered since adoption.  Both cats are indoor only and fully up to date on shots.  They do not get animal visitors as they are largely intolerant of other dogs and cats.
* We have lived in the same place since they were adopted; no home remodels or construction, last change in furniture layout included new bed and desk over 12 months ago.  We have not changed household cleaning agents or introduced new chemicals of any note.  They have abundant places to sleep or hide, and many blankets, pillows and cat beds to choose from.
* They have both been picky eaters since we got them, but nothing completely out of the ordinary.  We went through several combinations of wet and dry food over the years, however up until a January this year they were both doing fine with their favorite wet food (Friskies pate with extra gravy) and dry food (Natural Source, unsure which kind but low grain/filler) which was consistent for at least a few years.
* They've seen the vet at least once per year, someone who is respected according to reviews, same person since we adopted them.  They've never had serious health issues of any kind, at least none recognized by the vet.
* For their entire lives, they have been allowed to graze on food, with dry food left out at all times and their wet food left out until they finish it; they have typically had two cans of wet food per day, one in the morning and one in the evening.

Problem timeline:

* Beginning in 2019 they both seemed to develop a vomiting problem.  Actually, I'd just call the vomiting problem worse - they always had a few incidents during the month for their entire lifetime, sometimes a hairball but more often with bile and food; Casper was historically the bigger offender.  They have received regular visits to the vet and every time that issue was brought up it was waved away as a non-issue.  Starting in 2019 it started to intensify - vomiting perhaps once per week with small to medium amounts of dry or wet food; when it was dry, it was mostly whole and undigested.  Vet suggested they were drinking water right after eating and this led to the vomiting, advised us to move food and water, which we did.  No change.  The vomit was only ever food and small amounts of liquid/bile, no blood or anything else unless a hairball.  Casper produced larger amount of food in her vomit than Leo.
* We tried changing food - first, wet food, went to Petsmart and just bought a variety of of things from cheap to expensive, the whole range.  Both cats refused all the new options, but it didn't really surprise us because it took them a long time to figure out they liked the Friskies pate.  We tried changing the dry food, same approach, lots of options, high dollar and otherwise, concentrating on things that were recommended by vets for indoor cats.  They hated everything, again not all that surprising.  This took maybe a year, the vet had assured us nothing was wrong.  They were eating, drinking, peeing and pooping normally, nothing out of the ordinary at the time.
* The vomiting slowly increased in frequency.  In 2020 I bought a small carpet cleaning appliance because it was becoming routine to have to clean it up.  Same story as before, vet said basically nothing and couldn't find anything wrong with blood tests or physical exams.  This continued through the end of 2021, with vomiting becoming more and more routine, but otherwise no other or new problems.
* Around January of 2022, we observed a large change in the behavior of Leo, the male: he began vomiting his entire stomach contents often - at least once per day.  It contained large quantities of food and bile and was produced incredibly violently, often spread across 5 square feet or more.  After the main incident, he would run to another place in the house and vomit again immediately, but this time smaller amounts of only bile.  The smell was incredibly bad, not rotten but...foul.  It could fill the room and make you hold your breath while cleaning it up.  It was almost always dry food, and always seemed to be fresh and undigested, although wet food was occasionally included.  Around the same time, it seemed like both cats lost a bit of energy, and Leo in particular seemed to demand more attention.  At this time it was difficult to determine if Casper was having an issue, as she has always been moody and fussy; we were not able to find evidence of her having the same new vomiting behavior as Leo.  It did not appear that either cat was consuming more or less food or water, or had changes in litter box usage.
* We took Leo to the vet and asked for help, noting our previous years of visits where the issue was brought up.  We were brushed off, basically.  They didn't even say ""it's normal"", we just got a non-answer.  This happened two or three times between January and April.
* The third time we took Leo in, in the first week of April, they finally made a recommendation for an ultrasound suspecting an intestinal blockage.  Leo did not have any abdominal sensitivity and was not having any problems with the litter box that we could find.
* Vet referral called out current weight of 10.5lbs, weight loss of 1.5lbs since 10/19, \*one week\* history of vomiting (an insultingly terrible referral with limited history), epaxial and front limb muscle wasting.  Exam history was brief with mostly normal labs excepting low-normal ALB at 2.7 and monocytosis of 1747 uL.  Rest of physical exam had no callouts.
* The ultrasound was performed and the report states: moderate to marked thickening of the muscularis layer of the small intestines resulting in moderate intestinal wall thickening, with maximal wall measurement of 0.36 cm, and mildly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes measuring up to 0.8 cm in short axis; there was also a small amount of urinary bladder sediment (presumed proteinaceous debris).  There were no further findings, all other tissues and organs were normal.  The report concludes diffuse enteropathy, lymphadenopathy, with differentials for IBD and small cell lymphoma.
* Vet recommended immediate dietary change for both cats, assumed IBD diagnosis; we  switched to Royal Canin HP dry food and Prescription Diet Z/D wet food by vet recommendation.  Weekly B12 injections started for Leo.
* Result: lower rate of vomiting from Leo, although it still occurs; behavior back to previous, small amounts of food and bile, all dry food and undigested; Casper vomit rate seems unchanged.  Both cats have experienced multiple cases of vomiting up nothing other than a clear mucous at least twice, with Leo being the biggest offender.  Leo will still vomit in one place and then run to another and vomit again, just with little or no results.  No litter box changes of note.
* However, the biggest standout change from both cats is appetite and eating behavior: previously, both cats would climb over a cat deity to get to some greenies and trample anything in their path.  Casper in particular was a fiend and would jump up at your hand to bite them; for years, she would find them and paw or meow next to them loudly until we gave up and fed her some (until we started just putting them somewhere she couldn't find them).  Since the diet change, Casper will not eat greenies.  She won't even look at them.  Leo will eat a couple, then ignore them.  Both cats are interested in other small dry treats from Friskies.  Neither cat is interested in the new wet food, despite initial interest over the first two days.  Both cats do eat the new dry food, but I swear they look like they are hungry 100% of the time.  We got a can of their old wet food and they aren't even interested in that.

I am concerned for the health of my cats, and I don't trust the vet anymore.  The next closest cat specialist is not nearby, but we're going to try them anyhow.

I am very new to finance and had been considering finding a financial advisor. Upon looking into that, not only did it stress me out but I happened upon this sub and spent the last few hours reading in the wiki. I'm still not sure where to begin. I will try to keep from writing a novel but I will start with some background info and then list some of my questions... let me know if there is any other info that would be helpful.**

I (28F) am a healthcare worker, last year I made around 75k gross. My fiance (25M) just left his job in November 2021 and is going back to college. He is a full time student this semester and looking to get into a 2 year program starting in the fall. He is not making any income currently &amp; we paid for this semester's tuition out of pocket. He is currently uninsured because marketplace insurance is terrible. We have not set a date to get married but we don't plan on doing anything big or expensive. I am unsure how this would affect my taxes for 2022 when we file next year. I also have to file a return with 2 states as I live in one state but work in a different state. We also plan to move in 2-3 years once he finishes school and goes back to working full time. 

**Our current debt includes:**

1. Mortgage with PMI and 3.25% interest rate - current principal balance $178,500, monthly payment $1035
2. Auto loan with 2.9% interest - current principal balance $15000
3. Credit line #1 - current interest 0% until September - balance $500 
4. Credit line #2 - interest 0% - balance $1550
5. Credit line #3 - interest 0% until September - balance \~$10,000

**Assets/Equity include:**

1. 2018 Honda Civic that's paid off
2. only have around 10k paid off the principal of our mortgage loan
3. \~$2200 in savings account (typically add $200 a month at this time until we eliminate more debt)
4. Fiance's 401k from prior job (charles schwabb) - unsure of balance at this time
5. My current HSA account - balance around $300 (I contribute $100/month but this gets used relatively frequently so balance will possibly remain low.) 
6. My current 403b (Empower Retirement) - 0.50 cents on the dollar up to 5% - current balance around $16000. My current contributions are 16%
7. old 401k (fidelity) - balance $550
8. old 401k that got rolled over into a rollover IRA (fidelity) - balance $1900
9. I also have been working a decent amount of overtime and should make over 75k this year. I have been paying an extra $1000+ per month between our debts.

&amp;#x200B;

So that leads to my questions! 

1. **WTF are my taxes going to look like and what should I do to prepare? Will getting married sooner rather than later change our taxes in any way since I should be able to claim him either way?**  

For 2021 we filed separately and used the standard deduction, but I wasn't sure if we would be able to work any deductions/credits in our favor with the current circumstances. We had been thinking about trying to pay for his tuition up front to avoid taking out any student loans, but not sure if that is the best plan. It is far cheaper to add him to my health insurance once we get married than to buy from the marketplace. (would be $235/month for both of us, rather than $50 for me and marketplace price for him)

**2. What should I do with all of the 401k/403b/IRA accounts? Is 16% too high for my 403b if my job only matches up to 5% or should I keep trying to add to it? Since the balances are so low for my other accounts, should I cash them out or combine and start adding to them?**

I know absolutely nothing about investing and honestly not sure I have the time to dedicate to selecting and monitoring my own investments. all of our accounts are set up for them to select our investments. My current 403b company is Empower Retirement which has horrible reviews everywhere online. They are currently investing ""aggressively"" and it has a -15 rate of return which alarmed me.

personalfinance,"Parents have been taking my money earned since I was 14. Dad tells me you can't have more than 10,000 dollars in your bank account","Hi, new account because I don't want this trailing back to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 19 years old, a college student, I live with my parents and for the past 5 years all my earned money after taxes has been direct deposited to a saving's account that was co-signed and created with my dad when I was 14 years old. I started working during the summer when I was 14 years old, and since college, I have had an excess amount of financial aid has been direct deposited to my bank account. In total, I have acquired 30,000 dollars.

I have never touched a penny from that account and I found out that two years ago, when I finally reached the threshold of 10,000 dollars, my dad went behind my back and withdrew 10,000 dollars in two transactions. One week, he withdrew 9,000 dollars and withdrew 1,000 for the next. I did a little research and apparently the bank will file a report if you withdrew 10,000 dollars in one transaction. He didn't consult me and I later found out that the money was used for down payment for an apartment building. It was my money. When I finally found out, I confronted him. He told me that he was borrowing it and that if I needed money I could always ask him for it. But it's MY MONEY, shouldn't I have a say to how it's being spent and why do I have to ask him for me to spend my OWN MONEY?

What really gets under my skin is how he gaslights me saying that the money was losing value staying in the bank account and it'll be better spent on his apartment building. I was going to start investing in a brokerage account but he and my mom tells me that it's worse than gambling and that I'll lose all my money. In a sense, they're telling me that I should stop my personal finances and let my dad handle my money for the rest of my life.

He later on tells me that you are LEGALLY not allowed to have more than 10,000 dollars because the bank reports your earnings and since I'm not making as much taxable income, I'm not allowed to hold more than 10,000 dollars. I don't even think that's true. After the initial confrontation, he now tells me when he withdraws money, always going back to the statement that you can't have more than 10,000 dollars in your bank account or you get into some type of financial issue with the government.

Recently he just withdrew another 5,000 dollars and I was done with letting him manage my money. I headed down to the bank and asked an employee if it was possible to close my co-signed saving's account and open my own checking account. She told me yes but, I would need my dad to sign for closure and transfer of my funds. So I called my dad and had him bring my ID and we were able to get everything sorted. I have my own checking account now but I'm still concerned about the 10,000 dollar limit my dad has been essentially beating into me for the past 2 years. Should I be concerned about having more than 10,000 in my bank account?

I'm a little lost now, I recently applied for a student credit card with Discover but I also have my dad's authorized user Citi Costco card. I feel guilty that I closed the co-signed saving's account and opened my own checking's. My dad handles the family finances, he recently did my taxes. I don't want this to affect our relationship but for the past five years, he didn't even make an effort to give my access to my own money.

In total, he's withdrew up to 22,000 dollars from our co-signed account. I have 8,000 dollars left over that is being transferred to my new checking's account. How do I get started with building my financial wealth? I'm looking into investing by opening a brokerage account. I can't get Fidelity to verify my identity when I apply online and I don't know what my other options are. It was a lot easier when I was financially ignorance but now I want to start being financially literate.

Edit: Hi everyone, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate each and every post. The support means a lot to me. I saw some comments asking about my current financial situation and how my dad would still have access to my bank account because I made it at the same institution. Wow! I didn't know that. Maybe I'll switch to a more popular and convenience bank around my area. Anyhow, my financial aid from both the state and federal governments for college allow me to attend completely free, and there's also an abundance of it left over that is direct deposited (now to my new checking account). So I get around 5,000 dollars each school semester.I have my saving account booklet from the finance institution and yesterday just took pictures of transactions from 2017. It has noted all the deposits and withdrawals. I had a conversation with my mom as well. She tells me that my dad has been taking my money out and putting it in a safe deposit box.

personalfinance,Question on refinancing my auto loan.,"So, a little more than a year and a half ago, I pulled the trigger and got my first auto loan; I missed a number of benchmarks in my adult life and being 43 at the time, I partially cringed, BUT, I needed the boost in credit. I had always paid cash for my autos but I wanted something nicer AND, as noted, the bump in credit.

So, I put down $8k for a 2011 Toyota Avalon Limited which had one previous owner, certified through the Lexus dealership and only 65K miles with all service records with a remaining loan of $5k over 60 months at 7.75% interest rate through my Credit Union. At the time, my credit score was a tinge under 600 but since then, I've taken great pains to correct my youthful mistakes and my FICO is now sitting at 720 (with an expected 80 point jump within the next 30 days). 

My payments are $120/mo but I pay $150/mo with the extra $30 going to principle. The current note owed on the car is $2600...

QUESTION: With the $2600 currently owed, is it even worth it to refinance knowing that my credit score is +120 points since getting the loan?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Also, side note...Make fun of the Avalon all you want and how it's a ""grandpa"" car...I absolutely love the full sized sedan, comfort, and power -  the previous owner had some tuning done to the engine and she sits at about 325 HP (up from the 275 stock)...but everything else is stock, just very well maintained.",finance,1650648365.0

The  Federal Reserve (US central bank) wants to reduce their bond holdings  by shrinking the balance sheet around $95 billion a month.  In other  words, they want to sell a lot of bonds back to the market.

Until  recently, the FED did the opposite, buying a lot of bonds to support  the economy and the stock market via QE (""quantitative easing""), aka  ""money printing"".  This measure, combined with an indicated interest  rate hike of 0,5%, aims to fight the rampant inflation.

𝙄𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙞𝙘𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙘𝙠 𝙢𝙖𝙧𝙠𝙚𝙩

It is impossible to say what the exact results will be for the stock market, but a look at recent history might help.

There  are strong arguments for the thesis that the high stock market gains of  the last decade were mainly driven by growing levels of debt and the  FED's QE.  If quantitative easing (QE) combined with low interest rates  drive stock prices higher, the opposite (rising interest rates and a  shrinking balance sheet) can't support the stock market as well.

October  2017 was the last time the FED started to shrink the balance sheet  (""quantitative tightening"") by selling $50 billion of bonds per month  back to the market. This finally pushed up 10-year US Treasury Bond  yields up above 3% (less demand for bonds leads to higher yields). At  that point, investors panicked and the stock market fell by 20% the  first time since the big financial crisis in 2008.",finance,1650648631.0

personalfinance,Financing a vehicle for 84 month - not a bad idea right now?,"Hi all.

My current car is 12 years old and is starting to have enough issues that I'm considering replacing it. With the current market right now, a new vehicle seems to make much more sense than used. I'm considering a new 4runner which will cost around 45k out the door. I fully understand that I can get a new car for half the price and that I'm indulging in a several year desire to get the 4runner. 

My bank pre-approved me for the 45k at 3.09% for 84 months which would have a payment of around $625 per month. Assuming I put ~10k down it brings the payment down to around $500 per month which I think I'm comfortable with. 

Normally I'd be against 84 months but with inflation so high and a ~3% interest rate I think it makes sense to finance for as long as possible, especially considering the 4runner has historically depreciate minimally. Worst case scenario, assuming no major economical events, I can break even on this car in just a couple years if I did decide I needed to get rid of it. 

Quick summary of my monthly finances:

* Net income - $6100
* Rent &amp; utilities - $1800
* Phone, internet, streaming, etc - $250
* Current car &amp; insurance - $300
* Food - ~$400
* Student loans (once they resume) - $400

Lastly, and maybe my biggest reservation, is I am looking to buy a house in the next couple years so I'm hesitant to make any financial commitments right now. That said, even after a ~$10k down payment on a car, I'd have plenty left over for a small (not 20%) down payment on a house which would still leave money in savings for any unexpected events.

stocks,POWcycle: The Next Turn,"Hi, All.

Six days ago, I wrote about the [POWcycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u521ic/beware_the_powcycle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), a dangerous meta-pattern that has been the primary determinant of stock market behavior since mid-Feb 2021.

# The POWcycle is a THREAT to YOUR WEALTH

Virtually every time that the POWcycle's wheel turns, growth stocks, in particular, have been pushed down. I cautioned that we would likely get a meaningful discount in the ""run-down"" (the opposite of a run-up) to the final day of the current POWcycle, Wed 4 May, on which the JPow will hold his press conference. That's now happening.

The POWcycle is especially harmful to growth stocks, but it's affecting the entire stock market. This is just a quick post to remind everyone that although we can't predict the future, we can clearly see the effects of the POWcycle in action, so I'd like to offer some suggestions to both investors and traders.

* **The POWcycle Grinds Share Prices Down**: The POWcycle lasts approximately six weeks. Its two main events are the monthly release of the CPI and the every-six-week (two-day) FOMC meeting where the JPow speaks on the second day. Some POWcycles are shorter and some are longer, because these events don't align perfectly, and there are also Fed speeches and meeting minutes to worry about. If you want to invest or trade, make sure that you create a spreadsheet of these events and their dates and times, and take into account lead time, as market participants react in an anticipatory manner, not necessarily on the day of the event (although that happens, too). The important point is that within a given POWcycle, there are periods of greater and lesser danger. Take advantage of the crashes—wait for them—to dollar cost average (slowly and cautiously) into stocks that you like.
* **Growth Stocks Will Be Disproportionately Affected**: Their cost of capital goes way up when interest rates are increased. This makes them even more unprofitable. Worse, if they're not able to borrow money to grow, their growth rates will plummet, along with their share prices. And if they have to issue new shares to stay afloat, anyone holding those shares will be significantly diluted; the share price will drop.
* **Be Patient**: Sometimes you literally shouldn't do anything because market conditions are terrible, and this can go on for a very long time. You might be wondering, ""Just how low can stock S possibly go!?"" Or you might think, ""Stock S can't possibly go any lower!"" and decide to buy shares, only to find yourself immediately in the red, and getting redder. No one knows how low any individual stock, or the market as a whole, might go. One clue comes from major support levels, but these can easily be breached. But more importantly, heed the POWcycle. Buy when there's a discount, not just because you think that a stock's share price is desirably low. Don't buy shares of stock before a major event within the POWcycle, such as the release of the CPI. Sure, the market could rally. But there are many more reasons for it to drop than rally. Don't get caught on the wrong side. It's better to be late and safe rather than early and sorry.
* **Don't Be Fooled by Relief Rallies**: There will be relief rallies. Don't be fooled by them, or the institutions will fool you and take your money away. Institutions pay a lot of money to brokerages (Schwab, E\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, Robinhood, WeBull, et al.) for retail trading (and investing) data. That means that they know what's being purchased, when, which stop losses are most common, and everything else. They have statisticians and data analysts that pass their results on to executives who make decisions about how their institution's algos should trade. They have a lot of data (including macroeconomic) and knowledge that we don't, and they take full advantage of it. Don't try to invest or trade against the (down)trend. Don't be fooled by very temporary rallies. I expect the POWcycle to continue to determine market conditions for many months to come, and possibly the entirety of 2022.
* **Track the CPI (which is released monthly) and Other Economic Indicators**: Macroeconomic effects are ""swamping"" (dominating) all other conditions. Inflation and the measures that the Fed will need to take to combat it are the fundamental drivers of the POWcycle. It doesn't matter very much how strong of a ship you're on at sea if a devastating hurricane comes through. You'll be at risk, although being on a kayak would be far more dangerous than being on a destroyer (FB). Look at trends more than individual data points. We want to see signs that inflation has peaked. Market participants are future-directed and when they believe that inflation won't go up further, the market will stabilize and rally before the numbers show that we've turned the corner.
* **A Recession Looks Likely**: At first, the Fed didn't raise interest rates when it should have. Then, it said that it would raise rates by 25 basis points. Wall Street didn't believe the Fed, and the financial press started worrying about 50 basis point rate increases. At least one member of the Fed's Board of Governors has publicly mentioned 75 basis points. In his two speeches yesterday, the JPow said that the Fed could get a lot more aggressive to combat inflation. No one, apparently including the Fed, knows exactly what the Fed is going to do, but there are going to be multiple rate increases throughout 2022. No one knows just how high rates will go because no one knows how high inflation will go. The higher those rates go, the more downward pressure there will be on growth stocks. Corporate earnings will likely drop.
* **Follow the JPow (and the LBrain, and Other Members of the Board of Governors) Like a Hawk**: Whenever the JPow speaks, or he trots out one of the other members of the Board of Governors of the Fed to speak, there's systemic danger to the market, and there will continue to be until an equilibrium point is reached, where it will have finally priced in the upcoming rate increases. Again, since no one knows how bad things will get, we can't predict how low any given type of stock might go, but growth stocks are by far the most vulnerable. Don't think that the risky periods are just during the JPow's formal press conferences after the FOMC meetings that occur roughly every six weeks. Speeches before Congress and other bodies can be just as dangerous, and don't forget about the FOMC's meeting minutes, which are released three weeks after the second day of the two-day FOMC meetings. To avoid a potential mini-crash in the market, it is imperative to watch the JPow and other speakers from the Fed like a hawk. Know the dates ahead of time and avoid them. (Don't go long on stocks before these important dates, because you wouldn't want to be on the wrong side of whatever might happen, and even if there's a relief rally, it won't last, because the fundamental picture won't change.)
* **Growth Stock Investors Will Have Opportunities**: All of this feels as if it will never end. After all, the POWcycle has been active and swinging primarily at growth stock investors like a hammer for fourteen months, with no signs of stopping. But it really will eventually end, just not as soon as everyone would like. I don't think that this will go into 2024, but how long it might actually last is anyone's guess. At some point, many growth stocks will go as low as they're going to go and simply stagnate (flatline). Those who are trapped in them will have dead money until there's a systemic improvement in market conditions, but they won't change soon. With that in mind, there are reasonable opportunities to consider. I would focus on researching and dollar cost averaging into: ONDS, MELI, DOCN, UPST, JMIA, STNE, SQ, CDNA, and SE. Remember to distribute your money. Don't concentrate it into any single stock in these market conditions. And when you buy, buy slowly and patiently. If you want to be more cautious, FB looks attractive.
* **Some Growth Stocks Could Go Bankrupt**: Please don't think that this can't happen. No one imagined that FUBO or NVTA could possibly drop as low as they have, for example. While I don't expect either to go bankrupt, some growth companies will. Be very careful to research companies thoroughly before investing in them. Don't throw money at companies that you've heard of just because the market cap seems very low and looks undervalued. It's usually that way for a good reason. If you pick the right companies, though, you could 10x your money within five years.
* **Learn Options**: Although this is a stock trading subreddit and many people are scared of options and believe that they're a mechanism for gambling, and that they're too complicated to learn, in any case (these are all opinions that I once held, too), it's important that you learn how to trade options in these market conditions, because they enable you to greatly increase the odds of making money, as compared to a long-term buy-and-hold approach (which is great if you buy the right companies at a low price, and financially ruinous if you bought growth stocks near their all-time highs in 2020). I haven't been buying shares of stock, myself. Instead, I've been shorting (selling) puts slowly on the growth stocks that have shown the greatest buoyancy (relative strength) that I believe are trading lower than they should be due to widespread panic, which in some cases seems to be an overreaction driven by pessimism that market conditions will never turn around for many years; but I don't believe this to be the case. When you short puts, you have the potential to either make some cash outright, or buy shares at a lower cost basis than you might have had, had you bought them immediately. The devil is in the details, but I like to teach, so if you'd like to learn (for free), feel free to join our Discord server. (More below.) Don't try to short puts if you don't truly understand what you're doing, and never use more than 50% of available margin.
* **Don't Panic-Sell Existing Positions**: Please don't make this mistake. If you panic-sell below your cost basis, you will delete money, as if it had never existed. If you pay $100 for a book and sell it for $75, $25 of your capital will have been deleted. The same applies to shares of stock. Unlike with books, when you own shares (in good companies), you own something that should appreciate in value, not decay. Unless the fundamentals deteriorate because of a deleterious foundational change in the company or its market, hold patiently, for years if necessary.
* **Learn DCF Valuation**: Take this time to enhance your skills by learning to construct a DCF model, so that you can figure out how much a company is really worth. (Yes, this depends on various assumptions, but it doesn't involve wild guessing. You'll be shocked by how much higher than the fair value a company usually trades, but the degree of shock, relative to market conditions, should keep you grounded and aware of what looks like a good opportunity and what looks like a major risk.) I recommend two courses on Udemy that will help you to learn the needed skills. (I have nothing to do with Udemy or the courses.) They are: The Complete Financial Analyst Course 2022 and The Complete Financial Analyst Training &amp; Investing Course 2022. They should be taken in sequence.

The current POWcycle will end in twelve days, on Wed 4 May, after the JPow speaks. (Added: **If he announces a rate increase of 0.75%, there will be a lot of devastation in the stock market.**) Learn to recognize the POWcycle. If you want to invest, invest at the right time, aligned with the POWcycle, not against it, or you'll effectively be trying to drive through a concrete barrier to get onto the highway rather than taking an onramp.

Finally, if you're interested in joining our learning community on Discord, feel free to private message me. I can't post the link here or a bot will delete it.

I hope that this will help to tilt the odds in your favor and inhibit Wall Street's ability to take advantage of retail traders and investors. Be patient and don't worry. When we finally exit the POWcycle, there will be a great deal of money to be made.

personalfinance,Buying a double wide,"My parents gave me some land, not a huge amount, about 5500 square feet. Plenty of room for me and my wife and my cat. We want to buy a double wide to put on it, so we went to pick one out at the home store and applied for financing through Vanderbilt mortgage we got approved almost immediately but the terms are very tough. 

130,000, 9.5% interest with 11k down, total monthly payment of $1236. 

The land is developed and free and clear. In Kentucky where I’m located a double wide on block foundation is considered an actual home, so in 6 months I could refinance through any bank as a regular home with the land and all to get a better interest rate. My hometown bank advised me financing through the home store is the best option until then. 

I sent my info to 2 other lenders they partner with and I guess my question is should I give up on this at the current moment and not expect any other lender to be different enough to matter.    $1236 with 11k down on 130,000 is not a realistic option for us.

So i got a pension buyout offer from a previous employer (hospital). I am 47, the offer was for $42,528.37.

The reason i am thinking of the pension buyout is I would like to have extra money around and to possibly buy a house. Is it worth it to take the lump sum? I have until May 25th to decide. They did use the GAM 1971 mortality table. The plan's interest rate is 7%

I am currently a state employee and will have a pension from them that is separate. Was not planning to do a rollover, I have no account setup for 401 k or such. I do have a 401a with the state also but I can't roll it over into that. I realize i will be taxed an extra 10% taking it as cash.

I know the PBGC does guarantee this companies payments but it is not inflation adjusted.

On another note, I was given the same buyout offer in June of 2016 for 19,784. Why was it so less?

Anything i should call and ask the hotline they setup for questions?

Polkadot,"Could Gavin Wood, or him and his friendship group, be Satoshi Nakamoto?","Ok, I know what you're thinking and it sounds crazy but hear me out.

**Facts**

* We know that Gavin Wood played a critical role in Ethereum
* We know that Gavin Wood believes Ethereum is no longer sufficient and moved on
* We now have Polkadot which is built on a democratic federated architecture

**Background**

  
**2002-2005 (Studies)**

&gt;Gavin Wood's LinkedIn profile states that he graduated from the University of York in 2002 with a Master of Engineering (Computer Systems/Software engineering). In 2005, he graduated from the University of York with a PhD in “Music Visualisation for Human Computer Interfacing.”

He easily has the proven technical background.

  
**2009 (BTC)**

This is when Bitcoin launched under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. 

What we do know about Satoshi is the following according to sources:

&gt;The use of [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English) in both source code comments and forum postings, such as the expression ""[**bloody**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody) hard"", terms such as ""[flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment)"" and ""[maths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics)"", and the spellings ""grey"" and ""colour"",[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#cite_note-NY2011-17) led to speculation that Nakamoto, or at least one individual in a consortium claiming to be him, was of [Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) origin.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#cite_note-Wired-22)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#cite_note-whitepaper-10)[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#cite_note-betabeat-25) The reference to London's *Times* newspaper in the first bitcoin block mined by Nakamoto suggested to some a particular interest in the British government.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#cite_note-NY2011-17)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#cite_note-27)

  
**2014 (ETH)**

&gt;He met the first five co-founders in Miami, just before the North American Bitcoin conference in January 2014, where Ethereum was due to be unveiled.  
&gt;  
&gt;After being the first to get an Ethereum testnet up and running, he demanded a place at the top table. The others agreed, but not without some pushback. In April 2014, he published [the Ethereum Yellow Paper](http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf), a technical specification of Vitalik’s white paper, and later proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity. 

He was the first to get the Ethereum testnet up and running, and he published the technical yellow paper.

&amp;#x200B;

**2017 (DOT/KSM)**

We know the story here in that he essentially continued on with Solidity/Substrate, and built out what he believes is better than ETH and the next evolution (i.e. Web3) a term he has coined himself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

* The timeline makes sense - BTC's inception slots into the gap that exists in his career
* He has the technical background and he holds those strong political views
* Evolution of BTC --&gt; ETH --&gt; DOT (Web3) makes sense
* We know he's into Japanese culture (Kusama/Polkadot) - Nakamoto?

personalfinance,Should I Max out my 401K or continue to build emergency fund?,"I realized I am in a very fortunate situation right now and I hope I never lose sight of that. With that being said, I was hoping to get some help on how to proceed with my current situation.

Before today, I was making $104k a year. I was putting 13% into 401k, 5% into company ESPP. With federal and state taxes, HSA, FSA and all other deductions, my take home was about $4k a month. 

I have $13k in HYSA as an emergency fund. I know its nothing but still building it up to a healthy amount. 

I have about $6500 in Roth and auto depositing $400 every month.

As of today, my position changed and my salary changed to $155k a year. I have been racking my brain on how to move forward in order to maximize both 401k and Roth and also build a healthy emergency fund. My company matches 100% for the first 3% and 50% for the next 2% so I am already getting the most. 

My fiancee makes $67k a year with $20k student loans. I have $27k in student loans but they are all federal and not accruing interest right now. I was paying $600 a month but I figured why not save the money until the interest is turned back on. That is all the debt we have. She barely has any savings and once we get married this summer, we will pool our resources together. (Somebody please tell me not to do it😂😂)

My issue is whether or not to max out 401k and Roth (I think its $22,500 for 401k and $6500 for Roth for 2022) or just build the emergency fund to about maybe $30k or $40k before diverting the rest into my retirement account. 

TL:DR Summary:
Should I max out both my 401k and Roth to reduce my taxable income or build an emergency fund first? Our plan is to buy a house probably next year or whenever the housing market calms down. 

 Please let me know if you have any follow up questions or need any clarification. Appreciate any and all advice and feedback.",finance,1650671100.0

personalfinance,Mileage reimbursement in California?,"Hi everybody. 

I’m on mobile, so apologies in advance for any formatting errors.

I began a new job approximately one month ago. This job requires me to travel to two different worksites per day with my own personal vehicle. To date, I have driven 216.6 miles- not including the commute to and from my house, which totals out to a little more than 50 miles per day. 

Upon getting hired by this company, I was given an offer letter that explicitly stated that I, the employee, would be entitled to mileage reimbursement at the federal rate (58.5 cents a mile) at MINIMUM. I signed this letter, as did my employer. 

Now that I am asking my employer how I should go about receiving this reimbursement, I am being told via email that the city of Escondido does not “do mileage reimbursement” at all. Additionally, I was told that since I am “on the clock” while I use my personal vehicle, I am “only entitled to my hourly rate and nothing more”. I was under the impression that the state law regarding mileage reimbursement was not contingent upon different cities? I was also under the impression that I am entitled to this reimbursement *because* I use my personal vehicle for work related services while I am on the clock. 

I’m sending emails and getting zero responses. I would like to pursue legal action, but I need to know if I’m in the right to do so first. Am I being cheated?

MachineLearning,[D] Review of end-to-end multi-modal deep learning approach for autonomous navigation,"In reviewing various approaches to end-to-end deep learning for autonomous driving, I've come across an interesting approach [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09202.pdf) that I would like to discuss with others...

I will begin by summarizing the approach:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A ResNet50 architecture is used as an encoder network with the input being an RGB image + depth map concatenated as (224 x 224 x 4).  In the paper it is argued that a point cloud can also be used, or some other sensor modality would also work
2. The encoder network output (feature map of 7 x 7 x 2048) is fed into a decoder network that takes it back to (224 x 224 x 5) with pixel wise semantic segmentation of 5 classes: *lane, road line, sidewalk, vehicles or pedestrians, and others*
3. That same encoder output (feature map of 7 x 7 x 2048) is global average pooled to 2048 and fed into a feed-forward vanilla network with three layers (described as a driving policy network) where the output is the control commands of linear and angular velocities (v, ω) in standard robotics text books.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9spjbj16w6v81.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=020426b9e385685ae7111afb4e2e312dfdc08e5d

The idea behind the encoder network is to force the feature map into representing the scene by learning a pixel wise semantic segmentation. This would then help the driving policy network to learn something that is ""meaningful"" to the driving task: when to lane follow, when to turn left/right, when to stop/go, etc.

In my opinion this approach seems a bit naive for complex urban driving, **however it may be ideal** for autonomous driving in off-road scenarios like autonomous lawn mowers, robotic farming,  weed prevention robots, delivery robots, etc.

  My reasoning for why it is naive is:

1. It does not mention anything about ***path planning*** or seem to take into account.
2. The dataset was collected in CARLA even though there are plenty of open datasets (KITTI, Waymo, nuscenes, Berkley deep drive) most of which have the depth and/or point cloud data
3. The training was done on a single RTX 2080 GPU
4. There's no code published with the paper

**All that being said** I do think there's some validity in this approach for slower off-road autonomous vehicles.  

Would anyone like to provide a critique of the approach outlined above? Or provide a solid reason why it would not work for off-road autonomous vehicles?  I would hope to save my self a few week's time implementing this approach only to find out it has no real value to those tasks (autonomous lawn mowers, robotic farming,  weed prevention robots, delivery robots, etc.)",technology,1650682492.0

Worries about slowing corporate earnings and the Federal Reserve’s plans to rapidly raise interest rates dragged the Dow industrials to their worst day since 2020.

Investors this week parsed first-quarter financial results from a range of firms in search of clues about the health of the economy, the consumer outlook and companies’ ability to cope with inflation. Of the companies that have reported so far, about 80% have beat analyst expectations, according to FactSet, which has helped provide some stability to the U.S. stock market.

“Usually when the economy’s slowing down, or there is a perception it’ll slow down, there are obvious sectors to hide in. Those traditional sectors aren’t as safe from an earnings basis as they are historically because they still are going to have negative impacts from inflation,” said Tavis McCourt, institutional equity strategist at Raymond James.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its worst one-day percentage change since October 2020, losing 981.36 points, or 2.8%, to close at 33811.40. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 121.88 points, or 2.8%, to 4271.78, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 335.36 points, or 2.5%, to finish at 12839.29. 

The recent rise in government-bond yields showed signs of steadying, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ending Friday at 2.905%, down two of the past three trading days. Yields staged a climb earlier Friday before reversing course. Bond yields rise when prices decline.

Healthcare stocks are often considered defensive, with money managers betting that consumers will pay medical bills before making discretionary purchases. The S&amp;P 500’s healthcare sector fell 3.6%, its worst day since June 2020.

Concerns about inflation and the pace of monetary tightening by the Fed also remained at the forefront of investors’ minds this week. On Thursday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave investors a clear signal that the central bank is ready to tighten monetary policy more quickly and indicated that it was likely to raise interest rates by a half-percentage point at its meeting in May.

A rate increase next month, following the Fed’s quarter percentage point increase in March, would mark the first time since 2006 that the central bank increased its policy rate at back-to-back meetings.

Mr. Powell’s comments injected fresh volatility into a stock market that has been whipsawed this year by the war in Ukraine, soaring inflation and rising Covid-19 cases in China.

“The market is finally internalizing and factoring in the reality that the Fed really means what it says and it’s not going to back down,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer of Exencial Wealth Advisors. “Somebody had a saying, and it’s pretty
 good: ‘You don’t fight the Fed when the Fed is fighting inflation.’”

In commodities, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil, fell $1.68 a barrel, or 1.6%, to $106.65. It fell 4.5% this week.

stocks,"Exxon upcoming earnings, oil discussion.","Hello all, been a while since I've posted here about oil. Been having fun gambling during the bear rallies and losing some fun money with phone app. Time to make it back. 

Welp, funs over, back to business. Exxon has earnings coming up and it's estimated to be a blowout, slightly less than $90 billion in revenues. With oil prices as they were during the quarter, I expect a solid earnings beat, but I am slightly worried about the sell the news mentality, so am considering hedging my long position.

I believe that we have not seen peak oil prices yet, mainly due to the strategic reserves being released. 120 million barrels to be exact, that is 20% more than global use for one whole day. Draining of strategic reserves In my opinion, is bullish for the remainder of the year. It destabilizes prices. 

With the sanctions on Russia and what not still ongoing, and being discussed in the EU, I think working with the facts will be a must to avoid speculation and being too married to this trade. I don't know if the EU will ban Russian oil, Germany is strongly opposed as they are reliant on natural gas. But there is a lot of news released about other EU countries pumping more oil to meet demand in case the EU does ban Russian imports. Either way, the base case is still bullish, as I don't believe the war will end soon. I am unsure of what to make of this situation, and it can change by the month. We will have to wait and see. 

We have sold off this week due to China lockdowns and what not, maybe this is ignorant, but I view this as a non issue, and see it blowing over within a few months. Profit taking on that news is to be expected, and oil prices have stayed above $100 during this fear, albeit, not by much, and it does look weak.

That being said, the analyst expectations for long term oil are based on $60 per barrel, which is obviously in the rear view for now. We will see these prices again for sure, but I think the feds willingness to fight inflation means that these prices will be hear to stay for at least a couple years. 

Exxon has lagged over it's peer Chevron, (not by much) when Exxon's ""all-in"" on fossil fuels is advantageous in my eyes. With their profits soaring, they will seek further uses for carbon capture. Obviously, CC is nothing new, but on a large scale, can definitely be a catalyst to the long term value of the oil giant. 

I also have noticed oil being more of a defensive pick these days as well, as besides the news of the .5 rate hike, have traded against the market and has been moving up with healthcare names. Also I'd like to mention, the .5 rate hike was expectedly not priced in by how fast the market recovered when the .25 failed to send the correct message to investors. 

I think Exxon longs will be happy for earnings, and finally, the part that most people are waiting for, is the dividend increase. I'm not sure if Exxon will speak on it at this earnings, but I do believe it is coming this year. That will be a major catalyst to help get Exxon over $100 per share, which I believe we will see this cycle.

stocks,Assessing Value of Sector Specific ETF,"Hi all,

I primarily trade options on individual securities, but obviously I have to keep an eye on overall market conditions. A lot of my options trading is on biotech stocks and over the last year the entire biotech area has been marching downwards. Yesterday I was looking at the chart for XBI, an S&amp;P Biotech ETF. Yesterday it closed at $79.84. For context, XBI was above $79.84 for almost all of 2019--before the fed's quantitative easing program intensified after COVID. 

This would appear to suggest that the market is pricing in that that the expected fed tightening and the reversal of the fed's balance sheet purchases will cause destruction to pre quantitative easing levels. That seems extreme and has me thinking XBI is oversold. But I'd like to be able to assess with more accuracy than a hunch. Perhaps XBI going so low makes sense if it was overvalued in 2019 (past price does not mean said price was correct). Also the FDA has become stingy about approvals for new drugs after the Biogen fiasco, so that could also explain some of the price action. 

So my question is this: Does anyone have recommended resources, models, articles, books, etc. that would aid in evaluating the value of an ETF or index? I understand it is something of a weird question because an ETF just tracks a basket of stocks. So one could respond that the ETF doesn't have any value--its just an assemblage of the value of the underlying securities. And that wouldn't be wrong, per se, but obviously the whole reason there are ETFs in the first place is the thought that some sectors might move differently than each other or from the entire market. XBI is actually a great exemplification of this in action--it is below most of where it was in 2019 but SPY is still well above all of its 2019 levels. 

I want to dive into this and research all I can as to whether there's more room to fall, whether XBI is oversold, etc. Any suggested reading, or any feedback, would be great!",finance,1650718871.0
stocks,Bear case for GOOG/GOOGL,"Apparently market is going over another bipolar symptoms initiated by NFLX, which I think it's hyper reactions, but with Bears looking to maximize its profits, NFLX is only the pawn to take advantage of the current macro economics.

So I am looking to enter GOOG and GOOGL, but what's the bear case on it?

I dont really see meaningful bear case even if rate hits all the way upto 20% (if we go that high!). It has great cash flow, EPS is positive, everyone is using google to answer their questions, cloud service is still successful, with Forward PE around 19, which is also historically low. It has relatively less risk to supply chain issues as well.

GOOG's PE is almost identical to healthcare companies like UNH/ANTM that forward PE 23/17, so in terms of valuation wise, it's really great.

And just for my psyche comfort, CEO's astrology suggests that his prime time isn't over yet, so I think he wont make huge mistakes in short terms, it's not like NFLX and NVDA CEO whose prime time are already over and whatever they decide, the decision will end up not great return (and TSLA's Elon Musk is just starting his prime time, so not too surprised even when it goes to 5000$ per shares within 5-10 years).

Anyway, sure less digital footprint means less traffic to google, but everyone has been using google anyway, and I am highly doubtful that folks will go back to use paper map to find out highway exit ramps or remembers brick-and-mortal stores' phone numbers.

The biggest bear case for GOOGLE is when index goes down, GOOG will go down, but shouldnt this be another great opportunity if you are looking for long terms? This side of bear often suggests that big tech like MSFT/GOOG has never experienced interest rate greater than 5% in its lifespan, so it will create high uncertainty.

&amp;#x200B;

2nd best bear case is GOOGLE is winding down services in Russia after the war, so they might lose more active users and digital footprints, which accounts for NFLX's decline in large parts, but GOOGLE isnt making profits from digital footprint anyway, but more like ads and premium services in youtube, so this can lead to slowing growth.

My counter argument is google has pricing powers that they can charge more like AMZN's prime membership increase. I mean, folks will be hesistant to run away simply because they dont like Youtube premium services. It's free to go into Youtube premium membership, but I havent seen anyone getting out of it (at least yet) to watch all the ads in each Youtube.

Last bear case is more like general that since everyone talking about GOOGLE with high conviction, it can have confirmation bias that no one is aware except insiders in the case of black swan, but.... in this investing/trading world, there isn't 100% certainty like everything else in life (and that's why my B.S. astrology psche comes in for my comfort just in case, because no one expected Napoleon would be failing in Russia's mission and everyone had high conviction for his victory). If one has bear case simply because of it, perhaps, he/she simply needs to go to I bond or CD/Saving accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean.... Remember that Pelosi's call option 2000C expiring this September that she bought last December when it was around 3000$ per shares. She spent 100k for each and she bought 10 of them!) I looked and now its about 400K only, so her account been bleeding at least 600k just from GOOGLE, let alone other stocks/options (I dont remember all, but she also had RBLX 95C expiring sometimes this year, which is standing at 35$ per shares....

Perhaps, if markets dont like her enough, GOOGLE might go down 1999.99 to eat up her premium by the expiration date only to find out it can go back to 3000 after mid term elections? It's possible scenario (because in COVID crash, google experienced 30% loss in share prices), so if it started from 3000 per shares, it can go down to 2000, although I am thinking next support line is around 2200.

Anyway, what would you guys see bear case for GOOGLE?

PS: just so you know this is not a financial advice or anything, but I am simply looking for some more voices to see if I am missing something in GOOGLE.",finance,1650720604.0

War, inflation, fed WAY behind, supply shortages, covid, China lockdowns.  

Folks sorry but I don't see ANYTHING getting better for 2022, 2023 and maybe further!

I am presently 30% cash.  I've been investing for 2.3 years now and am still up about 30% in those 2 years from my one time lump sum 2.3 years ago.

Most of the time I have been anywhere from 10% to 70% cash so maybe my returns would've been higher but I was always worried about big downturns.

Well I fear NOW is very different!

I just can't stomach having my portfolio reduced to its principal amount and I'm deciding to call it quits while I'm still 15% per year up!

I will maybe leave around 30% in things like UNH, VTI, and maybe some energy and materials.

Other than that I want about 70% in cash for the short term.

I feel we are easily going to 4000 in May or sooner and might even hit 2000 by July.

I definitely don't see any all time highs in VTI this year.  I say VTI will be under 4000 end of year and then 2000 in 2023.

The positive thing is that we Accumulators will be buying at LOW entries!  

So after all the pain this summer and year I think... We will have great entry points!

I look at thr next 2 years as ""the great cleansing"" in the markets.

Shake out all the crap and start over again much lower!

He said ""would you rather lose 20% in the markets or 8.5% to inflation?"" Or similar.

The good thing is that the majority of my shares are long and I have a lot in my ROTH that I can sell off temporarily.

Timing the market? Yes. I feel it's definitely right this time though!

defi,Terra is a law-breaking bank,"EDIT: TLDR ust’s stability is entirely dependent on the market cap of ust never exceeding Luna’s market cap. Luna’s market cap is a function of how much the ust product is used by consumers, but is also a function of the incredible expectations of future growth that do kwon has sold luna investors on (the latter being quite fragile and prone to swings in market sentiment). To use a Tesla analogy: we all know that Tesla’s share price is detached from cash flow forecast fundamentals and is largely a bet on Elon himself… buying UST is like buying a bizarre type of Tesla car that will self destruct on the highway if the price of Tesla stock falls below some predetermined threshold. 

=====================================


Came up with a banking analogy to describe Terra. Let’s imagine Terra is a modern day bank (ie glass-stegall has been repealed). Terra is essentially a bank that uses 100% of its customer deposits to invest in its own stock! 
 
1/ Bank receives customer deposits 
 
2/ Bank uses 100% of those customer deposits to invest in its own stock
 
3/ Bank’s stock price will now increase in proportion to the volume of customer deposits.
 
4/ Bank offers a 20% interest on customer deposits. This interest rate is funded by the bank issuing new shares of its own stock and selling them for dollars, which are then passed to depositors as 20% interest.
 
5/ 20% interest rate attracts a HUGE volume of customer deposits. This causes the bank’s stock to go to the moon!
 
6/ As long as the market cap of the bank’s stock increases faster than the volume of customer deposits, the bank is able to keep operating with 20% interest rate, growing deposits and growing stock price.
 
7/ If, however, the deposits increase faster than the market cap of the bank’s stock, then Eventually the deposit volume will become bigger than the market cap of the stock. When this day comes, the bank will become insolvent. And of course , when a bank becomes insolvent, there will be a bank run and the bank will collapse. 


Addendum: detailed explanation of the terra as bank analogy
- terra blockchain is the banks payment processor (albeit one that only works for transactions between internal deposit accounts at the bank)
- UST is a zero interest deposit account product 
- LUNA is the banks publicly traded equity
- Anchor is a high interest savings account product",cryptocurrency,1650741546.0

personalfinance,Debt consolidation plan.,"So I have a plan to both consolidate my high interest debt, and bolster my dividend portfolio in one swoop, but I want to make sure my plan is valid.
I currently have an outstanding secured personal loan of around $2500@ 5% interest, but I have a small pay out of ~$3000 coming in a few weeks.

My plan was to put the $3k into my M1 dividend portfolio for a total of $7k, then write a margin loan@2.5% and use that to pay off the higher interest debt. The next step was to write a new secured personal loan, deposit that into M1 giving me a NAV of $10k, and repeat the method with any other higher interest consumer debt.

My reasoning is that since both loans are ""secured"", I am able to use my own money as collateral while still employing said capital. Also the lower interest rate means that my dividends will be able to pay off the margin loan interest while I make weekly contributions to pay down the actual leverage used.

investing,My thoughts on current macroeconomic state,"So the Federal Reserve is going to hike rates to cool the economy and inflation. Inflation itself will tamp down demand, and so will the rate hikes. Housing prices are already inflated, add in some rate hikes, the demand for housing should drop some, or at least not go up anymore. 

Unemployment numbers suggests a strong economy right now. So the rate hikes should not cause too much issue. At most mild recession.

I am thinking of 2 scenarios regarding the stock market:

1) rate hikes till neutral (2%) or slightly above neutral (2.5-3%) and inflation gets controlled. Inflation and rate hikes are milder than believed. Stock market stabilizes and rebounds from current level and the doomsday scenario that some are parroting here, doesn't occur. 

2) rate hikes way higher than neutral because inflation hard to control, PE compresses, stock market crashes. Inflation then gets under control and US economy enters severe recession. The Fed starts to lower rates again, PE expands again, those companies that survived the recession would see their stock price go back again.

I think in either scenario the stock market will do fine over the medium term, whether its 2 or 5 years, and well in the longer term. If someone wants to invest today instead of waiting until the picture on rate hike and inflation clears up, they should not use margin at all and they should not use options, unless the stock market does crash and the price of good companies becomes absurdly good. But they must be absurdly good that only then do leveraging thru margin or options becomes far less risky and far more rewarding. 

Otherwise, simply having cash invested will allow you to take advantage of scenario 1 if things aren't as bad as thought, or ride out scenario 2. Having 100% cash will allow you to take advantage of scenario 2 but you may miss out on a good portion of scenario 1.",finance,1650746467.0

CryptoCurrency,Government Money,"I'm authoring a financial literacy mini-course for young people, including content about Blockchain and DLT.  I have no doubt that today's 7th graders will need to understand Bitcoin like kids of the 80's had to learn about computers - or else risk social and economic disadvantage.  I feel a great sense of responsibility to impart important foundational financial facts.  

That means I have to step through how central banks work.  I've dusted off some basic texts I haven't looked at in a long time that explain how the Fed uses Open Market Operations to increase or decrease bank reserves which in turn impacts the Federal Funds rate and in turn the supply of money.  I can explain all this in terms a 7th grader can grasp, and I can test the material until that is a certainty.

In this process, what I cannot resolve for myself is why some Bitcoiners seem so anti-Fed.  We can have DLT-based currencies that fix the problems of the fiat world.  We can talk about the advantages of bank disintermediation.  We can demonize the governments of the world for funding wars.  However, the mission of the Fed is to stabilize prices and maximize employment.  That doesn't sound so bad, and it has me wondering what entity would carry on that mission in a Bitcoin or DLT-only world.

I love Bitcoin.  I see profound benefits of financial self-custodianship.  But what crypto project or DAO is going to pay for a bridge, or a hospital?  I'm asking this question, not to be confrontational, but because I really don't understand myself.  What would fund a US Treasury, and common purposes like roads, Social Security and Medicaid if Bitcoin was legal tender?  

We all know what got us Bitcoin in the first place was, in some measure, the decline in confidence after the government failed to protect Americans from multiple simultaneous financial forest fires in the 2000's.  It's still burning, as the money supply has been inflated to dangerous levels as a coping mechanism that isn't working any longer.  However, for all of the things that Bitcoin in particular does better than fiat money, like fixing the supply at 21 million units, who know what would happen in a DLT-only economy.  

What if there's a flood?  We would still need a government to send help.  Would people pay taxes in the form of Bitcoin?  If they did, would government policy be limited to paying its bills?  I know many who will answer that ""yes"" and ""that's all it should ever do"".   However, with no central bank, how would code enforce a policy like ""max\_unemployment = 0.04 x working\_age\_population""?   It's mind boggling to consider all this.

7th graders grasp blockchain, quickly.  Should I hit down the middle, explaining that central banks aren't going away, and this separate DLT-crypto-based monetary system is going to run parallel?  They're getting their information from YouTube and TikTok, and they're exposed to Bitcoin maxis who would have them believe central banks are obsolete.

I am coming up on my 2 year work anniversary and want to start taking my finances more seriously. Here is my current budget and investment plan. Any advice or suggestions on how to improve it are appreciated!

24, 90k salary in the Midwest working as an engineer

I get a paycheck bi-weekly of $3435 so 10 months of the year I get two paychecks and the other two months I get three paychecks which has made budgeting slightly harder. My budget is based on only getting 2 paychecks a month and I will use the triple paycheck months to build up my emergency fund.

From that $3435 paycheck:

$933 Taxes (27.2%)

$343 to Roth 401k (I contribute 10% and my employer contributes 12.5% on top of that)

$343 to ESPP (Stock purchased every 6 months at 15% discount and also has a lookback provision)

$1809 Take home pay

&amp;#x200B;

**Budget:**

Rent: $1250

Utilities: \~$150

Car Payment: $228 

Car Insurance: $110

Groceries/Food: $400

Gas: \~$150

Phone: $50

Gym: $50

Dental work: $120 

Fun: $350

Other: $250

Emergency Fund: $500

&amp;#x200B;

Total Monthly Expenses: \~$3608

Monthly Income (2 paychecks): $3618

&amp;#x200B;

**Savings/Investments:**

$4.5k Cash

$27.6k 401k

$5.2k Roth IRA

$1.9k HSA

$2.1k Company Stock 

I should have sold the stock but the price has dipped below what I paid so I will hold onto it for now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Debt:**

\-$10.2k Car loan (Purchased used, 4.19% interest with 50 months left)

\-$2.5k Dental work (0% interest, $2500 remaining over 20 months)

I do not plan on paying either of these off early as the interest rates are low.

&amp;#x200B;

My number one priority is building up my emergency fund to $10k. I will be selling all of the company stock I get every 6 months to capture the 15% gain and then reinvest it so I am more diversified. My next stock purchase is in a couple months and I will use that cash to get my emergency fund up to $10k. All future stock purchases will be used to max out my ROTH IRA and whatever is left over will be put in low cost index funds.

Based on all my reading in this sub I think this is a pretty good plan but just want to make sure I am not missing anything. My main concerns with my plan are:

ROTH 401k over traditional?

Is selling my company stock immediately for 15% gain and then reinvesting the right move?

Continue making minimum car payment since the interest is relatively low?

I owe around \~72k in taxes this year. 55k federal, 17k state. Mostly because I sold a lot of my assets to put a down payment on a house last year. Also, had a side gig where I was paid as a 1099. I have made a couple payments and have applied for an extension.

I would prefer to pay off the owed amount rather than do long term repayment plans. Obviously I don't have that much cash saved up, as I should have. A learning experience.

The options that I see as viable:

1. Sell investments to pay the tax owed. I hate this idea because these assets are my nest egg. And I feel I would be in the same position next year paying the taxes on this sale.
2. Get a HELOC. My current house is valued about 150k above what I owe on it now. Ive never done this before, this is my first house. Are interest rates typically lower with this option? Do they offer it to home buyers before the end of their first year? My credit score is around 720.
3. Borrow against my investments or assets. Looking at Nexo, or Celcius. Most of my assets are c r y p t o related, and stocks. They have loans around 6.9%-12.9% depending on certain factors. Still think this would be better than paying 15-20% in taxes. I don't want to sell these assets, or lose them to value change during the loan.
4. Make a tax payment plan from the government. I would like to pay off my state taxes in full first but federal, possibly get a payment plan. They seem to be around 6% with interest accrued on balance not paid by 4/15.

it would make more sense to wait 1 year and 3 months to make full advantage of the 9.62 rate so then it would be 8.37/1.25 = **6.7%** APY if you wait 1 year and 3 months

 you could hold for the full 5 years there's no way of knowing if rates stay this high. I think the best case scenario is the second one and if rates are still high a year down the road you don't need to redeem in 1 year and 3 months and can hold for 1 year and 9 more months.. if rates still high then you could hold for 2 years and 3 month etc etc.

solar,Questions about Net Metering and also Financin,"Friends,

We are considering solar for our home in Castle Rock, CO. We have great sun exposure (though SW facing so the panels will be on the front which makes the misses a little miffed) but also it's a fairly large home (over 4500 sqft including basement) and one electric car and our kWh usage for the last 12 months is average 1730, mean 1572, and totaled 22,487. My peak month was 2523 kWh and my low month was 1482 kWh.

With a target of at or near 100% that gets me at a 14 kW system.

Our power provider Core (Formerly IREA) has a cap at 10 kW for net metering and for over 10k offer credits at a reduced payback. This has even prompted one solar company to propose a smaller system to stay under 10 kw, which seems like it would not really ""solve"" our energy desires (run off the sun, do not pay power company except to maintain connection). I'm not sure how the credits work though - if I have a large month and have to pull from the grid then do I have to pay Core for that power or will I have some sort of buffer there from a lower month?

Here's the excerpt from their site:

&gt;Net metering is available to residential members installing a system that is 10 kilowatts (AC) or less, and from which proposed annual solar production does not exceed 200% of the member’s 12-month usage. If the system exceeds 10 kilowatts, it will not be net-metered, consistent with state law. A solar-generating member with a system exceeding 10 kilowatts may still receive a monthly credit for any kilowatt-hours their system delivers to CORE at our avoided cost, which currently is 4.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Our avoided cost is recalculated annually; the amount credited will be adjusted consistently with changes to the avoided cost. 

I'm paying about $0.114 per kWh, plus demand charges. (and $0.132 when you include the fees and taxes). So if I understand correctly - without net metering then I'm out a possible $0.07/kWh of ""income"" which means that I need to overproduce substantially in order to not pay the power company for energy. That is if I'm correctly interpreting the 11.4 cents vs 4.4 cents.

So my questions, if your willing to lend me your expertise:

ELI5 the net metering vs. credits. What am I losing out on there? Is it ""worth it"" to go over the 10 kW?

Some solar companies seem to try and sweep a lot of details under the rug and just offer a package deal that after reinvesting tax credits (and a re-fi of the loan at that time) keep the monthly payment at or just barely below your average current spend on power. Most of the others just offer links to credit unions that offer solar loans (Colorado has some special deal though tbh doesn't feel that special). In your experience what is the most common and prudent way to pay for solar? This seems like one of those things that makes sense to finance since its easy to offset much or all of that cost with the savings. But are the solar loans really a good deal? the interest rates seem kinda high. Why not do a HELOC since it's tied to the house anyway? Also, HELOC interest is tax deductible, but I do not think that's the same for the solar loans. In your experience what's the best method, and what's the most common method? Also, is there a method you would outright advice against?

More on financing, what is really the best term length to target? Obviously the lower the better for interest rates and overall cost of the loan, but what happens if you have to sell the house before you reach break-even? In theory the solar will increase the value of the home but not sure it's 1:1. If our break-even on a solar is 11 years and I sell the house in 6, but I've kept the payment low enough to be close to my average energy spend prior to solar then I haven't really lost anything. That same plan, if I do keep the house for 20+ years, is way more expensive in total.  However, if I get a shorter note, and spend way more per month, then that makes us ""locked in"" to this house and if for some reason I must move before the break-even then I've lost money. Am I thinking this out right?

I apologize for the length and sincerely appreciate any advice you can give!",energy,1650812894.0

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Guide: Go from ""who cares"" to ""the world needs this""","Thought I'd post this here to give people an overview of my experience (maybe this will help others) of how I went from:

1) Ignoring Bitcoin and not understanding it, to:  
2) Rushing to buy some because price keeps going up, to:  
3) Understanding it, appreciating it and continuing to allocate the remainder of my paycheck to it instead of a regular savings account.

Long story short, or more accurately, slightly less long, I heard about Bitcoin around 2013, but never thought anything of it, mainly because I didn't know what money was. Yes I worked, got paid, saved some of it and spent the rest, but I never really thought about what this paper cash or digital number in my bank account was. So, I would say, understanding what money really is, is crucial.

Fast forward to late 2017 and 2018 when Bitcoin's price was crashing all the way from $20,000 down to $3,500, like most people I assume, I was saying to myself things like ""good thing I did not buy any"" or ""it's definitely going to 0, it has no value and it's a pyramid scheme""... again, mainly because I didn't understand anything about money.

Fast forward to early 2021, when Bitcoin reached $65,000, I was so frustrated that I'm missing out on all the gains, when Bitcoin started going back down in price, I thought to myself, this is a good opportunity for me to get in, and I started buying around $42,000. But I was only buying because of FOMO.

But, things quickly started to change, when I joined r/Bitcoin because I wanted to see what other people thought about Bitcoin, and I thought ""well, I invest in index funds, because I understand the basics of investing in the stock market, but now that I'm putting money into Bitcoin, it's probably best to understand the basics of it as well"". In the process, I got to read ""The Bitcoin Standard"" book by Saifedean Ammous. This was crucial. I now understood a little bit about the history of money, what money is, the difference between hard money and easy money, the problems of our current fiat systems and the federal reserve, and why Bitcoin is the solution to the problem. This gets me to start buying Bitcoin with every paycheck, not because of FOMO, but because I understand WHY I'm buying Bitcoin.

Next, the research continues, I'm reading more and more about Bitcoin, watching YouTube videos, and I find [https://learnmeabitcoin.com](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/) and what a wonderful source of information on how Bitcoin actually works. Now I'm starting to really get it. A lot of things are starting to click. I believe understanding how it works is critical (in my humble opinion at least), because I didn't think it was enough to just understand WHY I'm buying it, I also needed to understand the basics of how it works.

Great, now I understand why I buy Bitcoin, how it works, but one question remained: why not buy any of the other coins that have a lot of hype? why Proof of Work and not Proof of Stake? This was a tough one but this article by Lyn Alden helped tremendously [https://www.lynalden.com/ethereum-analysis](https://www.lynalden.com/ethereum-analysis/) and I was now fully convinced that I'm only interested in Bitcoin and no altcoins.

Finally, I stumbled upon the Robert Breedlove/Michael Saylor 9 part series on the ""What is money"" podcast, about 10 hours or so, but I thought it was absolutely valuable as it helped me understand the significance of the Bitcoin invention.

So to put this all together:  
1) Read ""The Bitcoin Standard"" book by Saifedean Ammous  
2) Read about how Bitcoin works at [https://learnmeabitcoin.com](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/)  
3) Read about what separates Bitcoin/Proof of Work from altcoins/Proof of Stake at [https://www.lynalden.com/ethereum-analysis](https://www.lynalden.com/ethereum-analysis/)  
4) Understand the significance of the Bitcoin invention by listening to the Robert Breedlove/Michael Saylor series on the ""What is money"" podcast  
5) Don't stop learning

stocks,Don't Be Fooled. This Environment has no Historical Precedent,"This is a response to a multitude of posts I've seen attempting to waive away the current Fed path as no big deal. This is not a doom post. The economy is unlikely to face a major recession any time soon. The pain in stocks on the other hand, is almost certain to continue for a while and may be pretty bad before it's all over. Not all rate hike cycles are the same. The total increase in rates matters, the speed of hikes matter, what is happening in the broader economy matters. But many of these posts leave all of that context out. A lot of you I think are relying on misleading, overly simplistic, devoid of context arguments to inform your thinking and it will probably result in losing money.  

Many people on this board seem to have little knowledge of markets before 2020. Hopefully this provides some education, and convinces you to proceed with caution. The last three years (yes, I'm intentionally including 2019, pre-pandemic) are highly abnormal and almost certainly will not continue. So if your frame of reference for what's normal is the last three years, read on, and seriously consider reducing your risk exposure.

You've probably seen a number of posts like this, implying monetary tightening is no big deal and you should just shrug it off:

*Market returns during Fed rate hike cycles:*

*Aug 1954 - Oct 1957: 14%*  
*Jun 1958 - Nov 1959: 24%*  
*Aug 1961 - Nov 1966: 7%*  
*Aug 1967 - Aug 1969: 4%*  
*Mar 1972 - Jul 1974: -9%*  
*Feb 1977 - Jun 1981: 11%*  
*Mar 1983 - Aug 1984: 13%*  
*Jan 1987 - May 1989: 16%*  
*Feb 1994 - Feb 1995: 4%*  
*Jun 1999 - May 2000: 10%*  
*Jun 2004 - Jun 2006: 8%*  
*Dec 2015 - Dec 2018: 8%* 

The implication is that what the Fed does is no big deal, and a lot of people seem to believe that. Or more likely, nervously convince themselves it's true, because they want it to be. 

**TLDR:** 

1. Monetary tightening is bad for stocks. This is indisputably true. That doesn't necessarily mean stocks will decline during monetary tightening. If they rise, it will be less than they would if monetary policy were eased. Stocks often decline soon after a rate hike cycle or at some point during the cycle, but the numbers above don't show you that. Conveniently.
2. Quantitative easing has completely changed the picture. Pre-QE references are not comparable. The combination of high inflation, QT and rapidly rising rates happening simultaneously has no historical comparison. And it is likely to cause a significant bear market.
3. Don't fight the Fed.

**Why is this different than other rate hike cycles?**

QT and rate hikes have only occurred once, at a much smaller scale than what we're facing now, and it caused a bear market. During any of the previous rate hike cycles, QE/QT did not exist.

Shrugging off the current path of  the Fed is I think going to result in a lot of pain for anyone who tries to do it. Arguments like the above ignore an awful lot of context. Such as: 

* Many of these rate hike cycles did in fact cause bear markets. Just not immediately. Bear markets did occur during the rate hike cycles or soon after. Some of them were quite painful.
* What was happening with the economy? Generally the Fed has, and should, raise rates at the start of economic expansion, and lower rates as growth slows or contracts. That is the path many previous rate hike cycles followed. Is that where we are now? No it isn't. The Fed is tightening as growth has peaked and is about to slow. Facing headwinds from inflation and supply disruptions. The economy, and stock markets, are better able to withstand tightening when an expansion phase is ramping up than when peaked and is facing many headwinds to growth.
* Quantitative tightening is a much bigger bomb than the Fed funds rate. QT is almost entirely unstudied because it has not happened on a meaningful scale. **The only example of QT we have, caused a bear market that did not reverse until the Fed reversed.**
* Stock valuations by any measure are extreme by historical standards. Previous monetary tightening cycles generally began with more historically normal valuations.

Stocks valuations are in bubble territory by historical valuation metrics. This isn't disputable, so if you're thinking of trying, don't. You might have convinced yourself that something is different now and the new, much higher than historical valuations are justified for reasons. It's possible you're right, but probably not. High valuations can generally only be supported by low interest rates and QE. Both of these are ending. 

Valuation using CAPE, we are at a multi decade high, only the dot com bubble has exceeded current valuations. Even during the roaring 20s, which preceded the great depression, valuations did not reach the levels they are at now.

Valuation by S&amp;P 500 P/E, we were in the mid 20s at the start of the year. Which is higher than nearly any point in history, other than dot com. Estimated now at around 21 thanks to this little correction. Which is still very high by historical standards. S&amp;P 500 P/E over 20 has never been sustained for long outside of bubbles or when propelled by QE.

Most Fed tightening cycles did include significant periods of pain in stock markets. Or were followed soon after. Though the no big dealers present it in a way that you don't see that. 

Right now, we have a stock market bubble, an over heated economy, high inflation, and an aggressively tightening Fed. This combination of factors has no precedent in post-WW2 US history.

**Extreme Valuation Peaks:**

*Roaring 20s - September 1929*

CAPE: 32.56

S&amp;P 500 P/E: 20.17

*Dot Com - Mid 2020*

CAPE: 42.87

S&amp;P 500 P/E: 28.50

*November 2021*

CAPE: 38.58

S&amp;P 500 P/E: 24.5

The previous two peaks were followed by massive losses in stocks that did not recover for more than a decade.

**Rate hikes plus QT**

Bulls are dramatically underestimating the impact of simultaneous rate hikes and QT, at a time the economy has already peaked and growth is going to slow. There is no historical precedent for this.

QE first happened in the US in 2009. QE continued through November 2017. At that point the Fed began a slow QT process. The Fed had previously begun raising rates in 2015. This was a slow rate hike cycle at a rate of about 25bp every 3-6 months. In November 2017, the Fed announce QT. This started fairly slow, and progressed to a moderate pace. All told, QT lasted from November 2017 to August 2019. The Fed balance sheet contracted from 4.45 trillion to 3.76 trillion. A rate of about 31 billion a month.

The combination of rising rates and QT caused a bear market in the fall of 2018. It ended when the Fed pledged to stop raising rates in December 2018. Then, even though the economy was fine, the Fed started cutting rates in 2019 and resumed QE. The resumption of QE astonished many analysts. The Fed in fact didn't call it QE, though it clearly was. So what was this? This was the Fed put. Stock and bond markets ballooned in 2019, the beginning of the Fed induced acceleration of one of the largest asset bubbles in US history. All because of printed money from the Fed, at a time it was not needed to support the economy. It's important to note, risk assets were not exactly cheap by historical measures before 2019.

**Where are we now**

Let's compare now to 2018, the only other time QT has happened, alongside rate hikes. 

From 2015-2018, the Fed hiked rates around 25bp a quarter. Today, we're looking at 50bp a month, for probably 3 months, followed by 25bp a month. A rate of increase around 5 times faster than 2015-2018. 

From November 2017 through August 2019, the Fed reduced its balance sheet by an average of 31 billion a month. Today, we're looking at 95 billion a month. A rate 3 times faster.

A bear market began in September 2018 in response to QT and rising rates. The bear market of 2018 did not stop until the Fed stopped raising rates. QT ended soon after, and was followed by more QE. What happened? In 2018, inflation was not a problem. So the Fed Put was able to kick in. The Fed came to the rescue of the stock and bond markets. Can this happen now? No, not any time soon. The Fed has to fight inflation. There will be no Fed put to save stocks this time, not soon anyway.

Valuations were less extreme at the start of the 2018 bear market.

*September 2018*

CAPE: 32.62

S&amp;P 500 P/E: 22.52

*November 2021*

S&amp;P 500 P/E: 24.52

**Previous Rate Hike Cycles:**

You don't really need to continue reading if you don't want to. But important context is provided for each rate hike cycle. Most of these were not exactly raging bull markets, and in many ways were not remotely comparable to where we are now.

Aug 1954 - Oct 1957: 14%

* The US exited a recession in May 1954. 
* The Fed raised rates into an economic expansion from around 1.5% to 3% over the course of about a year and a half. Briefly touching 3.5%, upon which a recession immediately followed. 
* Bear market from 1956 to 1957
* CAPE and S&amp;P 500 P/E in the mid teens

Jun 1958 - Nov 1959: 24%

* The US exited a recession in April 1958. 
* The Fed raised rates into an economic expansion from around 1.5% to 4% over the course of about a year. A recession followed in April 1960.
* Stocks dropped from 1959 to 1960 but did not officially enter a bear market
* CAPE and S&amp;P 500 P/E in the mid teens

Aug 1961 - Nov 1966: 7%

* The US exited a recession in January 1961. 
* The Fed raised rates into an economic expansion to 6% over about 4 years. Worth noting this coincided with one of the longest and strongest US economic expansions. It included the Vietnam war and expansive fiscal policy.
* Bear markets in '61 and '66
* CAPE and S&amp;P 500 P/E in the high teens to low 20s

The inflation era from the late 60s to early 80s. I'm going to talk about this qualitatively  because looking at the numbers above is meaningless. You might look at the numbers above and think, oh look, 1977-1981, those were pretty good years in the market. No, it absolutely wasn't. Inflation outpaced market gains. 

On an inflation adjusted basis, the S&amp;P 500 was in nearly a 15 year bear market from 1968-1982. On an inflation adjusted basis, the market declined 65% over 15 years. This does not account for dividends. It was absolutely brutal. P/E on the S&amp;P 500 declined deep into single digits. Yes, that's right, for all you who think a P/E of 20 is cheap, single digits. I believe it bottomed around 6-7. CAPE also declined into the single digits. Why? Stagflation. Interestingly, now is the first time since then that any serious person is seriously suggesting we may enter a period of stagflation.

Mar 1983 - Aug 1984: 13%

* The US exited a brutal recession in December 1982. The recession was caused by, you guessed it, The Volcker Fed fighting inflation. Sound familiar? As a reminder (see above) stock valuations were at rock bottom before this rate hike cycle due to a brutal recession. In March 1983, when this rate hike cycle began, P/E was 12.23. A year earlier, it was 7.5. CAPE was at 9.23, a year earlier it was 6.95. This doesn't sound much like where we are today does it?
* The Fed raised rates into an economic expansion
* Remember, stocks were exiting a period where P/E had been driven down to single digits. By the end of 1984, S&amp;P 500 P/E and CAPE had risen to 10. When valuations are low enough, stocks can rise even in the face of rising rates. But we don't have low valuations now do we?

Jan 1987 - May 1989: 16%

* This period included Black Monday
* The phrase Greenspan put is born (which would later become the Fed put) following Black Monday. In other words, calling this a rate hike cycle leaves out important context. There was an enormous market crash, and the Fed responded immediately by cutting rates. Only raising rates again once the market had stabilized. Without the Fed put when the market crashed, this period would likely not have been so great.
* CAPE low 20s. S&amp;P 500 P/E had risen to low 20s before Black Monday, collapsing to low double digits.

Feb 1994 - Feb 1995: 4%

* The Fed raised rates from about 3% to about 6%
* Stocks went pretty much nowhere. Declining overall on an inflation adjusted basis. There were a couple of significant corrections in this period. At no point was there a rally above the 1994 highs until the fed stopped raising rates.
* CAPE low 20s, S&amp;P 500 P/E declines from low 20s to mid teens

Jun 1999 - May 2000: 10%

* Fed raises rates from around 4.5% to around  6.5%
* It's hilarious to suggest stocks did fine here, as the Fed rate hikes, among other events, popped the dot com bubble. Which was one of the most brutal multi year periods in market history. Stocks would not recover to the 2000 highs for almost 15 years.

Jun 2004 - Jun 2006: 8%

* Another bubble is forming, this time in housing and synthetic mortgage securities. These Fed rate hikes are one reason for that bubble popping, which caused a 60% draw down in the S&amp;P 500.

Dec 2015 - Dec 2018: 8%

* We are now in a QE world
* As a result of slow rate hikes and modest QT beginning in late 2017, a bear market forms in the fall of 2018.
* The bear market stops only when the Fed reverses course. Cuts rates and resumes QE.",finance,1650829704.0

personalfinance,Paying yearly taxes on I-bonds,"I think it may be wise to pay yearly taxes on I-bonds. My wife and I have purchased them with the intent of selling them in a maximum of 3-5 years to pay for building a house. Our income is modestly below the 12% / 22% cuttoff.

My thinking is that, if I pay the interest every year, we will still be in the 12% income tax bracket. If I wait until the end, we may be in the 22% bracket. Therefore, it makes sense to pay the interest every year.

I have an extension for federal taxes, but would like to figure this out ASAP.

The ""issue date"" for the first I-bond we purchased was 10-01-2021. I am having trouble finding out how I would see within Treasury Direct how much tax is owed. I think there may not be any for 2021, but I'd like to see how to find out for sure. Not sure if I need to report this ""0"" for the first year.

This isn't my actual circumstance, just always wondered about it. I don't have a mortgage.

My question is why would it not be fixed for the life of the loan. I borrowed the money at 2% in 2022, I'm not borrowing anymore why does the interest rate of the day (e.g. 2027) affect my interest rate on my loan from years ago (2022).",finance,1650844340.0

They, also have increased and will increase the rates to borrow and essentially make it costly to borrow.

personalfinance,Do not use Acima Leasing,"Do not use Acima leasing. Im a NYC lawyer so i am usually pretty careful about terms and conditions, but i even fell for Acima's scam. 

Facts: I have 13 inch macbook air 2020 intel. The keyboard has some wear on it and the battery has deteriorated. I work from home a few days a week and could use a larger screen. I went to a tech store near my house and saw the 16 inch macbook pro 2021 M1 Pro. I fell in love. The price was roughly $2500. 

I mentioned how perfect the computer is but that it would be tough to pay the 2500 in one shot. Tech store rep introduced me to Acima rep. Acima rep told me that his company can lease me the laptop and that if i pay it in 90 days that id get it without interest. I asked if there was a longer amount of time i can pay it off, he said if i pay it off in a year but not within 90 days, that id have a small amount of interest added. I asked about a early purchase, he said they offer early purchase of 65% of the device price minus what i paid. I was skeptical but i wanted the laptop. They had me sign a form and the form did not include the lease. The form referenced a $6,400 amount. I asked the rep. he said that would be the price if i dont pay it in a year. I said okay, ill pay it off in the next few months and do the early purchase option maybe in August and ill be good. so i signed. I got my laptop. the total cost was roughly $2900 w/ apple care. I went home, opened the box, signed into my apple ID and proceeded to use the laptop. I was having an absolute blast, i was listening to music, looking at old photos, scrolling the web, reviewing work docs. It was amazing. However, iI realized I didnt have the lease nor would the app display the lease. So i called Acima. The Acima rep was very nice and professional. He explained to me my lease. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the lease terms summarized. 

1. If i pay the $2900 in 90 days, i get the laptop, and only have to pay a $45 fee. So 2900 + 45 and i get the laptop.
2. If i dont pay it off in 90 days, then i am on the hook for the $6400 price, and this price doubles every year. If i took this route, i would pay $126.00 per week for a year. 
3. If i wanted the early purchase, it would be 65% of the 6400 -- not the 2900. It would be 65% of the 6400 minus whatever i paid. 
4. Effectively, if i didnt pay it off within 90 days my price doubled. 
5. I then received a copy of my lease agreement, which confirmed everything he said. 
6. I then reviewed the lease agreement and saw there is an early termination clause. The early termination clause allows the lessee ( me) to cancel the agreement at any time by returning the property to Acima. The only condition being that i pay any delinquent payments and that i would not be refunded any payments. At this time, my first payment is due next week so i am fine. 

So i then went back to the tech store and gave the Acima rep  the laptop back and asked for the contract to be voided. However, i have to call tomorrow ( Monday) to have the cancellation processed since Acima costumer service is closed on Sunday. I confirmed this info myself. the rep i spoke to on the phone was in the lease processing unit and not customer service. It is interesting that they have more staff who work more hours on more days of the week to process their leases than they do to cancel their leases. 

I have used plans like this before. I used progressive leasing and affirm. I genuinely like their services and think they can help people get products they cant afford in one payment. for example, i got a king sized bed and a really nice living room chair for my  through progressive leasing. I usually do Christmas shopping through affirm, and never had a problem. However, neither affirm nor progressive have the insane interest rates that Acima applies and they both allow you to pay off the merchandise for longer periods of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Only use Acima to purchase something you know for a fact you can pay off in 3 months. I knew i couldn't pay my 2900 bill off in three months, and hoped the 12 month lease to own was reasonable, and i was wrong. 

I will update this tomorrow when i hear back from Acima as to whether they will cancel the lease and let me off the hook. I know i messed up by signing the lease without reading it and i know i was stupid for agreeing to buy something i couldn't afford. I am only posting this because I didn't see many reddit posts about Acima.",finance,1650845861.0
personalfinance,Mortgage or Cash Offer Using All My Savings?,"Just trying to weigh the pros and cons.  There is a property that I may be putting in offer in soon and debating about whether or not to do a cash offer and liquidate most of my taxable investing account or just put 20% down and do a mortgage.  


I think I could beat the 5.5% interest rate that the mortgage would have by continuing to trade; but there is obviously something very alluring to the idea of actually owning the property and not having a mortgage.  I think a cash offer could also help my offer get selected as there is a lot of interest in this house.  


The house is a short sale and needs about $15-$25k in additional work to get up to livable condition.  This would essentially wipe out most of my non retirement savings.  (My retirement savings is in a golden position and my job is very secure)

solar,A few questions for y’all,"I originally made a post about a week ago regarding a decision whether or not to go with solar. I was met with a ton of responses and learned a great deal. 

I decided to get a second opinion from sun power for a 5.1kw system with an estimated output 7.98k/yr for 32.5k.

I honestly was very impressed by this company and learned quite a lot. However, there’s some things I did not get a clear answer to and would appreciate the Reddit knowledge within solar.

1) Unfortunately I was made aware that net metering with entergy in Texas is not 1:1 but rather $0.14 to 0.03. The system I would ultimately get would not include a battery so any excess produced would unfortunately be sold at ~20% the purchase (gross). The representative at sun power explained to me that the energy harvested during the day would be preferentially used to power the house during that time and if you use more than your produce, electricity simultaneously is fed in through the grid and you are charged and if less is used, the excess is sold back. This contradicts my previous explanation from the other company that all energy used is being paid from the grid and the energy you produce during that time is then later credited. This would yield drastically different price points because the latter would result in all your energy essentially being devalued 80% if you aren’t able to use any.

2) Follow from 1). If energy usage is preferentially harvested and immediately used, why would your house be unable to function if the grid goes down?

3) I pulled power usage throughout the day and see more usage at night. What % energy offset should I aim for if at most I’ll get full value for my energy for only half the day

4) I have the option of placing the panels in a slightly suboptimal position (~20% less energy production) but directly on top of the hottest part of the house on the second story. Would a ~5 degree drop in that room justify ~20% decrease production especially given inevitable miss matched excess production of energy and resultant selling for cheap regardless.

5) Everyone I get a quote from always puts the 26% tax deduction as a marketing tool to deceptively present a lower financial cost. I feel this is being milked and used more to subsidize these companies rather than reward the consumer. Does anyone know actual average price before all this rebate business?

personalfinance,Paying for Law School best financial advice?,"I'm currently planning to attend law school in the fall and I'm  deciding between  different universities: UC Hastings (free tuition), UC Davis (cheap tuition), and Columbia(expensive). I was recently offered a substantial scholarship from Columbia Law School which makes it an attractive option.

I will have about 60k saved up before attending law school in the fall, but realistically lets just say I will have 50k at graduation (assuming I spend about 10k on none essentials over three years). Most students at Columbia Law School work public interest their first summer (about 10k in wages) and Big Law Summer associate the second summer (40k in wages) so after taxes  I will earn about 40k while in school. That means I should have about 90k saved upon graduation and as long as I'm not at the bottom of my class at Columbia I should be able to get a big law job starting at 215k a year.

If I was to attend Columbia the estimated COA would be $153,300 (excluding interest). In order to finance this, I would have to borrow Stafford unsubsidized loan each year for three years ($20,500 at 5.28% interest rate for the 2022-2023 year and a 1.05% origination fee) and grad plus loans (at 6.28% interest rate for the 2022-2023 year at an 4.228% origination fee). The break down for borrowing would be as followed:

&amp;#x200B;

Year 1: $46,100 ($20,500 in Stafford loans and  $25,589 in Grad Plus loans)

Year 2: $46,100 ($20,500 in Stafford loans and $25,589 in Grad Plus loans)

Year 3: $61,100 ($20,500 in Stafford loans and $40,589 in Grad Plus loans)

Total Principal: $153,300 (excluding origination fees and interest)

My two major questions are this:

1. What is my true cost of attendance with the origination fee and interest accrued upon graduation May 2025?
2. What would be my COA be, if instead of borrowing grad plus loans I paid in cash for the first two year? (26k a year for 52k in total). How much would I save in interest?

personalfinance,Plan on asking my aunt for a personal loan. Any advice on how to approach this?,"First off - Asking family for money is a terrible idea, I get it. It's a shitty position to be in for both parties.  So with that out of the way..

I made some bad decisions a couple years ago when I was in school. I was making $300-$400 a week trying to support a family of 3 living in a HCOL area.  I was too prideful to ask family for money then so I too out some personal loans and ran up credit cards.

Fast forward to now - I make $90k, 10% bonuses, I paid down my credit cards, and paid off student loans, and now these personal loans are left and are KILLING ME in interest rates.  They total $24k and they range from 29% to 36% in interest.  I pay $1400/month just in loans and that plus high rent increase is hard to keep up with.

My aunt is extremely wealthy. What I'm asking for would be a drop in the bucket for her. On top of that - she has $90k plus 5 acres of land in her will that will be left to me when she passes (my dad left it to her to give to me when she passed? Weird I know.)

Also, she loaned me $2000 a few years ago which I paid her back within a month.

Anyways - I need relief from the loans and interest rates so that I can adequately start saving and building some type of wealth. So here is how I wanted to approach this.

I wanted to ask for her a loan of $24k at 6% interest rate for 48 months.  I would have autopay set up on a bi-weekly basis (when I get paid) to an account that she chooses.  We would have a legal document drawn up with these terms and any other conditions she sees fit put into it.

Obviously, I get that there is only risk involved for her and the only thing she has to go on is that I'm her family and she may trust me somewhat.   I'm never late on payments but I might start being if I can't get relief.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is shifting monetary tightening into a higher gear. His goal sounds straightforward—lift interest rates to “neutral,” a setting that neither spurs nor slows growth.

But there’s a catch: Even in normal times, no one knows where this theoretical level is. And these aren’t normal times. There are good reasons to think the ground beneath the central bank’s feet is shifting and that, after accounting for elevated inflation, neutral may be higher than officials’ recent estimates.

At their meeting next month, officials are set to approve plans to shrink their $9 trillion asset portfolio and to raise their benchmark rate by a half percentage point. They are poised to follow with another half-point in June.

“We’re going to be raising rates and getting expeditiously to levels that are more neutral, and then that are actually tightening policy if that turns out to be appropriate, once we get there,” Mr. Powell said during a panel discussion last week.

My point in posting this is specifically their ""Price Pressures"" chart depicting inflation.  It's a pretty significant spike.

You can see in that chart that from 1970-1982, when the Fed last had to fight significant inflation, there were more recessions in those twelve years than in the forty that followed, 1982-2022.  

A lot of people have noted that every cycle seems to involve the Fed allowing for easier and easier money, and this article puts it all together...the Fed could do this, indeed you can argue the Fed did the right thing doing this, because inflation was contained.  That is no longer the case.  This new state of affairs likely presages an aggressive rate hiking campaign that will not be like anything we've seen during the extended bull market of 1982-present day.

I've had prior posts about Fed policy removed, so I'll make this relevant to /r/stocks: 1) Easy money is over, 2) Don't fight the Fed.

Overall inflation is up 10 percent in a year — the largest increase since 2008 and the fastest rate of increase since 1982.

Today, prices for whatever from fuel to groceries are rising as the economy roars back from the pandemic economic crisis. This is raising issues in some quarters about whether the United States is headed back to the dreadful economic days of the 1970s. During the 1970s the nation was grasped by double-digit inflation that needed action by the Federal Reserve. The Biden administration firmly insists those issues of the 1970s when Americans sported campaign-style “whip inflation now” buttons on their broad lapels are long gone.

Joe Biden has already said he’s making raising taxes a top priority. His tax plans are directly aimed at your retirement investments. And if you DON’T want to see your retirement income potentially take a double-digit tax hit. . . You’ve got to move your money . . . Now . . . BEFORE he changes the laws.

Thanks to Biden, the U.S. is experiencing rapid price increases unlike almost anything in the last 39 years. That’s why it’s so important to to preserve your retirement wealth, especially if you’re over 60.

Are We Headed For ‘Double-Digit’ Inflation In 2022?

What is ‘Double-Digit’ inflation? An excellent description of “inflation” is a boost in prices and a fall in the worth of cash. Inflation is normally represented as a portion boost for one month over the very same month the previous year. Double-digit inflation is when this portion is greater than 10%. If inflation increases much more than 100% (i.e. Prices are two times s high as in 2015) it is generally called “hyper-inflation”. Don’t wait get the Biden Inflation Cure Report before it’s too late.

personalfinance,Marrying a doctor with medical school debt,"Hey Reddit, I (30m) am about to be marrying the love of my life (27f) soon and was wondering what the best approach to tackle medical school debt together would be.

Her med school and undergraduate loans total around $350k and there would be no debt in my name after we are married. We have no kids currently.

Her yearly income would be $~50k during residency in CA for 4 years and I make $~100k with my IT job with an annual increase of 4% a year.

So for the 4 years of residency, should we pay the maximum amount down on debt? Should we file our taxes jointly to save more money from tax incentives? Would filing taxes separately to have a low Income Based Repayment plan based on her residency income be a better strategy to invest extra income until post-residency when we would have higher total income? Which loan repayment plan would be best for these direct unsubsidized federal loans? Could these loans be forgiven? Wondering what some financial experts would recommend.

Finally, we would like to purchase a home sooner rather than later and will need help saving for a down payment which may be high in CA. I understand this school debt may have an impact on getting approved for a mortgage.

No HSA currently but will have opportunity next year at which point will also max.

Cant contribute to Roth directly and have substantial trad IRA rollover outside of current 401k so backdoor shut. Have very little (2%) of investment in Roth. My 401k doesnt allow additional after-tax contribution so no mega either.

This year only, putting 20k in ibonds as a short-term store for future large purchases or emergency. Not planning on putting in more and may pull out after 15 months.

Rest goes into brokerage in a 60-30-10 domestic stock/international stock/domestic bond 3-fund portfolio built on Vanguard index funds.

Am consideeing if it would make more sense to put 10% into additional payments on mortgage (3% APR) rather than the bond fund given I dont need income and interest rates likely to rise in the forseable future.

investing,Do I smell 2008? Can the housing market really be so hot?,"Hi All

Been reading some posts about housing in the US. I'm based in Europe and we are seeing ridiculous housing prices.

My house was just valued at a crazy amount and there seems to be nothing on the market.

I'm in Slovakia which is bordering Ukraine so there is also  an increased demand from Ukrainians who want to buy or rent l.

I've been contacting real estate agencies for both rent and for sale. The arrogance is unbelievable. When I call, they simply reply an SMS with the prices and ask if I want it without even viewing.

So, I took a look at bankruptcies in the EU and they are down!

Interest rates are at about 1 - 1.5% here at the moment but I've seen they are creeping up. I'm sure, when there is a 2 or 3 percent increase, people will start defaulting. 

We are thinking to sell our house and just rent for a few years because this feels like a bubble. We will keep watching the market and try to buy land, or maybe a mixed bag of properties. 

Now, I know we can't really predict the market but could anyone suggest some indicators I could check? How do you make decisions regarding real estate investments?

Edit: Just to be clear, when I say 2008, I mean just housing crashing part. I have quite a good understanding of the 2008 financial crash, and it is understood that the reason for the next crash is very unlikely to be for any of those reasons, I mean more in regards the outcome of such a crash - houses being sold a fire sale prices, defaults.etc.",finance,1650864904.0

I am currently employed and I’m relatively happy, making a decent salary for my previous zip code but recently moved to a higher COL. I happened upon a couple of job openings for some larger companies that would be amazing resume bumps. I had to apply. I did not expect an answer anytime soon but surprisingly got calls right away to start the interview process.  My experience seems to be a better fit than I initially thought.

Here’s where I think I f’ed up - I haven’t done this in a while and was caught off guard a bit by the immediate calls, so when they asked for a number I told them what I currently make.

investing,Recession and tech stocks,"All,

Considering ongoing macro economic and geo political issues, which tech stock would you actually buy or consider buying in next days?

Low cap + high growth stocks will be almost out of question. High interest rates and recession worries will put a strain on borrowing and high spend on customer acquisitions.

Mid - high cap on B2C side will suffer as well. This will put strain on companies like Apple since people would delay upgrading their devices. Companies such as AMD, qualcomm, intel with significant B2C exposure will also suffer. Netflix is already getting hammered.

Mid-high cap B2B. Relatively these companies should be in much better position. Companies are not going to stop using Microsoft products or discontinue the aws cloud or stop spending on Google advertisment. Sure, their growth rates will suffer but it's hard to think that their existing hold over market will be affected.

I'm thinking of readjusting my portfolio and would appreciate your inputs. Generally, I'm a fan of the tech sector from a long term perspective and would still invest in it at current conditions. I would still stick to active investing rather than ETFs since i assume accrual returns on ETFs would also be much lower.",finance,1650882971.0

2. Should I instead use that money to heavily fund this ""living expenses savings fund""?

investing,All about Leafly / $LFLY 😊,"*Note: This is incomplete and I'll try to continue to finish this throughout the week*. Hopefully we can have an in depth discussion about this company. 🤝  If anything, I hope this post can give some more information on the cannibis marketplace as well as potentially a stock to keep on the watchlist.

To start, I want to say that I am long this stock and am bullish, primarily because I think there are just way too many potential catalysts to not be bullish a marijuana ancillary stock, especially since the sector has been beaten down. I prefer to be in an ancillary stock as they are exposed to less legal risk and currently operate in a less competitive market than the producer/dispensary market. With that said, I am also fully aware that my timing may be off, given the upcoming recession and higher costs of raising capital. But I believe marijuana legalization will continue, and at the end of the day, I’d rather be in a stock I like than try to time the market.

**So let’s see what Leafly is all about**! 😊

# Quick Overview

Everything I talk about here will be expanded upon as we walk through the DD.

[Leafly](https://www.leafly.com/) basically is a cross between a wiki/media company and online marketplace for weed. It makes its money currently from two sources, **retailers and brands**. Retailers are basically dispensaries that list their store on the website (for a subscription fee) and hope local customers order from their store. Brands are basically companies that produce products related to weed, such as edibles, vapes, etc… Brands can list their products on the website as well (for a fee) and or pay for advertisements. Currently, Leafly does not make any money from ‘consumers’ which are people like you and I who go on the website to check out stuff and purchase products.

The marketplace aspect is like Amazon, Uber Eats, Doordash, etc… a business that most are very familiar with. The wiki/media website you can think of as a news website or social media platform. And so as you can imagine, given the current methods of revenue, site traffic is very important for Leafly.

# More About Leafly

Leafly has been around since 2010 (operating a similar business model as today) but has had somewhat of a bumpy ride until now. In 2019 and 2020, due to poor leadership and management, the firm downsized its workforce by 50% and the current CEO, Yoko Miyashita, who has a legal background, took over. However, this turned out to be the turning point for the company! Looking at the comments on Glassdoor, Blind, and Indeed, it is clear that poor management was the root cause of the turmoil, and that those dark periods are over. For example, here is a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedbiz/comments/ibtlnk/comment/g2s47fg/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on Reddit about Leafly from 2 years ago.

&gt;Leafly used to have some of the best, coolest, and most passionate people in the cannabis industry. Then they laid off anyone who voiced concerns over their atrocious mismanagement, refused to promote from within, hired a bunch of bumbling asshats to run the company into the ground. None of the execs ever knew anything about cannabis, let alone felt passion for legalization.Signed, a former passionate employee who once lived and breathed for that company. May they watch their empire crumble and burn.

And now this is what they are [saying](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Leafly-Reviews-E840667.htm?sort.sortType=RD&amp;sort.ascending=false&amp;filter.iso3Language=eng) on Glassdoor:

&gt;Tons of smart people here. I don't think I've ever been surrounded by as many talented people at one company before. Lots of autonomy in how to get the work done. Very little management blockage (if at all). Good work life balance - show up for your meetings and get your work done in the agreed amount of time and you can be on your own schedule for the most part. Really good at being remote - don't miss the office one bit It never gets old talking about weed (real topic - selling weed for cheaper)

After downsizing in 2020, Leafly grew headcount by 70% in 2021 and are still looking to hire engineers and sales people today.

Anyways, with Yoko at CEO (who’s passionate about weed), and once again with the desire to grow, in 2022, Leafly went [public](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220204005386/en/Leafly-and-Merida-Merger-Corp.-I-Announce-Closing-of-Business-Combination) via merger with a venture capital / private equity firm.   As for whether or not the VC is looking for easy money or will remain invested for the long haul remains to be seen, at least it gives me a bit more confidence in Leafly as an investment.

# Business

As mentioned before, Leafly basically functions as a media site and marketplace. On the media side of things, Leafly provides consumers with information about the latest strains and products, news, and reviews.

Leafly currently makes money from retailers and brands.

* Retailers are the licensed storefronts and delivery services that sell cannabis products to consumers. Example of retailer listing: [https://www.leafly.com/dispensary-info/the-re-up](https://www.leafly.com/dispensary-info/the-re-up).
* Brands are the licensed producers of cannabis products or accessories that are made available for sale to consumers. Example of brand listing: [https://www.leafly.com/brands/five/products/five-rosin-gummies-100-solventless-cbd-thc-hemp-extract-gummies](https://www.leafly.com/brands/five/products/five-rosin-gummies-100-solventless-cbd-thc-hemp-extract-gummies)

Currently, a large portion of the revenue is subscription based, which is something you'd love to hear. According to their recent 10K filing, Leafly had roughly 10,500 retail listings on our platform, of which over 5,000 were paid. Additionally, Leafly had 9,500 brand listings on our platform, which they are in the process monetizing. Leafly believes there are currently 18,000 brands in the market, meaning that over 50% of the brands in existence are using Leafly. Leafly also claims that, approximately 53% of legal retailers in North America are paying subscribers on the Leafly platform.

**In other words, Leafly has 50+% of all available brands and retailers using the platform**.

Leafly offers different tiers of subscrption services and also allow brands/retailers the opportunity to purchase advertising add-ons, which would be things like advertisements and premium positioning on the website.

Currently, Leafly's ARPA (average revenue per account) is around $636. The recently lowered some subscription fees to try to increase the number of retailers using the platform and increase market penetration, which makes sense for a growing company.

**International Expansion**: Leafly’s content is available internationally, but the company does not have plans right now to expand outside of the United States and Canada. Other countries that have decriminalized medical marijuana include Germany, Australia, Mexico, and Jamaica.

Strategic Initiatives

Some of their 2022 goals include:

* Hiring more engineers and sales people - this is one of their biggest impediment to growing right now.
* Improving the bidding feature - basically allows retailers to easily bid for premium ad placement
* Offer more features like menu merchandising (sponsored ads on retailer menus), delivery gateway
* Consumer Personalization - basically recommend better products to consumers and offer a more personalized experience on the website
* Making additional improvements to POS integrations to automate menus
* Provide retailers with more and better data
* Create a loyalty program for customers.

# Valuation

For the full year 2022, we are revising our revenue projections to between $53 million and $58 million representing 29% growth over 2021 at the midpoint

**As a reminder, this guidance does not factor in any new markets that have not begun legalized sales, including the largest East Coast markets like New York and New Jersey that are in the process of setting up their adult use recreational markets. With the revised revenue projections, we’ve been very thoughtful of about our operating expenses.**

# Competitors

IMO, there really is only one other competitor that I would deem competitive enough and similar enough to be a competitor to Leafly, and that is Weedmaps. Sure Dutchie is probably the dominant provider of POS experience (think Shopify), Dutchie's marketplace is far from impressive and I doubt anyone actually goes to Dutchie to buy weed. And Leafly, as of today, is not involved in the POS business.

Additionally, while there definitely are other websites that offer information on weed strains and products and/or are marketplaces, none of them (outside of Weedmaps) come close to Leafly in terms of depth, quality, number of reviews, and MAUs (Monthly Active Users). According to [similarweb](https://www.similarweb.com/website/leafly.com/competitors/) competitors such as Wikileaf and Allbud (who both offer information on strains) do not even come close to Leafly in terms of the number of visits and other site usage metrics. [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/leafly.com#section_traffic) also shows a similar story, with Leafly ranked 9620, Weedmaps ranked 8,728. For reference, Hightimes is ranked 69,584, so no one else is close.

**A common criticism of Leafly’s business model is that Google, Shopify, Instagram, Tiktok, Yelp, Doordash, Uber, Amazon, or etc... will eventually make Leafly obsolete**. While it is true that these other companies probably can do a better job than Leafly (i.e. Google is better for finding and reviewing dispensaries) at the end of the day, companies have a lot of legal hurdles and risks to deal with if they want to get into the marijuana business. It is my belief that, as long weed is not legalized Federally, the larger business like Doordash or Shopify will NOT enter the weed business. And because of this, as long as site traffic to Leafly is high, Leafly may be one of the few locations where brands can advertise their products. Leafly gets to take advantage of this current situation.

Additionally, even today, you almost never see advertisements for alcohol or tobacco on popular social media platforms. Even Leafly itself can’t advertise on places like Gooogle, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Twitter today, which means retailers and brands probably can't either. There's reason to believe even if weed was legalized, the competition may still not be that stiff for Leafly.

# Industry

The legal cannabis industry is estimated to be $40 billion to $50 billion in sales by 2025, which is double the market size of 2020. By 2030, cannabis is estimated to grow to $70 billion with some estimates as high as $100 billion in sales. There are currently [18](https://www.statista.com/chart/6681/the-states-where-its-legal-to-smoke-marijuana/) states that allow for recreational use and 37 states that have medical marijuana laws.

# Future Catalysts

There are several future catalysts that could propel Leafly's stock price.

**Federal Legalization**: This is the most obvious, the most well known, but also the least likely catalyst that will happen. I understand never say never, but I don’t think any of us will see Federal Legalization in our lifetimes. I won’t get into too much detail, but the two main reasons are politics and money.

* **Politics**: While weed legalization is widely popular across the country, neither party wants to give the other a win, so we will never get enough votes. Unless a single party wins 60 Senate seats and their party controls the presidency, it won’t happen.
* **Big Pharma**: Big pharma is slated to lose A LOT of [money](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-04-20/marijuana-recreational-use-drugmakers-lobbying) if weed was legalized, so they will try their best to not make it happen. We saw during Covid how much power Big Pharma has and they will do anything for money. Just do a quick Google search on why Big Pharma is against legalized weed and you'll see.

**But don’t fret, I actually think this is a blessing in disguise**. As long as weed is illegal on the Federal level, bigger companies such as Uber Eats, Google, Meta, Amazon, probably won’t enter the industry, giving Leafly room to operate. In fact, I’m so strongly opinionated about this that I would probably sell my Leafly holdings the day when weed is passed Federally as that basically opens the door for everyone to easily come into the business.

**State Legalization**: This is the most likely catalyst that will help Leafly out. While Federally we won’t see legalization any time soon, individual states will continue to legalize it every year. Leafly, according to its analyst presentation is well positioned on the East Coast, and that is where the next slew of stated legalizations will occur.

**Speed Of State Legalization**: This is slightly different from the above - this talks about how quickly a market can be developed after legalization. Believe it or not, once a state legalizes marijuana, there’s a long and drawn out process of licensing and what not, so it actually takes some time for a market to be developed. The longer we have to wait, the longer it’ll take for retailers to list on the website and for there be enough competition on the website for retailers to bid each other for premium spots. In fact, the reason Leafly downgraded their guidance in their Q4 call was because this pace was slower than expected for some states (like Illinois). If this pace speeds back up, it will be a positive catalyst.

For example, In Illinois there are about 185 licenses tied up in litigation.

If Illinois were to pick up the pace and New York and New Jersey get everything set up, it's only a matter of time before Leafly will raise their guidance. Leafly claims to have a strong foothold in Illinois and is ready to onboard the second the retailers get their licenses. Also in their Q4 call, they mentioned the 2022 guidance:

&gt;Does not factor in any new markets that have not begun legalized sales, including the largest East Coast markets like New York and New Jersey that are in the process of setting up their adult use recreational markets.

One tool I found that was helpful is this one: [Explore Interest Rates](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/explore-rates/#about) Some people were asking if they could get the same rate I was getting (3.5%) and that may be possible, but this tool will give you a better sense given various inputs like state, house price, credit score, etc. There are various toggles and inputs to adjust. The rate that I was quoted does show up given the different inputs I added, so that's a nice piece of confirmation that it's not totally out of line.

Here's what they say about their data source -- I think this is about as good as it gets!

vet,My dog died last night - why?,"2 months ago I bought a 2yo pug from a breeder. She was highly anxious, to the point where the breeder gave us anxiety pills at handover. Initially she refused to come any where near us and wouldn't eat for the first few days but after a while we gained her trust and she began to follow us around, eat, and just generally relax into family life.

We have 4 other pugs who all get along well and are no hassle. They spend most of their time outside as we have a huge property and plenty of space to run and play, coming inside to sleep in their separate pens every night and play occasionally. Our newest miss was too nervous for all that at first so she spent most of her time indoors until we slowly transitioned her into the group. Being a nervous Nelly, she tended to bark a lot, and occasionally the others would nip at her to tell her to be quiet and put her back in her place but that was rare and never harmful. She fit into our family well and you would have never known that she was the anxious dog she once was.

2 days ago we went out for the day, and came home to discover that the little miss had blood on her ears. We separated all dogs into their individual pens, and put her into the bath to wash her off and assess the damage. She had a small cut on the tips of each ear, and a few very small and minor scratches on the top of her head. She had obviously fought with one of the others but as far as dog fights go it seemed to be very minor. I blow dried her and applied antiseptic to her cuts, then fed her and sent her off to bed. She seemed very depressed and lethargic but otherwise ok. The next day (yesterday) we went out again; and kept little miss separated from the others, snuggled up in the house. She was still lethargic but walking around when needed. She ate and drank when prompted but seemed very sorry for herself. I wrote this off as possible bruising but being that her fight was with other pugs, I figured there wouldn't have been much damage as they can't open their mouths very wide, and are generally too lazy and fat to cause any significant damage. Being an anxious dog, I thought it was more the trauma of the situation than anything else. This morning we woke up to discover that she had died overnight, and had a small amount of vomit next to her on the bed. Other than that there was nothing unusual and she did not void her bowels.

Would this have been an internal injury? I can't understand why she would have died otherwise. I'm heartbroken and angry. Could it have been an underlying fault from the breeder? Anxiety related? My poor girl.

I haven’t gotten close to having an offer accepted and prices and interest rates keep going up that financially I’m just wondering should I give up completely or rent for a year and try again.

If I do buy anything it’ll be a cheaper starter townhome/condo. I’ll be living with my fiancé and after putting $30-$40k down. I’m hoping to have monthly expenses on the home at $2,600 or less. 

We have two other options. We can rent a 1 bed apartment for $1,500ish (so $750 each) a month which we both can easily afford. Or we can live in a 2 bed with her current roommate and his boyfriend which would be a little cramped, but we’d only be paying about $400 each and we’d be saving a ton of money. 

My main concern is since I started saving housing prices have skyrocketed to where I’ve almost been priced out of the market completely.

personalfinance,"30k in cash saved for my first car. Buy, finance, or lease a new car?","Hi there. So I have 30k saved towards a car. 750+ credit score. 

About me:

* In my early 20s, living in Seattle, WA. Ideally see myself staying in this city for another 3-4 years but who knows. 
* Been driving since I was 16 but not regularly since 2020, and honestly was not the best driver in the past, but I do feel with better safety features like backup cameras etc that are available in newer cars now that I'll probably feel better and more confident on the road. Have only ever driven my parents' cars (mostly a 2004 camry). So looking at newer cars. 
* No weekly commute, but probably looking at 60-80 miles a week. I'm somewhat outdoorsy and would like to have a car to take on occasional long car camping trips or road trips which is why I like the hatchback style of cars.    

My options are:

1. **Buy a new car (Toyota Corolla hatch, Subaru Impreza hatch) in cash**. No monthly payments. At MSRP at *best.* I'm looking at a Toyota Corolla hatch or Subaru Impreza hatch or Crosstrek; the least risky options that are actually available at MSRP right now, pending a 3-6 month wait. 
   1. My ideal car is actually Prius or something electric or hybrid, but the demand vs availability is so awful right now it's not feasible to get a Prius right now at MSRP. In addition I don't know how hard it would *actually* be to own an EV regardless of how much internet research I do, so if I bought right now, I would go for the ""safer"", likely to be cheaper/easier to maintain in the long run etc. choice ie. a Corolla or Subaru. 
   2. Ideally, the first car I buy I want to keep for 10-15 years. 
2. **Finance a new car**. Assuming I get around a 1-2% APR, I'd invest the amount I have after down in stocks ETFs etc. My portfolio is up 10% in the past year; it seems like even in the worst years, most conservative investment rates still net around 5% yearly. I would be ahead in terms of $, no? Or am I not understanding how APR and interest rates work? 
   1. Everything I've seen on this sub says to buy a car in cash and not finance but I don't really understand the rationale behind this -- is it just because APR rates are so bad? Is there a ""break-even"" point / maximum APR after which it's better to finance/invest the cash you have? 
3. **Lease a car (Nissan Leaf EV)**. I liked the Leaf on the test drive and originally wanted to buy, but depreciation is quite bad for this car and I'm not 100% sold on how easy it would be for me to own an EV right now, so it seems like leasing would allow me to kind of ""trial run"" it. If it ends up as a terrible choice, hard to find chargers, etc I'm only locked in for 2 years.  
   1. Also, since this is going to be my first car ever and I'm pretty young/not sure how long I'll be in my current city, I might lose less $$ if I need to switch to a different car or move in 2 years. 
   2. It seems like the car market is pretty crappy right now -- the plan would be to lease a car for 2 years, then buy a used 2-3 year old car (this time to own for 10+ years) in 2024ish when hopefully negotiation is more possible. I guess this being a good plan seems somewhat dependent on the market being in better shape in 2 years, but at the very least I don't think it can get a lot *worse*? So, worst case scenario, in 2024, the car market still sucks, I buy a new car, I effectively paid a few thousand to delay my decision a few years because I lost the gamble. Plus, I might be able to get a Prius or a hybrid Crosstrek more easily in a few years down the line, as it seems like EVs and hybrids are only going to get more common -- so I might have more options for electrification.
   3. The advice seems to be not to lease right now and that the current rates are terrible. How do I calculate this? What are the important factors to consider? Again, is there a break-even point of money factor percentage / APR vs car depreciation? I know I would be taking a loss, but *how much* of a loss? If it's not that much of a difference, I'd be open to paying for essentially the flexibility of a 24 month lease vs buying a car to own for 10+ years. 

As an addendum, while price is a factor, I do care more about getting a good deal and good value than I do about the actual $$. So I don't mind paying more $ for a nicer car with better features as long as I'm not paying towards dealer fees or markup over MSRP. Also the idea of leasing right now and waiting until cars are more reasonable and I could potentially negotiate or buy a car for under MSRP (as has been possible for family and friends in the past) is very enticing, though of course I know that might not happen. 

There's a lot I don't know about cars, and honestly about personal finance. Let me know if there are other things I haven't considered yet. What's the smartest choice financially? Are there formulas/spreadsheets/calculators I can use?",finance,1650919515.0
personalfinance,New Car - Looking for input,"Looking for people to poke holes in this idea I have stuck in my head:

I currently drive a 2014 Mazda 3 with 160k miles and getting 38ish MPG. Mechanically the car is perfect, and it has been well taken care of. I expect I could get several more years out of it. I love the little car but also like the idea of upgrading to something with more cargo space, ground clearance and amenities/safety features.

I have been eyeing a new RAV4 Prime XSE at $50k. This car checks all the boxes for me. Most of my commuting could be done with the 42 miles of electric range and even if I were to use hybrid mode, it would get similar MPG as my Mazda does. Plus, this car has a whole lot more comforts than my car right now and better fits my lifestyle.

Normally, I wouldn't go for a car this expensive but taking advantage of the Federal Tax Incentive for PHEVs, my state's incentive, low interest rates and the current high value of used cars - does this make sense?

Current income, $100k/yr.

&amp;#x200B;

* $50,000 - RAV4 Prime
* \-$7,500 - Federal Tax Incentive
* \-$1,500 - State Tax Incentive
* \-$5,000 - Mazda3 Value (May be more as I will likely try to do a private sale)
* \-$10,000 - Down payment (May be slightly more)

&amp;#x200B;

= Approx, $26,000. Though, because the tax incentives and private sale would take time, the financed amount would be around $40k, so payments would be higher but for a shorter term.

The pressing issue for me is that Toyota is nearing the 200k cars sold and that the tax incentive will drop for them. This is expected to happen in the next few months, so I would have to try and locate and by the car then.

Otherwise, for me the other option is to continue to drive the Mazda3 into the ground while continuing to save and evaluate what my options are at that point.",finance,1650919705.0

It is pretty base in terms of features besides a moonroof, BSM, power driver's seat, and Apple CarPlay. I originally purchased due to the good mpg, reliability, and having a 180 mile round trip daily commute that was going to last until the project wrapped up sometime in 2024. I estimated that I would put about 140k miles on it just from commuting and not factoring weekends, errands, etc. and would ultimately get a new car once I transitioned projects. 

I ended up changing careers and will be full-time remote outside of occasional air travel to client sites, so any car that I have will average about 8k miles/year. My family and I are  beginning to plan some long road trips over the next few years (700+ miles each way) and would like a larger, quieter, more luxurious vehicle under $40k for this purpose and to use for all other day-to-day driving. 

We are looking at a 2017 Lexus RX350 with 49k miles that was listed at $38k, but I have managed to get the dealer to agree on 36.8k and offer $24.7k on trade for the 2019 Camry. The Lexus was purchased and maintained for its full service life at the same local Lexus dealership and is a 1-owner vehicle with no accidents, open recalls, and full service records that show regular maintenance at every 5k interval, etc. It is also fully optioned with the following:

Heated/ventilated front seats

Heated wood/leather steering wheel

3 driver's seat presets

Heads up display

Panoramic roof

Dynamic radar cruise control

Mark Levinson sound system

Lane departure warning

Lane keep assist

Blind spot monitoring

My question becomes; with the car market the way it is, would it be more prudent to keep the Camry or is this worth the upgrade at this point? I live in the PNW, so having AWD is nice to have for the week or two it's needed. I am mid-20s and own a home with low interest and mortgage, don't have any other debt besides the current Camry payment at 2.59% interest, fully contribute to my 401k to get employer match, max-out my Roth IRA, contribute to an HSA, and save approximately 40% of my net income. If I do trade for the Lexus RX, I could pay cash but feel that if I can get a sub-4% rate then it makes more sense to invest that money and make extra principal payments each month to lower my effective interest rate.

personalfinance,Renting out a condo at a small loss? Or sell 6 months into ownership.,"Hi PF! I'd love for some advice about my current situation in terms of what is the best course of action with respect to a property I closed on late 2021.

I won't go into specific details why (you can read them in my post history, though), but I am set on moving out of my current condo in a HCOL area.  It's an unfortunate situation because I do really love the unit - it's new construction and lots of nice finishes.  

I spoke to my realtor and the cost of selling at this stage likely incurs a 5% on loss due to it not appreciating much since it's a short time since bought it. I did speak to a few other realtors and the census is the same... with the small chance of coming out whole, but not likely.  So at 1M pp then that's 50k.

I have started the process of renting it out using a property manager, who will both fill the place with a tenant as well as manage it.  We tested the ad out and getting pretty decent traction at a price for rent that is very close to the total monthly cost (all in including taxes) but potentially slightly under, and management fees will put me probably losing out net at 300-400 a month, and then the fee to place a tenant is a one time month of rent.  I talked to a few companies and the fees structures are pretty similar. 

What I don't fully understand is the tax implications, I have researched online and I can see that I can deduct interests, HOA, management fees but the income would be taxed too so I don't know if its a wash or if I can still come out even all things considered, or if the loss is even higher given the income not being offset enough by deductions.  Any advice on that is really appreciated.  Lastly, is the investment in property in the Bay Area in terms of future appreciation worth taking a haircut in the short term, my interest rate is really low as well. I can also see a world potentially the area continues to improve and gentrify which would help there. 

I don't want to end up in world of hurt, so I'd love to get some advice on how to think about this problem and navigate this tough situation optimally. Maybe selling is the best course as well, I am not set on renting. Thank you in advance!",finance,1650929574.0

About 40% of U.S. small businesses intend to raise selling prices by 10% or more amid decades-high inflation, according to a survey from the National Federation of Independent Business.

Overall, more than two-thirds of the respondents plan to increase prices in the next three months, according to the survey, conducted between April 14 and April 17 among 540 business owners. Almost half of the small firms are planning increases of 4% to 9%.

The report suggests that many businesses are planning increases that are above the current rate of national inflation -- the consumer-price index rose 8.5% in March, the most since 1981. 

Nearly nine in ten employers in the NFIB survey said they’ve had to raise prices to absorb some of the costs.

Inflation started to show up as an issue in the survey in the summer of 2021, the NFIB said, and it’s a novel challenge to entrepreneurs who started a business after the 1990s. The NFIB found that price increases are having a “substantial” impact on 62% of the respondents and a “moderate” impact on almost a third of them. No one said inflation had no impact on their business.

Small employers have few options at their disposal other than passing higher input costs on to customers, according to the NFIB, a trade association that defends the interests of small businesses. In the survey, the main drivers of higher expenses cited by owners were the cost of inventory, supplies and material, as well as fuel.",finance,1650938220.0

business,Looking at buying a small business...any thoughts help!,"Hello Everyone!

To preface, I am a college student going into finance and am curious what everyone thinks. 

I am looking at buying a laundromat in the Philadelphia area and have one eyed up that seems very appealing, but I have some concerns regarding what to expect, and the information given is definitely not enough. It is a 12 washer, 10 dryer laundromat that was family run. They have a small drink and snack bar inside also which was always staffed by the current owners. The price is hovering right around 100k for the business, all equipment included. The space is rented for $1,500 a month and utilities run about $1,500 a month. The lease has 5 years left and renewal is expected. I was told by the broker that the snack stand does not generate a lot of revenue, which is what I expected because having a snack bar that is staffed within a laundromat is not very common. I was sent an L&amp;R sheet from the broker, but it is (literally) a small excel sheet with no exact numbers, just general estimations. Monthly revenue is $11,000 to $12,500, profit roughly $6,000-$8,000. Most of the machines are newer. The space is very plain but looks very well kept. All machines are coin-op and there is a cash to quarters change machine inside. Current hours are 8a-6p. Google ratings are 4.9 stars. Website is simple, but sparse. They only offer snacks and coin-op laundry. Nothing else. No wifi, no chairs, no television, no card readers or ATM. 

I have several entrepreneurs in the family, they don't seem turned away, but definitely want more financial info.  

&amp;#x200B;

Some changes I want to do are as follows: 

Immediate Changes:

Change the hours to 24 hours. 8a-6p restricts prospective customers from coming in at late hours of the night. I personally do laundry at night, and I know several people who do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

Purchase a card reader and cash change machine. This keeps me from needing to add card readers to every machine and keeps the sales cash, to an extent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Remove the snack bar and replace it with a sitting area with a small table, comfy and affordable chairs, beverage and snack vending machines. The snack bar is built into a ""nook"" with a window. I'd simply open it up and make it more useful. 

&amp;#x200B;

The entire place is white with little to no decoration with ancient fluorescent lighting. Update to LED tube lights in a bright white or warm white color, no more cold and office-like lighting. Paint a neutral tan to warm the space up. Leave current floors (they are nice durable tile, not linoleum). Paint the stucco outside to a dark gray. 

&amp;#x200B;

Add security system with multiple cameras, double locks on all doors. Front door will have remote locks to close in case of an emergency. The space is small, but I plan on a minimum of 10 cameras to cover every single corner. 

Public wifi on a separate Access Point will be provided for guests to get work done while doing laundry but not impede on the internet that I will use for the security system. 

Add a soap dispenser with tide, free and clear and basic softener. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later Changes: 

&amp;#x200B;

Change name of the laundromat, but current name will remain for now. 

Renew lease. 

Add cable TV. 

Start wash-and-fold, employ college students and teach them some of the business, preferably business students. Anyone can apply though, I'll hire anyone who shows that they are reliable and want to learn about business. 

Add split unit climate control to save on old inefficient units. 

&amp;#x200B;

Goals of the Immediate changes: 

The immediate changes will give me the ability to make the entire place remote accessible and I can run it absentee, coming once a week to collect the change boxes, refill the change machine, empty the bills and coins from vending machines. No money will be stored on-site. Overflow safe will be installed for emergencies only. Contact info for myself will be posted so customers can report issues.

personalfinance,Pay down student debt or Ibonds?,"Say I have $10k. Would it make more sense to pay off high-interest student debt, or purchase Ibonds?

Here are my numbers, let me know if they are right:

* Purchasing $10k of Ibonds means that after 15 months, I will have:
   * $10,000 x (7.12%/2) = $356 after 6 months
   * $10,356 x (9.62%/2) = $498.12
   * Total interest after 12 months, which I can recover after **15 months: $854.12**
* Paying off $10,000 of student loans at 7.5% interest rate will save me **$979.65 after 15 months**
* I know I can recover the Ibonds after 12 months (and lose last 3 months of interest), but it just seemed simpler to calculate like this.

So from a purely financial standpoint, it makes more sense to pay off the loan ($125.53 difference).

However, if (knocking on wood) something were to happen, such as me losing my job, or simply needing the money in an emergency next year, I would be able to access what I would have in Ibonds. If I pay off the student loan, that's great, but I will not have that almost $11k next year should I need it. I have 3 months living expenses in an emergency fund saved already, but that is on the lower side of where I would like to be. It seems like that $11k extra emergency fund would cost me $125 for this first year. If inflation keeps going up or staying high, it would make even more sense and could even breakeven for following years.

Am I overthinking this? Does that make sense? TYIA!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I forgot the tax implications on Ibond earned interest. Assuming a 32% marginal tax rate, that would be $273.32. Definitely not negligible, puts the cost of Ibonds vs paying off the loan up to $399. I probably would just pay off the loan with these numbers.

personalfinance,"3rd-year college undergrad from Texas who attends a private university in California for 3 yrs: Should I keep my TX residency, or become a CA resident? Pros &amp; Cons? Taxes/Job Benefits?","I am from Texas, but I go to college at USC in California. I have never changed my Texas residency status in the three years that I have lived here-- I still have my TX driver's license and I am registered to vote in Texas. Judging by what I've explained below, what do you think I should do? Should I keep my Texas residency or become a California resident? Am I legally obligated to become a CA resident and I am just unaware of it?

I'm currently 21-years-old and was born &amp; raised in Texas, so I have only ever been registered to vote in TX and have only ever had a TX driver's license. I moved to California in August 2019 when I was 18-years-old to attend USC in Los Angeles. I have always been under the interpretation that since my purpose for residing in California was to attend college make it unnecessary for me to establish California residency and to get a CA driver's license-- so because of that, I've just kept all of my Texas ID's because it was just easier. 

I have no idea if the following information is even relevant to this scenario at all and it may come off as slightly ""pretentious"" to some, but that is not my intention at all. Also, the reason why I have specifically said ""private university"" is not to be snooty at all, but because every time I have tried to find the answers to my own questions, the results that pop up on Google are all just about the rules and requirements that non-Californians must meet in order to become CA residents and pay in-state tuition-- and none of these descriptions or topics really help me at all because that is not what I am trying to accomplish. 

During my first two years at USC, I was only a full-time student-- I did not have any form of a work-study, part-time, or campus job, so I was not receiving any form of legitimate income. I did not get any student loans from any financial institution— not in CA or any other state. My parents also do not receive any income from the state of CA. Essentially, my parents nor I had ever had any affiliation with an institution in California that could have somehow linked us to the state and its tax regime. 

Now that I live off campus in a non-school-affiliated apartment complex that has my name on the lease,  I now believe that I would be able to use my current address in order to establish domicile in California if I did choose to do so. 

As of today, I have completed 4 semesters at USC so far. Here is another caveat: I currently am taking a ""gap"" semester from school right now for personal reasons-- I am not registered for any USC courses for this current Spring 2022 semester-- and I have instead been working a non-USC-affiliated part-time job, and I have been dabbling around in some political campaigns &amp; volunteer projects. This summer I also plan I have a full-time, paid position at a professional firm here in California as well. Is it possible that this could mean that since I am not physically enrolled in class right now that I no longer have a college-student exemption and therefore I am required to become a California resident? Idk. 

My main questions are mainly these: What are the general pros and cons of keeping the Texas residency vs becoming a California resident? Are there any benefits to me keeping my Texas residency/driver's license even though I don’t live there, or is it smarter for me become a CA resident while living and working here in CA? Are there any benefits/advantages that California residents receive when they file their state income taxes in comparison to us non-Californians when we to file our CA nonresident state income taxes? Is it simpler to file state taxes when you are a California resident as opposed to when you are a nonresident? If I were to get employed by a California company but chose work fully online back in Texas, would I pay income taxes to Texas or to California? I have a car with me here in California that was purchased by and is registered under my father's name and his Texas address, so if I get a California driver's license, will they give me any issues about not wanting to register the car in California as well? And finally, since I am in college and under the age of 24, I am still a dependent on my father's federal income tax return and I am not financially self-sufficient, so if I were to change my residency from Texas to California, would that create any extra difficulty or financial harm for when my father files his federal income taxes? (i.e. if he loses money by me becoming a resident of a different state, then I will just leave it how it is and do nothing)",finance,1650958796.0

* My thoughts so far is it's gonna have a Data Class so that when the image/images are fed as input, it does all the initial preprocessing to produce some matrices.
* Then the data class result is gonna be fed into the model class(which also has other dependencies like ModelEvaluation class). The idea is to be able to incorporate the training process into the same class as well, so that if it's not train flag it works as an API and if it's train flag it trains the model with the data from the dataclass and generate the model evaluation metrics and saves it at a particular place.
* Also want to create logs for the whole api using singleton pattern, I understand dependency inversion and simple things like that but looking for what particular design pattern on a high level is closest to a problem statement like this.

cybersecurity,Are You Ready to Handle a Cyber Crisis?,"Companies that suffer from cyber security breaches or cyber vulnerabilities increasingly face claims of failing to implement adequate cyber security measures, deceiving others around the extent of their data security measures, or inadequately notifying the individuals whose personal information may have been at risk.

## The Legal Risks

At the federal regulatory level, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Communications Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission have all taken action against companies that, in their view, violated federal laws covering data security.

The FTC, in particular, has authority to prevent “unfair or deceptive” trade practices under Section 5 of the FTC Act. It has taken the position that a failure to employ reasonable and appropriate data security practices constitutes an “unfair” practice under the statute, and that misleading consumers about data security risks or practices can constitute a “deceptive” practice.

State and city regulators, predominately state attorneys general, have also taken action against companies that allegedly employed insufficient data security practices, asserting that such practices violated laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive conduct, specific statutory data security requirements, and data breach notification laws.

Companies that experience a breach or vulnerability may also face private claims. Most commonly, such claims are brought by the individuals (such as consumers or employees) whose data was allegedly compromised in a data breach.

Recently passed laws and regulations further increase the legal pressure on companies that collect personal information. For example:

* New York’s Department of Financial Services recently issued regulations imposing detailed cyber security requirements on insurance and financial services companies.
* California passed a statute to take effect in 2020 that creates a private right of action for certain failures to have “reasonable” cyber security measures. The state also passed a separate statute that takes effect in 2020 requiring “reasonable” security for certain connected devices.
* The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became operative in May 2018, imposes data breach notification requirements and an obligation to maintain appropriate security measures on companies subject to its provisions.

## How Organizations Can Reduce Risk

Given this complex legal landscape, how can organizations reduce their risk? Some steps companies might consider taking include:

* **Implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate security measures.** Enforcement typically involves claims that companies failed to create and maintain a sufficient information security program and allowed an otherwise preventable data breach to occur.
* **Verify accuracy of statements around the company’s data-security practices and how the company responds to a breach.** Many suits in the data breach context allege that companies did not live up to the level of cyber security they promised.
* **Develop and regularly test an incident response plan.** Most cyber security claims challenge, at some level, the adequacy of companies’ responses to cybersecurity incidents.
* **Understand notification obligations.** Regulators and private plaintiffs are increasingly citing alleged failures to properly notify consumers in their suits.

## Plan Ahead for a Cyber Breach

While many organizations focus on their incident response, incident preparedness is just as important. Yet companies often fail to take certain steps that could reduce risks associated with the litigation and enforcement proceedings that often follow cyber breach announcements. Some common issues we see even before a breach occurs include:

* Lack of an incident response plan or a plan that’s overly complicated to execute.
* Failure to test the response plan or include senior management in assessment exercises.
* Failure to preserve the attorney-client privilege for potentially damaging documents such as security assessments.
* Overlooking the involvement of third party vendors in a response plan.
* Failure to develop cross-function relationships among key plan participants and stakeholders.
* Lack of a communications plan.
* Limited or inaccurate IT documentation showing what cyber security measures the company took.
* Lack of cyber security insurance, or having insurance that isn’t the right fit.
* Lack of full network visibility.

Once the aforementioned details are accounted for, there are many additional ways to prepare for a cyber security incident:

* **Tabletop Exercises:** Many companies find it helpful to supplement their internal exercises with exercises that are facilitated by external providers, including legal counsel and cyber security consulting firms. Typically, these outside providers will play out a relevant cyber threat scenario by delivering a series of developed “injects” (simulated events) for the group of designated stakeholders to react to. At the end of the tabletop exercise, these stakeholders receive a series of observations made during gameplay, as well as strategic recommendations for enhancement.
* **Information Security Policy Review:** Organizations can conduct a legal review of information security and other relevant policies to identify potential gaps or policy language that the courts, the plaintiffs’ bar, and regulators have relied upon to confer Article III standing; assert claims for unfair or deceptive business conduct; or otherwise support claims in litigation or government enforcement action following a security breach.
* **Insurance Policy Cyber-Coverage Review:** Companies often are unaware of significant gaps and exposures in their insurance policy coverages when it comes to data breaches involving personal information and other cyber incidents. An outside law firm can conduct a legal review of cyber risk insurance portfolios to help identify potential shortcomings and identify the right scope of coverage
* **Written Incident Response Plan Reviews:** Companies should have counsel review their incident response plans to address legal requirements and regulator expectations. This is often accomplished with the help of a cyber security consulting provider.

## Steps to Take After A Breach

Even with best efforts, cyber breaches can and will happen, and the moves organizations make following a compromise can have both immediate and long-term consequences. To minimize harmful consequences, organizations should:

* Consult promptly with experienced legal counsel to limit damage and ensure compliance with time-sensitive legal obligations.
* Work with legal counsel, with assistance from an incident response firm, to ensure that forensic evidence is appropriately preserved.
* Work with legal counsel, with assistance from an incident response firm, to investigate and contain the incident.
* Determine whether insurers should be notified.
* Brief senior leadership and the board of directors on the incident.
* Determine what types of external and internal notification are required.

Internal company representatives involved can vary, but should include in-house counsel, IT and information security, and, in most cases, senior management. 

## How Prepared is Your Organization?

CryptoCurrency,MIT Blockchain and Money course (2018); lecture 6 summary,"In this lecture, Larry Lessig (Professor in the field of contract law and cyberspace law) was a guest lecturer.

For this lecture, you had to read 3 articles (please remember that they were all written in 2018 or even before that). Voluntary readings were Nick Szabo’s piece about smart contracts and the Ethereum whitepaper

*The lecture itself:*

**Smart contracts**

The first part quotes the definition of Nick Szabo (1996) of smart contracts:

smart contract = “A set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols, within which the parties oerform on these promises”. 

protocol = an algorithm. A standard operating procedure.

Smart contracts are not the same as artificial contracts. You might infact call them dumb contracts, because smart contracts are mechanizing strictly what otherwise would be done between humans.   
 And are they actually contracts?

**Ethereum** 

The Ethereum platform facilitates the making of smart contracts. 

Bitcoin vs Ethereum Design:

Bitcoin’s currency = Bitcoin. Ethereum’s Currency = ETH

Bitcoin can be mined using ASICS, Ethereum can be “mined\* ”only through GPU (no large mining rigs).

Bitcoin’s hashrate is 54 Exahash/second, Ethereum’s hashcate is much smaller: 260 Terrahash/second (less electricity usage).

Bitcoin had no presale. Ethereum at an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) &amp; prerelease

BTC rewards are 12.5 BTC / block. ETH rewards are 3 ETH/block

Bitcoin has the monetary policy that it is halved every 210.000 blocks (4 years). Ethereum’s monetary policy was fixed (5/block), but it can be changed by updates that are proposed

Bitcoin fees are voluntary. Ethereum’s fees are necessary and market based.

In 2018 there were the following smart contract platforms with their year of founding and their valuation in 2018:

Ethereum (founded in 2015): worth $22B in 2018, EOS (2018) worth $5B, NEO (2016) worth %1.1B, Ethereum Classic (2016) worth $1.1B, LISK (2016) worth $360M (code in Java, uses side chains), Stratis (2017) – %150M. NEO and EOS were a bit faster than Ethereum because they had a different type of Proof of Work.

If a platform is multilangual it allows for more apps to be built there, but fewer security. 6 or 7 programming languages can be used on the Ethereum network. 

12 Use cases of smart contracts’ potential use are mentioned ( I wrote about the article in case yesterday): digital identity, records, securities, trade finance, derivatives, financial ddata, mortgages, land title, supply chain, auto insurance, clinical trials, cancer research. As of 2018, none of these uses had taken off.

**dApps**

dApps= decentralized applications, that 1) run on a Decentralized Blockchain Network  
 2) Generally have a Native Token (but that is not necessary; they can also run on the basis of ETH) &amp; Run as Smart contracts.

**Initial Coin Offerings =**  **Crowdfunding for Investment &amp; Consumption**

* The proceeds (proceeds = money obtained from an event or activity, Google definition.)are being used to build networks
* Tokens are issued prior to being functional 

(Why would anyone put money in that? See: the last bullet point; Because of the anticipation of potential profit and appreciation of the coins in the future)

* Development, while open source, is largely centralized
* Promoters allocate themselves premined tokens

(Ethereum’s Vitalik and investors and the Ethereum Fund got a relatively small piece (was it 20% max? or even smaller? While developers and investors of other coins give 80% to themselves. . With a smaller share given to the developers/big investors, a coin is less likely to be seen as a security).

* Tokens are fungible &amp; transferable
* Scarcity is fostered with a preset monetary policy (about inflation)
* Purchasers anticipate profits through appreciation.

In 2018 there had been about 4500 ICO’s. Many were scams that gave the most coins to the developers/big investors. Some estimations are that these scams are between 20% and 80%. 50% of new coins failed within 9 months to a year.

*The rest of the lecture was taught by Larry Lessig.*

**Contracts; promises and performances**

contract (abbreviation: K) = a promise or performance given in exchange for a promise or performance (quid pro quo)

Examples:

* A **promise** for a **promise**: I promise to give you $10k if you promise to sing an opera for me tomorrow.
* A **promise** for a **performance**: I promise to pay you $5 if you sing a song for me now. I want a promise, not a performance, because I know what your promises are worth (LOL).
* A **performance** for a **promise**: I’ll sing if you promise to pay me after I’m done.
* A **performance** for a **performance**: I’ll sing if you pay me $5000.   


The latter; a performance for a performance, is important for smart contracts. Neither party wants a promise, because the system is not based on trust (“we don’t trust eachother”). 

**4 points about K** **(K = contracts):**

* terms? : What are the **terms** of the contract?

For example: If I put a coin in a Dr Pepper vending machine, I get a can of Dr Pepper out of it.

* express: How is it expressed? (thelawdictionary.org definition: express = made known distinctly and explicitly, and not left to inference or implication)
* implied: The insertion of the law. The law is part of every contract.   
 For example: **1)** If the Dr Pepper vending machine is in the US, it is implied that I get a drink out of it, and not a can filled with gasoline or unhygienic stuff. It’s safe to drink what is implied.

(I did not catch the 4th point, nor did I see it on a slide.)

**2)** If the things of the above point are implied, then the legal system has an interest in the contract. A contract has 2 parties: a promisor and a promisee. But actually a third party is present in the US; the state is at the middle of the contract and will police many contracts. The state can punish you about your contract if it doesn’t like it at all, or it won’t enforce the contract in court if it doesn’t like it. 

In this respect, the state cares about contracts in 3 ways: **a)** the kinds of K (what can you sell, what services can you provide?) **b)** the effect of K (won’t a company go bankrupt because of this K?) 

**c)** the terms of K (What if someone asks you to burn down their parent’s house so that you two can get the insurance money? It’s not likely that those are valid terms according to the state. But what is permissible changes; for example a contract to lobby at the government was not permissible at the middle of the 20th century according to the Surpreme Court, but now it is legal to hire a lobbyist).

d) taxation of K

**Copyright law: things are changing due to technology**

Before, if you got a copyright, you had the exlusive rights for life (about 70 years?) and your intellectual property was subject to fair use (which means that someone can for example quote your book in their critique of your book or in educational materials). These three points have changed a bit. For example, DRM (Digital Rights Management) gives access to a batch of copyrighted materials, such as movies. It’s not so exlusive to one maker anymore if you participate in that DRM. And the limitations of lifetime are circumvened as well. Fair use is something that can be circumvened by technology companies. For example, on an Apple Device you cannot record your screen (personal note: this was in 2018, I don’t know if it’s any different now) to use a part of a Disney movie for fair use in class.   
So: a technology can have a policy that is different than the policy of the law, that permits and facilitates fair use! 

**Smart contracts**

That the policy of a technology is not in step with the policy of the law is one of the biggest fears about smart contracts. The fear is that smart contracts can enable the kinds of transactions that can hide for the policy of law. How does the state appear in the middle of smart contracts?

Aim of contract law =/= to eliminate risk, but to allocate risk; to figure out who has the risk, so that any of the potential contract partners can figure out what they want in return for that risk.

For example, if I want 10k bushels of corn delivered to me on September 1st, \*the price of corn is allocated (allocated risk of price change), I shift the risk of delivery and storage.

We need a system, the legal system, if the bushels of corn are not delivered by September 1st. In first world countries like the USA and European countries, we take the legal system that enforces contracts like the one about the bushels of corn for granted. But in 3rd world countries contract parties cannot take the legal system for granted; it barely there or it’s not good.

Hopefully, the blockchain and smart contracts can help people in 3rd world countries to get a solid legal system (or replacement of what should have been a solid legal system). Judges and lawyers won’t be needed with a good system of smart contracts, so the TC (transaction costs) of their legal system will go down. And contracts will be made where they would not have been made before, because they can rely on smart contracts. So smart contracts and the blockchain can be a substitute for failed systems.

In countries with a good legal system (mostly rich, Western countries), TC (transaction costs) can go down significantly too with the use of smart contracts and the blockchain. Because 90% of the things that are done by lawyers right now, there is absolutely no reason for them to be done by lawyers (expensive). So for example, if I buy a house, I legally need a lawyer to sign documents for that. The law has been written so that lawyers have to sign the documents to make money. So there is a lot of cleaning up to do here! The people who get paid to sign documents have corrupted the law. 99% of this stuff ought to be automatic! Then lawyers can focus on hard cases instead of this stuff. 

 

**Delayed flights; automatic payments (smart contract, blockchain)**

A friend of Lessig owns an insurance company and he wanted customers to be paid automatically if their flight is delayed , with use of the blockchain. Why does he want to make use of the blockchain? If only some pieces of information are used (not that YOU were on the flight or your credit card number, but only that someone was on a fight and their flight got delayed) for the blockchain, you’ll have a lot of credibility around your claim. You can trust that the claim is made for valid reasons; a valid claim.   
 And if you are for example a startup insurance company and not yet a credible insurance company, people won’t buy your product, unless you can provide solid proof on the blockchain of incidents and claims for example. Perhaps consumers will trust your company if they can use a blockchain.

Credibility through the blockchain can represent facts, then you can lower transaction costs and verifying costs. This is in stark contrast with for example the market of derivatives on Wall street which was a major cause of the 2008 crash. The derivatives market was allowed to be an invisible market. This created all sorts of unacceptable risks. Law policy makers chose it to be an invisible market and to not regulate that market. 

Smart contracts can provide leverage in the system and make sure that transactions move quickly.

**Lawyers need to educate themselves on reading code**

Lessig proposes that lawyers have to learn how to read code, as they learned about economics in the past, just to be able to put up with what’s happening in current society. Lawyers should become technically sophisticated. This needs a culture shift in the world of law, because many lawyers see themselves as non-technical humans.",cryptocurrency,1650971678.0
investing,Investing in TBF or TBX (shorting bonds),"Shorting bonds seems like an obvious play to me right now. With high inflation continuing, it seems obvious that the Fed will have to raise rates. Many people also suspect they may have to raise them more than they are currently forecasting. ETFs like TBF (short 20 year treasuries) and TBX (short 7-10 year treasuries) allow you to short government bonds. There are also leveraged versions at TBT and PST, respectively. 

I would love to hear counterarguments against these trades.",finance,1650977402.0
stocks,(4/26) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, April the 26th, 2022-

# [Stock futures dip slightly as market attempts to build on Monday’s comeback](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell slightly on Tuesday a day after a big reversal in markets gave some traders hope the April sell-off was nearing an end.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased about 140 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down about 0.4%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.4%.
*****
&gt; On Monday, the Dow advanced more than 200 points, after cutting a near 500-point loss from earlier in the day. The dramatic market reversal pushed the Nasdaq Composite higher by 1.3% and the S&amp;P 500 up by 0.6%.
*****
&gt; “Quite an impressive reversal, unfortunately we don’t believe that [Monday’s] low is the end of the market’s drawdown,” wrote Rob Ginsberg, technical analyst with Wolfe Research. “The sell-off still feels a bit too orderly to us.”
*****
&gt; The bounce was welcomed by investors after stocks ended the previous week on a sour note, with the Dow falling to its fourth losing week in a row and the S&amp;P and Nasdaq hitting three-week losing streaks Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell into bear market territory last week, but after Monday’s comeback sits 19.8% from its record. For April, the S&amp;P 500 is off by 5% and the Nasdaq is down more than 8%.
*****
&gt; Monday’s reversal was led by names like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which rallied in the afternoon amid falling interest rates and ahead of an intense week of earnings for mega cap tech stocks. Twitter also jumped after its board accepted Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s offer to take it private.
*****
&gt; Alphabet and Microsoft were slightly higher in premarket trading Tuesday before their quarterly reports after the bell. Meta, Amazon and Apple will report later in the week.
*****
&gt; UPS shares added more than 1% in premarket trading after the shipper’s quarterly earnings and revenue topped expectations. The company also reaffirmed its guidance. 3M shares were marginally higher in premarket trading after first-quarter results topped expectations.
*****
&gt; “A third of the S&amp;P is reporting [earnings] this week, and you’re probably going to see much of the same: lots of top- and bottom-line beats. Companies are going to talk about margin pressures and passing on price increases to the consumer, but they’re still going to highlight there’s still overall optimism about the economy,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, told CNBC.
*****
&gt; Between the continuation of strong earnings and a quiet period from the Federal Reserve, there will likely be a relief rally in the market, Moya added.
*****
&gt; “We’re not going to be getting more nervousness about Fed tightening, because we won’t be hearing much more about it until the May meeting,” he said.
*****
&gt; In economic data, investors are expecting fresh numbers for new home sales and consumer confidence Tuesday morning.

personalfinance,Experiences with HELOC?,"Background: We moved into our house 2 years ago in June. We have done a lot of work to the house already that we can DIY but have some more intensive renovations planned for the future. We also spent down the savings we had set aside for home repair for some things that had to happen immediately (replace main water line, work on finishing basement so my sibling could move in) We’ve just realized that an issue with the structure on our screened porch has gotten much worse much more quickly than we thought and will need to pay 10-20k getting it fixed. 

Currently, my husband works full time and I’m in grad school full time, working part time (my fellowship pays my tuition + our mortgage, and freelance consulting helps with childcare). I will graduate next spring and work full time again. 

I’m looking into a HELOC to pay for the screen porch repair within the next 6 months, thinking that we can just pay the interest while I’m still in school, and then pay it off completely once I go back to full time work next year. Then we’ll have a line of credit ready to go to begin our other planned renovations.

I have no plans to refinance because our interest rate is 3.5. We have about 175k in equity in the house. 

What else should I be considering here?",finance,1650980961.0
personalfinance,Is a HELOC in 3rd position possible?,"I applied for a HELOC on my Primary residence, I currently have the main Mortgage with a balance around 130k.  I have County Deferred Rehab Loan which I am not required to pay on and every year for 10 years 10% of the balance drops off as long as I live in the house as my primary residence, if I do move I am obligated to pay the balance remaining at that time. I just did that last fall so the balance is 18k right now.

I applied HELOC and they are working to try to get that loan secured by getting the County loan moved to 3rd position via subordination as the bank I applied with will not approve a 3rd position HELOC loan.  The banker doesn't seem confident that this will work but he is going to try at least.  

So I guess I am looking for any advice about Banks that would approve a HELOC in 3rd position if the subordination is denied or any other advice on how what I could do.  

My mortgage is currently an FHA from 2013 so I have a 3.375% rate which right now is crazy low compared to current rates so doing a cash-out refinance wouldn't make sense but if it is my only option I may have to. 

Currently we are a family of 8 in a 3 bedroom 1 bathroom 1200 sq ft house, I had 3 kids when I bought the house with my ex wife and my now fiancé had 3 kids with her ex husband.  We badly need to get work done to accommodate everyone as they are getting older.  We love our neighborhood, schools and have a nice big yard especially for the are we are in so we really don't want to move and with house prices and interest rates how they are moving will cost me a lot more than adding-on/remodeling.

Currently my family and I reside in my grandfathers house, as it was his dying wish. Unfortunately, my mother 1. Never cleared the estate and 2. Fumbled the finances so badly that the bank foreclosed on the house over the last 16k left on the mortgage. This had led to a years-long battle in court with attorneys that ultimately got nowhere. To make a long story short the bank is refusing us the opportunity to buy back the house (despite our multiple attempts) and I have have 30 days to leave.

With rent prices soaring- in addition to the fact that we have family pets no one wants in their rentals - I made the decision that my best move would likely be to try to just buy a house (funny, i know, given the market and rising interest rates).  It'd still be cheaper than renting, plus I would be a first time homebuyer and thus eligible for not only FHA but the other programs that aid with closing costs, etc. I understand my best bet would be to stay conventional in this current market, as far as i can tell. 

I *kinda* know my limits and am only really looking at houses under 100k. I have not gotten preapproved yet. I am aware theres no way I can buy and move into a house in 30 days, I do have somewhere to go temporarily but the goal is to ultimately just have a place for my family where we feel safe and secure. *Now for the fun stuff:*

&amp;#x200B;

1. I make roughly 32k annually -  I'm also getting promoted with a raise soon, but I dont know if that can count toward earnings yet if i apply. Ive worked at the same place for 5 years, but only became full time last year.
2. I haven't spent the money yet to pull my full FICO 8, however my Experian, CreditKarma etc all range between 685 and 695, respectively. In reality im not sure if the Fico would be higher or lower, but i CAN tell you I have a total of roughly $39K in debt between school loans, credit card and my car payment. I have NO CLUE how to calculate by Debt to Income ratio or what that means, but I know Zillow isn't my friend when i put in the numbers : )
3. My partner (longterm but not married) makes an additional $35k annual, however I cant include his income because he's a ghost by all financial accounts. Paid cash under the table his entire life, no bank account, no credit. I'm not sure there's a way where i can include his finances that would help me, if only even to verify we can afford a monthly mortgage payment but not have him co-signed with me?
4. I have a minimum of $6,500 saved for a down payment, and am hoping I can either save more for closing costs or perhaps even convince a family member to gift me closing cost funds if needed. I know programs also exist to help with that, again with this current market I'm not sure it matters.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any advice on what to do, or NOT do as quickly and as safely as possible (or if i should even TRY for a pre-approval), I'm all ears. I don't really have anyone to guide me through this process, and though I've tried educating myself online it's alot to take in and understand. Thanks in advance!",finance,1650987030.0
personalfinance,chargeback insight/advice for a recent purchase from WB studio tour online store,"Hi everyone,

So about 7 weeks ago I purchased an item from WB studio tour online store and immediately upon receiving the item I wasn't satisfied with the product so I had planned on returning the item. Then for about the next 6 weeks I attempted to get in contact with their customer support to initiate the return process. I messaged support about once a week for the 6 weeks and was completely ghosted, no response back whatsoever. So I got fed up with messaging them and decided to dispute the charge thru my bank last Friday. Then this Monday I noticed that the my bank credited me back the purchase amount. First question I had is does this mean I won the chargeback and is the issue resolved?

Then just an hour ago I finally receive a message from customer support stating they noticed the chargeback and asked if I was unhappy with the purchase. This really was really aggravating as I could tell by the way the message was written they clearly didn't see any of my previous attempts to start this whole return process which would've resolved this issue weeks ago. So my question is do I even have to respond back to them at this point or would ignoring them cause the chargeback to be reversed?  Any advice or insight I would be greatly appreciated as this is my first time disputing a charge like this. Thanks for anyone who got this far in my post.",finance,1650987356.0

I am currently on a path for saving for the down payment and am also trying to build my credit up. Currently I have a score around 720 with one open account for medical debt that I have not paid off yet. I plan on paying it off soon, but otherwise, I have no issues with late payments, never had a late payment on my current credit card every since I opened it. I have had it open for around 4 years and it is the only one I own. I recently just got a credit limit extension to double what it was. I use maybe \~10% of my credit allotment a month and always pay it ahead of time in the grade period. Never came close to holding a debt on it and have responsibly kept it so and intend to keep on doing so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am tinkering with the idea of opening a new credit card to raise my credit to debt ratio in hopes of raising my credit score in the long run. My current average credit age is 4 years 10 months, and I am aware that opening another card can lower this, but given that I am not applying for a mortgage for another 2 years minimum, I don't see it being too harsh on the age of my credit and hence my overall credit score. Does anyone think this is a viable strategy for raising my score?

stocks,Questions about an SSI savings portfolio managed by Vanguard,"So the only option I have for savings or investment is through this company. I put 1/4 of my funds into their high risk 80/20 stocks and bonds program, and the rest in their low risk, 20/80 stocks and bond program.

I've had negative 8 percent yields across the board, with the high risk portfolio consistently outperforming by about a percent. Did I just buy in during a bubble? On their site, they're still advertising rates well into the positives. I'm especially wondering how I'm managing to lose so much money on bonds. Aren't they a guaranteed (small) income?

personalfinance,"Opinion: Mortgage ""start-ups"" like Simplist and Better.com don't provide any value","I'm currently buying a house, for the third time, with a mortgage.  I have a high salary, good credit, and it's a big loan.  Maybe someone in a different situation is a better fit for one of these start-ups, but if so it's extremely non-obvious (and they certainly won't tell you that).

The mortgage space is extremely competitive and extremely regulated.  There's not much to differentiate one mortgage-buying experience from another.  There's rate, customer service, and time to close.

There are several places to go for a mortgage.  You can go to your bank, or any big bank.  You can go to a direct lender, or a mortgage broker.  They won't give you accurate information about each other, either, even if the mortgage professional you are working with is honest, helpful, and well-intentioned within their sphere.  While in theory, the whole schtick of these start-ups is to compare lenders and use ""technology"" to get you the best possible rate, I'm finding that for a jumbo loan, big banks like to issue those to well-qualified buyers at low interest rates, and my bank can beat the pants off of Simplist's rate!  Simplist won't tell you that.  Big banks are slow and picky about approval, though (think 35 days, whereas other lenders can offer 25, or even 21 or 17 if you need a fast close).  They may not tell you how relatively slow and picky they are up front.  If you want speed, talk to a direct lender.  In general, a lender, broker, or bank will almost certainly give you better customer service than a start-up.  Even having applied for mortgages before, there are complexities and things to remember that I had forgotten about.  There are trade-offs to consider.  You want to be dealing with someone who is going to educate you a little bit and give you the sense they are working for you, e.g. giving you a heads-up about things you might not have thought of, and coming up with alternative solutions to things (even if you have to take everything they say with a grain of salt).

The online questionnaire and forms that Simplist gives you are exactly the same as any bank or lender.  The rates are not special.  The ""automated pre-approval"" letter is not treated any different by a seller's agent than any automated pre-qualification that is issued off of a questionnaire, before doing actual diligence on you.  The agents know that this is not a real ""underwritten"" pre-approval.

I didn't get to the end of the Simplist process, so maybe there is something different about the underwriting process later on, but it's not very clear.  They didn't give me a timeline or any sense of what to expect.  But all indications are that they need the same documentation as everyone else, except possibly they do a soft credit pull instead of a hard credit pull.

In short, you can expect slightly worse customer service from these companies, so that they can be ""efficient"" and scale, and that's probably the main difference.   It's a cash grab.

I think it bugs me because I believe in the power of technology to disrupt markets, reduce red tape, and benefit everyday people.  I've been a start-up founder, and sometimes a start-up can actually offer a higher-quality experience than the ""big guys.""  I believe in that.  It just seems like there's no value proposition here.  I'm curious if anyone sees it differently.",finance,1651001456.0

personalfinance,Should I take out student loans or liquidate investments and pay cash for law school?,"Hi Reddit! I find myself in a dilemma right now as I’ve started to budget for my first year of law school. 

I am questioning whether to sell some of my mutual funds (they have averaged 12% returns over the past 3 years, which isn’t terrible - but I do know that past performance is obviously not a guarantee of future returns) to pay for law school **or** take out student loans at about a 4-5% interest rate. Maybe I could do a combination of both?

The amount I plan on taking out in loans is about $50,000 to cover all living costs and partial tuition since I received a decent scholarship.

My rationale for taking out student loans for my first year is that my RSUs at my current company partially vest in about 7 months, and that would technically cover SOME of the amount I’d take out for loans. That way, I’d be able to keep my independent investments in mutual funds (and I-bonds, which I plan to purchase) during the upcoming 2022-2023 school year.

I currently have around $75,000 invested in mutual funds, $30,000 in a Roth IRA, about $16,000 in a 401K, and $200,000 worth of RSUs (**current valuation, but they do not start vesting until 2023 and vesting is over 4 years, so $50,000/year BEFORE taxes are involved**). I also have about $10,000 in an emergency fund savings account. 

Any advice is appreciated! I am a noob at predicting the market (as well as my company’s performance, which could obviously affect my RSU amounts), as well as very new to the world of student loans.",finance,1651007942.0

I have about $65,000 in my savings account, but I have no credit as I’ve never had any loans or credit cards before. I have decided to start building credit so I can get a loan to purchase a duplex in the next year or two.

I wanted to make this post and ask you guys if it’s worth it, or should I just buy a car outright with cash and use credit cards to start building credit?

My mother, 58, is currently looking at the prospects of selling our childhood home. She has about 10ish years I believe left on the mortgage, somewhere around 98k left I believe. She is lower income, maaaaybe 30k annually, but has been doing okay, particularly since my sister, and I when I was living there, have been paying her a small amount in rent to help out. My sister is now moving out, and the plan was pretty much always that she was gonna sell the house and downsize because she doesn't need the space if no one else is living there, maybe down to a condo or something of the like.

She has the mortgage and a second mortgage that total to about 1k every month. She recently received an offer from the bank for people who ""have received a discharge in bankruptcy or are subject to an automatic stay of bankruptcy under Title 11"" for a ""Trial Period Plan"", which would reduce her payments to $785/mo for three months, and then the loan would be modified after that. It says the interest rate during the trial plan would be 3.875%, it would turn into a 40(!!!) year mortgage at that price per month, which sounds insane to me, but whatever. I guess I understand how that could be an option to people if they were actually being foreclosed on.

She has not filed for bankruptcy at all, the most that has happened is that she was not paying mortgage throughout the pandemic because she qualified not to, so she diligently saved up her mortgage payment the entire time. We used that money to pay off her credit cards once she confirmed she did not have to pay it all back, and has been paying back the mortgage since it kicked back in, and there's some type of plan to increase payments or something so that she doesn't have to pay it all back. Regardless, this would be the first I'm hearing of where she wouldn't be current, and she has told me that was confirmed when she talked to the bank about this anyways; the paperwork is basically to avoid foreclosure, but she is not in danger of foreclosure. Regardless, they are still offering her this plan.

Her initial thought was, well if she's going to sell the house anyways, might as well take the additional 200 dollars she'd be saving per month while she tries to sell the house within the next few months. She has to decide by May 1st if she wants to do this or not, but her thought is if she can save the money, then save the money, she'd be getting rid of this mortgage anyways for a new one once this house is sold and she figures out where she'd be moving (she will most likely sell the house and stay with her sister for a small while as she looks for something to downsize into, not necessarily moving right into somewhere else.)

My initial thought was, well this will probably take some toll on her credit, which is already not tip top shape. She had a few late payments on one or two things in the past year or two, so she's taken a ding, but we're working to get her back to a good place. Regardless, if she's going to be mortgage shopping, I figure any new inquiries are not going to be great. It's also confirmed in the paperwork that these kinds of plans are not favorable to credit reporting companies, so it could (read: will) affect her credit. So I'm thinking: if she can afford to pay the full mortgage, it doesnt make sense to do this, especially considering she's going to be getting rid of the mortgage anyways. Save the credit score from a useless hit and from a bad loan on the account, don't basically refinance, sell the house, move somewhere else that costs less and be done with it.

She would be okay with this, but wanted me to check it out, so I'm trying to do my due diligence in finding out the pros and cons and anything else I can see.

Yields on government bonds are catching up with expected inflation after years of lagging behind it, a threat to the speculative stock-market bets that proliferated in the era of rock-bottom rates and economic stimulus.

Bond yields that trail inflation push investors to seek an alternative; many found it in the stock market, powering a surge in risky assets.

Often known as real yields, the yields on TIPS fell deeply negative at the start of the pandemic, meaning investors were guaranteed to lose money on an inflation-adjusted basis if they held the bonds to maturity. That helped power a surge in stocks by pushing investors toward riskier assets for better returns. 

Now analysts expect that time to end, with central banks pulling back from their efforts to stimulate economic growth by holding rates ultralow and buying bonds. Many now expect the Fed to fight inflation with a series of rapid rate increases, including a half-percentage point move next month.

That rapid shift in expectations has dented shares of low-profit tech companies and speculative wagers including Cathie Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund. The ETF targets companies it believes offer the greatest potential for innovation such as Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Coinbase Global Inc. It gained popularity in 2020 when the Fed cut rates and investors chased high returns in riskier places.

personalfinance,"Stuck in an annoyingly unlucky spot, unsure what to do next","I'm sure many of you are in a similar position as me, and I'm feeling totally lost in what I should do.

I (M29) have finally saved up enough money to put near 20% down on a house in my MCOL area. However, with interest rates rising, the monthly payment would be scary close to making me house poor. I also have a decent but not spectacular emergency fund.

I am single, so no one to share expenses with, also limited in buying power without a second income.

Inflation is eating more and more into my monthly expenses, rent is increasing soon, and the market is tanking. I don't know where to put my money where it can hold it's value (don't want to tie money in bonds as I'd need it for the house). 

I honestly am at a total loss as to how to proceed. I feel like because I ended up doing this journey solo so far, and followed the recommendation of saving 20% down before purchase, I got completely burned with the timing of how things have played out in society. Watching people I know in shaky relationships with bad spending habits taking major risk by putting like 3% down on a house 3-5 years ago and having it COMPLETELY work out in their favor just makes it sting even more.

personalfinance,"(hard) How can I calculate the effective interest rate given a principal, term, and a weekly payment ? (aka: how to re-arrange a mortgage formula to the interest rate on one side ?)","I'm charting the proportion of Australian renters whose rent payments exceed 100% of the house value (spoiler alert: 50% on average, 77% last month).  I want to put this data into a clickable bubble-map (bigger bubbles = more egregious rent).

My goal is to work out what interest rate (APR) the investor would have to be paying, in order for the rent payments to precisely match a mortgage on 100% of the home value.

For example: Palm Beach, Gold Coast, QLD. Sold Apr 2022 $667,000.  Rent=$600/week. APR=2.41%

Another example: Townsville, QLD. Sold Apr 2022  $330,000 rent=  $420/week. APR=5.25%

I've been using the formula:-

rent= principal \* rate \* ((1+rate)\*\*n / ( (1+rate)\*\*n -1 ))

iteratively to guess the APRs, where n is the number of payments (52 weeks times 30 years = 1560) and rate is the annual rate/52weeks ... however... doing exponentiation with big numbers fails a lot, and ""guessing in a loop"" isn't the right approach anyhow :-)

I think I need a formula that includes terms which are logarithms ?

stocks,"Since starting last year, my portfolio has returned 5.5%. VTI has returned 6.8%.","I'm not beating the index, but I'd like to dispel the notion that stock picking always leads to horrible performance.  In fact, I consciously made the decision to invest in a defensive, dividend paying portfolio, because I had a notion that I was late to the game and the market was overvalued thanks to Fed policy.

The goal of my portfolio was to minimize drawdown by buying good companies at a discount.  Another goal was to create a recession proof portfolio which I intended to achieve by buying recession proof businesses (consumer staples, etc.). The final goal was to create a portfolio that would allow for reliable compounding regardless of what goes on in the broader market.  The dividend yield of my portfolio is a bit over 4%, which should continue to pay out regardless of what's going on in the economy or markets.

I realized that pursuing these objectives may lead to lower returns compared to the index in the long-run, and that has in fact been the case so far.  At the same time, however, I believe this portfolio is lower risk.  So far it has functioned as intended: lower risk, and lower reward.  It's more conservative.

I understand the push for passive investing, but at the same time I think we do people a disservice by insisting that it's impossible to be a prudent stock picker.  There's more than one way to Miami.  Honestly, I found the indices to be overvalued, and I'm not surprised that they've come down so much since last year, especially given the state of monetary policy.  I know a lot of people are bleeding right now, but me I'm not really concerned.  I feel I've positioned myself well for all market and economic environments, and I'm proud of myself for thinking for myself and pursuing something that makes sense to me.

I suspect some people will take this as bragging, and honestly underperforming VTI by 1.3% is not much to write home about. Still, I think it's cool to see that I was able to think for myself and come out in a way that was not only far from being a major failure, but also somewhat successful.  Long-term I may vastly underperform VTI, but that's why I hold some of it in my Roth IRA.  And like I said, I'm okay with less reward if it means less risk.

I think it's wonderful and refreshing to have so many people willing to provide honest feedback, advice, and share experiences without wanting something in return. This is how I first heard about IBonds.

I wanted to invest $10,000 in Ibonds since it's a really safe method to put some money away to fight off inflation. Majority of people here are recommending to invest in April to lock in 6 months of interest at 7.12% and another 6 months at 9.62%. Since you can't sell Ibonds for at least 1 year you already know what interest you will receive for at least 1 year. My question is what makes people think that after the 9.62% rate period it will be below 7.12%? The composite interest rate according to Treasury Direct has never been below 7.12% based on their time period of 1998 - present. So the lowest rate since Sept 1998 has been 7.12%. It has happened multiple times but to my understanding has not gone below that. Am I missing something? Wouldn't it make more sense to wait until May to start with the 9.62% and wait to find out what the next interest will be. I know it's somewhat of a gamble but you are basing your decision on history.

&amp;#x200B;

 He's a Nobel-laureate economics genius known by the name of Professor Robert J. Aumann. He's an aged and most wise guy. I asked him to make known his view of the thesis that money cannot measure the worth of a commodity. By 'worth', I meant the use-value (usefulness) of a commodity. A commodity has both use-value and exchange-value. The most basic distinction between them is the former is inexpressible in terms of money while the latter is always expressible in money terms. 

The genius Nobel laureate is well aware of the most basic distinction between the two kinds of value of a commodity. He endorsed the correctness of my thesis and claimed that it was ' well known '**\***, and that ' It has been known for hundreds of years that the monetary value of an object does not measure its ""intrinsic worth"", usually called its *utility*. '**\*\*** Evidently, Professor Aumann prefers a different wording for this thesis.

The significance of the thesis happens to be the immediate corollary to it: the high or low price (market-price) of a commodity is not attributable to its use-value (' ""intrinsic worth"" ', as Professor Aumann put it ). Thus, a doctor's or an engineer's enviable income &amp; lifestyle is **Not** justified on the grounds that they provide ***qualitatively*** better service (a sort of commodity) than nurses or ordinary workers do. Hence, it follows that the wealth &amp; income disparity does **Not** owe its origin to the ***qualitative*** distinctions between humans, between a ***Nobelist*** &amp; a copyist or between the different sorts of work different people do.

In his first message in response to my message asking him to comment on the significance of the thesis at issue, Professor Aumann just refused pointblank to oblige me: Professor Aumann ' feels that he has nothing further to say on the subject. '**\*\*\*** Thus read the message from his assistant. Evidently, the Nobel laureate chose to stay mute with clenched teeth on ' the subject '. The message from him contained nothing to give you an idea of what led him to adopt such an odd stance on the significance of the thesis at issue, and it's implied that the genius economist were unwilling to welcome any further message from me on ' the subject '. Still, I sent him another message with a view to calling his attention to the gravity of ' the subject '.and thus persuading him to change his mind. This message contained the following points.

**1.** **Nobel** ***laureates*** are viewed as **Great** people by ordinary folks.

**2.** The thesis at issue and its ***significance*** is concerned with the staggering wealth &amp; income disparity the innocent victims of which make up the **99%** of humanity.

**3.** The thesis at issue and its ***significance*** are meant to awaken the deprived, the **99%**, to the fact that they're **Not** to blame for their pathetic plight really.

**4.** They're also meant to awaken humanity to the fact that the ***evil*** of wealth &amp; income inequality happens to be at the root of the greatest &amp; gravest social **INJUSTICE**.

**5.** The wealth &amp; income inequality and the greatest &amp; gravest social **INJUSTICE** it engenders are unbecoming of the humanity of the **Space** age.

**6.** Humanity must rid itself of the ***twin evils*** (the wealth &amp; income inequality and the greatest &amp; gravest social **INJUSTICE** it engenders) if humanity wants to be civilised through and through.

**7.** Shying away from making known your stance on such a sensitive and serious issue is unbecoming of a **Nobel** laureate.

**8.** By shying away from making your views on ' the subject ' known, you deserve to be accused of a ***callous*** attitude towards the **99%** of humanity.

**9.** Such behaviour as that of yours is in direct ***conflict*** with the **Principle** of healthy &amp; meaningful living.

The **Nobel** ***laureate*** chose to stay unresponsive to this message from me, which fact moved me to send him another message in which I argued that since the thesis at issue ' has been known for hundreds of years ', its ***significance*** that happens to be the immediate ***corollary*** to it must have been known for ' hundreds of years ' too, and so I asked him to refer to some works containing it. The response to it came soon. It read as follows: ' Professor Aumann apologises profusely, but he must end this correspondence now. '**\*\*\*\***

Thus, it's clear as day that the **Nobel** ***laureate*** is ***determined*** not to make known his stance on the ***significance*** of the thesis that he subscribes to, and that he won't say a word to justify this bizarre behaviour of his. By reading between the lines, the sensible see that Professor Aumann's silence (a perfect example of deafening silence) is **Not** in the least natural or naive. There certainly happens to exist something most serious behind this deafening silence, something that made the **Nobelist** economist apologise ' profusely ' to as humble a guy as me, an ordinary, unknown &amp; practically nonentity. and the way he did it created the impression that he must be under a death threat from someone that was holding a gun to his head and threatened to pull the trigger if he dared to make his position on ' the subject ' known.

Why did he behave thus? My answer is not only is the **Nobelis**t genius devoid of the ***backbone*** needed to utter the **Truth**, he's also an ***embodiment*** of rank ***hypocrisy***.

personalfinance,"Living abroad, recession looming...should I buy a house or not??","Hi everyone! So I know this question has been asked ad nauseum, but I'm in a somewhat specific situation (isn't everyone?) and want to put some feelers out to the interwebs. My husband and I moved to Spain two years ago. We love it here, and we are sure we are staying for three more years, but aren't sure after that. We are 38 and have $132,000 in a variety of investments (it was $140k+ before the last month of ""volatility""... UGH).

I've done all the rent vs. buy calculators and they are saying 3 years is basically the sweet-spot to break even or even save a little money. We currently live in a gorgeous apartment that we love in the center of the city, but the rent is €1500 a month (we got a bigger/nicer place because covid lockdowns) and I had to close my business last year and so that amount just feels high. That being said, we have no problem paying all our bills, saving, taking vacations, etc., even with my weakened freelance income. But it is pushing the suggested rent-to-income ratio. 

If we buy a place, we will have to move out to Chinatown across the river, about a 25-minute metro into the center. My husband's commute, however, stays about the same. BUT the mortgage payment will be *significantly* cheaper (think €750ish). We want to buy a place for around 200k and allot 50k to renovate it (that is a reasonable amount here). Spain has a minimum down payment of 20% plus another 10-ish percent in taxes and closing costs, so we'd be wiping out $80k+ off the bat, but interest rates here are still hovering around 2.6% for a 30-year fixed. Considering the looming possibility of recession, it feels like it might not be a terrible decision to take the money out, but it also feels like....why would take that risk if we're not sure if we're staying more than 3 years? There is the possibility to rent it out if we move as well, but then we wouldn't have capital to buy a place in the next city we live in.

**Things I'm considering:**   
\- the cost of my time and stress of renovating (but honestly, renovating sounds fun to me and i'd like to learn how to do some basic stuff myself)  
\- the feeling of finally owning something when we're almost 40 (this is a pretty big one)  
\- if we stay in our apartment, we definitely spend €54,000 over three years that we don't get back, but the house COULD appreciate more as it's an ""up-and-coming"" barrio. But it might be 5 years or even 10 before that neighborhood gets cool enough to be expensive lol   
\- if we stay in our apartment we get to enjoy living in the city center, being close to everything, and seriously our terrace is SO NICE.

stocks,Why do we celebrate failure around here?,"Despite warnings that stock picking doesn't work (in /r/stocks, mind you, not even /r/bogleheads), I decided that the indices were overvalued when I started investing last year.  Fed policy was unprecedented and I understood that this has a pumping effect on asset prices.  Therefore, I decided to avoid index funds for the time being and focus instead on a low-beta dividend portfolio.

As I posted yesterday, my portfolio has returned 5.5% since I started on Feb. 1, 2021, compared to 6.8% for VTI.  Not bad at all.  But I didn't receive a single comment saying ""hey, nice job, that's a pretty good return for a conservative portfolio"".  Instead, I received comments blasting me for how stupid I am for underperforming the index, among other things.

Meanwhile, when someone YOLOs their money into ARKK and loses their life savings and decides ""VTI and chill from here on out!"", we upvote their post to the front page and slather it with awards.  Everybody loves a good repentance story, I guess.

But really, it doesn't make sense.  My theory is that there's a psychological benefit to ""VTI and chill"".  There's some sort of psychological comfort in thinking ""if I just do this, nothing can go wrong, and there's absolutely no other sensible alternatives"".  It takes the responsibility off of you.  That's kind of the point, right?  But it doesn't mean that you don't have other options.  And it doesn't mean that index funds don't come with their own risks.

I think it's a shame that in a sub called /r/stocks we bash people for picking their own stocks, and even more so when those people are moderately successful.  The ""haha I'm down 50% this year YOLO"" comments that we upvote are funny, but I think we can do better.

EDIT: It's a low beta portfolio that's designed to do better during downturns.  In 2021, when I started, we weren't in a correction.  2022 YTD I'm up 4.8% while VTI is down 13%.",finance,1651058340.0

personalfinance,How much would you pay to avoid Wells Fargo?,"Hello! After over a year of searching we finally got our offer accepted for our first home. We’re currently trying to select a lender and we’ve narrowed it down to two. The rates are the same but Wells Fargo is about $3000 cheaper because of lender credits. The other option is a local mortgage broker. I know $3000 is a decent bit especially because the increased interest rates from when we first started looking are putting this house over our original budget but at the same time Wells Fargo has a reputation for a reason. At the same time we had close friends work with Wells Fargo in 2020 who had no problems and highly recommends the agent they used who happens to be local. Safe to say I’m stressed about this decision and would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!

Edit - I should add I’m not really worried about it being sold to them down the road. More concerned about a stressful month leading up to closing and want to make this easier if possible.

stocks,"before the Fed raises rates. If the market crashes, my second choice is GOOGL and my third choice is semiconductor chip companies.","Inflation intensified. The current CPI hit a 40-year high and will continue to rise. Meanwhile, the PPI, a proxy for future inflation, posted its biggest rise on record and is likely to continue rising.

The Fed's second rate hike is on the verge of early May, after Powell publicly said he would raise rates by 50 basis points and possibly shrink its balance sheet.

At the same time, the yield on the 5-year treasury bond reached 2.79%, and the yield on the 10-year treasury bond reached 2.77%. Yields on medium-term treasury bonds and long-term treasury bond yields are inverted.

This is a red flag for capital markets. Judging by the recent market reaction, the rebound in late March may have simply created an opportunity for Wall Street institutions to flee. Because Wall Street institutions have long known the Fed's movements, many Fed officials in history came from Wall Street.

The future market situation is not optimistic. Fortunately, I closed out all my long-term stocks late last year and now have very few short-term investments.

What kind of stocks would you rather invest in if the market fell sharply? What is your first choice stock?

My second choice is GOOGL. Google has strong competitiveness in search engine, Android system, YouTube, etc., while constantly expanding new business;

I've been out of college for one year, and I wanted to take an account of my finances and get some opinions to see if I'm on the right track. I'm very open with my numbers in this post, in the hopes that it can serve as a resource for others in a similar situation. For reference, I am 23 years old with a STEM Bachelors degree, living in a high (MSI 115) cost-of-living area in the U.S..

--------

**My Budget**

* [Here](https://imgur.com/a/sdCya9Z) is a copy of my approximate budget. 
* I currently put $1,000/month to a credit card, this will be paid off in June.
* My student loans ($11,000 - Fed Direct - 3.73%) are suspended until 8/31/2022.
* My rent is too high -- Had minimal options moving states last-minute
* I owe about $9,600 (Wells Fargo - 6.94%) on my car, which is worth approximately $14,000

-----------

**Future Plans**

Here's where I'd really like some input. As I finish my high-interest debt, I'll have $1,000/month to put towards debt reduction or investment. Working my way through the snowball method to pay down debts. I'm making inferences here, and would like to hear if my estimates sound off-base.

* **Credit Card** -- Put some school, living, and moving expenses from junior &amp; senior year on this card, and I've paid off all but $2,000. That'll be taken care of by June. After that, I plan to use the card on whatever category I have rotating cashback in (and mostly nothing else, save for times I want the travel/purchase protection).

* **Student Loans** -- I could pay these off in 12 months if I used all of my investing budget. They're suspended and not gathering interest until at least September 2022, and the interest rate is under 4%. When payments resume, my current plan is to pay only the minimum throughout this inflationary period. If this slows, I'm prepared to pivot and knock this debt down once it makes sense to. Does it make any sense to pay these off aggressively? I'm leaning no, especially since there's a chance part or all could be forgiven.

* **Car Payment** -- This one is a bit tougher. I bought a bit more car than I could afford during college, after some expensive/stressful experiences with older cars. The monthly payment is within my budget, but the interest rate is substantial (comes out to $60/mo in interest). My car is reliable and suits my needs well, so I'm planning to stick with it. My parents are looking for a new car, and this would fit their needs as well, so there's a possibility I could sell it to them (or just shift payments) if that makes the most financial sense for me. I could use some input on paying this debt down. At nearly 7%, should I be throwing the majority of my investing budget towards this loan? Does it make sense for me to invest in the stock market when I have a free 7% return staring me in the face? Any input you have on this topic would be valuable.

* **Housing Costs** -- I moved to an expensive suburban area for work, and my rent is the maximum I can afford. I plan to move to a slightly cheaper area, and potentially move in with my SO. I would expect my portion of rent over the next two years to be around $1600, after my lease ends in September.

* **Health Insurance** -- I have a bit over 2 years left on my parents' insurance. My job offers health insurance, but I'm not familiar with the price or quality. I should find out more from my coworkers, but right now I'm thinking of it as another car payment (when my car is hopefully paid off). I'm in good health and take one prescription, and would want dental but not vision coverage.

* **Short-Term Investment** -- Right now, it seems like it makes the most sense to pay off my card, then my car, then begin to invest (while letting my student loans chill @ 4%). I'd like to build an emergency fund of several months, but my rent makes this a really large amount. Does all of my emergency fund need to be in savings? Is it worth taking the hit on short-term capital gains and waiting 2-3 days to have my emergency fund invested? To keep things easy, I'll probably use Robinhood. At my age, I want to make high-risk investments in individual stocks and a small amount (20% maybe?) of crypto. I know that this won't be tax-advantaged, but I plan for my first 1 or 2 raises to bring me up to the annual 401k max, hopefully by the time I'm 26 or so.

I went from a college budget to a HCOL area in the span of just a couple of months.

stocks,Need Help Understanding Bonds,"Something I don't really understand which I am hoping you all can help clarify for me. The Federal Reserve is ending QE, increasing interest rates, and considering QT which I, for the most part, understand from a high level perspective. This is causing Treasury Bond yields to skyrocket, which I also understand from a high level of why that is so. What I do not understand is, when everyone talks about the future and the Federal Reserve continuing to increase rates, the biggest concern for everyone is 1) the U.S. economy, 2) house prices, and 3) the U.S. equities market.   


Now, what I do not understand is, why has there been little to know discussion or concern for the current debt obligations of the Federal Government? Given we are continuing the practice of deficit spending, combined with our existing debt obligations which have yields at all time lows, wouldn't that mean in order to service those existing obligations the Federal Government would need to issue more debt at significantly higher yields to pay of the existing debt as it matures thus leading us into even more debt? Then throw on top of all that the American economy actually slowing down and the revenue of the Federal Government also starts to take a hit.   


I guess I am just curious why this isn't being discussed as much, this seems like a major problem. Maybe I'm missing something or not understanding the current and future situation correctly. Thus, I have decided to see if you all could help provide some clarity. Thank you!",finance,1651085822.0
personalfinance,How much to buy in I bonds,Basically as the title says. Me and my husband are 24 and are looking to invest and from what I’ve read here I bonds seem to be safe since I’m not comfortable with risky investments. We have a savings account about 27k and don’t touch it except to add money. My husband puts into a 401K and Roth IRA every month already. Would it be smart to put in the full 10k or should we put in less since we can’t touch it for at least a year (ideally we won’t touch it for the 30 years). Is this even the best investment strategy for us? Also one question I have is if you invest 10k and lock in the 7.12% after 6 months does the 9.62% interest only count towards the 10k we put in or include the $712 we would have made from the previous interest rate?

personalfinance,Seeking advice on what (if anything) to do with excess HELOC funds,"I recently got a HELOC at 4% for 49k to help pay for some renos.  The HELOC is structured so that any withdrawn funds can have the rate locked in.  I will have 30k or so left over after paying for renos.

Given that interest rates are rising along with inflation, it seems like cheap debt is a good thing to own right now if the funds are invested in something that can outpace inflation + interest.  I would imagine that ideally that would be real estate, but that isn't possible for us right now.

The question is:  do I take the rest out, lock in the rate, and invest that amount elsewhere?  If so, where?  Ideally looking at an investment term of 2-5 years.

personalfinance,Deferred Fixed Annuity instead of cash fund? Please read completely.,"I've read through a lot of the fixed annuity posts here, and wanted to see what the people of PF think about my situation. My fiduciary advisor has suggested moving the funds currently in a Fidelity Cash Reserves fund in my IRA to a 3 year A++ rated MVA deferred fixed annuity paying 3.15%. Interest rate is net of implicit fees. I am 60 and retired, have a minimal mortgage that I'm thinking about paying off, and a big emergency fund. I'm not planning on taking SS until I have to, or maybe even wait until 70. Spouse is still working at a high paying job for many more years. This is money currently earning almost nothing, and is just one piece of my entire retirement package. This is the ""safe"" money that lets me sleep well at night, knowing it won't flow with the market. I have lots of other money in my IRA invested in the market, well diversified (heavy in growth funds that have performed quite well over the years), riding the roller coaster up/down. I am not looking to put this ""safe"" part of my retirement in to the market, and I'm ok with that. Surrender/withdrawal charges are moot since I don't anticipate needing liquidity for this, or to access this for any reason during the 3 years. At the end of the 3 years, I can roll it into another 3/4/5 year fixed annuity or put it back into the cash fund. I'm ready to do it. Even if short term rates rise by a few points, I'm still ahead in the long run. Are there questions I should be asking my fiduciary before pulling the trigger?

personalfinance,"Question about buying a second property, second mortgage etc","Hi All,

I wanted some advice on buying a second property and renting out my existing one.

I have a mortgage on my current house with an interest rate of 2.5% 30 year fixed and the monthly payment is 2k. I spoke to a few rental property management companies and they estimated the rent i could get for it is around 4k a month.

After doing some reading, i thought i had to convert my existing mortgage into a rental property mortgage so i was going to do a cash out refi and convert to investment loan, pull some cash out and then buy a new home to move into. I called my lender and the loan officer explained to me that i definitely do not have to convert the mortgage and it would be crazy to do that given the current rates.

First question: Is what he saying true? I thought i had to convert the mortgage to a property investment loan but seems like i got that wrong.

If what he is saying is true i need to find 50kish from somewhere else for a down payment, i have around 70k saved up, next house will be around 500k - 600k and want to put down 20% down on it.

Second question: he mentioned i should try a home equity loan but does anyone else have any other ideas? another idea is to pull it from my 401k and pay it back but i just wanted to run it by everyone here first to get your advice?

I make 200k a year and my fico score is around 815 right now, DTI is probably pretty low since i have a 2k mortgage payment and a 600 car payment but thats it.

personalfinance,85k+ in credit card debt: How to climb out of this massive hole,"**Background:** 40 years old. Share house with GF of 15 years (she's 45). I have about 85k of credit card debt. She has around 20k of credit card debt and has 10k of a car loan. We have no other debt other than our mortgage, which we owe 50k on. I have no retirement savings. GF has about 35k saved in retirement.

Our house has anywhere from 100-135k equity if sold today. However, the house is in semi-disrepair. It needs a new roof, heater, water heater, porch, main bathroom, plumbing, among several other issues. Easily 50k of repairs, though it would not be difficult to drop 100-150k to get things in a ""good"" state. 

*My debt is from about 5 years of not having an income*. I realize people should not be lazy and should work, but I was not in a good place mentally or even physically for a long time. I'm in a different place today and ready to face this problem head on.

She makes 40k/yr currently and I just got a job where I anticipate income in the 45k-50k/yr range. I don't think I'll be able to work a 2nd job as this job is a 2nd shift and I am expecting quite a bit of overtime (hence the 50k part of that range). 

**The problem:** We're over 100k in the hole in credit card debt, way over what our incomes can support. My credit card minimum payments are approaching 1,800 a month and climbing, due to rising interest rates. Some of that debt is on short term 0% promotional offers, but for the most part those are running out in the next few months.

**A solution?:** I don't see any way out of this other than to sell the house and try to find an affordable apartment/house to rent. Then focus all equity and extra income on debt repayment.

I'm very comfortable living within my means, budgeting, and saving for retirement *when I have a steady income*. My debt is literally only because I had virtually no income for so long. 

Is selling the house to pay down debt the best course forward? 2 bedroom apartment rents are less than ideal in this area. Anywhere, from 1200-2500/mo, with somewhere in the middle of that being normal.

If I still had 30k of credit card debt (and GF's was gone) I think I could handle a debt management plan with reasonable interest rates. Certainly not the interest rates I'm paying now, or will be paying if things continue as is.",finance,1651088103.0

We've talked about getting married for about 2 years now so itll probably happen and we'll get a better tax situation than now.

For debt I have my car which is about $16,700 at 6.69%. It's variable though because it's on an unsecured line of credit. Don't ask why because the short of it is I had to remove the lien on my car so I didn't have a choice, which really sucked.

The provincial loan I have is 3.2% at $5,566.54, but they're combined so I don't know if I can make extra payments toward just this part

Day before yesterday it was 27. 

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Now, what do we do now?

As I mentioned, we could bounce back. But things just aren't looking good on all fronts. It isn't I'm expecting a massive sell off. Between gas prices, increasing inflation, SEC vs XRP, normal markets are off a cliff, companies are pulling back their remote workers instead of saving money and letting them stay remote, the Fed hike soon, and so on. I'm not expecting us to go to a ATH any time soon.

Like we can easily jump back in the $40k-$45k. But it isn't worth noting until we hit $50k IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm doing is simply holding and doing my research. The reason why is you lose a lot less than what you gain with the price going down, and I don't expect the price to half what it is now. 

Lets use basic math to explain this. Lets assume price per coin is $100, you spent $1,000, and it goes down to $1. Your value now is $100

Now lets say the price is at $1 per coin, you put in $1,000 worth, and the price jumps to $100. You just 100x and you are worth $100,000.

So IMO the only reason to sell at a loss is if you 

1. Need the money now. Like you need to pay rent or whatever
2. You are using it to tax loss harvest
3. If you think you are at the peak of the price or it will take too long to recover and by putting it in other places you will recover faster. (Note taxes)

Because as long as if you have the money, and you think the price will come back up. You could just end up holding, buying more at a lower price and keep going.

So times like this, it is worth doing some research into whatever projects to see if they are actively working on whatever, to see what people think, to see if you should buy more or jump ship, and to figure out the chances of a speedy recovery. 

&amp;#x200B;

This applies far far far more to coins that just started last year. They should be already starting or already working on the project. And note all the projects should be taking a hit. Look even at the normal stock market, or look at a crypto heat map

I can get the money for a down payment and intend to save up as much as I can just to have it ready but getting into the home doesnt seem to be my problem, its having the continuous income to keep it without my bills outpacing me.

The only thing I can do at this point is keep saving money, it seems. I dont have any credit card debt, although I have close to $30k in credit available between them I dont use.

I tried to buy a Vanguard 2060 (VTTSX) retirement fund today with the first $2k I had put in, but the money looks like it's tied up in a ""Federal Money Market (Settlement Fund)"" when I try to purchase any retirement funds.  


How do I get the cash out of the settlement fund, so it's freed up to purchase the retirement fund?

personalfinance,Should we hold off on applying for a VA loan for a month or two or pull the trigger?,"My husband and me are wanting to buy a house before we become completely priced out of where we live. Home prices and rates are making it so in 6 months, we probably can't afford to buy a house and would have to move to another location. Don't want to do that because our kids would have to start all over for friends and school life.

Here is where we are:

\-Fico 2,4,5 are showing an average score of 580 for husband. Me 600.

\-This was due to medical debts (4) from 4 years ago (got severely sick) and went into collection. When we decided in February that we needed to look into buying a house, we got them negotiated and paid off and now waiting for our reports to reflect that.

\-Credit utilization was at 50% but we just paid it all off last month and waiting to reflect. We usually don't carry a balance but there was a small emergency in February. Our score dropped significantly (30 points) when we had the balance. Mind you, we only have a limit of $6,000.  Its not like we charged $25,000 or something. Our fault, still, I know. I had lost my debit card during the emergency and absentmindedly in a state of panic, used my credit card.

\-Last late payment was back in 2017 when Harvey hit Houston and to be honest, I wasn't thinking about paying off $25.00 of 4 credit cards when my home was flooding and the national guard was saving us. I forgot and paid as soon as things stabilized.

\-We had a personal loan last year when we were rebuilding from the medical collections and post Harvey late payments (2017), paid on time and paid off last month now.

\-Had two car loans, both good standing - just paid them off last month ($40,000 total)

\-Husband has a steady career since 2017. Makes a minimum of $105,200 a year. With his performance bonus, it can go up to $120,000 a year. Past 2 tax years, his income reflected $114,000 and $119,000.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, if we applied with the 580, would anyone even approve us. We have about $15,000 left over (not including our 401k) to put towards the house even though the VA loans say 0% down. We had $55,000 but used it all to make our debt $0.00. I know we could always refinance later, but we just don't want to apply if we will just flat out get denied - hurting our score all over again. Anyone with lender recommendations that could work with us?

Forgot to mention that the range we are trying to work with for a home is $350,000 since property taxes are high in Texas and so is home insurance due to hurricanes and factoring a 6% interest rate. This is still affordable with no car payments and no credit card payments now (our DTI right now without mortgage is 0%, with mortgage and insurance, taxes and hoas would be 38%).",finance,1651124133.0

I have had this loan a very long time, and I have kind of made the payments on autopilot, as it were.

CryptoCurrency,"Despite what people claim on this sub, inflation is BAD NEWS for crypto.","It's no secret inflation is running rampant across the globe.

As a means to curb inflation, banks are looking at raising their interest rates to suppress demand.

Unfortunately, rising interest rates across the globe means people with debt have bigger repayments and less free cash to splash, and it also makes people think twice before borrowing more money to spend on purchases. That's how it reduces demand.

With less cash to splash, it means people will be taking money out of discretionary investments like crypto first. Inflation is predicted to increase in the coming years which means we are very unlikely to see the next bull run in crypto for quite some time.

Despite what people say on this sub, this is the basic science of inflation and something you should ignore at your peril.

So long as inflation is running rampant, crypto will suffer. This could already be priced in and may be why we are seeing days of red. The golden question is - for how long?",cryptocurrency,1651138010.0

stocks,Can the stock market slump take the opportunity to buy the bottom? Wealthy investors: The worst may not be here,"Entering April, the market's expectation that the Fed will aggressively raise interest rates has continued to rise, and US stocks have also fallen sharply. What is even more surprising is that the data shows that as of April 27, the US Nasdaq Composite Index led the decline among the world's major stock indexes.

It's been a tough year for investors, and the wealthy are no exception. Both U.S. stocks and bonds have fallen this year, making portfolio conversations between Wall Street advisers and clients more challenging. The most conservative portfolios performed as badly or worse than the riskiest portfolios, with bonds offering little or no protection.

So is the moment to make most wealthy, seasoned investors think that the recent stock market volatility has been ""total zero"" and that it is time to buy the dip? Right now it doesn't appear to be the case.

**First, U.S. stocks fell, but most wealthy investors think it’s not a good time to hunt for dips**

A quarterly survey by Morgan Stanley's E-Trade conducted in the first two weeks of April found that only 49% of investors with $1 million or more in their stockbroking accounts believed U.S. stocks would trade at a higher rate. The second quarter ended with an uptick. The bullish sentiment reading among these wealthy investors slipped to 52% from 64% in the previous quarter.

Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Capital Management, said, ""We've just had a really turbulent quarter, and as expected, the bullish sentiment has subsided due to market changes.""

Twenty-eight percent of investors surveyed expect U.S. stocks to edge up in the quarter, and 18% think U.S. stocks will end the quarter barely flat. However, a closer look at the findings shows that many investors remain reluctant to bet that the stock market has bottomed, a view that has been reinforced this week by the decline in U.S. stocks.

""Investors have embraced the new reality we face together as investors,"" Loewengart said. He said that due to the current changes in stocks and bonds, there are opportunities to deploy capital, and the survey found that some investors are seeking new opportunities, but they are mainly taking a defensive stance and using inflation as the dominant force in investment decisions.

“The current environment is challenging for all investors. Millionaires are more sophisticated, they recognize volatility is part of the equity process and we have to live with it. At the same time millionaires can see through near-term pressures and wait to pick the right one. investment point.”

In fact, volatility is already expected by most people, and as a result, the percentage of millionaires who see volatility as the biggest risk to their portfolios has fallen—to 36% from 48% in the previous quarter.

**Second, The biggest portfolio risk cited by wealthy investors is inflation (not market volatility)**

An analysis of how wealthier and more seasoned investors are feeling now can start with the Fed. The Fed raised interest rates to fight inflation, but it risked pushing the economy further into recession.

More seasoned investors generally understand that the economy and markets are not the same thing, and that the Fed's hawkish turn (entering a rate hike cycle) is a direct byproduct of the strength of the economy. The Fed raised rates because it felt the economy was overheating from a price perspective and was confident that the economy was healthy enough to handle it.

But the views of the wealthy are divided: Among these wealthy investors, 38% expect a recession; 68% think the economy is healthy enough for the Fed to raise interest rates.

Another point worth mentioning is that the millionaires predict that the Fed will only raise rates two or three times. This could mean: either these investors are thinking about a 50 basis point or 75 basis point rate hike, and if the Fed gets more aggressive early in the cycle, two or three (rate hikes) could mean A full cycle; or they could be expecting the Fed to push the economy into recession after only a few rate hikes.

“All investors right now—whether wealthy or ordinary, individual or institutional—are facing an important question: Will the Fed have to take such a drastic step that it will tame inflation. The only way is to throw the economy into recession?"" Loewengart said.

""We don't know the answer. We've heard relative optimism from the Fed, but history doesn't support the possibility of a soft landing. But it's also a special time. To some extent we're in uncharted territory right now.""

Inflation (not market volatility) was the top portfolio risk cited by these investors, with 38% citing the risk of a recession this time around, up from 26% in the previous quarter, the survey showed.

**Third, the wealthy investors who hold cash have increased under inflation**

As stocks fell, some of the bubbles at the top of the market have dissipated, leading to a decrease in the share of millionaires who believe the market is at or near a bubble — from 71% in the last quarter to 57% in April, but that hasn’t helped them improve risk appetite.

Loewengart said the proportion of wealthy investors who said they would not make any changes to their portfolios fell — from 44 percent to 36 percent, a “significant drop.” “In the current market, investors shouldn’t be under pressure to make hasty decisions, but choosing where to invest and making rational decisions doesn’t mean doing nothing,” Loewengart said.

At the same time, more investors said they were adding cash. Among wealthy investors surveyed, the percentage of millionaires who said they had increased their cash due to rising interest rates rose from 24% to 31%, while there was also an increase among millionaire investors who said they invested in inflation-protected bonds — up from 25% to 32%.

Holding cash during inflationary times is a difficult problem. Because it doesn't help in an inflationary environment, though the increase in the number of investors holding cash may reflect concerns about continued market volatility. Rising volatility means more downside risk to equities, and cash may be the first choice to ride out the storm. Institutional investors did say it's always important to have cash on hand so that they can be ready to pounce when stock market valuations are low.

“We are in a special period and we know that inflation will cause cash to lose its purchasing power, but with the front end of the yield curve and ultrashort debt not immune to volatility, cash is getting more attention.”

""They still have confidence in the economy, they just don't have confidence in the market in the short term, and they're preparing for future rotations, and even further corrections in the future,"" Loewengart said.

**Fourth, where are the areas that wealthy investors are willing to invest in?**

Inflation now dominates all analysis of stock valuations by wealthy investors, the results of the survey's inquiry into S&amp;P 500 industry sector bets show. Energy, real estate and utilities were the most popular sectors this quarter, while some traditionally defensive sectors less closely tied to inflation, such as healthcare and financials, did not perform as well as one might expect.

""Inflation concerns are overriding everything, including taking a typical defensive position within the stock market,"" Loewengart said, which is why interest in energy, real estate and utilities is high, but not in financials. ""It's not surprising that there is strong investor interest in sectors that are expected to benefit from a prolonged period of high inflation,"" he said.

On the tech front, the percentage of investors showing a strong interest in tech stocks fell from the previous quarter after the tech sector’s rout this year – from 37% to 34% who made tech their preferred investment for the quarter .

Among non-traditional investments, commodities are getting a lot of attention from these investors - the percentage of millionaires who said they would increase their commodity investments increased from 11% to 22%.

However, Loewengart said, ""When we see the bright spot is commodities and energy stocks, it is difficult to point out to conservative investors, because we think that they as risk averse investors should not necessarily own commodities."" He said, ""Having a heavy position in the commodities space could cause problems in the future.""",finance,1651148094.0

stocks,U.S. economic growth rate unexpectedly declined in the first quarter by 1.4%,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/us-q1-gdp-growth.html

Gross domestic product unexpectedly declined 1.4% in the first quarter, marking an abrupt reversal for an economy coming off its best performance since 1984, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

The negative growth rate missed even the subdued Dow Jones estimate of a 1% gain for the quarter.


A plethora of factors conspired to weigh against growth during the first three months of 2022, which fell off a cliff following the 6.9% gain to close out last year.

Rising omicron infections to start the year hampered activity across the board, while inflation surging at a level not seen since the early 1980s and the Russia invasion of Ukraine also contributed to the economic stasis.

Prices increased sharply during the quarter, with the price index for gross domestic purchases surging 7.8% in the three-month period, following a 7% gain in the fourth quarter of 2021.

While recession expectations on Wall Street remain low, there’s further trouble ahead: In an effort to combat burgeoning price increases, the Federal Reserve plans to enact a series of rate hikes aimed at slowing growth further.

Current market pricing indicates the equivalent of 10 quarter-percentage-point interest rate moves that would take the Fed’s benchmark interest rate to about 2.75% by the end of the year. That comes after two years of near-zero rates aimed at allowing a recovery from the steepest recession in U.S. history.

Along with that, the Fed has halted its monthly bond-buying program aimed at keeping rates low and money flowing through the economy. The Fed will start shrinking its current bond holdings as soon as next month, slowly at first then ultimately at a pace expected to hit as high as $95 billion a month.

While economists still largely expect the U.S. to skirt an outright recession, risks are rising.

Goldman Sachs sees about a 35% chance of negative growth a year from now. In a forecast that is an outlier on Wall Street, Deutsche Bank sees the chance of a “significant recession” hitting the economy in late 2023 and early 2024, the result of a Fed that will have tighten much more to tamp down inflation than forecasters currently anticipate.

That all comes after a year in which GDP rose at a 5.7% pace, the fastest since 1984. While consumer expenditures, which account for nearly 70% of the U.S. economy, drove growth in the first half of 2021, an inventory rebuild from the depleted pandemic levels accounted for almost all the growth in the final two quarters of the year.

Sustaining that growth into 2022 will require an easing in clogged supply chains and some resolution in Ukraine, both of which will face pressures from higher interest rates from not just the Fed but also global central banks that are engaged in a similar struggle against inflation.",finance,1651149608.0

 **DP annualized, quarter-over-quarter:** \-1.4% vs. 1.0% expected

The decrease in real GDP reflected decreases in private inventory investment, exports, federal government spending, and state and local government spending, while imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased.

personalfinance,Question on my Car Refinance,"I bought a car back in November. At the time, I was considered a first time buyer because of my credit history. The dealer I bought the car from said that the car I chose would be financed at around $10k. After about 2-3 weeks, a company financed my car, but for $14k and an extremely high interest rate. I needed the car, so I went with it, assuming I could stick with it and refinance eventually. Now, my credit is good, and my credit union is offering a refinance, but because I was given so much more than originally promised, and because it's 140% over market value, they aren't sure I'll be able to refinance it. I've gotten ahold of the dealer, to ask if certain things like the lifetime drive train warranty or anything else can be refunded to bring the loan down, but I haven't gotten any response. Is there anything I can do, or any tips on securing a refinance?",finance,1651152785.0

CryptoCurrency,Why am I against Elon Musk? Because he made meme coins a trend,"Recently I had a top post about brief Doge price hike and why people still trust Elon after all he is done and you guys showed a lots of support. 
Still a big minority bombarded me with different allegations. From being a hater to ""butt hurt cause you didn't buy Doge"".
Today I want to tell you why I, like many others here, found Elon toxic for crypto.


















Before Elon started shilling Doge it was a simple meme coin with a fraction of its current value. Very soon after Elon started generating hype around it Doge value sky rocketed. 
Now that by itself is not bad. I have nothing against Doge. And I love it when people make profit of crypto. Not because I am such a saint.  Because it is good for crypto which means it is good for me.





















Then came Shib. Elon again started shilling it. And Shib went from being a Doge ""spin-off"" to the next big thing in a matter of months. Now Elon himself has a huge bag of both. So he made hundreds of millions if not billions in the process. Now remember, money don't appear out of thin air (unless you are federal reserve). Many people invested in those two coins. Early buyers made huge profits while those who entered the market at top suffered huge losses (remember 1$ Doge myth?).
















Now I have my suspicion about market manipulation by mr Musk but he is innocent until proven otherwise. Least I can say is that his backtrack from his previous promises and public bashing of coin he himself promoted looks really wrong if not shady. But my main problem is something else.



















 
Specially after Shib's astronomical success, people learned that by making a meme coin and shilling it they can make millions. Specially if someone famous was promoting it. And so the golden age of meme coins started. You can see it by the amount of dog and cat coins out there. They are Doge and Shib's unwanted children. And people losing money investing in them hoping they become the next Shib. 




















It is a game that Elon Musk started. He was the one who popularized ""Buy a meme coin and get rich before a year"" mindset. A game that took millions of victims so far. Of course Elon did not made all those shitcoins himself, nor he shilled them to scam people, but he opened the way and made it trendy. And the biggest victim is the crypto market itself which now looks like a circus full of shitcoins and scams.",cryptocurrency,1651159269.0

1) This print is a surprise for most economists. Feds have been hawkish because of an overheated economy. You can't say the economy is over heated when it's -1.4%.  Powell might become more dovish after the May hike.

2) Everyone was predicting rate hikes to 3-3.5% to trigger a recession, slow the economy, and drop inflation.  Well folks, another negative quarter and we have recession before the summer is over. Feds could see recession after raising rates by another 50-100 bps. Rates could top out at 1.5-2%.  This is still extremely low historically.

3) Inflation might begin to decline with slowing global growth. Oil usage drops on lower demand. Shipping and supply chains improve with slowing demand and covid becoming endemic.

We closed two weeks ago with a 4.05% rate and we currently have about $1000 worth of monthly debt. Our mortgage is $1850 a month. We’ve gotten this crazy idea to try and maybe sell our home for a $150k profit because the builder has a long waitlist for their homes, and there are a ton of people willing to pay cash to get into these homes. If we sold we’d be able to pay off all of our debt like our credit cards, payoff our car, and some medical bills we have. We have about 35k in debt. Factoring that debt payoff of 35k, capital gains of about 30k, and closing costs of about 28k we’d have about 55k left to put away in savings or invest. Only issue is that now that the interest rates are spiking if we wanted to rent or eventually buy again our payment would probably be in $2600-2800 range. Pretty much we would be replacing our debt we pay monthly with a house payment instead. BUT we’d also have a huge savings. So what do you guys think? We take the chance and sell it or do we keep the low interest rate we have along with all the debt that we’re barely able to make the minimums on.

UPDATE: had a talk with the husband and we’re going to take everyone’s advice, buckle down and pay off this debt with a serious budget and possibly look into the home equity loan (need to research into this don’t know much about pros and cons) thanks for snapping us out of it, we were way to focused on the short term and not the long term.

Of course this still requires regulatory approval in the US and Europe but fears on this are overblown imo, it's hard to argue exactly how this transaction provides Microsoft any real monopolistic power.

Recently passed my Accounting exams.

I do 5/6k a year in mileage atm (when I do travel I travel far which is why I don’t think a cheap run about is worth it).

I would be keeping this car for 10 years so I wouldn’t be going from car loan to car loan.

This cars tax band is lower (Saving £120 per year) and is more fuel efficient (Predicted to save - based on forum advice roughly £30 a month).

The loan interest rate is 2% and the amount borrowed would be 17k with a 5k deposit. However I have done the rough compound interest calculation and it done make me think twice.

* I have 53K in checking/savings accounts. I am wanting to buy a house/condo soon.
* 23K in employer provided 401K (they match 50% of contribution up to 6%, I have been contributing 6% since higher date)
* I have 3000 dollars left of my student loan and plan on wiping that out when Repayment is required.
* 9000 left on a car loan for a car I plan on keeping for at least another 5-7 years. (interest rate 5.3%, about 3 years left on loan term). Car currently valued at 19K according to KBB.

I feel like my finances have been on auto pilot for the last few years, I need to fix that. My major concern is that I am not saving enough for retirement. My current plan is too:

* increase 401K contribution to 12%. Currently the investment is ""balanced"" should I go a higher risk route to make up for lost time?
* Open a fully fund an IRA (unsure of roth or traditional). I think I will just max it out when I open it.
* I could wipe out the debt now, or have it handled in a year. Part of me wants to keep the money liquid for the down payment on a house. the other part of me hates debt and wants it gone and out of the way.

CryptoCurrency,Contender for Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Poilievre plans to quash Bank of Canada’s CBDC plans if elected,"Conservative leadership contender Pierre Poilievre promised Thursday he'd spike the Bank of Canada's proposal to offer a digital currency, saying this sort of financial instrument should be left to the private sector.

Poilievre has emerged as a fierce critic of Canada's central bank. He's tried to link decades-high inflation to its COVID-era policy of quantitative easing and recently slammed the institution as ""financially illiterate.""

Poilievre is a big proponent of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. He has suggested that Canadians can ""opt out"" of inflation by pouring money into these investments, and he doesn't want the Bank of Canada to offer a competing product.

According to a policy backgrounder supplied to reporters, the Poilievre campaign is concerned that a push to ""nationalize"" deposits would lead to ""politicized banking.""

The backgrounder suggests a deposit-accepting central bank would be akin to a state-run bank and politicians could ""bestow blessings on voters"" and ""begin making election promises of more generous interest rates for depositors or other benefits.""

Poilievre also raised the spectre of the Bank of Canada tracking the financial history of its would-be depositors. ""It can surveil what you're doing, what you're spending and potentially abuse your civil liberties,"" Poilievre said.

The bill calls for making federal judges follow similar disclosure requirements as lawmakers by establishing a 45-day window for judges to report stock trades of more than $1,000.

Under it, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts must also create a searchable and publicly accessible online database of judicial financial disclosure forms posted within 90 days of being filed. It calls for the database to be online within 180 days of enactment, though the judiciary can obtain extensions.

datascience,Evaluating 3rd Party Products,"I work for a pretty big company with a very scattered organization. There are a few unrelated data science teams, and a lot of other teams aren't familiar with the work we do. There is a big push around investing in data science (hence my team being built out and trying to find its footing), but that's led to every team trying to buy whatever product that bills itself as being AI-driven.


We're in the process of evaluating a lot of these products to see if they really do what they claim to do, or if it makes sense to build a product internally (either as a cost savings mechanism or just to get a better product). 


That's put me in this uncomfortable space where I'm asking these companies ""so uh... how does your AI work?"" and it feels like I'm asking them to reveal their own IP. On the one hand, I totally get wanting to keep your proprietary methods secret. But on the other hand, if you really believe in your product, you should be able to defend it from technical scrutiny (without totally revealing your secrets).


I've gotten mixed responses. Sometimes I get connected with their data scientists who seem eager to answer questions, as if they are excited that somebody is actually interested in their work for once. Other times I get stonewalled and fed the same marketing speak that you can find on their website. When that happens, it's hard to tell if the company is selling snake oil or if they are just being protective of their methods. I personally think companies (or at least, the ones in the spaces I'm talking to) should err on the side of transparency.


 Most of these products are unrelated to our core business functions and are just traditional things every company deals with (marketing, accounting, etc.), and so I certainly believe there is some value to be added by a 3rd party company aggregating data from various industries (as opposed to my team building a model using only internal data). 


I want to know if their ""AI"" models are like... ""we took an average"" or ""we built a neural net."" I want accuracy metrics and the types of things that weren't presented to my marketing team that bought the product.


Does anybody have experience navigating this space? Like, what is fair to ask, or more importantly, what is fair to expect an answer on when it comes to asking other companies about their ""AI"" products?


And then as a related topic, does anybody have experience navigating the internal politics of what I'm describing above? I may know data science well, but the e.g. accounts receivable director knows accounts receivables really well too. So when I'm asked to give my input on an ""AI-powered"" accounts receivable tool that we're considering purchasing, I'm conflicted on how much my opinion should even matter.",technology,1651182251.0

cybersecurity,Salary information and Job titles/Certs after 20+ years in IT/Infosec,"Helpdesk to CISO.

&amp;#x200B;

There seems to be a lot of questions about career progression, wasting time in helpdesk, and the desire to jump right into the high paying jobs. I’m not here to tell you that is impossible, I’m here to show you my career progression. I hope that some people interested in the field will gain some comfort knowing that hard work pays off, and you’re not a loser if you don’t jump directly into a 6-figure job. I very obviously do not want my personal information readily available on the internet, so “throwaway,” but I also want to share salary information, so people get the full picture. Please be kind to a professional trying to help out the next generation and keep your OpSec investigations for someone else? 😊

This data was taken from the Social Security Administration page, so it is based on Adjusted Gross Income, and thus doesn’t reflect perfectly what I was paid as tax deferred savings like 401k are not represented, and some years had bonus $$$ while others didn’t. This data represents work on the West Coast of the United States primarily in a big city with a HCOL. There is a middle bit where I moved to a LCOL area but moved back to the same HCOL later.

Salary Tables

[https://imgur.com/Ppy99MK](https://imgur.com/Ppy99MK)

(Sorry for the image link, I gave up trying to paste an excel table into reddit after the github pages that supposedly make it easy didn't work. Also r/cybersecurity doesn't seem to allow images. )

**Some things I would like you to keep in mind.**

My salary progression stalled more often when employed by the same company for longer periods of time. This does not mean I think that job hopping is a useful goal, but it does mean that after a time-frame I consider around 2 years, if you’re not getting what you want from a job it’s time to look elsewhere.

I avoided certifications when I worked in IT because:

1. I was young and dumb
2. Many Certs did not hold the weight then, that they do now
3. I was not mentored well in my early years

The technical part of the job is the easy part, and none of it is a waste of your time. Whether you’re learning technical skills, security skills, communication skills, or office skills, they ALL make you a better person, a better professional, and a better candidate for jobs.

I would rate communication skills as the most valuable skill to nurture in yourself. The ability to speak and write in a clear and easy to understand manner so that others can understand what you are trying to communicate, will benefit your long-term success more than any technical skill I know. A healthy dose of curiosity would be rated second, as the most successful people I know in this field are curious about every granular detail.

These jobs have spanned multiple industries, from energy, federal defense, local government, and the financial sector. I’ve never worked for a FAANG company or start up, and don’t plan to.

I do not have a college degree and do not plan to pursue one currently. That doesn’t mean I feel they are useless, but as with many certifications it is what you learn during the process that is of value.

You are what people will evaluate when hiring, not your alma mater, what you scored on your cert exam, or what your prowess is on hack the box. When writing your resume ensure that you highlight why your skills are valuable and what you’ve done with them. The people interviewing you have a pretty good idea what THEY want you to do with your skills, and anyone who communicates on a resume that they already know how their skills are best utilized, are the candidates that stand out from the rest.

I’ll do my best to questions if anyone has any.

&amp;#x200B;

\*UPDATE\*

  

Based on some of the responses I’d like to add some context around the salary data. My goal for most of my career was to have a good work/life balance. I specifically did not chase higher wages in more challenging positions. I was a bachelor and able to pay my bills, fund my 401k, and that was enough for me. You can see the length of time I spent at some companies and the reason I stayed so long was because I was able to fulfill the job duties with a very low effort on my part. At the time I thought I was ahead of the game if I only had to work 2-3 hours a day. I could take long lunches, play video games, and generally do what I wanted if I was available when needed, and able to respond to my job requirements efficiently. So, what happened in 2019? I got married. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m “mostly” comfortable with the fact that I did not challenge myself fully until recently in my career, as I was able to do some amazing things in my youth. Don’t let my data be the stick you measure yourself against for success. Measure yourself against only yourself, and if you’re happy that is all that matters.

&amp;#x200B;

I will also add that I did not plan for a senior management role. My career has been about chasing what was interesting to me. The offer of the role of CISO has become very interesting with the ability to influence how the company approaches security as a whole.",technology,1651184095.0

personalfinance,Hi! Newly self employed with own business here and I need help understanding taxes.,"Hi, so I'm a new self employed business that started the week after the first quarter date (April 15, 2022). I didn't pay any taxes last year in 2021 as I didn't work. I'm a private vocal coach and I just realized that self employment taxes are different than your usual w2. This is the only source of income I have and I have several questions.  I also live in the state of California.

&amp;#x200B;

1. If I started my business after the 1st quarter, would I get dinged for not paying the first quarter?
2. Because I started this business in late April, when estimating what my annual income would be, should I account the amount for 9 months instead of 12 since I did not work the first three months?

**I understand that this number isn't going to be the exact number**, but if someone could run estimate numbers for me (Including SE tax, state, and federal please) I'd really appreciate it! I am at loss on guessing my estimated income (Since this is my first year of business I don't know if I'm even going to have students the next 9 months) and how much I'd be paying quarterly roughly and at the end of the year when I file annual taxes. 

My hourly pay is $30 and I only work 7 hours a week meaning weekly I get $2\`\`10  
Monthly I assume that'd be $840. I also don't have any deductibles, I'm going to file single as well and not head of household. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I know if I don't have a tax record the previous year and it's my first year of business I don't have to pay estimated taxes, however I just want to start doing the quarterly pay already since I don't know what my financial situation is going to look like at the end of the year when I file annually and don't want to pay a big sum all at once.",finance,1651186978.0
economy,I have a theory.,"The world market for oil and gas is mainly denominated in dollars.  So when the the dollar experiences inflation, that generates windfall prices for oil and gas.  If Europeans want to forgo Russian gas, that makes a situation with few alternative, cost-effective sources.  One way to pull the rug out from under producer countries like Russia is to thus penalize ourselves by aggressively reducing demand by busting inflation.  That is obviously a blunt tool.  But the point is that if the Fed were to be more aggressive about busting inflation, sort of how Volcker did it in the early 80's, it could go a long way toward embarrassing Putin's expansion plans.  With lower demand, there would be more producers eager to sell oil and gas to Europe.  Remember how Reagan salvaged the economy?  Star Wars and tax cuts.  That really amounted to a Keynesian stimulus, albeit with very Republican overtones.  Unfortunately, I never saw such tendencies from Trump.",finance,1651189919.0

personalfinance,Finding Goldilocks: Becoming a First-time Homeowner,"Finding Goldilocks to become a First-Time Homeowner

I've found myself trying to find the sweet spot between saving/investing and not panicking with the recent increase in home prices/interest rates. I have a quite a bit of regret not buying 2 years ago when prices were about 40-70k less in my area and interest rates were low. The homes I'm looking at cost about the 240-270k range and will be built in the year and half or two.
I was thinking of putting my money in I-bonds. Giving me the guaranteed growth in a year and not having the mere 0.4% APY Navy Federal is giving me.

I also want to thank this sub for teaching me so much and providing a lot of resources as a lot of this is new to me being the first in my family to be in the position I'm in. I'm excited to keep growing and learning with all of you!

About me:
I'm 27 years old. Graduated college from my Masters 3 years ago in Mechanical Engineering and began working at the current job as a 0855 Series (Fed). 

A little bit about my finances:
I make $79k a year. (Yearly Increases anticipated)
I'm putting 20% from my paycheck to my TSP with an additional 5% match.
After deductions my pay is $3,150 Monthly.
I live at home with my grandparents and have no debt except the $3,125 Remaining on my car loan and around $1,300 in CC debt which I expect to pay in full at the end of the month.

My only expenses are: 
Car insurance: $91 
Car Payment: $231/ Monthly 
Bills/Gas/Food/Etc.: ~$550

Assets:
Cash: $18,036
TSP: $22,128
Webull: $5,000
ROTH IRA: $7,240 (On my way to maximizing it this year 1,000/6,000 contributed)

Questions:
- Put money into I-Bonds before May 1st for guaranteed/safe growth since I'm not looking to buy 1-2 years from now? 
- Reduce TSP contribution to grow cash assets for a bigger down payment/furniture/appliances? (Literally don't have anything)
- Fully pay off car? (5.65 % Interest Rate)
- Are the price ranges of the homes I'm looking at acceptable for my salary? (I know this is a common one asked here sorry)
- Or drop the idea of buying a home and stay at my current position saving more in order to wait out the current market?

&gt;  
&gt;The top leadership vowed on Friday to speed up implementation of existing tax-cut and supportive policies, as well as the use of new monetary policy tools and effective investment, while also refining regulatory policies, according to a statement following a quarterly economic meeting of the 25-member Politburo, the centre of power within the Communist Party headed by President Xi Jinping.  
&gt;  
&gt;Specifically, the widely watched Politburo meeting said that leadership will actively respond to the concerns and appeals of foreign investors, which have been greatly affected during fresh waves of coronavirus outbreaks that began last month.  
&gt;  
&gt;The meeting also showed signs that leaders may be keen on loosening their tight controls on internet and property developers.

Personally, this has been long in the making. Pretty obvious that the while the idea of Big Tech Regulation is needed in some form (and being explored by most major economies) the implementation was horrible and has done more harm than good. We could see an end to the DiDi Probe, resolution on Audit Access, and less aggressive market regulation coming. 

I'm expecting Beijing to walk back their Tutoring Regulation in the coming year or two as well. It'll still be heavily regulated - but considering how it was a major employer of Chinese Graduates - along with Big Tech - Chinese Regulators basically shot their two biggest growth sectors dead and are slowly but surely backtracking.

I'm expecting a swing back from heavy regulation towards tolerance towards disorderly capital. Although, considering how many people got burned, the biggest issue is the credibility factor. I'm unsure how or what Chinese Government could do to regain the trust of foreign investors.

Regardless - I'm bullish on China, always have been. Zero COIVID will eventually end and China will begin a slow - but steady - backtrack from draconian regulations.",finance,1651214226.0

personalfinance,We discovered our elderly uncle hasn't paid tax for the last 3 years. I have just been given financial POA to help out. I am overwhelmed.,"My uncle is in his 80's and lives in an assisted living facility in Illinois.

It's come to my family's attention that he no longer keeps track of his finances - and his portfolio is anything but simple.

He has failed to file his taxes for the last 3 years.

Uncle's brother (my dad) lives outside of the US and so I've been tasked with trying to help sort his affairs. I have established financial POA but I am not financially savvy and am overwhelmed to say the least.

He has stocks that I've found have been forfeited to the state due to dormancy. I'm doing paperwork to reclaim that from the Illinois treasury.

He has maybe a dozen different IRA accounts open across 4 different banks. Some of them worth 6 figures. We're regaining access to each bank account one at a time as I discover most of these accounts have been deemed ""dormant"".

My mission is to pay off all his delinquent taxes and penalties and set up a living trust for him.

I'm working with an estate attorney and the living trust is currently being drafted.

The tax is what is currently overwhelming me.. I've gotten in touch with uncle's old accountant who has done his taxes for a long time.

He is asking for me to locate all sorts of 1099 forms etc. that I simply don't have. And neither does my uncle. He hasn't been keeping his mail. He's got it together enough to know who I am and grant POA but legit doesn't care / remember that he has all these assets spread out everywhere. He's basically too old to give a f about paying his tax.

How on earth do I do this properly..? What is the best way to approach this to recover all necessary paperwork (1099s etc.) for the accountant..?? And to make sure I locate all of his assets..?

Is there a professional we can hire to do this for us? It's a lot of forensic work that goes back a few years. (federal and state tax for 2019, 2020, and 2021)

CryptoCurrency,"Project Hamilton, created by the FED of Boston and MIT, is most likely the framework for the US CBDC.","CBDCs are on their way to the US whether we want it or not; we're already lagging. Nine countries have fully launched a central bank digital currency, and 87 countries (representing over 90 percent of global GDP) are exploring a CBDC.

After doing a little research on what CBDCs are built on, because I'm partly terrified of CBDCs, and I wanted to learn more about them, I stumbled on Project Hamilton, which sounds like it might be the US's CBDC framework. 

It currently states that it's just a proof of concept, but it has to start somewhere. The paper and the accompanying code demonstrate the technical feasibility of a system that solves payments on a scale like the United States and the US Dollar. The system can handle more than one hundred thousand payments per second, where each transaction has to complete in less than 5 seconds. 

**Per their executive summary:**

""The processor's baseline requirements include time to finality of less than five seconds, throughput of greater than 100,000 transactions per second, and wide-scale geographic fault tolerance. ""

One interesting thing about this project is the focus on privacy. It aims to be like fiat, without physicality; the freedom for users to pay others using CBDC without relying on intermediaries like banks or credit card companies, with the privacy of fiat. 

**Per their executive summary and their focus for phase 2:**

""We found that separating a transaction processor into modular components improves system scalability and flexibility; for example, we can scale and replicate transaction validation independently from preventing double-spending and committing transactions, and our architecture can support many future designs for programmability and privacy.""

Bitcoin,A List of Points about Bitcoin mining missed when comparing Bitcoin vs VISA,"Not necessarily complete, but this is my list.  The argument against mining is two fold.  1) Mining is wasteful, and 2) there are better ways to secure crypto.

To disparage Bitcoin, Bitcoin is often compared to VISA.  Hence the following list of observations and facts:

&amp;#x200B;

* Mining done today on Bitcoin continues to secure the blockchain forevermore. It is an investment in security that continues to secure the blockchain record.
* Bitcoin's mining has created the most hardened data structure in existence.
* Bitcoin is the sole issuer of Bitcoin tokens.
* Bitcoin provides security for accounts that hold bitcoin on chain
* Bitcoin provides all if its security for any cryptographic structure (files, Merkle Trees, protocols) that anchors into Bitcoin
* Bitcoin Mining can be optimized for lowering carbon output by following market incentives
   * Waste energy is cheaper than wholesale energy (gas flares, excess wind/solar, geothermal, etc.)
   * Mining is trivial to locate at source (eliminating transmission loss)
* Bitcoin can support transactions on chain between the accounts it creates and secures
* The Bitcoin blockchain is a settlement layer for all sorts of Bitcoin transactions off chain, which arguably are more carbon efficient than VISA
* Bitcoin supports lightning transactions
   * Lightning is peer to peer
   * Lightning only requires the exchange of transactions peer to peer (a bit more complicated when routing through channels though)
   * Lightning has no need for vast server farms to support it. 
   * Lightning likely is very light weight compared to VISA (though we have no numbers for Lightning that I know of)
* Bitcoin supports custodial transactions between parties (equivalent to what VISA provides for banks).
   * PayPal, Coinbase, Cash App, etc. all provide Bitcoin transactions with no more carbon footprint than VISA
* VISA is *not* a settlement layer for dollars and does not ever serve that role.
* Banking (from Central Banks to Credit unions), FedWire, Swift, ATMs, Cash systems (including armored trucks to move around paper and coins) collectively match the functions Bitcoin provides.
* We have very few numbers for the Carbon produced by banks.
* The ratio of the budget for mining vs the Value/Transactions of Bitcoin Network approaches zero over time due to Bitcoin halving.  
* In the future fees can continue to support mining for Bitcoin. 
   * Bitcoin may become fee supported either by increasing fees or by increasing blocksize
   * Very high fees will still be affordable for settling accounts between 2nd layer solutions
   * Technology may advance to the point Bitcoin Developers may except larger blocks
   * Vested interests (governments that use Bitcoin as legal tender and Corporations that use Bitcoin for payments, for example) may choose to provide support for mining
* The Value of Bitcoin has been growing faster than the halving of the rewards for mining have been declining
* The carbon footprint for a dollar's value in Bitcoin exchanged by two parties by any means has absolutely gone down year over year by developing payment rails.
* The carbon footprint for a dollar's value in Bitcoin exchanged by two parties by any means has absolutely halved every four years by the halving of rewards in Bitcoin to miners.
* We don't have *any reasonable estimates* for the average cost in carbon of a consumer's Bitcoin transaction that includes all the transactions typical between two bitcoin users of any type.
* We don't have *any reasonable estimates* for the average cost in carbon of a consumer's dollar transaction that includes all the transactions typical between two dollar users of any type.",cryptocurrency,1651239239.0

personalfinance,Cash vs Pay off SL vs “Low” risk investment,"I’m looking to do something with my money right now and looking to crowdsource some ideas. I have a bunch of student loans that I’m looking to deal with in some way. I have two different types of student loans, the bulk is some that I refinanced/consolidated at around a 3% interest rate and the rest is federal loans at around 5% interest. Due to the freezes I still don’t have to pay anything for the federal yet.

My goal is to be able to pay off my loans in 5-7 years while not stressing myself otherwise financially and being able to save for retirement and other things. My original plan was to put whatever extra money I wanted to put towards paying off loans on top of my bare minimum payment in a brokerage account in “low” (not trying to hit home runs) risk assets that would hopefully average 7-8% annually and I would be able to use the compound growth over 5-7 years to help pay off the loans faster. However there are reports coming out now that this decade may have overall slower growth than the previous decade since it was so good before (mean reversion). This has me doubting this plan and thinking that maybe I should try something else like just holding cash (not totally happy cause of inflation) or just paying off extra on the loan and locking in a 3% return. Also wanted to add, if I lost all my money in my brokerage I’d still be totally fine paying off my loans in 10 years comfortably.

**Hackers find 122 vulnerabilities, 27 deemed critical, during first round of DHS bug bounty program**  
These vulnerabilities were found by more than 450 security researchers who were working through the Department of Homeland Security’s “Hack the DHS” bug bounty program, which started in December 2021. The researchers, who were vetted by the agency before participating, were eligible to receive between $500 and $5,000 for verified vulnerabilities, depending on the severity. The DHS has not disclosed the vulnerabilities that were found, nor did it share any information about fixes for the bugs. Under original plans for the DHS program, the agency would verify the flaws within 48 hours of being notified, and fix them within 15 days — or, for more complex bugs, develop a plan to address them.

**AWS’s Log4j patches blew holes in its own security**  
Amazon Web Services has updated its Log4j security patches after it was discovered the original fixes made customer deployments vulnerable to container escape and privilege escalation. The vulnerabilities introduced by Amazon’s Log4j hotpatch – CVE-2021-3100, CVE-2021-3101, CVE-2022-0070, CVE-2022-0071 – are all high-severity bugs rated 8.8 out of 10 on the CVSS. “We recommend that customers who run Java applications in containers, and use either the hotpatch or Hotdog, update to the latest versions of the software immediately,” the cloud giant said in a security bulletin on Tuesday.

**Mandiant finds record zero-days in 2021**  
According to the security firm’s annual report, disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities exploded in 2021, more than doubling the previous 2019 record with 80. Most of the zero-days tracked by Mandiant were exploited by APT groups. Since it began tracking in 2012, Mandiant reports that China exploited more zero-days than any other nation. The growth in zero-days mirrors a report from Google’s Project Zero, which also saw a record number of zero-days in 2021. However Project Zero believed this was due to better industry disclosure rather than just an increase in zero-days discovered.

**Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover could be bad for security and privacy**  
After this week’s announcement that Twitter has accepted Elon Musk’s $44 billion purchase offer, cybersecurity experts fear that Musk’s open source vision for the platform may make it more susceptible to malicious actors. Experts are expressing concerns about open source vulns such as Log4Shell and also the potential for “gaming” the algorithm to treat people differently based on their personal characteristics. Additional concerns are being raised by Privacy advocates regarding Musk potentially implementing real-name policies, overriding anonymity and pseudonymity which protects the identities of those whose opinions do not align with those in power.

**Stormous Ransomware targets Coca Cola**  
On Tuesday, Coca Cola admitted that some of its systems were potentially hit by a ransomware variant but says it is still investigating the incident. Meanwhile, Stormous Ransomware group released a statement that it has stolen about 161GB of data from Coca-Cola and is intending to sell the data if its ransom demands were ignored. Coke announced last month that it is withdrawing business from the Russian Federation because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which some are speculating could have precipitated the attack by the Stormous gang who have been trying to make money through supporting Russia’s political agenda.

**Two-thirds of organizations hit with ransomware**  
According to Sophos’ State of Ransomware 2022 report, 66% of organizations surveyed were hit with a ransomware attack last year, up from just 37% in 2020. This comes as the ransom’s paid by organizations increased nearly five-fold on the year to an average of $812,360. 11% of organizations said they paid ransoms over $1 million, up from 4% in 2020. Organizations paying less than $10,000 dropped to 21%. Overall 46% of organizations that had data encrypted paid ransoms, including 26% of organizations that were able to restore data from backups. 83% of mid-size organizations had cyber insurance policies, with 98% of incidents paying out for costs incurred, including 40% covering ransoms themselves.

They are also going to be starting school and are in the process of applying for student loans. They would need ~$16K to cover the costs of schooling for 2 years, so about the same as the current cash-out check they hold.

Would you recommend they continue to take out student loans (~4.4% interest rate) which have interest accrual/repayment grace periods?

As well as then maybe investing the original $15K into some kind of investment vehicle that could beat out the 3.875% rate?

energy,Hydrocarbons for democracies,"If the EU and UK impose a total embargo on Russian energy, it will not lead (as one might think) to painful fundamental energy shifts. It's just that this will result in a redistribution of markets around the world, where Russia will lose a significant part of income off hydrocarbon sales.

Unfortunately, Russia will retain the opportunity to sell oil and gas to other countries (PRC, India, and Turkey), but at much smaller volumes and, accordingly, with significantly lower profits. Especially considering that Russia is already actively selling its oil, released after the U.S. and Canada embargoed it, to India with a massive 30% discount!

As for the substitution of Russian hydrocarbon supplies for Europe, mathematically, there are no problems with the volumes that need to be replenished. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar have already pledged to significantly increase oil output. It is also possible to establish cooperation in the field of oil supplies with Iran and Venezuela. These countries have challenged a number of principles of the West, as a result of which some countries have severed trading relations with them, while others, like the United States, have imposed sanctions on them. But, since neither Iran nor Venezuela have resorted to an open external aggression on a far-fetched pretext (like the Russian Federation), the West can move to resume oil supplies from these two nations. In addition, fixing things in Libya would also greatly contribute to increasing oil supplies to Europe, reducing instability in North Africa, and even lowering the influence of the Russian Federation, which has runs training camps for mercenaries in southern Libya (as well as in Chad and the Central African Republic).

As for LNG supplies to the EU, over the past five years, Qatar, Nigeria, and Algeria have already become important players. In general, the largest capacities to liquefy gas are available to Qatar (77 million tons), Australia (66 million tons), Malaysia (29.3 million tons), Indonesia (26.5 million tons), and Algeria (25.3 million tons). Potentially, they could either deliver LNG to Europe themselves, or play their part in the global redistribution of LNG supplies. The United States has also pledged to send as much oil and LNG as possible to the EU and UK to replace energy resources produced by the nation of resurgent totalitarianism that is wreaking havoc and death in all neihgboring countries.

But, while everything is mathematically fine with the required volumes (that is, they are guaranteed to be extracted from the earth bowels), serious problems remain with their delivery. To transport ""black gold,"" special tankers are needed, while shipping gas requires high-tech installations for liquefying gas on the exporters’ side, and tankers, receiving platforms, and terminals for storing LNG on the part of the European importers. All this will require several tens of billions of dollars, but this is less of a problem – money will be found.

The main disadvantage is time shortage, since neither the tanker fleet nor the infrastructure required for LNG can be built swiftly. Therefore, in the near future, the EU may announce a partial embargo on Russian hydrocarbons (which will also be a very unpleasant blow for Moscow). But, if the EU takes a firm political decision and shows an iron will, a complete embargo on energy carriers from the Russian Federation is also not far off.

In addition, for European democracies, it’s not oil but gas dependence on Russia that’s more significant. However, Russia, the country that has unleashed its mad war in Ukraine, is not the only gas producer out there. The UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway will now focus more on getting gas from the sea shelves of the North and Norwegian Seas.

Poland and Denmark are completing the construction of the Baltic Pipe pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, which will deliver gas from fields on the Norwegian shelf. The technical launch of the gas pipeline is scheduled for October 1, 2022, and the start of commercial deliveries is scheduled for January 1, 2023.

Italy plans to receive more gas from Algeria (through Tunisia), while Greece and the Balkan states – from Azerbaijan. Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic are so far in a more difficult position in this regard.

Of course, Germany is in the most difficult situation in terms of accelerating diversification of gas supplies, since as much as 50% (!) of natural gas flows into the country from Russia (24% from Norway, another 20% from the Netherlands, while only about 6% is produced in Germany ). However, Germany is now rapidly completing construction of four LNG terminals: Brunsbüttel (Schleswig-Holstein), Wilhelmshaven (Lower Saxony), Stade (Lower Saxony), and Rostock (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). In addition, Poland offered Germany to use its terminals in the Baltic ports of Swinoujscie and Gdansk. Also, the Germans can use two more terminals in the neighborhood – Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Klaipeda (Lithuania).

In general, according to the calculations of German economists, Germany, even in the event of a complete (rather than partial) rejection of Russian energy resources, will lose from 2% to 3% of GDP. Indeed, this is a noticeable figure, but, nevertheless, not critical. Especially considering that on one side of the scale is the usual comfort of German citizens, enjoying solid social protection, and on the other side is the deliberate destruction of the entire economic infrastructure of Ukraine, the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians, the murder of more than 200 children, and gang rape of dozens of women...

As both the Kremlin leadership and the Russian military in the Ukrainian cities and villages they occupied have convincingly proven, all these horrors will go on and on as long as Ukrainians rejecting the values ​​of the so-called “Russian world,” imposed on them by force, are alive. Ukraine in 2014 clearly chose the values ​​of the Euro-Atlantic civilization and, therefore, today the West cannot abandon it to be torn to pieces by the wild hordes of Russian conquerors. EU and UK should impose a partial embargo on Russian hydrocarbons today, and as soon as the construction of tankers and LNG terminals yields results, they will impose a complete ban on Russian energy imports.",energy,1651242166.0

Since the pandemic started, I've been aggressively saving for retirement and have managed to save 100k in just a couple years, between Roth IRA (~35k), 401k (~28k), HSA (~7k), and normal taxable investment accounts (~30k). However, I can't maintain this level of saving and will need to dial it back since I want to also save for a house. 

Since I'm starting my career so late, and since I'm trying to save for retirement and save for a home, I'm trying to accelerate my earnings. I've job hopped and went from 57 to 68 to 90 in the last 3 years, and I think I can probably continue to accelerate my earning this way. I can probably switch to another job to get 110 at this year, however, I'm not sure if continuing on this trajectory will be enough. 

I've heard about the federal government pension program and the idea of a defined benefit plan is attractive. It sounds like it's not that great though? You pay 4.4%, and your return is the average of your 3 highest pay grades, multiplied by 1.1%, multiplied by years of service. If I managed to get to the last few steps of GS15, that would be 170k * 1.1% * 20 yrs = 37.4k. I know GS15 step 8 in a HCOL is a pretty lofty assumption, and it would yield a not very attractive number.

Would it be better for me to just keep chasing higher and higher salaries in the private sector and than to try to get the federal pension? If I went to the federal government now, I'd probably be GS12 since I have 3 years exp, and that would put me at 86k. Next year I'd be at GS13, and 102k, both of which are a minor, but not immaterial pay cuts from what I'm getting right now. 

And final thought: I've read a few other posts about the federal pension and they mention the health care. I have lifetime VA healthcare due to being a service connected disabled veteran, so I'll always have *something* for health care, but is the health plan from federal retirement significantly better? 

It's hard for me to evaluate all this information, and since I'm about to turn 40, I want to make sure that I don't miss an opportunity to get the federal pension if that's going to be a good decision for me.

personalfinance,Does TLH make municipal bonds less attractive?,"**My scenario:** I have a medium term taxable portfolio of stocks and municipal bonds. Year-to-date the stock market has been down and I have used that opportunity to harvest some losses. Importantly, I have harvested more in cap gains losses than I predict to earn this year in dividends and returns.

**My question:** Should I move my bond holdings from muni ETFs to corporate ETFs?

It's my understanding the muni bonds have a lower interest rate because of their tax preference. If I anticipate having zero capital gains (or a capital loss) at year end there is no tax savings from muni bonds. If my capital losses are certain to be greater than any capital gains from my bonds, doesn't it make sense to shift to corporate bonds and take advantage of the higher interest rate? Am I forgetting something about how capital gains tax is calculated?

*Caveats:* Assume the new bond portfolio is very similar with the same ratings, duration, etc. Ignore default risk.  I would have to revaluate this strategy at year end and consider next years capital gains.

Interesting things about 2022: Investing books will tell you there is a negative correlation between stocks and bonds; but, that's not true this year - both are down YTD. So rebalancing my bond portfolio is only going to \*add\* to my harvested losses. Also it's early in the year. Bonds need time to make returns. This strategy might not be worth the effort in Q4.

stocks,Nasdaq slides 2% led by Amazon as benchmark heads for worst month since 2008- NASDAQ in bear territory,"U.S. stocks fell Friday with the Nasdaq Composite on pace for the worst month since 2008, as Amazon became the latest victim in the technology-led sell-off.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 2.3%, weighed down by Amazon’s post-earnings plunge. The S&amp;P 500 retreated by 2.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed about 500 points, or 1.5%.

The Nasdaq is down around 11%, on pace for its worst monthly performance since October 2008 in the throngs of the financial crisis. The S&amp;P 500 is down more than 7%, its worst month since March 2020 at the onset of the Covid pandemic. The Dow is off by roughly 3% for the month.

March 2020 for instance saw very sharp declines, but equally fast recoveries. The current episode looks much more likely to impose long lasting losses in investors that piled in during the 2021 rally, and is best thought of a ‘creeping bear market,’ that is steadily widening its net over prior market leadership,” Shaoul added.

The Nasdaq Composite sits in bear market territory, more than 22% below its intraday high. The S&amp;P 500 is off its record by more than 12% and the Dow is around 9% lower.

About 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beat quarterly earnings expectations, with about half of the index’s members having reported results so far, according to FactSet.

“Despite what we view as a solid overall earnings period so far, the positive results look to be getting overshadowed by some of the broader concerns related to inflation and the Fed,” BMO’s Brian Belski said in a note to clients.

personalfinance,Cashing out series I bonds early,"I've read some posts on here suggesting the purchase of series I bonds, so I bought some for myself earlier this month. My wife was dragging her heels setting up an account, so I went ahead and made one for her today and purchased 10k so that it would still get the current interest rates that are available through April. However, only after confirming the purchase did it tell me it wouldn't be processed until May 3rd. I had thought since I was doing it well before the end of business that it would be good to go, but now I'm concerned that it won't get the current rates.

Is it worth leaving the 10k in the I series anyway? And if not, should I just go ahead and immediately cash it out? I'm pretty new to having this sort of money, and I wanted to do something that would see good, guaranteed growth.

I just couldn't see any way of cancelling it, but it seems awfully shady of them not to tell you it will be processed days later until AFTER you confirm the payment.

personalfinance,Where to invest - overwhelmed,"Hi Everyone,

I’m looking for advice on how to build wealth. I’m 26, make ~69k/year, and live in a HCOL area. I’ve only been working full time for about a year and a half and worked really hard to save almost 1x my salary by living at home for a year, then doing gig jobs like pet sitting, etc. 

My savings/investments/debts are as follows:
-$12,000 in student loans,
$6,000 emergency fund, 
$21,500 cash in a HYSA (saving for a down payment in hopes I could buy this fall, but the way the market and interest rates are, I’m no longer sure),
$11,000 Roth IRA,
$9,000 employer 401K,
$6,000 in a brokerage account,
$2,500 cash in short term savings for travel for my sisters wedding, buying a tv, etc.,
A paid off 2012 sedan worth around $4000-5500

I know that I am in a decent position and could be doing much worse financially. However, given the soaring housing costs, raising interest rates, inflation, etc., I still feel a lot of anxiety around money. I’d like to buy a condo in my area, but a decent one costs 300,000 minimum, not including HOA dues. Moving to a LCOL area is not an option at this time. I could potentially invest out of state, but feel that this is much riskier than buying a place that would be my primary residence. What else could I be doing with my money? Family has advised me to just hold the cash should an opportunity arise, but I’m not even sure what opportunities I should be looking for. I’d like to feel financially secure (at minimum) and ideally make some sort of passive income/ have enough investments that I don’t have to work a 9-5 forever.",finance,1651257187.0

Carvana's financial troubles spilled over into debt markets this week when the online used-car dealer struggled to sell bonds and was forced to turn to Apollo Global Management Inc. for $1.6 billion to salvage the deal. The giant investment firm agreed to purchase about half of $3.275 billion of bonds Carvana is issuing to purchase car-auction network ADESA U.S., people familiar with the matter said. Carvana had a hard time attracting investors following a disappointing first-quarter earnings report and stock selloff. Apollo’s intervention highlights the growing clout of private debt and equity firms that are bankrolling swaths of the U.S. economy. Shares of Carvana surged during the pandemic but tumbled over the past eight months as secondhand car prices declined and investors grew concerned about the company’s continued losses. ADESA was meant to accelerate growth, and Carvana hired JPMorgan Chase to raise billions of dollars in debt and equity to pay for the purchase and subsequent integration.

The financing ran into headwinds last week when the company reported a more-than sixfold increase in net losses for the first quarter of 2022 compared with a year earlier. The company was one of the biggest losers in the tech stock selloff, which was driven by rising interest rates and worries about a recession. Carvana blamed a mix of tough economic conditions—rising interest rates, higher gas prices, inflation-weary consumers—for its first-ever decline in quarterly retail sales. It also acknowledged to investors that the constant pressure to continue its rapid expansion has played an outsize role in its priorities, and it pledged to reduce costs and improve its efficiency. The deal with Apollo is an acknowledgment that filling the hole in its balance sheet had taken precedence over growth. The onerous interest rate on the debt could make it difficult for the company to invest in growth. Carvana has burned cash since its founding 10 years ago.

Carvana shares dropped about 30% in recent weeks and bond prices also fell, pushing up the yield that bond investors demanded to lend the company more money. Bond yields rise when prices fall. Carvana disclosed plans Monday to issue $2.275 billion of bonds and $1 billion of preferred shares for the ADESA acquisition. Chief Executive Ernie Garcia III and his father, Ernie Garcia II, participated in a roughly $1.2 billion new common-stock issue to boost cash levels. Apollo privately committed to buy $600 million of the preferred shares, but JPMorgan struggled to find enough buyers for the bonds, fund managers who considered the deal said. By Tuesday, the clearing yield for the bond deal was above 10.5%, a level that might have forced JPMorgan to forgo some or all of its fees for the financing, the fund managers said. Apollo, which has invested in Carvana stock and debt for years, proposed an alternative: Carvana would scrap the preferred stock sale and issue $3.3 billion of 10.25% bonds backstopped by a $1.6 billion order from Apollo. That yield is well above the average for most junk bonds.

The revised deal came with a twist, in which Carvana would be barred from prepaying the new debt for about five years—roughly twice the normal period for junk bonds. Apollo stands to make about 1.6 times its money if the bonds are subsequently repaid. It would have made about 1.3 times its money on the preferred shares, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Such large checks have grown increasingly common as private fund managers raised unprecedented sums of money, prompting them to hunt for increasingly big trade ideas. The funds provided jumbo rescue loans to companies like Airbnb Inc. and Carnival Corp. during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic.

Apollo manages about half a trillion dollars and made a similar $1.5 billion preferred-stock investment in Hertz Global Holdings Inc. in 2021 to help lift the car-rental company out of bankruptcy. The Hertz deal paid out handsomely, but Carvana’s future is uncertain for now. Moody’s Investors Service cut its credit rating of Carvana this week to triple-C, one of the lowest rungs on the junk-debt ratings ladder, citing persistent lack of profitability, negative cash flow and corporate-governance risk. Credit ratings firm S&amp;P Global said Wednesday that the replacement of the preferred equity with debt will result in higher interest costs that will put pressure on the company’s cash flow. S&amp;P estimated that the additional capital would help the company cover about two years of cash burn. “Technology companies can offer excess yield, but investors need to pay attention to the quality and stability of cash flows,” said Scott Giardina, managing director at FS Investments. “Technology business models are generally asset light, and bankruptcy recoveries will tend to be lower than more traditional asset-based companies.” Carvana, which went public in 2017, has burned through cash and relied heavily on debt investors to fund its operations, similar to tech companies such as Netflix Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.",finance,1651275973.0
stocks,Excited to be DCAing again - What are you guys buying?,"Since December 2021 I've positioned bearishly in the market. Selling all of my stocks and going 100% cash. I've recently begun buying back into the markets ... slowly and with caution. I was originally bearish because PE ratios were simply too high, and inflation was high, which if you look at history triggers interest rate hikes, which triggers downward pressure on the markets. Now, the tightening is seemingly priced in and the average PE ratio is around 21 in the SP500 (in December it was around 25). This PE ratio is closer to the 10-year median of about 20 which is why I've begun my DCAing into the falling market. Before, I was bearish because the market was simply too hot, but now, in order to be bearish one must believe there is fundamental problems with our economy that will result in substantial GDP decline. There are still many risks including war, inflation, effects of interest rate hikes, and demand decline in certain sectors after exceptional performance during the pandemic (we saw this with Amazon).

The point I'm trying to make is that the market is no longer overvalued from a cashflow perspective, but there are still headwinds that we must hurdle. If you are bearish, you are now betting against the American economy to some degree which may hold some merit after all.

I want to caution that I am by no means bullish, nor bearish, but rather neutral on this market right now which is why I'm unloading my cash position slowly.

When Corona was gaining speed, people were begging for QE's, keep the printer on, which I understood, and made sense in a way. Investor would go apeshit crazy both in Europe and the US if the ECB or FED would even slightly mention an interest hike. I remember quotes ""all that it takes to keep the economy going"" and "" we are not even thinking about thinking to raise the rates"". So investors would be pleased , and money kept flowing, with several rounds of stimulus checks in the US. Even under political pressure ( Trump also pushed this). People screaming and shreeking if the FED would even have a ""hawkish"" tone on this. JPOW being called incompetent if he would not understand the needs of the economy. The FED initially wasn't a big fan of just keeping the printer on without limits and had reservations.

Now of course, with all the supply chain issues, shortages and cash flowing around obviously inflation is rising, partly to feed the growing economy and also because of other factors like people spending more etc.  Now the FED announced the hikes, and people are still shreeking. I understand that having higher interests, those hikes will not benefit the labour market, but something has to be done to keep the inflation under control, no? I AM NOT DEFENDING JPOW OR THE FED, quotes like ""inflation is transitory"" were weird to me, and I have the personal feeling they are making decision to save their own seats as well. I am also aware that it is much more complex than this. For example, interests hikes are probaly necessary, but what was the right timing?TLDR: : the FED caused a river of money to flow, people were happy, and now that the consequences are there in the form of inflation, people are pissed that the FED is proposing interest rate hikes.

*****
&gt; Investors will be looking for a reprieve after the worst month for stocks in more than two years, but the calendar might not be too friendly from here.
*****
&gt; Rising interest rates, some high-profile earnings misses and burgeoning concerns about global growth took a toll on the stock market in April.
*****
&gt; The big drawdown comes on the eve of a historically weak period for stocks, with the “sell in May and go away” mindset officially beginning next week. According to the Stock Traders Almanac, an investor who held the Dow Jones Industrial Average between Nov. 1 and April 30, and then switched to fixed income for the next six months, would have produced solid returns with reduced risk for more than seven decades now.
*****
&gt; That seasonal weakness can be especially pronounced in midterm election years, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes it has paid to lock in gains ahead of the traditionally challenging May-through-October periods. And this particularly goes for midterm election years, also known as ‘sophomore slumps.’ Indeed, since 1992, the S&amp;P 500 fell an average 3.4% in the May-through-October period of midterm election years,” Stovall said in a note to clients Monday.
*****
&gt; However, jumping to fixed income, as the simple strategy suggests, might not be smartest move.
*****
“Cashing out might not be the best option either, since equal exposure to the defensive consumer staples and health care sectors from May through October outpaced the broader benchmark 100% of these years and posted an average six-month total return of 5.6%,” Stovall wrote.
*****
&gt; # Did May selling come early?
&gt; To be sure, those defensive sectors Stovall highlighted have already been outperforming in recent weeks.
*****
&gt; And what about the tech sector, which has been sliding for nearly six months now? Some metrics and market action suggest that the sell-off has gone far enough.
*****
&gt; “Regardless of whether the market is sold out, you can argue tech, especially, is due for a bounce. Both Microsoft and Meta have rallied back to, but not quite through, their respective 50-day averages. These seem key points,” Frank Gretz, a technical analyst at Wellington Shields, said in a note to clients on Friday.
*****
&gt; It is possible that the sell-in-May trend simply started a bit early in 2022.
*****
&gt; However, there is still some concern that valuations remain too high in parts of the market.
*****
&gt; “When adjusted for stock compensation, the median tech and communication services companies’ free cash flow yields are below the overall market and most defensive sectors. This suggests that cash flow isn’t at the point at which to support current tech valuation,” Chris Senyek of Wolfe Research said in a note to clients Friday.

&gt; # Fed meeting ahead
&gt; One thing that could break a seasonal trend next week is the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting. The central bank is set to release an updated policy statement on Wednesday, followed by a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; The market is pricing in a 50 basis point rate hike on Wednesday, but recent Fed speakers have signaled increasing aggressiveness about the fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; “The question becomes ‘What will the Fed break?’ If they stick to their verbal outline, their verbal commitment to price stability, how far are they willing to go and what do they see that can break?” asked Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; One term that has come up in recent weeks is “front loading” — the potential for the Fed to do multiple 50-basis point or higher hikes in the months ahead to get close to or even above the supposed neutral policy rate.
*****
&gt; According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders see the Fed funds rate potentially rising to 3% or higher by the end of the year.
*****
&gt; “They have the luxury at this point of a strong labor market. Why not go in and take it from their toolkit as best they can and try to slow demand as quickly as possible,” Krosby said.
*****
&gt; After the Fed news on Wednesday, investors will get key labor market data in jobless claims on Thursday and nonfarm payrolls on Friday.
*****
&gt; The monthly jobs report for April could get some extra attention this week after a surprise negative gross domestic product reading for the first quarter. Though that decline was driven largely by export and inventory numbers, traders and money managers are watching closely for signs of economic deterioration in the U.S.

&gt; # 6 Charts Focused on the Long Term

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index in correction territory (down more than 10% from the previous peak) while the market faces a number of big threats, including inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve, soaring yields, and war in Eastern Europe, investor anxiety levels are understandably elevated. During volatile markets, it’s difficult to focus on anything beyond the short term, but at times like this studying market history for reminders of the benefits of long-term investing can be helpful for investors

&gt; “Individual investors have the benefit of time on their side,” wrote LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “History shows that patience is rewarded during volatile periods in the market. This looks like one of those times.”

&gt; Below are 6 charts we think may help investors stay focused on the long term.

&gt; First, simply put, stocks have gone up over time as shown in the chart below. Based on this 122-year data series of the Dow Jones Industrials, stocks have gained 9.5% annualized including dividends. That’s a pretty good long-term track record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.29.22.png))**

&gt; So what has driven those big gains for stocks all those years? Earnings, plain and simple. While we don’t have 122 years of earnings data for the Dow, we do have 70 years of S&amp;P 500 earnings per share data, shown in the chart below. Earnings have grown at an annualized pace of 7.5% over this time period, consistent with long-term stock price appreciation (excluding dividends).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.29.22.png))**

&gt; The next chart shows how punitive it can be to be out of the market on its best days. Though the S&amp;P 500 Index is unmanaged and can’t be owned directly, it’s clear that owning stocks for the long run has been very rewarding and moving in and out and potentially missing out on gains can be costly. Stocks experienced some significant downdrafts during the 31-year period shown in the chart (2000-2002 and 2008-2009 to be specific) and yet the S&amp;P 500 Index still rose an average of 9.9% per year during that time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chart-4-4.29.22.png))**

&gt; The next chart shows the probability of S&amp;P 500 Index gains over various rolling time periods since 1950. Based on monthly data, the index was higher in more than 80% of all rolling 3-year and 5-year periods. Going out further, 92% of all 10-year rolling periods saw the S&amp;P 500 move higher, while the S&amp;P 500 was higher 100% of the time for all rolling 15-year periods. In other words, those with a greater than a 10-year investing time horizon have an excellent chance to achieve positive returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-5-4.29.22.png))**

&gt; It’s also important for investors to remember that when stocks fall, they usually become cheaper relative to earnings. LPL Research certainly believes this is relevant today given the solid earnings trends still in place (despite several high profile disappointments among mega-cap tech and internet stocks this quarter).

&gt; The next chart illustrates the relationship between stock valuations—measured by the S&amp;P 500 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)—and future stock performance. Specifically, the chart shows the future 10-year returns an investor might expect based on the valuation levels at a given point in time. If this relationship holds going forward, then buying stocks at a 19 P/E today positions investors for better long-term returns—perhaps 5-6% annually—than the 24 P/E observed at the start of the year. Note that the P/E scale on the chart’s right axis is inverted, so a rising line reflects lower valuations.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-7.png))**

&gt; Earlier this week LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick published a chart (shown here) showing the average maximum peak-to-trough decline in a given year has been 14%. Put another way, as shown in the chart below, on average the S&amp;P 500 has experienced one 10% or greater correction per year. The takeaway here is that the volatility experienced this year, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 13% from January 3 through March 8, is actually quite normal.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-8-4.22.22.png))**

&gt; So there you have it. Six charts to help put the latest bout of volatility in perspective and remind us of the benefits of long-term investing. Bottom line, be patient, stick to your plan, and if you have a long-term time horizon with a relatively conservative asset allocation, this might not be a bad time to consider adding some equities.

&gt; # A Closer Look At The Stock Market Sell Off

&gt; The selloff continued on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 Index down 7.8% in the usually bullish month of April. With three days to go, this could go down as the worst April since a 9.0% drop in 1970.

&gt; The usual suspects of a slowing economy, a hawkish Federal Reserve Bank (Fed), supply chain worries, war in Europe, and now another China shutdown have all combined to make this one of the worst starts to a year ever for both stocks and bonds.

&gt; It is important to remember, though, that historically midterm years can be rough, down more than 17% on average peak-to-trough. The March 8 closing low, which amounted to a 13% correction, is still the low for the year as of now. The good news is a year off those lows stocks have historically gained more than 32% on average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.27.22.png))**

&gt; One potential worry is in midterm years stocks usually bottom later in the year. “Could stocks bottom for the year in March or April? Sure, but history would say midterm year lows tend to be later in the year,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “You’d have to chalk this up as one clear potential worry out there still.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, midterm years see the S&amp;P 500 bottom on August 14 on average, and the median bottom is in early September. But the good news that is important for investors to remember is big gains a year off those lows have been quite common.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.27.22.png))**

&gt; Something else to remember is just how strong the bull market was off the March 2020 lows. As you can see below, this is still the second best start to a bull market ever. After the fastest bull market to double in history, some type of potential weakness or consolidation shouldn’t be overly surprising.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-3-4.27.22.png))**

&gt; Many investors forget that double-digit declines during a year are actually normal. After only one 5% pullback all of last year, markets have provided an unfriendly reminder in 2022. In fact, since 1980, the average correction each year is 14.0%, putting this year’s 13.0% correction in perspective. Taking this a step further, 21 times since 1980 the S&amp;P 500 has been down double digits at one point from its peak, with an impressive 12 of those years managing to come back and finish the year positive. In fact, the average yearly gain those 12 years was a very solid 17.0%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chart-4-4.27.22.png))**

&gt; Lastly, we knew coming into this year that more volatility was possible, potentially early in the year as that’s been the playbook during midterm years. Looking at the entire four-year Presidential cycle shows that this quarter is actually the worst out of 16. Last quarter (year 2, quarter 1) and next quarter (year 2, quarter 3) are pretty weak as well. The good news is some stronger quarters are right around the corner.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-5-4.27.22.png))**

&gt; The weakness we’ve seen so far this year has been disappointing and taken many investors by surprise. But after more than a 100% rally off the March 2020 lows, some type of usual midterm year frustration was likely. Continue to follow LPL Research, as we help you navigate the investments landscape.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Down Year-to-Date and Down in April Preceded Year Loss 69.2% of the Time

&gt; With just two trading days remaining, April will not likely live up to its historically bullish reputation this year. S&amp;P 500 decline in April as of today is 7.65%, second worst April since 1950 and sixth worst since 1930. As of today’s close, the third from last trading day of April, S&amp;P 500 year-to-date loss of 12.22% is second worse in our data going back to 1930. The worst year was 1970. Since 1950 the combination of a down S&amp;P 500 April combined with a year-to-date loss has been a clearly bearish indicator. Of the previous 13 occasions since 1950, the following May was positive five times with an average loss of 0.39% and the full year finished positive four times. The only full-year double digit gain was way back in 1952. The average loss in all years was 7.26%.

&gt; # Welcome To the Weak Spot of the 4-Year Cycle

&gt; Unfortunately, the market entered the weak spot of the 4-Year Election Cycle this month with an array of headwinds from the Fed, Inflation, the Ukraine War and now most concerning the China’s unprecedented Covid lockdowns and testing. This situation has the potential to generate the greatest impact on the global economy as it could severely restrict the flow of essential raw materials and goods around the world.

&gt; The market is also suffering from the usual disappointments, unmet promises and miscues from the new incumbent administration that has historically restricted market gains through Q2-Q3 of the midterm election – the period we’ve only just begun. As you can see in the chart here Q2-Q3 are the weakest two quarters of the 4-Year Cycle, averaging losses of -1.2% for DJIA and -1.5% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949, and -5.0% for NASDAQ since 1971.

&gt; The good news is that this weak spot immediately proceeds the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Cycle, which runs from Q4 of the Midterm Year through Q2 of the Pre-Election Year, averaging gains of 19.3% for DJIA and 20.0% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949, and 29.3% for NASDAQ since 1971.

&gt; Caution is definitely in order over the next “Worst Six Months.” We already issued our Seasonal Best Six Months MACD Sell Signal on April 7. But be ready to pounce on the perennial Midterm year bottom that is most likely to hit sometime over the next six months.

&gt; # May is Second Worst S&amp;P 500 Month in Midterm Election Years

&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

&gt; In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up thirteen times in the past twenty-four years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down –11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and six losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010 followed by another sizable loss of 7.9% in 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5a8236c820bc5f672ec17dd414c5228/3c57636b132072af-df/s400x600/9b971e3568cbadf1790efcc02c3e7b97aef2c8f0.jpg))**

&gt; Since 1950, midterm-year Mays rank poorly, #10 DJIA, #11 S&amp;P 500, #8 NASDAQ, #6 Russell 1000 and #9 Russell 2000. Performance ranges from a best of +0.1% by Russell 1000 to a worst of –1.1% for Russell 2000. Not one of these indexes has been positive more than 50% of the time in midterm years.

stocks,Deutsche Bank HQ in Frankfurt raided over suspected money laundering,"repost of some news I found

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uentw7/deutsche_bank_hq_in_frankfurt_raided_over/)

German authorities have raided Deutsche Bank’s headquarters in Frankfurt over suspected money laundering at the country’s largest lender.

Officers from the financial regulator BaFin, the federal police, and the Frankfurt public prosecutor’s office launched a raid on the bank’s glass-panelled offices – known locally as the “twin towers” – on Friday morning after securing a search warrant from the local court

stocks,Why I'm bearish on the market right now,"Stocks have fallen but they have a lot to fall more unless serious measures will be taken by US and EU Governments and I'm not seeing them doing that. Here is my opinion.

This is mostly a supply led inflation, it's very different than other inflation cycles we witnessed in the past because those were demand based and could be addressed by raising interest rates to curb pressure on demand. Stocks would still go up with interest rates rising because the economy was booming.

This inflation cycle is different and only have a precedent during the early '70 oil supply crisis that caused stagflation and a massive stock market crash. How bad was that crash? Well, in the US the market lost 50% of its value, in the UK the stock market lost well over 70% of its value. As can you imagine, we are just at the beginning of the crash and in my opinion the situation today is worse than in the '70 so the stock market crash can be worse.

The point is, we are seeing inflation because commodities prices are rising and those higher prices of production are then transferred to the consumers. How do you fix it? Well, you can only fix it by increasing supply of those commodities. What are we doing instead? We are boycotting all supplies from one of the biggest producer in the world: Russia. And ESG policies are also targeting local companies  so their CAPEX is very low. And you can't just increase CAPEX overnight, it takes years. Add to that that the current US Administration has very bad relations (the worst since many decades) with Saudi Arabia and UAE, two of the biggest oil producers in the world. They already said they won't increase oil production.

What the FED can do? Well, not much in reality because the FED is very useful to fix demand led inflation cycles but they can't do much to fix supply led inflation because they don't set commodity prices. It's all about demand and supply and since the supply is low the only thing the FED can do is destroy demand to match the low supply and reach a new equilibrium. But you see where we are going? To lower inflation to 2% the FED will have to destroy demand so much to cause a big recession. Any soft landing talk is bullshit. There can't be any soft landing given the circumstances. The FED will have to raise rates so much because the sensitivity of inflation to interest rates rising (in a supply led crisis) is much lower than in a demand-led crisis. And by raising that much a recession will follow and the demand destruction will match the supply, finally lowering inflation. The stock market will crash massively with a big recession.

This is already very bad, but things get even worse when we consider Europe. They are very dependent on Russian commodities and if they ban russian oil and gas, the price of these commodities will skyrocket to over 150$/barrel. Now, Europe already is experiencing a massive inflationary cycle (same as the US, supply led) but contrary to the US they can't raise interest rates much because the very existence of the euro currency is at stake. Why? Well, because Southern European countries already have such a massive debt (and zero growth) that they wouldn't be able to finance themselves in an open market at rates low enough to keep their economies afloat and not default on their debt. Indeed after the Sovereign debt cycle the ECB one way or another bought massive amount of their debt to keep them from defaulting but that was a band-aid that only postponed their demise.

Now, there is a Covid-related vast debt buying program that the ECB is doing but it's gonna end soon. Keep in mind the ECB, by charter, can't buy debt of Sovereign countries because it's totally independent and this is why a massive crisis will happen in Europe. I try to explain. Until now the ECB kept these countries from failing with different emergency buying programs and there were never inflationary pressures so interest rates were held below zero. Now inflation is above 8%, the ECB (contrary to the FED) has only one goal: to keep the inflation around 2%. So they have to raise interest rates and can't keep find excuses to buy Sovereign debt and expand their massive balance sheet because otherwise inflation will keep go higher and they would not respect their charter (by law they can't do it).

As soon as the ECB stop this debt buying program (they say it's gonna end soon) and raise rates, Southern European countries will experience big problems in financing their debt in the open market. Debt spreads between EU countries will rise and a new big Sovereign debt crisis (much bigger than the one in 2011/2012) will emerge threatening the survivability of the euro itself because Europe would need two different monetary policies (a lax one in the South, and a hawkish one in the North) but they only have one central bank.

Imagine a scenario with stagflation (high inflation+recession) and Sovereign debt crisis at the same time. This duo will create probably the biggest crisis in European stock market in history. Once they crash, the repercussions will be felt in the US as well because the economy is interconnected....imagine all US companies (already with the US crash I explained above) having to deal with demand destruction from a massive crisis in Europe...the recession in the US would get so much worse.

So, how do we get out of this crisis? I don't think there is a way unless the commodity inflation is taken care of and looking at the comments from various US and European politicians I don't see this scenario to happen...actually it's the opposite since they want to ban ever more russian commodities creating the condition for the scenario I explained above. The thing is, in the current interconnected world, already experiencing commodities price pressure, you can't ban the commodities from Russia (after you already did it with Iran and Venezuela) without ruining our economies too. By trying to ruin Russian economy, we'll ruin our economy and crash the stock market. Unfortunately, not many people have understood it and there is so much ignorance in this regard...so many people think they can ban those commodities and feel no effect in their countries. Economic ignorance and emotional based decisions are the biggest threat to our economies.

Why I'm extremely bearish on the stock market? Because the politicians went so far with their words that now can't walk their comments and decisions back. Every person that try to explain that boycotting russian commodities will cause a massive recession and stagflation in Europe and US is thought of as a Putin friend. The average person is just as dumb as a rock and no matter how you try to explain it, they don't get it.

How to position in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment? Well, I think going long commodities stocks, shorting the Nasdaq (with many stocks that reached very high valuations after the Covid crisis) and shorting Europeans stock indexes would provide decent results in the next year. As I said I really believe the stock market will crash more than during the '70 and back then it crashed over 50% in the US and over 70% in Europe.",finance,1651325664.0

personalfinance,Buy a home or hold off,"My boyfriend and I live in Seattle where the rental market is hot but the housing market is even hotter. Most homes have been going for 30-40% higher than list for the last couple years and the list price is even insane for the type of home you’re getting. For example, 650k for a 2 bedroom 900sq foot semi-updated home from the 1950’s 20 minutes north of the city. However, my friend who’s an agent said that with rising interest rates, peoples buying power is dropping and it’s a good window of time to get in. He said most homes are going for 20% over asking at the moment. 

Right now we are renting a condo for $2200, soon to be raised to $2600 if we resign our lease in June, and we have a really good deal on our condo but many of the apartments in the area have prices that are rising to insane rates as well. Fortunately we’re splitting rent so that’s a massive help.

My boyfriend and all his coworkers think we need to buy a home as soon as possible to avoid rising interest rates. We’ve also watched the housing market steadily rise for the past decade and he’s getting tired of waiting for the bubble to burst.

My dad thinks that this is not sustainable. He says the best thing to do is wait for interest rates to go up, home prices to drop, buy a home at a cheap price and then refinance once rates eventually drop.

I do believe my dad is right but I’m also tired of waiting it out. He‘s been saying for years the housing market can’t keep going up and it has. Homes have doubled in price in the last 5 years. I’m starting to feel left behind and if I don’t take action soon I may never own property here in Seattle.

For context, my boyfriend and I both make over 6 figures. We have about 40k for a down payment may be able to secure loans from family members to get a 20% down payment on hopefully a 700k home. We’re hardly competitive in this market where people are making all cash offers way over listing if we don’t put at least 20% down.

I like to look at the big picture. To me, a home isn’t necessarily an investment. But if we’re going to be bleeding out money renting a bare minimum apartment in a couple years, it seems like it would be wise to at least secure property in an area where owning a home HAS been a massive investment in the past decade.

personalfinance,Budgeting- Paying off Student Loans as fast as possible,"Just a little background information....

* Received a BS in Public Health
* Went to school for 5 years instead of 4 because I changed my major my Junior year (best decision ever)
* I slacked in college in my early years so I have to repay some of my financial aid I received
* I currently owe $19,065 (Was originally $27k) in Federal Loans and $69,703 in Private Loans (Was originally $78k)

I graduated college in 2020 with Bachelor's degree in Public Health with an emphasis on Health Administration. When I graduated my loans were going to enter repayment 6 months after that. I got an internship with a non-profit company and got a job there after my internship ended. My payments entered repayment, except for my Federal Loans since it was during the start of COVID. My private loans were through Sallie Mae, which screwed me over because I had 6 loans through them all with interest rates anywhere from 8.9%-11.9%. My monthly payments were $1k/month. When I started my job I was only making roughly $39,000 annually, so I was starting to drown in payments. I made a few smart decisions (I think they are smart at least ha). I refinanced my private student loans from Sallie Mae to Earnest and now have a 4.79% interest rate and a $700 monthly payment for 12 years and also got my co-signer off my loans (yay!). This was much more manageable as my boyfriend and I are living in a rural town with cheap rent and not much to waste money on. Over the course of a year I saved roughly $26,000 in my saving/checking account.

My boyfriend and I wanted to move out of the state by the end of this year, but I'm afraid to since I have crushing student loan debt.

So this is my repayment plan and I need advice on it or if there is something better I can do like allocate my money someplace else, refinance, etc.?

Just recently we got big raises at work so I will be making roughly $59,000 annually- which with after taxes, retirement deduction, and benefits deduction I will roughly have $1600 a check. So for one month I make roughly $3,200. On top of this I just recently got a part time job at a bakery where I picked up 15hrs/week which will roughly be $300 per paycheck, or $600 for the month. So my monthly income will roughly be $3,800. I have deducted my monthly expenses which are student loan ($700); xcel ($150); rent ($250); gas ($150); groceries ($150); subscriptions ($22); for a grand total of roughly $1,422. So that will leave approximately $2,378 leftover each month which I am planning to put towards my student loans. My boyfriend is wanting for us to move out of the state early next year and is going to put $500-600/month towards my loans so that will be roughly $2,878 towards my private loans. I also have the $26,000 in my checking/savings account that I am going to put towards my loan and I have a rainy day fund jar at home with about $1,600 in it that I will apply towards this, and I will put my tax return for next year towards it which is projected at roughly $1,000. So that being said I will roughly the $69,703 in student loans paid off by May of next year!

I am I correct in my thinking and calculations? Is it smart to throw everything at my student loans and get it paid off? My thinking was that I would be more confident in moving when my private loan was paid off versus my federal loan being paid off as once the payments resume on federal loans my projected monthly payment is going to $200 for those which is much more reasonable. Is there a way I can pay off my private student loan any faster or is this the fastest projected way? Should I try to refinance my private student loans through a servicer that can give me a lower interest rate even if it's for 20 years since I plan to have it all repaid next year?

Thanks for getting through all of that and any feedback is great to hear!",finance,1651339697.0
personalfinance,"Sorry, another Roth vs. Trad IRA Question","Hello. First, I’m new here. I’ve read the IRA and Roth v Trad wiki pages, as well as other posts on the topic here, at length. I’m still confused about what approach to take. If there’s a daily questions thread I didn’t notice one, but I’d be happy to move the question there if this is inappropriate. 

My info:
42. Married file jointly. 
2021 tax info:
Fed tax rate: 24%
Taxable income $177,737
AGI: $202,960 (I believe our MAGI is identical)

I max out my employee Simple IRA, and have been doing so for a few years now. I have built up a sufficient emergency fund and now have excess I want to invest long term for retirement. I’m looking to open IRA accounts for my wife and I to max out, then I expect to have additional left over to invest in a taxable account, which I will open. 

The question of course from the title is: Roth or traditional IRA? We seem to be in the grey middle income area. The examples provided in the wiki steer me toward a Roth IRA, where half of the items apply while the traditional examples don’t seem to apply at all. Seems obvious at first glance, but my income provides about 90% of our household earnings and roughly a 1/3 or that is based on bonuses which vary year to year. 2021 income $ applied to 2022 puts us very near the limits of a Roth IRA, where we’d have to possibly phase out our maximum contribution. I suppose if the company I work for has a really good year I might not qualify for Roth at all. 

I’d prefer to just lump sum $6k each for us near the beginning of each year, but what would happen if the year ends and we find suddenly our income was too high for Roth? Can they be switched to a traditional IRA later since we’d have until April (end of tax year) the following year to make contributions? 

I’m paranoid about:
1. Making this more difficult than it needs to be. 
2. Making a mistake that can’t be undone in a given tax year and incurring unnecessary expenses.

solar,"Is this a good deal? Also, is battery back up worth it?","We are seriously considering solar and got the best quote from Sun Power. For a 15 panel solar system generating about 6,867 kwh/year (115% electricity offset), the net total after federal and state tax incentives comes to about $18,325. That breaks down to a roughly $85/month loan payment (this would be to finance the system over 20 years). We could also pay off early with no penalty. We currently spend $130/month on electricity on average, with summer months going up to around $250. Is this a good deal? 

Lastly, we are considering getting battery back up storage as we lose power anywhere from 1-5 days a year and have small kids. It would be about $150-$160/month after tax incentives on a 20 year loan. It would be nice to have peace of mind knowing we can still power important things, but I know the battery back up makes any savings we’d receive from solar panels minimal to none. We don’t have or want a generator, so it’s either this option or just continue to tough it out during power outages. Does anyone have any positive or negative experience with the battery back up? It’s something we could always add on later but then we’d completely miss out on the 26% federal tax credit which completely disappears starting in 2024.

defi,Are there protocols that can garner the HIGHEST deposit rates and the LOWEST borrow rates?,"Is this possible?

Likely, you will say no, but here's what Advias is doing to mathematically achieve this:

&amp;#x200B;

One important factor, we focus on native asset yield. 

Although, there will be yield rewards, none of the following diverts away from the native asset yield.  This may be an obvious statement but with protocols claiming 1000% APY's on USDC while 995% of that coming from the protocols token, imo it is an important factor to bring up.

&amp;#x200B;

You can also replace any of the following examples that we use with any token.  We use AVAX in the examples since we are launching there but feel free to think of any token like USDC, ETH, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Deposits:**

* **Most Protocols:**

Most protocols allow deposits and these deposits go into a lending pool waiting for borrowers.

So if a 1,000,000 AVAX pool exists and

* you have 1,000 AVAX in it, and
* 100,000 USDC is being borrowed at 10% APR,
* you only get a 1% interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tnsdpwz4wpw81.jpg?width=561&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7ee11c11cccce5fb1c93364b147f55a3b02497a

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* **What we do:**

All deposits are automatically aggregated to the currently best yielding protocol(s) with the highest deposit rates.  Off chain, an asset allocation algorithm runs full time to ensure this and when it finds a better asset allocation combination, or singular protocol, it sends rebalances the lending pool.

So if you deposit 1,000 USDC, your 1,000 USDC will yield you the best yield possible on that current blockchain we are on.

We also are implementing bridging to get even higher rates from more allocation options.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4pgsrw5bwpw81.jpg?width=766&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc9390e19e9695eb47e8f2033cd73c3da6f6baa2

**Borrows:**

* **Most protocols**

borrow rates have a interest rate spread above the deposit rate usually around 1-10% on stable assets.  Some assets can be 2.5x or even 10x, more for hyperbolic assets.

This means, is the borrow rate is 10%, the deposit rate is likely between 1-8%

You can see this by visiting any protocol and seeing the borrow rate/deposit rate spread.  Currently AVAX on most protocols is 3% to borrow and 3% for depositors, this is a 3% spread.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/881dtr0mwpw81.png?width=1345&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=877b5eb4010ea66e1f4b96c0a6920c1c8214a492

* **What we do:**

Since we aggregate, we don't need a formula that is majored by asset borrowing demand.  We simply need to allow borrowers to borrow at the current deposit rate or higher to continue to give depositors the highest interest rates possible.

So, even if the best deposit rate is 3%, our borrow rate is about 3%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jn7b3kotwpw81.png?width=1143&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c84228480a4ce00226464c148ee2fd3d1e6518c7

In this graph you see as borrowing demand is low, the spread is low and increases through utilization.  This also creates a delta as well, which is important for many borrowers using leveraging strategies or looping.

&amp;#x200B;

Not shown in the graph is the following....

Of course, we can't allow borrowers to borrow 100% of deposits so when borrowing demand hits a certain point, say 90% utilization, depending on the asset we do a few things, either one or a combination of:

* Increase the interest rate
   * This is likely to settle the rate near the avg of all protocols
* Decrease the immediate borrowers LTV depending on utilization rate.

&amp;#x200B;

**What about if a protocol DOES have a lower rate than your current deposit rate?**

This scenario is possible, although unlikely, and we have a solution for it.  Our leverage from aggregation gives us borrowing power.  We simply allow a very low LTV ratio from the leverage we currently have for borrowers to choose to borrow from.  So, a borrower can borrow from us near the current deposit rates, or they can choose to borrow from one of our current aggregated protocols.

&amp;#x200B;

While all of this protocols benefit us, we benefit them.  This isn't a competitive scenario but an integrated innovation.

# Why would you deposit anywhere else?

# Why would you borrow anywhere else?

# 

It's important to note, the formulas Advias uses are probabilistic to achieve all of this.  We use many algorithms to create a high likelihood of having the highest deposit rates through both onchain and offchain metrics.  Getting the lowest borrow rate is a by product of having the highest deposit rates, plus the backup leveraging.",cryptocurrency,1651347295.0

My question is -- once funds are locked into an HSA, are they stuck there forever? Suppose I needed the cash for something non-medical related down the road, is there any way to pay taxes on the HSA funds and transfer them out?

I always read that maxing the HSA then investing it is a good idea, but if it can only be used for medical expenses for the rest of time, then I would think one would want to limit their HSA contributions to whatever they think they'll actually use for said medical expenses. What also makes me cautious on the HSA is the interest rate (at least on mine) is simply atrocious so you're losing a lot of money to inflation if it's just sitting there without being invested.

2.               Reserve study completed by a professional within the past 3 years

They haven't done a reserve study in past 3 years, and the condo hasn't had an inspection itself.  (it's side-by-side townhouses style rather than a single building.)

I believe as a foreigner, Americans here are underestimating how influential and huge the American companies have become over the last decade. They have basically dominated the globe and the bull run that started after the 2008 crisis is due to their success.
