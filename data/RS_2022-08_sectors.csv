personalfinance,cash available - Lump sum on current mortgage or Downpayment on a second rental,"Hello, I am in the middle of brainstorming of my next financial move with the cash I have now and I need advice. 

The situation is as follows: 

- 100k cash
- Own a rental property (410k mortgage, 4 years remaining @ rate 1.89%, rent covers the mortgage)
- I am 25, still live with parents, probably for the next 5 years
- Live way below my means and monthly expenses are not too big (at least for now) 
- No debt, loans, etc. 

Plan A 

Big Lump sum on the rental property: 

The plan is to pay as much as I can on the property to lower the amortization period and to have a break from the high interest rates after my term is done. This plan would be combined with contribution into RRSP up to 35k on 4 years to have a tax break. After 5 years, I would withdraw the funds from RRSP (IRA in the US) as well as pulling some of my equity to pay my downpayment for the place that I will live in (home plan). I find this plan to be conservative as rate is VERY low and I wouldn’t save that much (1k per year), however, it would ‘lower’ the stress of having debt. 

Note: In Canada, I am allowed to withdraw funds from retirement account, up to 35k cad no taxes to pay for my first home that i would live in. However, i need to pay back the amount within 15 years. 

Plan B 

Use the cash as a downpayment for a second rental property: 

The plan is to acquire a second rental property. I don’t think I would have problems with pre-approval, as I will have parents to cosign with me (I will be the one making the monthly payment). Although, interests are higher, they would be tax deductible, so I would balance out with other property. I find this plan to be less conservative, as if I don’t find tenants for both properties, It wouldn’t be so fun. However, I don’t mind pitching in with whatever rent I can get, since I mentioned my expenses are very low. 

I apologize if this post offends anyone. I know I have a great privilege of living with my parents. 

TL;DR: I have 100k cash and do not know how to use them. Dumping a lump sum on my current rental property with a low rate or put as a down payment for a second rental property.",finance,1659313263
personalfinance,"Identity Stolen - Scam, Prank, or Coincidence?","For context, my identity was very recently stolen and I’m still in the process of dealing with all the fallout from that. It’s been a pain in the ass, and I feel like I have no idea what types of things I can trust anymore or might just be a scam.

Today I randomly got a phone call from someone asking if my dog was missing. Immediately alarm bells went off in my head because of my current situation, but also because I don’t own a dog and obviously didn’t put up missing dog posters with my phone number on it. 

Some other weird details about this: I asked the person how they got my number and they were friendly and told me it was on a poster at a gas station in New Jersey, but they didn’t know what town they were in. I asked because I wanted to maybe see the poster myself and see what’s up, but I don’t even live in New Jersey. Another weird thing is that the phone number that called me had the same area code as me which means they aren’t from NJ themselves. I know numbers can be spoofed, but it had the verified check mark next to it, is an iPhone (I can facetime them), and it had a caller ID. So I think the number was real.

I guess it’s somewhat plausible if they were just stopping for gas while driving through or something and happened to see the poster and find a missing dog, but what are the chances of all that happening? I don’t know what to believe anymore. This all just seems really weird, and it also seems unlikely to me that someone would go through the trouble of putting up posters for their missing dog without double checking if the phone number was right.

To me this just seems like all too many coincidences. Is this some sort of scam that I’m not understanding? Or maybe just a dumb prank? Or could it actually just be a coincidence? I was thinking maybe they were trying to fish for security question answers or something like that, but they didn’t ask me anything besides if my dog was missing so maybe they really were just trying to help out.",finance,1659315680

personalfinance,Rent vs buy in Chicago if unsure of how long I'll be here,"Hi all,

I'm a 26M living in Chicago. I'm currently living in a family member's home (no rent), but thinking of moving out to a place in Chicago downtown. Some of my family members are saying that I'll be wasting my money renting and should buy something instead. However, I'm not sure how long I'll be in Chicago. I may look for a new job next year which might lead me to want to be elsewhere. So buying feels like it would restrict my flexibility when it comes to that. From what I've read, it also seems like right now may not be the best time to buy (due to high interest rates/home prices/etc.)?

I looked through the articles/calculators linked in the wiki, and I can understand that buying is not always better than renting. However, I had a difficult time understanding all of the inputs to the calculator and wasn't able to completely calculate things for the Chicago context. Rent would probably be around $2k per month, which is within my means.

I'm leaning towards renting for the flexibility and due to potentially not staying in Chicago. However, I wanted to do a gut check with the community to see if I'm missing anything. Thanks for your help!",finance,1659319055

personalfinance,Does it hurt to open more than one checking account and maybe close the original one?,"I just opened a new savings account with Capital One, but my checking account is with Chase. I'm considering opening a checking account with Capital One for two reasons:

1. I like the idea of having all of my accounts together at one bank
2. The interest rate on the CA checking account is 0.10% vs. 0.01% at Chase

Is there any downside to doing this and possibly closing the Chase account altogether? Or would it hurt to just leave that account open but empty? (I'm pretty sure I don't have any fees on it, but I suppose they may also automatically close it if it remains empty. I'm not sure.)

I want to make sure I'm not being overzealous in my recent attempts to get smart with my money. Maybe leaving things alone would be the best option...

Thanks!",finance,1659322360

personalfinance,PSLF refund of payments. Save or pay down credit cards?,"I had my student loans paid in full recently through the updated PSLF process. My refund of overpayments was $12,000. I am still owed around $1100 for payments made during the covid pause. My dilemma is that I have 26k in credit card debt, $8100 balance in a loan from Discover and a balance of $3900 on a car. 
The credit card debt is mostly medical and the Discover loan was for medical care. 

Discover 12% APR
Car 2.2%
15k 0%
11k 10%

The 0% credit cards vary from 1/2023 to 05/2024 end dates.

As a Federal employee I have stable employment but feeling very uneasy about the upcoming FY 2023 budget.  

I would like to pay off the Discover loan and free up $572 a month. The car loan will be paid off soon and that is $395 a month. The extra $967 could speed up debt pay down. I used the covid pause to pay my car down from $16k to the current balance. 

Because of uncertainty in the economy I wonder if I should just save the majority of the money to the spring when furlough chances are minimized. Looking for some advice. Thanks!",finance,1659330078

personalfinance,Buying a car but also saving for a house,"Curious if anyone has any thoughts on this.  We've been saving for a house in a HCOL area, still at least a year or from buying. I also recently had to put in an order for a new car (my current car is about 16 yrs old and finally starting to require some more expensive repairs that aren't really worth the money anymore). Not sure what interest rates will look like in a month or two when my car comes in,  but I do technically have the funds to pay cash for the car out of our house saving fund.  Thinking I could then put money back into that account instead of paying interest on a car loan. However, would it be a better idea to take out a short loan for the car and build up additional credit? Would that be helpful for securing a better future mortgage rate? Might be worth a few hundred in interest now,  just not sure if that would be the case. Thanks for any thoughts on this.",finance,1659331408

Why cause it ain’t a part of the system collectively helping others gain too?

If only we could borrow against our stocks or any of that, like get a loan knowing we have stocks to back it up but still pay from our checking?

worldnews,Thousands of UK Firms Cut Ties With China Amid Rising Tensions: Industry Group,"Thousands of UK businesses are cutting their economic ties with China as they anticipate faster decoupling between China and the West, according to a major UK business group.

Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Director-General Tony Danker said thousands of companies in the UK are currently rethinking their supply chains in anticipation of hardening anti-China political sentiment.

“Every company that I speak to at the moment is engaged in rethinking their supply chains,” he told FT Weekend. “Because they anticipate that our politicians will inevitably accelerate toward a decoupled world from China.”

Danker said the UK needs “new strategic alliances in the world” as tensions rise with China. In Washington, the need for companies to build “resilience” in preparation of a divorce from China was “all they are talking about,” he noted.

As the UK’s relations with China turn sour, the country will need to find new trade partners and rekindle old ones, such as the European Union, according to Danker.

“If the political experts and security experts are right, we are all going to need to be good friends again,” he told the newspaper.

Toughening Stance

China has emerged as a key foreign policy battleground between the two final contenders in the race to become Conservative Party leader and UK prime minister.

Both Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former Chancellor Rishi Sunak have pledged to curb the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime to the UK’s national security and economic security.

Truss’s campaign stated that she’ll continue to toughen the UK’s position on China and help lead “the international response to increased Chinese aggression.”

UK officials and politicians are becoming increasingly wary of China’s growing economic influence in the UK.

On July 20, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng announced that he had blocked a Chinese company from acquiring smart camera technology from the University of Manchester, in the first use of the government’s new powers under the National Security and Investment Act, which came into force on Jan. 4.

Under the law, Kwarteng is also presiding over an investigation into the takeover of Newport Wafer Fab by Nexperia, a Netherlands-based subsidiary of the Chinese smartphone manufacturer Wingtech Technology.",technology,1659334880
personalfinance,which car finacial decision is better?,"This car market has me struggling to make a decision on my next vehicle and could use some help 🙃 

I'm in need of a new vehicle after my 270,000 mile Honda is being retired due to bad rusting, RIP old friend.

I wanted to get a reliable car for no more than $15K and under around 50,000 miles or something certified pre-owned. In this market, that seems extremely hard to find. I always told myself buying new cars is never worth it, however this market is making me re-question everything.


After talking to a few people it might seem like going in on a new car and getting a special 1.9% interest rate / warranty might be the best bet. Or I can buy the older Toyota and hope the previous owner treated it right and save some money.

Either option I pick, I'll most likely use the car until it dies. If I go new, I would pay it off before the 1.9 interest rate ends. Looking for help from fellow finacial planners.

stocks,The Stock Market Is Rallying. Here’s What Could Make it Tumble Again...,"While the stock market has enjoyed an impressive run of late, the party could end when the next inflation result comes out in early August. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 13% since hitting its lowest close of the year in mid-June, mounting a broad rally that features more than just a handful of stocks. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 16% from its mid-June low, and the Russell 2000 index of stocks with smaller market capitalizations has risen 14%. 

The main force behind that has been investors’ view that the Federal Reserve will begin to slow down the sharp increases in interest rates it has been rolling out as it seeks to lower the rate of inflation by curbing economic demand. While the Fed will likely raise its target for the benchmark lending rate at its next few policy-setting meetings, the probability that it lifts the rate to above 3.5% by February has gone down to 17% from a 44% chance a month ago, according to CME Group data. The bank now aims to keep the benchmark, the fed-funds rate, at 2.25%-2.5%, up from near zero at the start of the year.

Contributing to that more optimistic view about rates are signs in two key places that the rate of inflation has already peaked. Commodity prices are now way down, with West Texas Intermediate crude off about 14% since the start of June, and copper down about 16%. Not only is oil part of the consumer price index basket, but it is possible that falling commodity prices reflect a decline in demand across the economy. Another indication that prices could be cooling off appeared in the S&amp;P Global U.S. Services Purchasing Managers Index, a measure of activity in the services sector. That fell to 47 in July, while anything below 50 represents a contraction in activity. If activity is diminishing, demand would fall as well, bringing prices down. 

Markets will get to see whether that optimistic thesis holds water when the consumer price index is released on Aug. 10. Economists are looking for the CPI to have gained 8.8% year over year in July, which would be below the 9.1% seen for June. For stocks to keep rising, the market needs to see that inflation is in fact cooling down. If the result is worse than expected, expectations that the Fed will slow down its rate increases could fade away, sending the stock market tumbling. 

“The Fed has to be concerned that inflation is becoming more entrenched and they are going to need to remain aggressive in raising interest rates,” wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. “We believe the rally will last until later in the summer. Markets will again have another selloff.” Others agree. “\[Stock\] gains are now data dependent,” wrote Julian Emanuel, equity strategist at Evercore.

As the financial results of high-tech giants such as Apple and Amazon exceeded market expectations, the investor psychology that is nervous about the recession has improved.

The 0.75% rate increase at the Federal Open Market Commission (FOMC) held on July 27 has already been incorporated, and the point that Chairman Powell of the Federal Reserve (FRB) suggested that the rate increase would slow down is certain repurchase pressure. It is connected to.

On the other hand, as the Central Bank of each country is forced to accelerate financial tightening due to inflation control, and the macroeconomic outlook is deteriorating all over the world, there is a strong view that it will remain in a temporary backlash of the long-term downtrend, and the crypto asset (virtual currency) market is no exception. .

The economic symposium ""Jackson Hole Conference"" is scheduled to be held from August 25 to 27, and it is likely to be interested in the future view of U.S. monetary policy.

personalfinance,Can employer be under-withholding federal taxes?,"My income is 220K and my spouse’s is $350K. We file a joint married tax return each year. On our W4s, we have both put down: single / 0 federal / 0 state withholding. We should be in the 35% percent tax bracket. However, my employer only seems to be withholding 20% federal and my spouse's employer at 25% federal. Based on this, it looks like we’ll owe around $8K to the IRS next year. 

Can someone explain why this is happening? I thought that if you put single/zero/zero then your employer holds the **maximum** amount possible. Is that not the case or are our employers make a mistake? Is there anyway to remedy this? I know I can revise the W4 to ask them to withhold a specific amount (e.g., withhold an extra $400 per paycheck), but I’d prefer they just withhold the correct amount from the get-go.

Thanks!


EDIT:  I should re-phrase my question — if both my wife and I each have our W4s to single/zero/zero, then how is it possible that we owe anything (particularly $8K)? This is our only source of income. I thought single/single/zero means that you'll basically owe nothing and receive no refund.",finance,1659359641
personalfinance,Help Understanding Current Value Calculation of Series I Savings Bonds,"I've started to trickle some e-fund into savings bonds (just a little at a time due to the initial illiquidity). 

I bought a $150 bond in February, which has just come to the 6 month mark and changed rates from 7.12 to 9.62%. Supposedly this time frame is also when interest is compounded. 

What I've noticed is that in my account, the Current Value has increased before this 6 month mark, but not by as much as I would expect based on the interest rate. I figured that this would even out once the 6 month mark was hit, since that's when the interest compounds, but when I checked it this morning it's still shy of what I understand it should be. 

By my calculation, 150\*.0712=10.68 after a year, so after 6 months I should have accrued half that: 5.34. That would put my current value at 155.34, but it's 152.64. Now, this could be because the Current Value reflects the 3 month penalty if I were to cash out now (even though I can't in the first year), but even then, the value should be 152.67, right?

I'm just a bit confused on where the numbers are coming from and why they seem to be about half the actual interest rate.",finance,1659359802

stocks,"U.S. factories grow at slowest pace in two years, ISM finds. New orders fall again in bad omen","A key barometer of American factories fell to a 25-month low of 52.8% in July in a sign of creeping weakness in the U.S. economy. The good news? Inflation pressures eased. The Institute for Supply Management’s closely followed manufacturing gauge dipped from 53% in June, in no small part due to another decline in new orders. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the index to total 52.1%. The closely followed report is viewed as a window into the health of the U.S. economy.

While any number above 50% signifies growth, the latest reading was the weakest since June 2020. The index has also declined three months in a row for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. The silver lining in the report was some relief from inflation. Companies are still paying higher prices for supplies, but a gauge of inflation sank to a nearly two-year low. It will take some time before the economy begins to benefit, however. The rate of inflation has jumped 9.1% in the past year, according to a popular index that tracks the cost of living. Problems getting supplies also continued to clear up. Supply shortages have played a big role in the worst U.S. outbreak of inflation in almost 41 years.

**Big picture:** The U.S. economy has slowed since the end of last year due to soaring inflation, rising interest rates and the end of government stimulus. Gross domestic product, the official scorecard for the economy, has fallen two quarters in a row, meeting an old but informal definition of recession. While factories are still running close to full tilt, business has slowed and it could get worse in the months ahead as a decline in orders suggests. New orders reflect future sales.

In some cases, customers over-ordered and are waiting to sell the products they have on hand. They are also worried about a recession. “Our markets are still holding up; however, I believe a slowdown is coming,” a top executive at a company that makes metal parts told ISM. “We are cautious about going out too far with orders.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Key details:** The index of new orders slid 1.2 points to 48%. That’s the lowest level since May 2020.

The production barometer dropped 1.4 points to 53.5%. The employment gauge rose 2.6 points to 49.9%. Most manufacturers are still trying to hire, Fiore said, in a positive sign for the economy. The prices index, a measure of inflation, sank 18.5 points to 60%, the lowest level in almost two years. Most of the decline reflected lower energy prices. Looking ahead: “The broad slowdown in the economy is apparent in the manufacturing sector as well,” said chief investment office Jim Baird of Plante Moran Financial Advisors. “Still, conditions are modestly expansionary, a welcome sign amid the pervasive negativity on the heels of last week’s GDP report.”

**Market reaction:** The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 0.29% and S&amp;P 500 SPX, 0.27% fell slightly in Monday trades. The losses were extended after the ISM report.

stocks,iBonds long term rate predictions?,"My crystal ball is dirty &amp; malfunctioning…


But I see historically that the rate is 9% which hasn’t been like this at least since before 2000. 

I noticed that after the 08 crash, it tumbled to 0%. And hovers around 2-4% or so most of the time.

Seeing some of the news from the fed and economists that it seems the inflation will remain high and will keep raising rates until inflation goes down it seems that the nov ibond rate will be about the same, right? 

Some analysts say by 2023 the fed will lower rates as inflation gets under control. Which might mean the ibond rates goes lower to around 7% , right?

Or can the ibond rate go above 10% in Nov and then in may 23, the rates go way down?

On one side , the recession might trigger inflation to go down abruptly as more people get fired, and supply chain/energy/war subside.
On the other side maybe baby boomers, who many retired during covid , come back to work and giving too much employment and therefore inflation goes up.

CryptoCurrency,"The crypto market may not actually be following stocks as directly as many people think, so much as the same root causes. Here's what's likely been happening:","You probably all saw last Wednesday, when rate hike numbers came out, both crypto and stocks pumped.

But some of you may have noticed that Bitcoin actually pumped before stocks (about half an hour before).

This is not an isolated incident, it's actually something we've often seen with these moments of correlation with stocks. We've seen several times Bitcoin dip several minutes, sometimes an hour before stocks.

Even the entire crypto market started to crash in November, months before stocks.

In any case, crypto hasn't really waited to see how stocks react to follow its price, and hasn't followed stocks. It has reacted to the causes, not the action of stocks.

# What has been happening?

Crypto is a faster moving, volatile, and lower volume market. So if it's gonna react to something, it will be able to pump, or dump a little faster.

It's not so much that crypto is taking its cues from stocks, but that both crypto and stocks will sometimes follow the same news, economic/market changes, and the same fear/greed behavior.

# The correlation.

The correlation has only started to gain some real significance since Covid.

&amp;#x200B;

[Below 0.5 is generally considered a weak correlation. We started to have a moderate to strong correlation after Covid. ](https://preview.redd.it/23xyti91v4f91.jpg?width=820&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19b982db720ade0bb563d68b7fb21df26874517a)

While the market psychology was similar, it's operating at different speeds, different volatility, and on different cycles.

We had crypto crash a few times into its bear cycles, while stocks were still going strong in their bull market.

The Covid crisis that rippled through all markets, plus the liquidity injected by the fed printers, created causes that affected stocks and crypto at the same time.

But the correlation didn't become strong until this year.

When crypto entered its cyclical bear cycle, it was followed by stocks in their own bear market, a couple months later. And they started their moderate to strong correlation (the strong correlation was only really with tech stocks).

Bear markets become more sensitive to negative news. Most of the negative news this year about Fed rates, inflation, etc...had a similar effect on both markets.

* Should I use the gains from the sale of my home to make a principal payment on my new home's mortgage loan to get over the 20% equity threshold to remove PMI and lower the monthly rate through a recast? 
* Or should I use it to pay off the student loan and car to reduce our overall debt to only our mortgage? 
* Or is there a third option I'm not thinking about?

CryptoMarkets,SEC charges 11 people in alleged $300 million crypto Ponzi scheme Forsage,"On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it charged 11 people for their roles in creating and promoting an allegedly fraudulent crypto pyramid and Ponzi scheme that raised more than $300 million from investors.

The scheme, called Forsage, claimed to be a decentralized smart contract platform, and it allowed millions of retail investors to enter into transactions via smart contracts that operated on the ethereum, tron and binance blockchains. But under the hood, the SEC alleges that for more than two years, the setup functioned like a standard pyramid scheme, in which investors earned profits by recruiting others into the operation. 

In a statement, the SEC added that Forsage operated a typical Ponzi structure, wherein it allegedly used assets from new investors to pay earlier ones.

“As the complaint alleges, Forsage is a fraudulent pyramid scheme launched on a massive scale and aggressively marketed to investors,” wrote Carolyn Welshhans, acting chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.

“Fraudsters cannot circumvent the federal securities laws by focusing their schemes on smart contracts and blockchains.”

Forsage, through its support platform, declined to offer a method for contacting the company and did not offer comment.

Four of the eleven individuals charged by the SEC are founders of Forsage. Their current whereabouts are unknown, but they were last known to be living in Russia, the Republic of Georgia and Indonesia.

The SEC has also charged three U.S.-based promoters who endorsed Forsage on their social media platforms. They were not named in the commission’s release.

Forsage was launched in January 2020, and regulators around the world had tried a couple of different times to shut it down since then. Cease-and-desist actions were brought against Forsage first in September of 2020 by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines, and later, in March 2021, by the Montana commissioner of securities and insurance. Despite this, the defendants allegedly continued to promote the scheme while denying the claims in several YouTube videos and by other means.

Two of the defendants, both of whom did not admit or deny the allegations, agreed to settle the charges, subject to court approval.

personalfinance,Brother bought used truck and I think the dealership screwed him,"My brother has been looking to purchase a used car for quite some time now. I'm proud of him for driving our family beater ever since he started college. After a couple of years graduated, he has been doing very well with work and had some good funds saved up, it was time for an upgrade. He found a lightly used 2020 Tacoma and sent me a picture of the online listing for $30,498.

I discussed with him the pros/cons of paying off various student loans with his saved-up funds vs using cash for a down payment. I told him his next step was to find various financing options at different credit unions. He would then get back to me and we'd figure out the best course of action for actually buying the vehicle and dealing with the tactics that the dealerships use. 

The old car was sideswiped recently by a drunk driver and over the weekend he was pulled over for the mirror being gone. He was fed up, and I can't blame him. After this encounter, unbeknownst to me, he went down to the dealership and bought the truck he said he was going to buy using their finance department. I told him no worries, we'd search for better financing through a credit union and get the dealership out of the picture.

This morning he called me about the numbers on the bill of sale. The Cash Price listed was $37,517.69 with $2,071.69 of that being taxes. This means they priced the vehicle at $35,446, $4,948 over what the price of the vehicle was online. He said he signed a document with the original $30,498 that they haven't sent a copy of. Is there some fine print he missed or did they try to pull a fast one on him?

There are a few more problems, mainly the dealership extended warranty, that we need to take care of. Any help would be great. I have more info if need be.

EDIT: Thanks for everyone's insight. I had him march down to the dealership and we talked to the finance guy. They ended up adding a $150 Gov Fee, $499 Proc/Doc Fee, $399 3 Year Key Replacement, $2,995 Addendum with a bunch of BS (Lifetime Window Tint, Special Paint Coating), and some GPS thing for $1,295. He was led to believe these were included in the cost of the vehicle. The finance guy said every sale has to come with this stuff which is non-negotiable but not listed in the sticker price. He definitely knew he was pulling a fast one on my brother. The dealership I got my truck from tried this and I told them to pound sand. 

We ended up getting rid of the $4,800 extended warranty and a few other items totaling $1,300. Told my brother that this is a learning experience and a mistake he'll never make again.",finance,1659385690

I will rightfully get put on blast for this, but I don't have a credit card. Haven't built any credit. I would prefer to never take out a loan. I know this is stupid, and am willing to be convinced otherwise.

That $700k is more or less set aside to buy a house. But given life circumstances, I will not be ready to do that for \~2 years or so. So the question is what to do with it in the mean time.

The market is volatile at the moment. If a had a 30yr time horizon I wouldn't be worried. But PE ratios are elevated above the historical averages, word is we are heading into a recession, and I don't trust that I would have positive returns over a 2yr period.

I will also have a decent income the next few years. The plan right now is to max out 401k's and savings accounts. There may be another windfall payment of \~$1M in the next few years, but nothing there is certain there.

The best I can think of for the cash is some high interest rate CD (\~3% right now). But maybe there are better options? I will probably max out I-Bonds as well.

datascience,My manager telling me “data science jobs are all descriptive stats and dashboarding”,"I’m a data science intern and I had a coffee chat with my manager today. He went into depth about how my experience has been at the company and his team, and overall what kind of jobs I was interested in. My background is in statistics and minor in mathematics, so I’ve been exposed to the modeling heavy side. Also I have done some coding and data cleaning related tasks before so I am familiar with that side as well (web scraping for personal projects is the closest thing to data engineering I’ve done). 

Anyways, my project was pretty much solely product analytics and marketing analytics and doing tableau dashboarding and SQL. I didn’t sugarcoat it for him, I told him straight up how I thought this project and my experience had introduced me to me a different side of analytics, but I was more interested in what the modeling team and the data science research team does. 

He didn’t get mad, but he basically just tried to tell me that the jobs I’m interested in don’t really exist, that data science is “more than just statistics” and that at the end of the day all data science jobs are “people managing, sql crunching, and visualizing simple kpis”. 

To me it felt a bit off putting, because in that case it feels like I’ve been fed a lie my whole life about what data science is. With his statement, graduate school seems even more promising than working a junior analyst job somewhere.

personalfinance,"Going to jail for 1 year, 17k in cc/pl debt, 21k in student loans, No assets or savings.","Throwaway for obvious reasons. First off I just want to mention, given the fact that my case has not concluded, I will not be discussing my case in any further detail, other than the fact that I am expecting to report to county jail within the next 1-2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I (single) am currently 17k in debt with credit cards/personal loans and 21k in federal student debt. During my college years I was arrested, indicted, and bailed out. My lawyer bought me enough time to complete my education and did gig/contract work to keep myself afloat. I am fortunate enough to have a lawyer who took my case on pro bono and I don't have any car loans or mortgages. I currently have no assets; my car is in another family member's name, I live with family, and the most expensive thing I own is my cell phone.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in a position where my gig work has been hit hard by the economy and I'm at the point where I need to start giving up on paying creditors since I will be reporting to jail soon. My support system is prepared to supplement my food, living situation, and basic essentials like a phone bill and health insurance. As well that support system will be there for me when I get out. I am confident I can find basic work when I get out and I foresee myself getting into my career field within the next 3 years. My current financial plan is to serve my time, file for bankruptcy , shoulder my student debt, and start fresh.

&amp;#x200B;

The advice I would like is:

1. How sound is my current plan?
2. Should I inform my creditors of my situation, even if I plan to file for bankruptcy?
3. Should I assign a trustee to my accounts, even though I have nothing to give? I'm worried they will harass that individual.
4. Should I attempt to settle my debts after I serve my time? I do not believe my first job out will be big money, although I have good connections to my field and am confident on my 3 year timeline to be in my career field.
5. Are there any other resources I should be looking at?

I am getting a brand-new M1 Macbook Air, which when looking it up, appears to have a lithium-polymer battery. In any case, what IS the proper protocol to ensure it lasts longest, etc...?

Do I need to charge it for at least 24 hours or up to 100%?

Do I need to charge it to a full 100% and then drain it to a complete 0% for some reason or nothing like that?

What if it is already at some random percent, let's say, 50% when I get it. Just charge it from there or drain it first?

I can use the laptop during that initial charge or better not to?

&amp;#x200B;

ALSO, since this means I will be ""retiring"" my 2012 Macbook Air (lol), do I need to do anything in particular with THAT battery while it sits in storage or wherever I put it for a long time? For example, do I drain it's battery to 0% presumably before putting it into storage? Its battery is already effed, it lasts 10-15 minutes without the adapter with light normal use. Is it possibly unsafe to store a battery that is presumably not in great condition?

EDIT: Another thing that I read about recently that I forgot to mention in my original post was somethin about generally keeping laptop charged between 20-80%, like at all times I guess. Is this something that is considered good practice?

Also any reason to think the battery on the one that I will put in storage could expand and blow up while in storage or something? I even have keys that have popped out of the laptop and won't go back in and sometimes I wonder if it's possible that they won't go back in because the battery has expanded ever-so-slightly but maybe I'm just paranoid.

Upon releasing their Q1 results in May shares came crashing down - more than halving in value over the space of two days. The price further slumped over the next months, with prices currently trading at CAD$0.75 (01 August 2022).

Despite revenue beating most expectations with CAD$41.2m, investors were spooked at losses worsened to (CAD$18m) - nearly doubling from last year's quarter loss of (CAD$10m).

The net margin for Q1 was a loss of (43.9%), lower than last year's quarter loss of (47.6%).

Xebec haven't always been loss making - in the final quarter of 2021 they earned CAD$2.42 on record revenue of CAD$46m - as well as CAD$2.02m for FY19.

Total cash levels had been incrementally declining to CAD$24m, down from CAD$100m in last year's quarter - leaving investors worried about how Xebec would raise further cash and the risk of dilution or increasing debt levels amidst interest rate rises.

Total assets were CAD$464m, which was up from CAD$419m in last year's quarter - but were down from record levels of $497m as of 31 Dec 2021.

Total debt was CAD$83m - representing a current liquidity margin of 17.9% (compared to last years quarter of 13.1%).

Xebec's balance sheet has been growing considerably over the last few operating years, with the 2020 trading year taking assets levels up to elevated heights. The liquidity margin was 12.8% in FY20 and 17.7% in FY21.

personalfinance,best way to buy a new car,"I've never bought a new car before, or borrowed money to buy any of my cars. I drove cheap used cars when I was younger and for the past 7 years or so have shared a car with my wife. We historically just haven't had a need for 2 cars, but now we do and it's my turn to buy the car (she bought the old one). 

If you don't want to read everything below, feel free just to chime in on this: what kind of rate and term length should I expect? My credit score is 792 and my salary is $120k.

I'm 41 years old and I am between jobs at the moment. I left my old job (of 14 years) in June and have since accepted an offer to start in October. The salary of both jobs is/was $120k.

After quitting I rolled my 401k into an IRA so now all of my long-term money is in one place (Vanguard). The total account balance is about $400k, $59k of which is in a taxable brokerage account while the rest is in IRAs. The taxable account was funded with money that I had to save over the past 7 years or so after maxing out my 401k, IRA and HSA. It was designated for a major purchase in the future or early retirement, whichever came first. 

I'd like to max out my 401k and IRA again this year, but since I am enjoying 4 months off from work that would be hard to do with income alone. So I figure if I can at the new job, I'll contribute something really high (&gt;50%) whatever it takes to max it out for the year, while continuing to pull money from the brokerage account for spending money through the end of the year.

So, the question is do I get a car loan, or pay for the new car with cash that I get by withdrawing even more from my brokerage account. I have $59k which is enough for the new car ($30-$40k range) and to max out the 401k, but I won't have much left over at the end of the year. 

In some ways, that's good - assuming my long-term capital gains rate remains 15%, it's better to pull the money out ASAP and divert the money to my 401k to stop the taxable growth, and if I pull more money out for the car, that also stops the tax drag. 

On the other hand, I'm not paying off my mortgage early as a bet that gains will exceed the interest rate, and I'm trying to decide if I should do the same thing with the car. If the rates are similarly low and terms sufficiently long, it might make sense to.

edit: forgot to add - if the money stays in the taxable brokerage until early retirement, there is a chance I'll be able to withdraw it during a year when I'm in the 0% LTCG tax bracket, but of course that isn't certain. I would like to retire around age 50. So, I'm not sure whether to see pulling the money out as a good or bad thing tax-wise.",finance,1659397788

economy,"In reality, poverty is on the rise: Americans are having a tough time in an economy they keep being told is actually really strong.","“In reality, poverty is on the rise. With inflation going up and federal support ending, households are suddenly finding it much harder to make ends meet. Since the wildly successful Child Tax Credit expired in December, nearly half of the parents who benefited from the program have reported struggling to afford to feed their families, and more than 60 percent say they can’t pay for basic necessities. Child poverty shot up just under 5 percentage points between December 2021 and January 2022, meaning 3.7 million more kids were suddenly thrown below the poverty line.

It’s not just households with kids: 54 percent of elderly single women and 45 percent of elderly single men either qualify as poor or don’t make enough to pay for the essentials. Just under two-thirds of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck by this past June, up 4 percentage points since a year earlier

Those that do have work, meanwhile, don’t earn nearly enough from it. News about rising wages often ignores that the cost of everything else is rising, too, and at a faster rate than workers’ pocketbooks can keep up with. One in three workers make less than $15 an hour, which is already worth quite a bit less than it did when the Fight for $15 campaign started ten years ago, while roughly 243,000 workers earn as little as the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at the same puny level an ungodly thirteen years, and is today worth the least it has since sixty years ago.

Americans in turn are less and less able to afford the skyrocketing price of keeping a roof over their heads. This past May, the median asking rent for the whole of the United States cleared $2,000 a month for the first time in history after rising 14.8 percent over the previous year. This effectively means that only households making $80,000 a year are now paying rent that’s officially “affordable” by government standards. Even mobile homes have seen their rent shoot up, thanks to private equity firms and other investors buying up them up as cash cows.

As a result, the already bad US homelessness crisis is getting palpably worse. Shelters across the country are seeing their waitlists double and triple, with single mothers and even families with jobs more and more likely to ask for help. This isn’t just anecdotal evidence: cities and states all over the map are recording an uptick.

All the while, Americans are winding up deeper and deeper into debt to keep their heads above water. Household debt is on the rise, and 43 percent of Americans expect to sink further in the months ahead, most of it thanks to increasingly expensive mortgages, but much of it through credit cards. For many, it’s the only way they can pay off treatment for health and medical issues, which, coupled with the dysfunctional, corporate insurance-dominated US health care system that chugs along unreformed, has left one hundred million Americans with some form of health care debt today.

Any sane person would read all this and tell you that job numbers and GDP — which tells us only about the total wealth of a country in a system where those at the very top are taking massive shares of it for themselves — don’t give you a very full picture of this economy. “

I’ve met my initial goal net worth goal (originally $2m, currently at $2.5m).  Now we just need to wait 2 more years until we’re retirement eligible from the military.  We were at $2.7m at the beginning of the year, but you know how that's gone for everyone. Major financial events were selling a rental house last fall and buying a new primary residence a few months ago (details below).

You can read previous annual updates here by clicking this [link and then continuing to follow the previous links.](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/nu162f/military_couple_3_years_from_fire_goal_update/)  I’ve been working towards FIRE for about 16 years and have been making progress updates on reddit for 6 years.

The goal we’ve had is simple:  maintain the same quality of life we’ve been enjoying, without having to go to work.  The methodology I used was to look at our spending, then, consider whether each of our current expenses would remain in retirement, and if so, whether it would go up or down.  I wanted to be conservative with my estimates, so we estimated on the high side if there was any doubt.

**Current Ages:**

* Me: 41yrs
* Wife: 39yrs
* Kid 1: 9yrs
* Kid 2: 6yrs

**Income:**

* Me: $147k
* Wife: $140k
* Rental Income: $14k (net)  This is down from $30k in previous years.  We sold one of our rental houses last fall.  We had bought that house back in 2010 as a foreclosure for $215k and sold it for $305k.  It was a 15 yr mortgage so we only owed about $30k on it so that money just went into the brokerage account for a while.
* Dividends: $8.8k
* Total:  $309.8k (last year was $316.6k)

**Savings:**   We max out our tax advantaged savings accounts (TSP and Roth IRAs).  We're no longer eligible for Roth IRAs, a big chunk of our military pay consists of tax free housing/subsistence allowances, so we got to use Roth IRAs longer than typical based on the overall income.  We’re adding approx $109k/yr to various savings/retirement accounts.  Pretty much all saving stops after we FIRE.

**Current balances:  (note: everything is in low cost index funds such as VTI, VXUS, VOO, C/S/I funds)**

* TSPs (gov’t 401k): $984k  (down from $1.078m)
* Roth IRAs: $338k (down from $365k)
* Taxable brokerage account: $514k (up from $383k)
* Emergency fund/Cash on hand: $60k (up from $30k)
* Coverdell Education Savings Accounts: $58k (up from $56k)

**Life insurance:** No changes.  $500k in regular/family SGLI (military) for each parent, plus separate $500k 30-yr term policies for each parent.  The military insurance will go away when we retire, but the 30-yr term policies will go until age 63 or so.

**Expenses:**

* Fixed expenses: $8,341.61/mo    
* Fixed savings: $9k (this is down from $10,661.60/mo) as no more Roth IRA, but it's offset by more money going to debt/taxable brokerage account.

[**Historical Actual Net Worth and Debt**](https://i.imgur.com/fh5cpqG.jpg)

**Current Net Worth:  $2.5m**

* 2012: +$130k
* 2013: +$194k
* 2014: +$110k
* 2015: +$39k
* 2016: +$177k
* 2017: +$247k
* 2018: +$102k
* 2019: +$367k
* 2020: +$418k
* 2021: +$541k  (ended year at $2.7M)
* 2022: -$191K  (down $191k, at the market low a couple months ago we were down about $350k -- advice to anyone is don't panic, just hold)

**Current Total Debt: $806k (up from $397k)**

* Rental House: 314k @ 3% left on mortgage (Property worth about $700k)
* New house/Primary residence:  $467k @ 4.35% 5 yr ARM.  We moved this year and ended up buying a house at the top of the market (or maybe not as prices have continued to edge up).  We put 20% down and I went with a 5 yr ARM to minimize the interest rate as they were skyrocketing just as we started looking for houses.  Figured the ARM didn't matter too much, if rates go up a ton and we actually stayed here after retirement, then we always have the option of just paying it off entirely.  While it pains me to think $1700/mo is going to interest, renting was an even worse proposition in this area for the size/quality/neighborhoods we wanted.  (Property worth about $600k)
* Car 1: $7k @ 2.75%
* Car 2: 18k @ 1.9% 

**Retirement plan:**

Military pensions are equal to 2.5% \* yrs of service \* high 3 base pay avg. So, 20 years = 50% of your base pay. Based on our expected rank at retirement, this would be $63k each.  This is inflation indexed and will adjust after retirement the same amount as social security adjusts.  I'm actually going to go 20.5 years to maximize my pension (51.25% or so) while replacing 6 months of income history with my current higher monthly pay.

**Assumptions:**

* 3.25% safe withdrawal rate.  We’d draw primarily from our taxable account first, then Roth IRA principle, and also set up a 72(t) distribution from our TSP funds which would allow us to access those funds prior to 59.5
* My Military Retirement: $63k
* Spouse Military Retirement: $63k
* Retirement/Taxable Account Distributions:  $71.5k

**Retirement income (post-tax): $197k/yr**

I'll sell the second rental house around when we retire.  I had to sell the first rental house last year to start the clock on the 2 yr primary residence tax exemption.  There's a special rule for military where if you moved due to military orders you have about 10 years to sell it and still get the tax exemption as if it was your primary house.  However, you can only do that once every 2 years, and you can only pause the clock on one house at a time.  It seems like it was a good time to sell.

**Retirement house purchase scenario:**

* Price:  $700k
* Expected equity from rental houses: $489K
* Cash out: $200k (would rather put it in the market than have it locked up in my primary residence)
* Mortgage: $460k @ 5%, 30 yr (really don't know about this, if rates are high we'll just put more down)
* Payment w/taxes and insurance: $3,761

The biggest unknown we have is still not knowing where we want to buy a house and live.  We’ve narrowed it down to a handful of states and have a house budget target of ~~$400-~~700k.   My excel spreadsheet lets us easily make retirement projection calculations, so I can plug in house purchase prices, interest rates, taxes, insurance, etc., how much cash out I want.  I also added projections based on my months to retirement for future contributions to our financial accounts.

In the past I had planned to use the VA loan benefit and not put anything down if rates were super low and just invest all that rental house equity, that idea has pretty much been scratched now.  One important consideration is getting the loan figured out prior to retirement.  It seems mortgage lenders aren’t as interested in lending money if you aren’t working.  My spouse will be working one year more than me and we should qualify on just that income.  Worst case scenario we just buy a house outright and don’t get a mortgage.

**Current Expenses (that carry over into retirement):  No real changes here compared to last year.  I'll admit I haven't tracked them as closely as I used to.  I plan to do an in depth update on expenses at the end of the calendar year to compare how inflation has affected things.**

Overall that’s $197k income, after tax is probably closer to $160k and $153k expenses for a small cushion.  I'm pretty comfortable with that knowing my estimates are pretty conservative and we could easily scale back expenses or worst case get some side hustles going. The 3.25% SWR could also be upped if needed, albeit at a slightly higher risk.  I've thought about this a bunch and considering the expected social security income at age 62, we'd probably be perfectly fine with a 5% SWR due to the guaranteed income from pensions/social security.

**Common questions:**

* **What about the kid’s college expenses?**  Each of us transferred our GI Bill benefits to the kids.  That pays for the highest in-state public university tuition cost plus a housing allowance and books/fees stipend.  We'll continue funding the Coverdell education savings accounts until our retirement then let that money grow until they go to school. They should be able to easily afford college without needing to take on any student loans.  Any excess funds from the Coverdell ESAs can be converted to 529 and transferred to a cousin.
* **Are you taking into account social security?** We’ll both start getting social security which would be an extra $2k month in today’s dollars.  After doing the math, we’ll probably just take the money as soon as we can (age 62) even if we don’t need it since the break even point isn’t until our late 70s if we delay payments.
* **Why don’t you snag a high paying contractor job after you retire from the military and make bank for a few years?** Yes, we both have extremely marketable and in demand skills and could land high paying jobs post military.  We’d rather spend our time with the kids/extended family though.  We just don’t need that money.  If asked, I’ll just tell people that I’m a high net worth financial advisor (true except the only client is myself).
* **Why not stick around in the military a few more years?** The military pension goes off your high 3 years of earnings and adds 2.5% per year of service.  We’re planning to leave at 20 years (50%).  Yes, we could get promoted again and then stick around 3 more years to increase that base pay/high 3 calculation.  Sticking around 1 extra year would mean a 52.5% pension instead of 50% which would be an extra $300/mo.  At the end of the day, it all comes down to whether or not we need that extra income vs the stress of being in the military (potential deployments/separation/long hours/etc).  The bottom line is the military doesn’t define who we are and there are others capable of doing our jobs when we walk away.
* **What will you do to stay busy?** Kids, volunteer work, travel, extra curricular activities, go to the gym because we want to, start a garden/chickens/apiary, who knows.  I do plan to spend some time at a coffee shop telling unsolicited war stories to young people at least one day a month.
* **Why is your healthcare budget so low?** As a military retiree, we’re eligible for Tricare retired.  This is the same health coverage we currently have, but when we retire we have to pay about $600/yr for enrollment fees and minimal co payments ($20-$30 for a visit) with a catastrophic cap of $3.5k or so.  This includes a good prescription drug benefit, but no dental/vision coverage.  When we become eligible for medicare you automatically get swapped to medicare and Tricare For Life which is basically Tricare covering the 20% that medicare does not plus your same existing prescription drug coverage.  Basically we'll have only the medicare premiums as our healthcare costs after age 65.

tl;dr Net worth is now $2.5m. Plan is to retire in 2 years at the age of 43 with military pensions worth $126k/yr while using a 3.5% SWR to generate an additional $71k for a combined total of $197k/yr retirement income.",finance,1659401013

In my area 1 bedroom apartments usualy go for $600 and up.  I have toured a large 1 bedroom apartment in a nice location that is being rented for $750/month, this price includes all of the utilites. I pay \~$100/month for car insurance and do not have a car payment, gas is paid for by my employer. I have a $25/month fee for a storage locker that I will still need to store things in (its not anything that I could  store in this apartment so I cant get rid of it). I spend \~$150/month on groceries but this could be brought down significantly. I'm currently not paying for any streaming services. I'm assuming internet will cost me between $50-75/month.

I have steady employment and my net income is \~1,200/month.

I'm currently giving college a second try but tuition is all covered by grants and subsidized loans. there is a possibility I could easily get a second job on campus to bring in some more money each month (I have federal work study so it should be relativley easy to get), this was something I was thinking about doing either way.

I currently live with a family member and paying between $400-$600/month depending on utility usage. It's not an ideal situation and I'm only there due to some major changes in my life a few years ago. long story short its time for me to be living on my own again.",finance,1659409308
personalfinance,pre-owned vs new car,"Hello,

We are looking to buy a van for our growing family. I was comparing a new sienna with a MSRP of nearly 45k to an older Odyssey 2015 56k miles for 28k. 

My calculation assumes that we will keep the Odyssey for 5 years while Sienna for 9 years or more based on our past ownerships. Based on a mockup interest rate and better MPG for the Sienna the increase in cost of ownership for Sienna is coming out to be nearly $544 a year.

personalfinance,Consolidating debts/loans,"Hi all! I am looking for advice as I'm not quite sure if I'm in the right path.

So I have 4 small/medium debts which total around CAD 14K. 3 of those debts are through the bank and one is a student loan given by the government. All of these have different interest rates of course, from 5% to 13.45%, and I was thinking of regrouping to save on interests and pay them off faster. Is this a good option? The bank is willing to consolidate the debts but I'm having a hard time deciding as my credit, which i rebuilt drastically over the last few years, might be affected and I'd like to start saving more than a few bucks a week for future projects.

If anyone has gone through this, I would appreciate your feedback as I'm still not 100% sold on the idea. Also, sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes, english isn't my first language.

Thank you very much!",finance,1659410098
personalfinance,Should I sell my 16-month old car and get something cheaper to rid myself of credit card debt?,"**Current Car**: In March of 2021, I purchased a Toyota RAV4 Prime for \~$45k; it is now worth \~$50k with its current mileage according to offers from Carvana, Vroom, etc. I owe just under $31k on the loan and I'm paying \~$500 per month over 84 months at a 3.14% interest rate.

**Financial Profile**: Currently, I make \~$140k a year - $4,600 per month after taxes/401k/insurance and sell $5k-$10k in stock after taxes every 6 months. I pay $1,600 per month in rent and I owe \~$25k in credit card debt and \~$50k in student loans (even split between public and private). I spend *quite a bit of money each month* on bikes (nice MTB, coaching, maintenance) and eating nicely and healthily.

**Looking ahead**: Experts say that the economy isn't in a recession yet, but I think we will be next year so I'm trying to brace myself (besides trying to do a better job at managing my finances). I also have public student loans that I will have to start paying either next month or after the new year if extended again. Lastly, my rent will be changing to $1k per month once I move to a house with a friend in January.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the above context, do you think I should switch cars to something cheaper (\~$30k) and take the $20k to pay off most of my credit card debt? I'd need it to comfortably seat my 6'3"" stature, have cruise control with lane keep assist and get great gas mileage for the once-a-month long trips I take. If so, what do you recommend?

solar,Please let me know if this is a good deal. Thank you.,"I have been a lurker for some time and now that I am considering solar + battery. I'm hoping some of you can assess what I'm considering for my house. I don't know much about this, hence the reason I'm posting so please I will appreciate all your honest assessments/opinions.

I am in Houston, TX, and my future plans include at least 2 EVs. My average electricity payments are currently $200 / month.

The two main reasons I am considering this are to do my part to be greener, and for backup power since we're prone to power outages here (hurricanes, Texas power grid, etc.)

Note: The monthly solar payments do not increase as shown if I apply the 26% tax credit to by the 19th payment. The interest rate is 5.99% and the payment/warranty is for 25 years. I plan to pay it all off within the next 3-5 years.

The photo showing my energy consumption shows my current consumption at the top and the guaranteed solar production at the bottom.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated. The installer is by Sunnova BTW.

economy,Why does China need the Pelosi scandal?,"Since the beginning of this year, China has become more and more aggressive in the international arena, turning from a ""watching monkey"" into a ""yapping mutt."" Now we are witnessing a new round of public attacks by the PRC against Taiwan and the United States. And this is actually caused not by deep feelings for the fate of the island, but by nothing more than a significant deterioration in the state of the Chinese economy: Xi Jinping is forced to increasingly learn from Putin's experience in distracting the Chinese layman from internal problems with the help of threats against external enemies, to which China, as well as in Russia, there is significant demand.

In fact, China artificially created the problem itself when it took out its displeasure with Nancy Pelosi's impending visit to the public domain. It would seem that hint through diplomatic channels that the visit is undesirable, and Pelosi would have quietly abandoned such plans. However, the sharp and public attacks on the United States against the backdrop of a visit that has not yet been approved left the states with no choice: Pelosi must visit Taiwan, otherwise, the whole world will perceive such a refusal as America's weakness. It will be interesting to see how China will get out if Pelosi does visit the island. And will it not turn out that China has painted itself into a corner: it is clearly not ready to start hostilities.

However, let us return to the reason for China's escapade against the United States, namely the state of the Chinese economy. And there are the sad consequences of a zero-tolerance policy toward the coronavirus. Since the beginning of the year, China has been forced to regularly introduce new hard lockdowns in different parts of the country to prevent the spread of the highly contagious omicron strain of Covid-19. At the same time, it has long been obvious that Covid has become an endemic virus that will now always be present in the human population. Achieving zero incidences of it by shutting down economic activity is as crazy an idea as shutting down cities because of a few residents with a cold or the flu. However, Xi Jinping remains committed to the crazy idea of ​​proving to the West that China's totalitarian system can achieve this. And he's not worth the price. And the price could be the collapse of the Chinese economy.

In the 1Q, strict epidemiological restrictions mainly affected only March, and the country's economy still managed to demonstrate the growth of 4.8% y/y. These were still high growth rates, but back in 2019, which was not the most successful for the Chinese economy, GDP growth was 6%. But already in the 2Q, the Chinese economy grew by only 0.4% YoY. At the same time, this weak growth was achieved only through exports, precisely to those countries that this paper dragon is trying to growl at, while sectors of the economy focused on domestic demand showed a decline.

Thus, the export of goods from China for 1H of 2022 grew by 13.3% YoY, while imports, amid falling domestic demand due to lockdowns, grew by only 5.7%. And this is in monetary terms against the backdrop of record commodity prices observed in this period. In real terms, China's imports, which are dominated by commodities and intermediate goods, should have shown a significant drop. It was weak imports to China that allowed the country to achieve modest economic growth in the 2Q. Let me remind you that net export is included in the calculation of GDP dynamics: the outpacing growth of exports compared to imports makes it possible to increase the dynamics of GDP growth. However, as we can see, in the 2Q this growth was artificial and was the result of epidemiological restrictions and not the success of Chinese goods in foreign markets.

[China International tradу statistics](https://preview.redd.it/q7wxu3qgh8f91.jpg?width=757&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae72f698e84e7b453d2a19c0c406a70c04540146)

China's industrial sector (including construction), which accounts for about 39% of the country's economy, grew in the 2Q due to external demand by only 0.9% YoY (5.8% y/y in the 1Q), while the service sector, which accounts for ≈55% of the country's GDP, decreased by 0.4% YoY. Given that China again regularly imposed lockdowns in different parts of the country in July and still declares its commitment to zero coronavirus cases, one should not be optimistic about the dynamics of the economy in the second half of 2022.

Developed countries remained the main source of external demand for China's industry. However, as we remember, developed countries are now rapidly tightening monetary policy in order to limit demand, which, in addition to accelerating inflation, ensures the growth of the Chinese economy. So, if for the whole of 2021 exports from China grew by almost 30%, then, as I mentioned above, growth for the first half of the year was only 13.3%. Given the continued rise in interest rates in developed countries, there is every reason to believe that the dynamics of China's exports will move into the red zone already during the 2nd half of the year. Thus, the Chinese economy will soon face a double whammy - a continued fall in domestic demand due to lockdowns and the beginning of a fall in external demand.

The depth of the decline in domestic demand in China is evidenced by the dynamics of retail sales: in the first half of the year they decreased by 0.7% YoY. And this is in nominal terms. Taking into account the average inflation rate in China in the first half of the year of about 1.7% YoY, the fall in domestic demand in real terms was about 2% YoY. And this is in an economy that, before the pandemic, showed real demand growth rates above 6% (!). [The fall in consumer sentiment in China, observed since March of this year, leaves no chance for a recovery in consumer activity](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/consumer-confidence): the consumer sentiment index in China fell below the level of 90 points and is at a record low since China began publishing such statistics in 1991, in while back in February it was above 120 p. Thus, the people of China obviously know something more about the state of their economy than the world financial markets.

Thus, the people of China obviously know something more about the state of their economy than the world financial markets.

The sad state of the PRC economy is also evidenced by the dynamics of tax revenues to the country's budget. So, if according to the results of the 1Q budget revenues showed an increase of 8.6% YoY, then by the end of the 1H they fell by 10.2% YoY, while the fall in revenues in the 2Q averaged a monstrous 28.1% YoY! Given that budget expenditures grew by 5.9% YoY in 1H, the 12-month rolling budget deficit of the Celestial Empire grew from 3.8% in 2021 to 5.3% of GDP as of 30 June of the current year. As in many other countries, China's budget spending peaks at the end of the year, as a result, we can expect a further significant increase in the budget deficit in the second half of the year.

[China Budget statistics](https://preview.redd.it/mz8synwih8f91.jpg?width=756&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43466e4043b9e5c18c9695842c69badf8a458f41)

The state of affairs in China is also sad with private investments: if, according to the results of the 1Q, their dynamics was 8.4% YoY, then by June their growth rates had fallen to a barely noticeable 1.3-1.6%, which in real terms indicates their contraction. The country still manages to demonstrate the growth of total investments due to the investments of state-owned companies, but they are financed by a further sharp increase in the debt burden, which carries enormous risks for the economy against the backdrop of its weak dynamics.

With the Chinese economy suffering from monstrous imbalances and an unprecedented bubble in the country's real estate sector, China risks facing an economic crisis of such magnitude, from which it will take longer to recover than it has been for more than 30 years. years in a state of lethargic sleep of Japan.

Thus, at the steering wheel of China, we are seeing the same inadequate as in Russia, which is ready to sacrifice the state of the national economy and the well-being of the population for the sake of miserable geopolitical goals. However, we wish Xi Jinping success in his endeavors: the collapse of China will lead to the completion of the commodity super cycle, which could bury more than one authoritarian regime in the coming years.

personalfinance,Is it correct that a CD ladder will always yield less total money than a single long-term CD?,"Hi all. I'm doing a little math here, and I'm thinking I'm right, but I want to be sure. Is it right that the only real benefit of a CD ladder is simply to have earlier access to your money? And if you really don't need it sooner, it's better to leave more money in a longer-term account?

For example, [this image](https://snipboard.io/Zuv3FW.jpg) (&lt;-- that's a link in case you can't see it) shows the figures I'm working with. Basically it comes down to earning either $1,706 in interest from a 5-year, $10,000 CD, or $891 from five separate $2,000 CDs staggered yearly.

Did I do this right? Is the 5-year CD simply better if you don't need early access to the money? It's nearly $900 more!

(One possible argument I can see for the CD ladder is that it not only gives you earlier access to the money, but also allows you to reinvest each rung at a possibly higher interest rate each year. But since there's no way to know if the rates will be higher or lower, is it smart to do it for just this reason?)

personalfinance,Is downsizing worth it?,"My spouse (M46) and I (F44) are considering downsizing our 2200 square foot home to something smaller and less expensive, maybe 1500 square feet. We have about $310K left on our mortgage, and our house could probably sell for about $700k. Conservatively, I think we could walk away with $300k. To get a reasonable home at the smaller square footage in our HCOL would probably be in the $380-425K range. Even with higher interest rates I believe we would save about $900/month on mortgage, and we should save on energy costs with a smaller home, though I'm less sure what those savings would be. We would perhaps save on maintenance costs, as well? I'd love to hear thoughts on this plan, especially from those who have downsized themselves. Our goals are to live more simply, save more money, etc. My husband worries that the savings wouldn't be worth having a less nice home which would probably not be in as nice of an area (lovely town, cul de sac) as our current home, plus losing out on the appreciation of the more expensive home over time. I feel like having less debt and fewer monthly expenses is well worth it. Thanks!",finance,1659440034
CryptoCurrency,"Are we at the bottom? no one knows, but market is doing fine.","How much deeper market gonna dive? Many believe we are near bottom. And there is a big reason for it. Market acting surprisingly fine despite everything. 















First it was interest rates. We knew it will be around 75 and it was. And market rallied (relief rally?) And it did not stop when numbers came in and US GDP growth was negative for the second consecutive quarter (which is a big recession indicator).

















Why is that? Many think it is because we have allrdy saw the bottom and that market is currently ""undervalued"" so it is kind of numb to bad news. It very well might be the case, or it might not. 
Frankly It is not about where the bottom is (if there is one) but rather when there will be room for real growth!
Current situation is:














1. We might allrdy be in recession. 

















2. Inflation is still here.

















3. War in Ukraine continue to have an impact on energy and food price.

personalfinance,Calculating effective interest rate with lower intro rate,"Hi,

Some help needed!

Trying to calculate the effective interest rate of the following conditions:

* The credit being repaid in 12 months
* The credit sum being 20 000 kr
* The interest rate being 16,9 %
* The annual fee being 195 kr
* The monthly fee being 25 kr
* The same sum being paid every month (the yearly fee the first month though, and so that lowers the repayment the first month)
* **What makes it difficult for me to use an online calculator is this:** The interest rate is 0 % the first 50 days, not 1 or 2 months like what can be entered into the calculators.

It's very important that the answer is precise, can anyone point me in the correct direction, or show me a formula or anything that might help me?",finance,1659443129
Banking,NBFC not providing statement on refund of the excess interest paid,"My father took a mortgage loan from an NBFC and he decided to foreclose the loan after 7 months due to the hefty interest rate. On 5th of every month the EMI will be deducted automatically.

During 8th month, my father foreclosed the loan on 23rd and during foreclosure the bank executives told that the interest of 30000 bucks should be paid for the whole month and the excess interest paid will be refunded after the loan is closed.

According to my calculation, the no of days for which the interest to be paid is from 6th to 22nd i.e., 17 days, so the interest for 17 days equals (30000 x 17)/30 = 17000. So my father has to receive 13000 as the excess interest amount but only received 6000 bucks. And when I called and asked for a statement of refund from the bank, they are saying no statement will be given after the loan is closed. They are not willing to give any explanation for the same.

I need to know whether my calculation is right or wrong.


Update - I have mailed the bank's customer care that I should receive the remaining 7000 bucks. A person from the company called me today and told that the interest is calculated only from 6th to 25th of every month. Even by the logic he mentioned, it doesn't answer the fact that I have received 6000 bucks. When I mentioned this point to him, he was stumbling and said that he has to look into why 6000 bucks were credited to me and didn't give me a proper explanation. Is there any chance what he is said is true about interest being calculated from 6th to 25th?",finance,1659446775

I'm 27, M, single in Cherry Hill, South NJ. I make 80k before taxes. My monthly expenses look like this:

- 1600 in rent (parking, water, electric, gas, etc included)
- 750 in student loans (will go up to 1100 when the federal loans are off pause in August)
- 420 in car note + insurance
- ~400 for Food/Entertainment (varies month to month) 
- 130 for internet and cable

After taxes I take home 1050 a week (my job pays weekly). I've been here two years and currently have 17k saved through employee match. Outside of that, I have 4k saved for emergency funds. 

My job offers a 8% employee match for savings. I am currently doing the 4% employee match as I don't think I would be able to afford the full 8% out my paycheck every week.

economy,"Economists, if the government paid CPI +2% interest on all personal FDIC insured accounts, how do you think that would effect inflation?","Right now there is absolutely zero incentive to save for the average consumer.  People are even buying bigger ticket items on credit because of just the expectation of inflation.  This just adds more demand to the fire, exacerbating the inflation problems.

If we can give a good reason for people to just save their money and not spend it, at least in the short term, we can potentially give the supply chain the reprieve it needs to stabalize.  

Since this would just be for FDIC accounts up to the FDIC limit, it would be most effective in curbing middle class spending (which is who they point the inflation finger at anyway).  I would even be for higher interest payments for CDs that lock up the cash for longer periods.  

This would be an alternative to the heavy handed fed rate increases.  We don't need businesses cutting expenses and growth when we need them to be increasing production to ease the supply side of the inflation problems.  

Nothing like this have ever been tried.  Sure it would need to be funded by the government, as the banks aren't going to want to pay this out of pocket.  

How do you think this would play out?  I'm sure it might have a huge negative effect on the markets/crypto, at least for the less gambling inclined individuals.  Plus, unlike TIPS, this would essentially be automatic for all people with a bank account.  It would also make the banks flush with deposits, so less chances of having some financial catastrophe that rising rates may bring.  

Unlike just handing out money though, this gives people real reasons to NOT spend, but save their money.  

I'm sure there are quite a few potential pitfalls for this idea, but let's at least have a rational economic orientated discussion on how you think this would pan out.",finance,1659454440
CryptoMarkets,Bank of America: Net Flows Suggest ‘Bullish’ Crypto Market Momentum,"The Bank of America has concluded that the recent rise in crypto outflows from exchanges and a rise in stablecoin net inflows signal ""bullish"" market momentum.

In the July edition of its Global Cryptocurrencies and Digital Assets report, the bank went as far as to say that ""fading sell pressure"" has now turned to ""buying.""

This change in sentiment can also be seen in an 11% rise in the digital asset market between June 29 and July 26, despite recording a 56% downtrend year-to-date.

""Investors are moving off of the sidelines as risk assets rally. Tight supply and continuous exchange net outflows indicate that investors continue to HODL,"" the report reads.

What’s more striking is that the recent positive price action comes in the wake of exceptionally high CPI numbers and the Federal Reserve’s decision to undertake its greatest rate hike in 20 years.

Despite this, Bank of America suggests that investors have acclimated to the current macroeconomic turbulence and are ready to venture back into risk-on territory.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and FTX’s native token FTT have all experienced hefty inflows to wallets and away from crypto exchanges.

This is often understood as a bullish signal because investors typically move assets off of exchanges when they are simply interested in holding the asset (rather than selling).

When examining Bitcoin, for example, the leading cryptocurrency recorded a whopping $508 million in outflows from exchanges over the past month. In that same period, it recorded a 19% increase, jumping from $19,300 on July 2 to $23,160 on August 1.

personalfinance,Advice on rebuilding credit,"Hello all, a whole lotta things came down at the same time which pretty much tanked my credit. Looking for advice to see if it’s repairable or if anything is disputable.

For background, I’m relatively new to the credit game, my oldest credit card is a little less than one year old. I was able to maintain a credit score of 720 to 740 across all 3 credit Burroughs until about 3 months ago. Right now my credit is sitting at around 600-650. 

The reason for the downfall was several factors:

1. I opened a CareCredit card for 4600 dollars due to an emergency surgery for my dog, the vet charged me 4660 which put me above the credit limit. No interest for 6 months and I’m expecting around 3500 from pet insurance. 

2. Around the same time I opened a micro center card for 1600 dollars, also no interest for 6 months. I’m not worried about not paying this and the previous card on time.

3. I payed a student loan debt a few days late last month and this month because I had thought that all federal student debt did not have to be paid until a couple months from now. I learned that this is not the case for federal Perkins loans, I feel dumb for messing it up twice.

So far in terms of credit debt, I have never made a late payment. I’m assuming that a lot of my downfall has to do with high credit utilization which is around 70% and those two late student loan payments. I’m wondering if this is something that will stabilize as my credit utilization goes down over the next few months. Should I be worried that this is going to affect me long term,  because I plan on moving in around 5 months and was hoping my credit would be in better shape by then.",finance,1659455865
stocks,How did you originally pick your longest held and/or best positions? What did you learn from those picks?,"Per the title. I'm curious about how you originally identified what are now your longest/best holdings. What made you take notice of those companies in the first place? What have you learned from whatever methodology you used to locate those top picks?

I think it's useful to honestly look back at the original thesis/logic if we want to replicate success. It's easy to get sidetracked with strategy, but in the end, the proof is in the pudding, so to speak...so what went into your pudding?

&amp;#x200B;

**For me:**

The longer I continue my journey with stocks (\~15 years now), the more I favor getting back to the basic axiom of investing in what you know. Of course this is a well known strategy (Peter Lynch, etc.), but I've been thinking more about it lately in the context of my own portfolio and how it has evolved over time. Most of the stocks that turned out best for me follow this rule, though I wasn't explicitly following the Lynch playbook at purchase (because I didn't know who he was at the time).

My top 5 most successful (and also longest...not a coincidence) holdings are:

* AAPL - 10 years - bought my first iPhone and was absolutely blown away by it, coming from an Android device. iPhone seemed almost absurdly better than its nearest competition at that time, which seemed like a pretty good baseline investment thesis. 
* COST - 8 years - bought after visiting a Costco with my parents in law and then immediately joining myself.  Came to the stock as a result. I still love Costco, the company and the stock.
* CRM - 5 years - bought after selecting Salesforce as our main operations hub at my former employer. Became familiar with Salesforce admin, saw the platform's power and flexibility, saw it in action, saw how it moved the dial, saw how it quickly becomes a must-have tool. 
* UPS - 5 years - Was working a lot with FedEx. Their service was slipping and prices were going up. Missed deliveries. Not easy to deal with. Started using UPS...better service, better store experience, better prices, more reliable deliveries. Bought the stock. And of course they started eating FedEx's lunch.
* AVGO - 4 years - This is the outlier. I bought based on a generally favorable outlook for semis, and they seemed highly financially secure, are broadly exposed to the semiconductor industry (sort of a picks and shovels play; AMAT is my other), and pay a large and growing dividend. Worked out well despite my lack of direct personal knowledge.

Conclusion: I didn't read Lynch until relatively recently, and I wish I'd discovered him earlier, because the foundation of my portfolio is composed of my ""Lynch stocks"", and in hindsight, I could have avoided a lot of painful lessons and headhaches if I'd just started out picking from a basket of companies I know, like, admire and trust.

I'm increasingly thinking that ""invest in what you know"" is less about finding the best companies - though that's part of it - and more about finding the deep conviction to hang tight over many years, which is where a lot of the outperformance is generated.

I also note that none of these picks were particularly cheap when I bought them. The best companies are rarely cheap.

Thoughts? Experiences?

&amp;#x200B;

defi,Is crypto being transformed into TradFi 2.0?,"Although it sounds strange to crypto OG’s, but times are changing. And unfortunately not for the better. 

Think about it; Crypto is going mainstream. There are ads, sponsorship deals, and the lot. It’s all geared towards inviting normal everyday folks into the market. But at what cost (to them)? 

When you explain crypto to a newbie, the very first thing that comes to mind is of course self-custody (it’s one of the reasons why the damn thing was invented in the first place after all). 

Many people care about the “sleek UI”, “ease of use” and lack of accountability. Especially when dealing with all things financial. This is why the majority of people keep their cash in banks after all. 

I’m wondering if we’re slowly moving away from such important aspects as self-custody and proof of ownership into a new system of centralised custody by the new “banks” like centralised exchanges, custodials (like traditional banks) and later when the CBDC’s get deployed, to even having a “crypto account” at the FED? 

Is there hope for self governance and self custody? What do you guys think? 

Most of us realise that the catastrophic events of the past few months are now being used by the regulators to tighten the noose around all of crypto space. 

It’s good to know that DEFI is a pain in the ass to regulate! Almost impossible actually. Big protocols like AAVE and Uniswap can sell their souls to the faceless globalists, but most of decentralised finance will still be here catering to normal people. 

We strongly believe that the future of DEFI lies in providing sustainable passive income even while the current financial system is struggling under the weight of debt and leverage. In fact we’ll go as far as saying; it’s better not to confront the current system at all, but simply to step aside and build something newer and better that’s accessible to everyone.",cryptocurrency,1659461057

&gt;	**Inspecting Individual Recession Indicators**


&gt;The NBER committee’s indicators used to date business cycles include real (inflation-adjusted) personal income minus transfers, nonfarm payroll employment, employment as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics household survey, real personal consumption expenditures, wholesale-retail sales adjusted for price changes and industrial production.

&gt;The gray lines in Chart 1 show the movements of nonfarm payrolls and industrial production in each previous business cycle relative to the peak of that cycle (month 0 = 100); the average across all previous cycles is the black line. The 2020 COVID-19-induced recession is excluded because its cause, scale and timing were extremely atypical. The red line is the indicator’s movement between June 2021 and June 2022 relative to the level in December 2021.

&gt;	The data show that employment in the overall economy and output of the industrial sector in 2022 have significantly outperformed what occurred during every previous recession at a similar point. Chart 2 repeats this exercise for an alternate source of employment (surveying households rather than businesses) and for manufacturing and trade sales.

&gt;	While these indicators in 2022 (red line) are not as starkly above the gray recession lines as the indicators in Chart 1, their paths remained at the higher end of the distribution and were notably higher than the corresponding average recession paths. These indicators are also more volatile than their counterparts in Chart 1, with a wider range of recessionary outcomes.

&gt;Finally, Chart 3 shows a similar pattern as Chart 2 for real consumption and real personal income excluding transfers.


——-


&gt;	**Low Unemployment Rate Is Also Argument Against Recession**


&gt;While not listed among the indicators considered by the NBER committee, the unemployment rate is also among the indicators pointing to labor market strength through the first half of 2022 (Chart 5, Panel B). It has declined from 3.9 percent in December 2021 to 3.6 percent in March 2022, where it has held steady through June. By month six, every other recession incurred an unemployment rate increase of at least 0.3 percentage points.

&gt;Increases in unemployment may also better match conceptually what is generally understood to mean a recession—an increase in slack or underutilization of resources rather than a decline in economic activity. As trend GDP growth slows due to aging demographics and slower productivity gains, there may be more frequent periods of negative GDP growth without an increase in unemployment, making the distinction between increasing slack and declining activity more relevant than in the past.

There is just so many cards to sort through I was being overwhelmed. So I have decided to look into getting a balance transfer card with that 0% fee with help from this community.

In short, does anybody know of a 0% balance transfer fee credit card that is available to someone with a 702 credit score? Is there a better option for me that I am not considering?

solar,Massachusetts Homeowner here. Question wr/r/t battery backup &amp; managed loads &amp; code compliance,"Hey folks,

About a year ago, I signed a contract for 4 x Powerwall2 units, installed following a PV system install; same company for both.  Both projects with a 'max price guarantee'.  A full year later, the PV system is installed, running well, and that aspect of the project is complete and paid for.  The remaining battery project is priced at around $43k.  


As mentioned, the remaining project is for the 4 powerwall2 units, installed in a detached barn - NOT in the dwelling and not close enough to need the added fire code typically required for batteries inside a dwelling structure.  Also, the conduit is already laid in, so we're down to just installing batteries and wiring them into the existing panel.    


I've now been told that due to a ""policy change"", which I haven't been able to pin down to a change in the NEC, or even an *interpretation* to the NEC, they would like to add a SPAN (probably 2, given the # of circuits I have) to manage the loads and comply with [702.4(B)(2)](https://up.codes/viewer/illinois/nfpa-70-2020/chapter/7/special-conditions#702.4_(B)_(2))(b) Load Management in lieu of complying with the 702.4(B)(2)(a) Full Load clause, where I'd cover the full load.  

&amp;#x200B;

House is fed by a 200A service, if that matters.  Largest Circuit is a 100A subpanel, largest single draw is a 60A EV charger.

Some questions I have, in no particular order:

Does this apparent ""policy change"" have any basis in fact, even anecdotal?  Bonus points if you can actually refer me to a MA policy / source / authority that's on point.

Or... does this seem like a fig leaf for them to renegotiate a locked-in price, a year on?  I'm assuming PW2 have gone up in price since this time last year? I'm expecting they'll propose a significant (12-20% or so) price increase for this change and pad their margins.

Does the Span product seem to anyone else like a bit of a sketchy idea, both in general, and specifically for a retrofit job such as this? My concerns: new company, fungible electronics in a critical aspect of a home, likely causes significant wiring rework for no clear ROI.

Given 4 powerwall2's, that's spec'd for 120 Amps, no?  So that's well in excess of even my single largest load (EV charger @ 60A), and surpasses all the other single items, including a few sub panels at 50A &amp; 60A.  Does it pass the sniff test that I need to manage loads *at all?*

Thanks in advance for any thoughts, advice, etc!  I really want to get this project done, but 10-20k more in price rules this out - I'd rather just get a generator for a fraction of the price.",energy,1659483835
business,Anyone using FedEx for international shipments?,I recently had a shipment from alibaba going to philippines and they used FedEx.

personalfinance,Does it make sense to break a cd in today’s interest rate climate?,"I made a CD ladder 2 year ago desperately looking for my backup 6 month e fund to make some interest; 5 5k cds from 12 to 60 months. I rolled over year one when it ended after I learned about ibonds, and will do the same for year 2 in September (Then will have maxed my yearly ibond limit). The remaining 36, 48, 60 month cd are earning 0.95, 1.05, 1.15 apy respectively. To me it seems obvious to withdraw as much as I can early, take the hit, and put them in my onlin e savings, which is at 1.4 and has increased apy every month the past 4 months (I don’t see this interest dropping soon, but I also plan to gradually move it to my brokerage as I have my e fund fully funded).

the penalty is 360, and 540 days‘ interest respectively.

personalfinance,Should i take out a loan for a car? Any useful wisdom is appreciated,"I'm conflicted. To give context as to why I am asking this, I was in a wreck involving a commercial vehicle last month. Hit on both sides, car completely totaled. Im 23 and live at home. I drove a 2005 SUV, so the companies insurance is only offering about $3-4k. Its been just about a month now and the insurance has yet to pay me out. I work full time so reliable transportation is critical. Everyone home works so I cant rely on them for transportation. 

Before the wreck, I missed out on some money because of a car failure that forced me to have to stay home from work. And then boom, wreck happens and im home again, without pay. So by now ive missed out on about a months worth of pay. There was a whole situation where I had to wait days to even get a rental provided by the insurance. Ive gone through some of my money and honestly dont have quite enough to make a cash car payment for the type of SUV im wanting. My dad and I have been car shopping and found a really sweet deal on a good 2013 SUV, and he wants me to buy it ASAP but I dont have enough to do so. I just started back working last week and dont get paid until later on this week. Im stressed and kind of desperate for cash because I need a car. Im 23 with no credit, so I considered financing to build credit, but it seems as though that process may take long. I went on my credit unions website and glossed over some of the loan information. Im really eager to go ahead and get a new car, but considering Im tight on cash it seems the only option would be to get a loan. My question is it wise? &amp; Would it be better to apply for a personal loan instead of a used car loan? In the case that I dont want to pay a car note, would it make sense to just get a personal loan and just buy the car that i want in cash fully??? They say the lowest possible interest rate for a personal loan with them is 5.49%. Is that reasonable? Is it even possible. As i type this im supposed to be purchasing the car tomorrow, but i dont have the guts to tell my dad i dont have the full amount. I also refuse to ask my parents to spot me the money for my own reasons. What should I do? My plan is to go to my credit union tomorrow and speak with someone who can help me. Im just desperate for an immediate solution, Like,,, i need cold hard cash NOW.

personalfinance,Can we afford a house? We have no idea where we stand and parents are not knowledgeable enough to help,"My husband and I don’t have any family we can ask for help and are afraid of getting bad advice from our realtor or the brokerage. I’d appreciate any advice about our situation. We feel so lost! 
Basically I’m a SAHM and my husband makes a little more than 40k a year. We have a $250 car payment that will be paid off in 12 months, credit card debt less than $2000 minimum payment $67. We both have excellent credit over 740. The problem is we only have 2500 in savings (we had more but had a medical problem come up earlier this year) and like 9-10k in a Roth IRA that we would take from. We thought about applying for a USDA 0% down mortgage so we would just have to pay closing costs on a house in the 175-180k range. Right now we are paying 1195 in rent - the best deal we could get and it’s trash. My thought is… our house payment wouldn’t be much if at all lower, but at least we would be building equity and wouldn’t have to wait with baited breath for interest rates to inevitably increase. If I’m going to be poor I’d at least like to build equity in the mean time and slowly increase the value of my home by adding improvements over time. My husband also has opportunity for growth in his career, but we will only see an increase in $1-2 per hour before the end of the calendar year. Growth could happen much more substantially in the future but it is hard to predict when. I’m looking into ways I can bring in income too but I feel like by the time I figure it out interest rates will be up to 7-8% and we will still be in the same price range. 
We live in a relatively LCOL area and try to live very frugally. Are we idiots for even considering applying for pre-qualification? With the rent we are paying right now we are hardly able to put any money in savings and so I just don’t see how we will ever get out of this cycle especially knowing that rent inevitably increases every year.

personalfinance,Is it possible to get a balance transfer with a 0% fee with a decently good credit score?,"Hello everybody.

I have reigned in my spending big time. And I have started to pay off my 6,500$ of credit card debt from two cards (chase visa &amp; capital one mastercard). This is the most important thing in order to get debt free.

However, the high interest rate is just horrible. Like throwing money away. I started looking for better options with a lower interest rate... I considered either a personal loan OR a balance transfer. The latter option, if a 0% transfer fee is possible, would be much preferred. There is just so many cards to sort through I was being overwhelmed. So I have decided to look into getting a balance transfer card with that 0% fee with help from this community.

In short, does anybody know of a 0% balance transfer fee credit card that is available to someone with a 702 credit score? Is there a better option for me that I am not considering?

Thanks all !",finance,1659509898

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street tries to rebound from back-to-back losing sessions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/02/dow-futures-gain-slightly-after-the-three-major-averages-notched-a-second-day-of-losses.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures traded higher Wednesday, as traders tried to regain their footing following back-to-back losing sessions.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143 points, or 0.44%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each gained 0.48%.
*****
&gt; Those moves came as Wall Street worried that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan could further strain already tense U.S.-China relations. China had spent weeks warning her not to make the trip. Markets fell further after three Federal Reserve presidents hinted that further rate hikes would be necessary to combat high inflation.
*****
&gt; Traders also digested mixed remarks from Federal Reserve officials. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Tuesday he was confident that the U.S. economy could achieve a “soft landing.” Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the central bank’s work to tame inflation is “far from done,” while Chicago Fed’s Charles Evans said there’s a chance for a smaller rate hike at the next monetary policy meeting.
*****
&gt; “Despite the fact most of today’s attention is still riveted on the Federal Reserve and its ongoing fight to bring inflation under control, many economic policies have already embarked on a new easing cycle,” said The Leuthold Group’s Jim Paulsen. “The prospect of lower inflation is not only helping to usher in a new easing cycle but is apt to stoke a private-sector confidence revival that has untapped potential.”
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating another batch of second-quarter earnings. CVS, Regeneron, Under Armour and Moderna will report before the bell Wednesday.
*****
&gt; In economic data, investors this week are awaiting mortgage demand numbers and PMI data out Wednesday.

computers,[Question]what would exactly happen to the cpu if it was suddenly without any ram sticks in the motherboard,"I'm not stupid, I'm not asking if it would turn off or the screen would stop displaying things. I know that the RAM contains all the operations and data needed for the CPU to operate. What I'm asking is if it has a mode where the CPU does something in case that happens. does it go in HALT mode?  does it go into a busy loop? does it repeat the last operation fed over and over again? does it use the hard drive as very slow method of storing the instructions meaning that it reboots? all I have found in google is how to fix broken RAM and as you can see that's not what I'm asking.

personalfinance,Looking for some advice with a lease buyout,"Hi everyone, I have a lease ending in about 15 days on my 2019 Dodge Ram. Initially I thought I would turn it in for another but since there are no real good incentives right now, I am going to opt to keep it. This will be my first time every dealing with the end of a lease and I have the following questions:

1. The dealership says they can help me with getting financing. The one time my wife and I bought a car, we did the dealer financing. Later people said we can usually get more favorable terms obtaining our own financing. Would you recommend getting our own financing for our lease buyout? If so, should I go to a website that will shop around for rates or go to the bank I have accounts with?
2. Assuming the answer to question 1 is to obtain my own financing and to do so online, I would like to play around with the terms of the loans to see what interest rates are available depending on how long I stretch the payments. I have the buyout amount and I know my local sales tax so I have a pretty good idea of what it will cost for me to buy it (About $30,500). I want to play around with different loan lengths, down payment amounts and see what the payments would work out to. Is that easy to do online while at the website I use for the financing? I know there is an endless supply of car finance calculators but I want to have hard interest rates to use and right now, I don't know what to even think for a car loan interest rate. My credit is great (800+) so I won't have any issue there
3. What do I do after I have the financing? Do I just set it up online and I am totally done with it? Or do I need to contact the dealership I leased it through? Do I need to contact the credit union who did the lease?
4. Anything else I should know or think about?

Thanks!",finance,1659531267
energy,"Manchin released details of ""handshake agreement"" on natural gas pipeline and other permitting","Last week, Sen. Joe Manchin noted that as part of the Inflation Reduction Act energy provisions, he and Sen. Schumer had made a ""handshake agreement"" on natural gas pipelines and other federal permitting reforms.  [He has now released some details of this agreement](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-5b22-de24-abe3-5b2210300000), which various media reports say is also supported by the Biden administration.

For Manchin, the centerpiece is a requirement that federal agencies quickly move forward approving the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 303 mile pipeline to transport up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day between West Virginia and Virgina.

[Manchin's summary of the agreement](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-5b22-de24-abe3-5b2210300000), contains additional details aimed at speeding up the federal review process for energy projects, some of which include:

- Direct the President to designate and periodically update a list of at least 25 high-priority energy infrastructure projects and prioritize permitting for these projects.  It would require a balanced list of project types, including: critical minerals, nuclear, hydrogen, fossil fuels, electric transmission, renewables, and carbon capture, sequestration, storage, and removal.
- Set maximum timelines for permitting reviews, including two years for NEPA reviews for major projects and one year for lower-impact projects.
- Speed up Section 401 review under the Clean Water Act by requring final action within one year of certification 
- Clarify FERC jurisdiction regarding the regulation of interstate hydrogen pipeline, storage, import, and export facilities.
- Enhance federal government permitting authority for interstate electric transmission facilities that have been determined by the Secretary of Energy to be in the national interest.

- Set statute of limitations for court challenges.",energy,1659534466

personalfinance,First-Time Home Buyer looking for Advice/Guidance,"Hello,

Some background:

I am 22 years old, just recently graduated from college, and am living with my parents for the time being. I was fortunate to land a job (financial advising...this is ironic eh? haha) before I graduated and have already joined this whole ""adulting"" thing for the most part. My job is just 8 minutes from my house, I have a 2020 accord which only has 12.5k miles on it and I plan to pay it off at the end of my lease (1.5 years away) for around 14k. I only have about 8k in student debt thanks to my parent's 529 plan doing well in 2016-2020. I have had some serious life-changing things happen in the past 8 months or less. I lost my uncle at only 60 in late November, who was my father's last brother (He lost his other brother when he was only 43) so that has been very tough. Shortly after in February, my cat of 15 years passed away, and just here in June, my only grandfather passed away who of all the grandchildren, I was the closest with. Just a few weeks ago I found out that he will be gifting his 2008 F-150 with 100k miles on it (it needs some work to be roadworthy. If I had to guess probably $500-2k into it) to me which I am extremely grateful for. Part of me feels guilty as I have cousins that were also close with grandpa that are nearing 16 years old and this truck would be useful for a first-time driver. I also have a girlfriend who lives with her parents about 25 minutes from me, and we have only been dating for about 8 months but have known each other for going on 2 years. We're not looking to move in with each other, but it could happen within the next few years. 

Currently Spending:

\-$1.1k per month ($275 per week)

\----No housing payment for time being, only groceries ($120 per week)

\- Life to golf 2x per month ($80 per month, $20 per week)

\- Girlfriend likes to go out and I try to treat her from time to time ($20 per week)

Debt:

\-$8k - student debt

\-$1.5k - student apartment payment to my dad (He said I don't have to pay him back, but I want to out of showing respect for all the help my parents gave me)

\-$14k - Car lease payment in 1.5 years to buy the car and own it outright

Saving: 

\-$1.9k per month (I would like to start putting 500 or more per month to Roth on auto-pay)

\-----------$1.4k just sitting not doing anything - Once I start setting up auto-pay on Roth

Miscellaneous:

\-$6k - KBB value of F150 Trade in - unsure of what to do

\-$500-$700 one-time payment for licensing exam fees/ study materials

Goal:

\- Save $40k-$50k for a down payment on a house. (target house value: $200-$300k) within 2-3 years

\- If anything is left over, start 529s for future children plus tax-advantaged growth in accounts

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I have been going through a lot of changes recently and it made me think about the future. I want to move out of my parent's house within 2, maybe 3 years and buy my first home. At my current job, I only make about 39k annual, but once I pass licensing (hopefully by Octoberish), I will receive a pay raise to 55k. From there, I can start my book of business and the ceiling goes up from there. Within a few years of building my book, I hope to make 75-90k annually.

Ultimately, I am looking for advice on what I can be doing to start saving for a house right now (I'm not in a huge rush as the past 2 years have been a seller's market, but now interest rates are rising, my parent's house doesn't seem like such a bad option haha). I am already funding a Roth and have been since the age of 19, but not maxing it out. My current employer doesn't offer a 401(k). I would like my money to be working for me but other than a traditional, or Roth IRA, I'm unsure where I can put my money. I've considered mutual funds and ETFs but want to make sure I'm maxing my qualified accounts first. Also while I'm living at home, I plan to pay off my remaining student loan debt (8k). Should I pay it off in a lump sum, and not fund my IRA or should I gradually chip away and feed both? Finally, I want opinions on what should I do with the truck. Currently, I'm thinking I will use it for the next 3-5 years because of the utility and in case I move early, then eventually sell it and put the money towards paying off funeral expenses for my grandmother. Does that seem fair? Should I just gift it to one of my cousins?",finance,1659536939

personalfinance,Saving and Budgeting for Parenthood,"I (28M) am getting to the point where trying to become a father is seeming less of ""one day"" scenario and more of something that should be a near term goal.  I love being busy, so, I'd guess I would want 3-5 kids, but I know I'm naïve having never been a parent. I know things like food and healthcare will directly scale with number of kids, but others might not like clothes(hand-me-downs), sitters and housing (shared bedrooms).  That being said, how much should I try to have on hand for savings for adoption/surrogacy costs and what should I be long term budgeting for such a huge commitment?

&amp;#x200B;

Current financial picture if needed: I have a day job making \~160k and I have a side real estate business.

NOI on the business will increase to around 68k at the end of August, excluding ongoing projects.  There's 36k in &lt;5% APR debt servicing (24-29 years remaining) making free cash flow around 32k at that time.  There's two projects that are currently eating into that money, but if I scale back the business to raise children, I wouldn't invest in more.  If I keep the cash flows and finish those, the business will have around 150k cash I could pull out.  If I reinvest that into longer term assets matching existing performance, I'd expect around 115k NOI, 65k debt service and 50k free cash flow.  That would take me around a year to accomplish.

&amp;#x200B;

Assets

Primary residence: \~350k, only two beds, so I'd need to upsize to \~500k to keep the area and lifestyle.

401(k): 73k

HSA: 3k

Business (assets minus liabilities): 400k-500k.

Car: '17 Civic SI that carmax just valued at 20k

Cash: 15k

&amp;#x200B;

Debts:

Federal student loans: 8.5k at 3.61% and 4.41%

Car loan: 6.3k at 2.19%

PR Mortgage: 189k at 3.25%

&amp;#x200B;

Current personal living expenses are 40k including all debt servicing, but not including saving.  I dislike my day job company, so covering my living expenses from my business has been my goal for the last 3 years.  If I were to stop investing, in 37 years 401(k) projections have that money growing to around a million, and the debt will be paid off on the business making free cash flow \~68k since income and inflation will roughly keep pace.  Seems like that would be a not-unreasonable amount to retire on if medicare can be counted on.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'd have to pick between the business and job if I became a parent, and maybe even scale to part time.  I'm not married, but have had a boyfriend for 5 years.  He's a teacher, so tons of time off, but salary is only around 55k.  I am currently strongly opposed to blended finances, and love the safety of being able to fully support myself but my parent's multi-year divorce just settled a few months ago, so time could change that.",finance,1659536981

- **Species:** Cat
- **Age:** 11
- **Sex/Neuter status:** Female, Spayed
- **Breed:** Russian Blue
- **Body weight:**21 lbs.
- **History:** she’s been overweight (vet recommends she stay under 16 and she’s never been there, diet and weight reduction food, she’s creative and finds her brothers food, even potentially puts herself in harms way trying to get to it (out of reach) She’s very loving, still follows us everywhere up and down the stairs, plays on occasion but usually gives up bc of her brother. She’s clean/still cleans herself, she’s chatty, happy, territorial to an extent. She started showing negative responses to being handled too much at her back end (it appears her hips are bothering her so she’s been taking supplements in her treats) 
- **Clinical signs:** what’s got me worried: recently (two weeks ago) she woke from a slumber on the couch, looked like she couldn’t control her arm and her leg. I used to have these strange seizures as a kid where it felt the same; looks almost like uncontrollable stiffening of the muscles. She started slowly trying to move around and she eventually started to gain control of her two separate limbs, then she laid on the floor like normal, got up a few minutes later and was purring, showing me signs she was ready for dinner. I didn’t film it but I asked my sister in law who’s a vet tech in a diff state, she said it sounds like  she’s likely in pain, stiff joints from sleeping or being idle, suggesting she may have arthritis. 

I scheduled an appointment with her normal vet, and soonest they could see her was 8/8. I called another vet, they said they could put me on a list for cancellations so I took that too. No luck so far. 

But today, 5 minutes ago, it happened again. This time she tried to walk off the couch even though I don’t think she could use her hind leg fully…she looked sort of shocked, but not terrified, makes no sounds, just sort of moves in slow motion. I got a video this time because I actually had my phone on my hand. Now I’m googling everything and worrying myself that my cat is about to have a heart attack, if that’s possible. I’m worried this isn’t arthritis and it’s something much different. 

- **Duration:** whole episode lasts at least a minute, not more than two? Then she’s immediately normal. At least that’s what’s happened the last two times I’ve seen it. 

- **Your general location:** Washington state 
- **Links to test results, vet reports, X-rays etc.** I don’t have anything with me from her vet, she’s always had a clean bill of health outside of needing to drop the weight. I feel like a failure but at the same time, I’ve truly done what I can to keep her away from more food than she needs without jeopardizing the other cat having access to their food.

Highest Balance-Loan-15.25%-$23K-$684 min payment- Sept 2025 maturity date 

Highest Interest Rate-Credit Card-24%-$11K-$314 min payment 

The other debts I have are:
Car Loan-5.14%-$15K-$352 min payment 
Credit Card-18.49%-$4K-$41 min payment
Credit Card-22.74%-$1K-$40 min payment

I really want to tackle one of the first two, either the loan or the credit card. I’m leaning towards starting with the loan since that large minimum will make it faster to pay off everything else. Is that the best idea?",finance,1659542397
retirement,The 4% Rule,"Talk on CNBC today is that Fed rates will be hiked to 4%, if not this year, then next.  This is from interviews with assorted pundits who specialize in treasuries and watch the Fed closely, as well as Fed governors themselves.

What does this mean for the 4% rule?

If you buy T Bills or T Notes that pay 4%, you can get the 4% income that the 4% rule suggests, but without losing $.01 of your capital, and the least risk free investment on the planet.

If rates do hit 4%, I would suggest starting to build a ladder of varying rates and expiration dates.  If you dollar cost average, similar to with stocks, you might be getting some at 4% and some at 4.25%, and some at 4.5%, and so on.  The important thing is that you can get 4% from your life savings while keeping your nest egg from decreasing in value.

Granted, 4% doesn’t cover inflation (yet).  But the 4% rule suggests you draw 4% the first year, then 4% plus inflation the second, and so on.  At high inflation, it seems to me that your life savings would disappear much sooner than 30 years.

Another point is that I see no end to (high) inflation, yet, but in theory it will come.  It would sure be nice holding 4.5% bonds when the newer ones are paying 2%.  It’s also conceivable that the Fed hikes rates much higher than 5% to 7% or more, but that’s a gamble and we’re conservative with our retirement funds!",finance,1659543672

personalfinance,Should I consolidate my credit card debt with a loan?,"Currently have about $9000 across three credit cards. After all of my expenses my net remaining is about $700. I put a lot into my 401k every month (down 30% this year but still at 34k) but otherwise have no savings.

I saw an offer on BestEgg (and some other loan sites) for loans of $10,000 with 3 or 4 year terms and APR's varying from 7% to 12%. These are lower interest rates than my credit cards and the monthly payments would be around $280-$380. This seems like a no-brainer to me, I'd be able to pay off my debt and start saving $300-$400 a month.

Am I missing something? Is this a good idea? Otherwise I feel like I'll just be in a hole paying off my cards.",finance,1659545108
personalfinance,HEL or HELOC to remove PMI?,"So I managed to get a 3.25% interest rate when I bought my house.  But I only paid 3.5% down and have PMI.  Home prices in the area have skyrocketed and ignoring the improvements and being conservative, the house has appreciated by 33% or more.  My mortgage specifically states that PMI may only be removed after it is paid down to 80% of the original loan value or 15 years and changes to the value of the home do not impact this.  So it does not seem like having the house reappraised to get PMI removed is an option.  Refinancing now seems like it would cost me more due to the interest rate increases.  Also my credit score is down due to unexpected expenses having to be put on CC and bringing utilization above 30%, but much of the CC balances are 0% interest things.  Prior to this my credit score was 710-730 depending on where and when you look.  Now my score is 670-710 depending on where and when you look.  


So I am wondering if the following are options or good ideas.  
1. Take out Home equity line of credit or loan to pay down to 80% of the original loan value.  This would leave me at worst case 79% combined LTV.  With my upcoming guaranteed bonus I could bring it up to 80% LTV.  


2. Take out HELOC or HEL to pay down to 80% of the original loan value and the credit cards that are charging interest (avg APR 18%).  This would result in 86% LTV.  When researching my options online it looks like some mortgages subtract liens from your equity, but I don't recall this being in the papers I signed.  Does that have to be stated in the papers for them to deduct liens from equity?

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to :  
1. Reduce month cash out flow, so I am able to replenish emergency funds.

2. Save money long term.

personalfinance,University reported me to collections for unfair latefee,"Hi all,

I recently attended a university (from which I've graduated), and there was a problem my last semester with my tuition. I'm American and this was in the US.

To make a long story short, their system made a mistake with my account, and after paying my billI was told that my tuition was paid for in full (and I even received a refund for the leftover student loan money) in error. Later, their system decided that I owed more for my tuition, but I didn't receive the notices that I owed money until after the semester was over (they were emailing a University email address that I never checked--instead of my primary email address listed).

When I finally realized that I owed more in tuition, I spent many HOURS on the phone with the university. They were never able to understand or explain to me how their system made this error with my account. But they were sure I did owe the tuition, so I happily paid the tuition I owed.

However, I didn't feel I should pay the $200 late fee, as it was atleast as much their fault as mine that this happened to my account. Most of the many people I spoke to at the university agreed with me about this, except for the Bursar. He offered to take off 1/2 of the late fees, I refused. I wanted all of the late fees removed. We left it at that, and I left the measely $200 on my account unpaid.

They've since reported this to a collections agency, and I'm pretty mad, as I've already paid this university $12,000 for the program I was attending. It hasn't appeared on my credit report yet, but of course I'm trying to avoid that. What are my options as far as not paying this late fee? I'm mostly angry out of principal, for being continually screwed over by higher-ed in the US (I've got a lot of federal student loans).

stocks,"PayPal, Moderna Lead Buyback Frenzy Week, Giving Stocks a Lift; Over $21 billion in share buybacks announced this week","[Source: Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-03/paypal-moderna-lead-buyback-frenzy-week-giving-stocks-a-lift?srnd=premium)
 
&gt; At least **$21 billion** in fresh **share repurchase programs** have been unveiled **this week** alone, with PayPal Inc. leading the charge and authorizing a new $15 billion buyback plan as it works with Elliott Investment Management to turn around its struggling shares. Moderna Inc., Airbnb Inc. and Marriott International Inc. have also added to or unveiled new programs in the last three days, following a slew of others, including Chevron Corp., Charles Schwab Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. that did it last week. 
&gt; 
&gt; Altogether **buyback announcements for the second quarter earnings season have already surpassed 2018 highs**, when companies said they planned to repurchase almost $400 billion of their own shares, according to data compiled by BNP Paribas. And the announcements may not be over yet, with more than 50 S&amp;P 500 members still set to report earnings still this week. 
&gt; 
&gt; PayPal and Moderna saw outsize share price jumps following their buyback announcements, adding 8.8% and 16% respectively on Wednesday. Shares in The Charles Schwab Corp., which announced a $15 billion buyback plan last week, are up 11%.
&gt; 
&gt; “Buybacks should provide another flow tailwind,” BNP Paribas Equity Derivatives Strategist Maxwell Grinacoff wrote in a note on Monday. Announced **buybacks have hit the highest in more than a decade**, Maxwell added.
&gt; 
&gt; For Wall Street strategists schooled in the logic of “buy low, sell high”, buybacks this year likely make complete sense. Companies like PayPal and Moderna have slumped more than 25% amid a boom-to-bust cycle for pandemic winners turned losers. By scooping up shares at a lower value, the company can theoretically resell them later on in a secondary offering, ideally at a higher price, to help raise additional capital.
&gt; 
&gt; Smaller companies or less hefty programs don’t always give a meaningful boost to shares. The S&amp;P 500 Buyback Index, which tracks 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratio, has underperformed the broader market since the start of May, falling about 3% compared to a nearly unchanged S&amp;P 500.
&gt; 
&gt; One notable exception this season among companies known for supporting robust buybacks are banks. **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. announced they would be pausing current share repurchase programs in order to help meet higher capital requirements** following the Federal Reserve stress test. JP Morgan and Citigroup shares, up 4.9% and 2.8% respectively, are trailing the broad S&amp;P 500 9.6% advance since July 14. 
&gt; 
&gt; “In the here and now, investors like it when their favorite companies buy back shares. Speculators like it too, because there is a large buyer whom you know will be active in the market,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC. “It is quite reasonable to think that buyback announcements have been a key trigger to the recent rally.”",finance,1659550708

personalfinance,Sell my house or keep it and rent it out? 28 years old and trying not to make a bad decision!,"Howdy! 

Here’s a quick rundown of my situation. Bought my current home in October 2020 for 205k. I put down about 20K and my current loan balance is 177K. My interest rate is 2.875% on a 30 year mortgage. Monthly payment is about $940 with everything included (principal, interest, &amp; escrow). The house is a fairly small 3/2 but it was renovated in 2020 before I bought it and so far it’s honestly been a nice place to live and haven’t had many issues. Obviously the value has increased since I bought it (Zillow estimates it to be around 275k now, I know it’s not the most accurate but just figured I’d throw it in here). 

However, I’ve decided that the city I live in just isn’t for me and I’ve decided to move back to the city I was in previously (hopefully around Nov/Dec this year). My original plan was to just sell this house and use the profit to buy a house in my old city, but now I think maybe I should look at renting it. Rents in my current area for similar houses go for anywhere from 1500-2200. I have a close trusted friend who is actually a rental manager and has offered to take my house on and manage it if I decide to go the rental route. My reasoning for wanting to sell the house was just wanting to be totally done with this city, make some money off the sale and have a clean slate but some friends recently made the point that I lucked into a very good asset and a very good price and this could be a great long term investment. I think there’s definitely pros and cons to both options. I grew up really poor and personal finance is definitely not my strength so I’m a bit intimidated at the thought of renting it out. My rental manager friend has assured me this would be a good decision but I want to get other opinions. 

Current financial situation is pretty good. No debts other than the mortgage (paid off student loans and car is also paid off and in good condition). 35k in savings, 25k in my IRA, and my gross pay per year is 92k. I live well within my means and have been able to save about 20k since I bought the house. My old city has fairly cheap rents so I could rent there for a year, see if mortgage rates go down and then buy a house there (very affordable place to buy, looking to spend roughly 220-250k there). 

What would you do? Anything else I should be considering? If there’s any info I forgot to add that would make giving advice easier just let me know and I can edit my post. Thanks in advance! :)",finance,1659551469
personalfinance,Should I make additional payment towards my principal every month?,"My mortgage is $3,300 a month and my interest rate is 2.99%.

Would my money be better utilized by investing it in an established EdwardJones account rather than paying towards my principal?

personalfinance,Is Vanguard the best safe and easy place for yield?,"With the Fed in a raising rates cycle, I've been spending too much time the last couple months moving money from one high yield savings account to another.  First I was at Marcus, then CIT, then Liberty Savings Bank through SaveBetter then back to CIT.  I've soured a bit on SaveBetter as even though they have the current highest yield of 2.55% through a Patriot Bank NPCD, I'm not quite comfortable with keeping money there as who knows how well recovery would work from SaveBetter's omnibus account at its various partner banks in the event of a failure.  Even worse, what if the money never makes it there and is misappropriated and you have no claim on the partner bank, just on SaveBetter.  So that's no longer an option, at least for large balances.  Prepandemic I used to carry large cash balances in the PCOXX or PVOXX mutual funds through TD Ameritrade but TDA has eliminated those funds as options on its platform and only allows investing in Schwab MMMFs which are not as high yielding.  So I recently opened up accounts at Vanguard and have been keeping some cash there in their settlement fund which I believe is the same as VMFXX.  The 7 day yield on VMFXX is 2.00% as of 8/2/22 ( [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vmfxx#price](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vmfxx#price) ).  Vanguard doesn't post the daily yield but PCOXX which seems to have a similar historical yield as VMFXX and DOES post their current daily yield, is currently showing a daily yield of 2.22% (see here under the ""yield"" tab under ""RETURNS"" [https://www.federatedinvestors.com/products/mutual-funds/prime-cash-obligations/ws.do](https://www.federatedinvestors.com/products/mutual-funds/prime-cash-obligations/ws.do) ).  So I'm going to make an educated guess that VMFXX's daily yield as of 8/2/22 is about 2.22% as well (currently Fed reverse repo rate is 2.3% and VMFXX invests in a lot of RRPs so this makes sense).  So long story short, I'm not sure if this was the case a month or two ago, but VMFXX seems to be the best current option for parking cash as it's higher yielding than the other major safe high yield savings options like CIT, Ally, and Marcus (and SaveBetter is no longer an option for the reasons mentioned above and it's not worth my time to constantly open new accounts with these various tiny internet banks that pop up at the top of the yield rankings like Bask Bank, BrioDirect, etc).  Wondering if you guys agree with my analysis?",finance,1659555534
stocks,The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent,"So far 4 Fed officials have come out on damage control duty to explain that interest rates will remain elevated throughout the year and one official said that rate cuts are highly unlikely for early 2023. On that news the ten year moved higher but the market seemed to not care. Around a week ago the market seemed to not care about the Core PCE data that surged higher to 4.8% in June which broke a 3 month downtrend. Jerome Powell explicitly stated that if Core inflation was to remain elevated or turn higher, the FOMC will continue hiking rates. Although there are signs of falling inflation such as the commodity price downtrend and slight evidence of supply chains easing, this discounts the fact that demand remains strong for most consumer goods albeit a little signs of slowing. Furthermore, there are still supply shortages for oil and service inflation is becoming increasingly out of control. Finally it's extremely difficult to understand why markets will rally when QE is slowly being taken away, rates are still rising, and stimulus from congress no longer exists. All of those circumstances I mentioned were used in 2020 which caused a market rally and higher revenue and profit growth for most companies. It seems highly irrational that equity markets will create a new ATH this year without the Feds help and even congresses.

economy,Why the global crisis in 2023 is inevitable and what will be its consequences?,"The world's leading central banks continue to accelerate the pace of monetary tightening. However, this cycle of rate hikes is atypical and was the result of record inflation rates for decades. It is caused by external shocks to the world economy, and not by the economic boom and the excess of potential output, as is usually the case. The actions of world central banks are aimed at a sharp reduction in demand, which will plunge the global economy into recession as early as 2023. At the same time, regulators will be forced to keep rates high until the factors that provoked inflation are eliminated because premature rate cuts will lead to a rapid resumption of price increases.

Why is a recession inevitable?

Thus, the past month again brought us news from the world's leading central banks: the US Federal Reserve raised its rate corridor by 0.75 percentage points for the second time in a row, which was the maximum rate of tightening monetary policy in the early 80s, to a level of 2.25-2.5%, reaching the maximum levels of the previous cycle of rate hikes, in which the US and world economies began to rapidly slow down. At the same time, the Fed plans to continue raising the rate at the upcoming meetings and, according to the expectations of the Fed members, the rate of the American regulator will reach the level of 3.25-3.5% by the end of the year. Thus, the Fed rates are already at levels that are critical for the global economy and will continue to grow in the coming months.

[FED and ECB policy rates](https://preview.redd.it/sozrn6gt6mf91.jpg?width=756&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f617ca86f9cb6234d1e6d65edf0f7c175a77a6a7)

Along with raising rates, the Fed also began to reduce its balance sheet, the pace of which, however, is currently unimpressive: from the maximum level of $8,965 billion reached on April 11, it has decreased by only $75.5 billion as of July 20. However, the rate of balance sheet reduction is likely to accelerate significantly in the coming months and reach several tens of billions of dollars per month. In simple terms, the Fed began to withdraw from circulation the money ""printed"" during the crisis. The transition to balance sheet reduction will also have a significant cooling effect on the global economy, as last year the growth rate of the balance sheet exceeded $120 billion per month. It is also worth noting that it is not so much the balance sheet itself that is important in its nominal value, but its relation to nominal GDP, which, in conditions of inflation of more than 8%, will demonstrate very high growth rates, accelerating the relative reduction in the Fed's balance sheet. Thus, the Fed is now not only rapidly increasing the cost of money, but also rapidly reducing its supply.

The ECB, which raised its key rates by 0.5% at once against the expected 0.25%, also distinguished itself by an unexpectedly high rate increase in July. As a result, the ECB ended an eight-year era of negative rates in just one step. At the same time, the ECB also promises to raise the rate at the upcoming meeting in September, and in June it completed its asset purchase program.

Among other banks in developed countries, the Bank of Australia increased in July (+0.5 p.p. to 1.35%), the Central Bank of Canada (+1.0 p.p. to 2.5%), South Korea (+0, 5 pp to 2.25%) and a number of other central banks of developed and developing countries. This coming Thursday, we can expect an increase of 0.5 p.p. from the Bank of England. Thus, we can confidently state that the ""printing presses"" of the world's leading regulators have stopped - for the first time since the crisis of 2008, and their rates have exceeded pre-pandemic levels, while we are still only in the middle of a monetary tightening cycle.

Why is this cycle atypical?

What forced central banks to tighten monetary policy so quickly and sharply? Of course, this is high inflation. However, the causes of inflation in this cycle are fundamentally different from previous crises. In the classical version, central banks begin to tighten monetary policy during an economic boom, when demand rests against the potential volumes of production of goods and services and leads not to the production of additional goods and services, but only to an increase in their prices. Against this background, central banks increase the cost of lending, which reduces demand and restores its balance with supply. At the same time, an economic boom is often accompanied by overinvestment in one or more sectors of the economy, forming a bubble that bursts against the backdrop of monetary tightening at the end of the economic cycle and provokes a recession (the dot-com crisis in 2000-2001; the 2007 mortgage crisis in the United States, triggered the global crisis of 2008-2009). And after that, it all starts again.

However, the situation could only be called an economic boom in the US economy, whose GDP returned to its pre-crisis trajectory in 2021 and showed high growth rates in the second half of 2021, but already in the first half of 2022, the growth rate of the US economy slowed down significantly. Although China showed high economic growth rates until the beginning of this year, in average annual terms they remained below pre-crisis levels, [and in 2022 they slowed down sharply due to China's commitment to a zero-tolerance policy for Covid-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/we2zkg/why_does_china_need_the_pelosi_scandal/). The Eurozone economy with great difficulty returned to pre-crisis levels only in the fourth quarter of last year and does not show signs of a boom, especially against the background of the crisis in the energy sector. The Japanese economy is still below pre-pandemic levels and has been stagnating for decades.

[GDP growth of the main world economic centers](https://preview.redd.it/en4cjup17mf91.jpg?width=756&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01ebb95689e984af1caa91c9245a67431227413f)

With the exception of the US stock market, where the technology stock bubble inflated (which, however, has already deflated without any consequences for the economy), there are no signs of credit and investment bubbles in the developed economies that could lead to a recession. The US real estate market, although back to pre-subprime levels, is in a much healthier state. The growth in demand for residential real estate is not a consequence of investment demand but reflects a change in the lifestyle of the population due to a significant increase in the number of workers from home.

Thus, today we have the highest rate of price growth in decades without an economic boom and credit bubbles. What is it caused by?

The perfect inflation storm

What provoked such high inflation, if there is no economic boom? Firstly, these are the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and the introduction of epidemiological restrictions. Lockdowns have had a negative impact on logistics and disrupted supply chains for both intermediate goods needed for further processing and end-use products. Even the significant decline in air traffic has had a negative impact on cargo transportation: wide-body aircraft luggage compartments are an important mode of cargo transportation and a way for airlines to increase the efficiency of using passenger aircraft. The number of flights in the world, however, still remains 16% below the levels of 2019. Epidemiological restrictions have also negatively affected the ability to move labor between regions, which artificially limited the potential for the production of goods. The current lockdowns in China continue to have a significant negative impact on global inflation rates even now.

Secondly, the coronavirus pandemic has led to a significant change in the structure of demand and the economy needs time to adapt to it. Working from home triggered a significant increase in demand for electronics, which the global industry was unable to meet. As a result, there was a significant shortage of goods that contain semiconductors, and this is not only in consumer electronics but also industries. The shortage of chips for the automotive industry has severely curtailed car production from pre-pandemic levels, driving prices up significantly, with U.S. car price increases accounted for more than a quarter of aggregate consumer inflation at the end of 2021.

The combination of the influence of the first two factors was the main reason for the acceleration of inflation in the last two years against the backdrop of ultra-loose monetary policy of both developed and developing countries' central banks, as well as the large-scale fiscal stimulus in developed countries. Moreover, in the context of already existing failures in supply chains, various random factors were added that increased the effect on inflation and which, according to the law of meanness, in 2020-2021. was in abundance. These are the weather conditions:

• Frosts in Texas in February 2021, which negatively affected oil and gas production and disabled large semiconductor factories for several months;

• last year's hot summer in Europe, which led to increased demand for electricity and, consequently, natural gas and coal to operate power plants against the background of calm weather, which limited the generation of electricity by the numerous wind farms in the region;

• Bad weather has reduced crop yields around the world, leading to increased shortages and higher food prices.

Natural disasters and accidents:

• a fire at one of the factories in Japan for the production of semiconductor products for the automotive industry, which disabled a large line for the production of silicon wafers for chips;

• a fire at a plant producing equipment for semiconductor manufacturers;

• the accident of the Ever Given container ship in the Suez Canal;

• floods in central China in July-August last year, etc.

As well as political events:

• workers' strikes in the Chilean copper mines, which contributed to the rise in copper prices against the backdrop of a shortage of copper supply;

• China's ban on the import of thermal coal from Australia, which has led to a significant complication and increase in the cost of global supplies of thermal coal;

• active promotion of the green energy agenda against the backdrop of growing supply problems, which only increased pressure on commodity markets.

The third factor was Russia and its military aggression against Ukraine. It is now obvious that Russia was preparing for a war with Ukraine throughout 2021 and began to reduce gas supplies to Europe even then, intending to keep the Old World in gas gloves, which would make it more accommodating after the planned occupation of a neighboring country. So, although Gazprom carried out all deliveries under long-term contracts, it did not participate in the spot market, refusing excess profits in favor of the Kremlin's political goals. The beginning of the war and the inevitable sanctions against Russia from the West led to a new round of rising prices for oil and natural gas, a shortage and an increase in prices in the food market due to blocking grain exports from Ukraine and limiting supplies from Russia. The rise in the cost of food was also facilitated by the rise in the cost of mineral fertilizers on the world market, caused by Russia's threats to limit their exports. The rupture of raw materials, production and logistics chains in Russia and Ukraine with the rest of the world only exacerbated the problems that already existed.

Thus, all this contributed to the creation of a perfect storm, which led to a record inflation rate in decades. Considering that it is impossible to increase supply in the current conditions, the only way to reduce inflation is the need for a drastic reduction in demand, and, consequently, the introduction of the global economy into a deep recession in order to balance demand with limited supply. This is precisely what the policy of the world's leading central banks, primarily the Fed and the ECB, will be aimed at in the short and medium term.

What will the upcoming recession look like and who will be hit the hardest by it?

The fact that the fight against record inflation could lead to a recession was recognized in June by the head of the Fed, Jerome Powell, at a hearing in Congress. Given the level of rates expected at the end of the year, a global recession next year is already an inevitable event, without which it is impossible to balance supply and demand to normalize the pace of price growth. What can we all expect from this event?

In order to understand what the consequences of the global recession will be and which countries will suffer from it the most, it is worth returning again to the situation in which the economies of various regions are. The economies of developed countries are generally in a fundamentally very healthy state: the population remains highly prone to consumption, the economies are not experiencing credit bubbles, and the unemployment rate is at long-term lows. At the same time, although the rise in prices, for example, worries American consumers, on the whole, it is quite neutral for the US economy: the United States and Canada, for example, together almost completely provide themselves with energy resources, food, and fertilizers, so the rise in prices for these groups of goods only redistributes the structure of income in the economy, but has virtually no effect on total GDP.

European countries suffer from rising energy prices much more. At the same time, the Old World, like the United States, is fully self-sufficient in food and is a major exporter, also benefiting from rising prices. The negative effect on Europe is also smoothed out by the ECB’s softer monetary policy compared to the Fed, which allowed the euro to significantly weaken and return it to pre-pandemic levels. The weakening of the euro has increased the competitiveness of European exports, whose share in Europe's GDP is significantly higher than in the US.

Who should get ready?

Developing countries suffer the most from rising prices. In the structure of expenditures of their population, energy resources and food occupy a much higher share than in developed countries, so people there suffer from rising prices for these goods much more than the population of developed countries. The state of many EM countries also raises questions.

China

China's economy has grown mainly through exports over the past two years, primarily to the United States, where people have gleefully spent ""helicopter money"" handed out as part of pandemic aid packages. At the same time, the growth rate of domestic demand in China was two times lower than before the crisis, which, in turn, had already declined significantly in previous years. There are huge distortions in the Chinese economy: the share of investment in the country's GDP is about 45%, compared to the normal level of 20-30% for most developed countries. China is forced to constantly increase debt investments in less and less profitable projects in order to maintain demand for a huge range of domestically produced investment goods (steel, building materials, equipment, etc.), for which there is not enough demand in the rest of the world. As a result, the country's debt burden exceeds 300% of its GDP.

And what about other countries?

The economies of Brazil and South Africa practically stopped in the middle of the last decade and do not demonstrate success in reforms. The Indian economy slowed down significantly in 2018-2019. against the backdrop of the exhaustion of the growth model adopted by the country and the lack of new ideas. The economic experiments of R. Erdogan also led to a significant reduction in the growth rate of the Turkish economy, which demonstrates growth solely due to the devaluation of the national currency, while in dollar terms the country's GDP is rapidly falling. Many other developing countries suffer from similar problems. It is possible not to mention the hara-kiri that Russia inflicted on its economy.

What will the crisis be like?

The low interest rates of the Fed and the ECB, as well as fiscal packages from developed countries, allowed developing countries to weather the crisis caused by the pandemic quite easily due to high external demand. It is the reduction of this demand that is now the main goal of the central banks of developed countries. In the context of the pandemic, the demand of the population of developed countries has largely shifted from the service sector towards goods, in the market of which there was a shortage and which account for the lion's share of aggregate inflation. Opening access to services in connection with the removal of epidemiological restrictions allows the structure of demand in developed economies to return to pre-pandemic levels. The prices of services in developed countries have risen less than those of goods and are rarely financed by credit, which is not the case for goods such as automobiles, electronics and household appliances, and furniture. Thus, by raising rates, central banks will be able to push the demand structure back to pre-pandemic, significantly reducing demand for goods. Rising interest rates will also cool the US real estate market, which will not only reduce demand for construction products in the US but also for related real estate purchases - again, electronics, household appliances, and furniture.

How will this affect the economies of developed countries? To be sure, raising rates to the levels projected by the Fed and the ECB will slow their growth, and many may even face a recession. However, given the fundamentally healthy state of developed economies, the depth of the recession in them will be negligible. A shift in demand towards services created domestically, away from goods, a significant part of which is imported, will also help mitigate the negative effect of rising interest rates on GDP.

At the same time, with rising rates, developing countries will not only lose their main engine of growth - exports. Domestic demand in these countries has suffered much more than in developed countries due to the pandemic, and rising energy and food prices have been an additional powerful blow. Thus, domestic demand will not be able to compensate for the fall in external demand. Additional, but no less dangerous, will be the problem of the high level of the debt burden of EM countries and their refinancing. The weakest representatives of developing countries, for example, Sri Lanka, have already faced this. The increased economic risks of EM countries will also repel foreign investors who will withdraw funds from them to economically safe regions.

Thus, the EM countries will simultaneously face a fall in external and domestic demand, a credit squeeze and an outflow of foreign investors, and emerging economies that stopped growing even before the crisis will go into a fairly rapid decline and find themselves in a state of deep recession, which they are unlikely to be able to cope with in the coming years.

It is the fall of the economies of the EM countries that will ensure a significant reduction in aggregate world demand, which will allow the central banks of developed countries to reduce inflation rates in them to the target ones. As a result, in the near future, we can expect a fall in commodity prices, which is already observed, for example, in the non-ferrous metals market. Falling demand for oil next year may return them to the corridor of $60-70 per barrel. If China, which has not seen an economic crisis in more than 40 years, hits a recession, the world economy will be in recession for a long time, and commodity prices will collapse even more.

personalfinance,Fiancé needs cost of living loan during masters degree,"Hey guys, hoping you can help us out with what direction to go. My fiancé is starting her masters degree soon and won’t be able to work while in school (lots of credit hrs, 20hr/week placement, homework, studying, research) and unfortunately my salary does not allow me to cover all her expenses (car insurance, medication, etc etc). 

We don’t have a ton of debt from school so an additional loan won’t hurt us too bad. Obviously it would be great to not take out a loan but unless an $80k job falls out the sky into my lap we need the extra help. When she’s done with her masters she’ll be making more than me so repayment shouldn’t be an issue. We both have great credit and here’s what I need help with- what kind of loan do we get? And is it possible to get one with a deferment of ~3 years? 

We have 3 existing loans with salliemae, two of them have very low interest rates (2%, $10k and $5k) but the third is high (10%, $10k). Would it be possible to take a loan that covers salliemae + cost of living for 2 years? Doing the math she needs about $15k/year so we’d be looking at maybe a $60k loan including salliemae and some car repairs on credit cards- but this is negotiable as I wouldn’t mind taking a smaller loan that doesn’t cover existing debt. I’m paying $425/m for salliemae as it is and I don’t think I can pay that + a new cost-of-living loan unless it’s deferred, hence my wanting the salliemae loans to be grouped in with the new loan. 

I know it’s a mess to read all this but I just don’t see us making it financially for the next 2 years without a loan to get through it. Any help is appreciated, thank you.",finance,1659611202

Bitcoin,One thing that the nocoiners never address: The massive US debt of 140% of GDP - How is this current level of fiat debt sustainable?,"The US has currently a debt to GDP of 137% and many other western nations exceed 100%.

Once you go above 100% being able to pay back your debts is not very likely. Add demographics and growing healthcare costs due to an aging population and it looks even less likely.

High debt levels are strain on the economy so an economic miracle saving us is not very probable unless we make some groundbreaking technological discoveries.

The best thing we can do is to survive and hope we manage to be able to make interest payments but if debt is not reduced it will grow further and sooner or later, add another pandemic, war, energy crisis or anything that forces the government to borrow even more and we are fucked.

Over the long-term default in some way or another seems likely.

The government has two options to default. Either you do it unofficially. You keep interest rates as low as possible print money and rely on inflation to devalue your debts. Essentially you sacrifice your currency and bond holders to get out of this mess.

The other options is to just continue to a point where they become unable to pay interest on debt and go for an official default. This would likely be catastrophic and kill the global economy and make the great financial crisis look like a walk in the park. Not to mention they would lose all credibility and trust in the dollar and  US government bonds would be at an all-time low and it would be harder to get people to lend money to the government. Once the global economy fails many other high debt nations would collapse and default as well.

In both scenarios fiat and bonds will take  a hit and holders and savers would likely lose  a lot of money.

Stonks wouldn't do to well either as as the high debt situation will lead to low economic growth and if there is sustained high inflation as well stocks would do very poorly.

Alternative assets that don't have any counterparty risks and that you can hold yourself, gold, real state and bitcoin look much better.

So yes fiat and related store of values look great if everything is going well but what happens when you find yourself in fiat debt spiral?

But I forgot, who needs Bitcoin when there is fiat money?",cryptocurrency,1659611853

*****
&gt; “U.S.-China tensions remain high and the Fed continues to talk tough on inflation, but earnings were enough to catalyze the next leg of the rebound,” according to Barclays. “A wave of Tech quarterlies came in better than expected, and the [technology, media and entertainment, and telecommunications] complex led the S&amp;P 500 to a new QTD high.”

Reeling from a surge in energy prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 for a half percentage point rise in Bank Rate to 1.75% - its highest level since late 2008 - from 1.25%.

The BoE warned that Britain was facing a recession with a peak-to-trough fall in output of 2.1%, similar to a slump in the 1990s but far less than the hit from COVID-19 and the downturn caused by the 2008-09 global financial crisis.

British consumer price inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.4% in June, already more than four times the BoE's 2% target, triggering industrial action and putting pressure on whoever succeeds Boris Johnson as Britain's next prime minister to come up with further support.

The pressure on Governor Andrew Bailey and colleagues to move in larger steps intensified after recent big rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other central banks.

Those moves weakened the value of the pound, which can add to inflation.

But it stressed that there were ""extremely large"" uncertainties about the economy - which could make the slowdown more or less severe than its core forecasts - and it would judge what its next moves should be as events unfold.",finance,1659619063
stocks,Evercore says to brace for more volatility ahead of a 'dangerous month' as the bear market drags on,"[Full Article](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bear-market-stocks-analysis-outlook-strategy-federal-reserve-evercore-isi-2022-8)

Investors should continue to be cautious with the bear market set to drag on, according to Evercore ISI managing director Julian Emanuel.

Emanuel warned that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue to be hawkish into 2023, with rising interest rates likely suppressing stocks' growth.

""There is more work to be done in terms of hiking before we sound more of an all-clear, particularly for the equity markets,"" he told CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' Wednesday. ""The Fed has really made it clear that the last thing that they want to do is get into a position where for some reason, they have to cut rates subsequently in 2023, simply because the inflation problem may not have been cured.""

Stocks rallied in July despite the Fed hiking interest rates 75 basis points for the second consecutive month. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 8.6% to climb back above 4,000 points, while the Nasdaq jumped 14.9%.

But Emanuel advised investors to brace for a fresh bout of volatility in September.

""To us \[this\] is much more typical of sort of late-cycle August coming into September, which tends to be a dangerous month, type of behavior,"" he said.

Emanuel advised investors to continue to act cautiously when buying and selling stocks and said it could be a good strategy to hold cash if necessary.

""As the market runs higher, you want to trim some of your position,"" he said. ""So again, you can be in a better position to buy weakness when it materializes.""",finance,1659619255

&gt; Rates have fallen swiftly from their 13-year high of 5.81% in June

&gt; Mortgage rates dropped to their lowest level since April, offering a reprieve to prospective home buyers who have been hit this year with higher rates and surging prices.

&gt; The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 4.99% this week, down from 5.30% a week earlier, according to a survey by mortgage giant Freddie Mac published Thursday. Though rates remain well above their levels from a year ago, they have fallen swiftly in recent weeks from their 13-year high of 5.81% in June.
&gt; 
&gt; Sales of previously owned homes fell for a fifth straight month in June, according to the most recent data from the National Association of Realtors.

&gt; Mortgage rates are tied closely to the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which tends to move in tandem with expectations for the Fed’s benchmark rate. On Monday, the 10-year yield slipped to its lowest level since April.

personalfinance,Refinancing to a Higher Interest Rate to Pay off Debt,"My wife and I (39M/35F) bought our first home last year. We had been renting at the same place well below market rate for years, but the owner decided to sell (and was asking a completely unreasonable price), so we had to scramble. Our housing market was (and still is) volatile, but we were able to get enough money together for an FHA loan on a townhome. It was in the neighborhood we loved, near our friends, and a deal at 225K. Flash forward to today, nearly identical townhomes are going for 400K one block away. Ours is older (built 2007), but has features the new ones do not (balcony, garage, dedicated parking space), and since buying we've put in a brand new AC system, new water heater, new floors, new lights, etc.

A combination of bad decisions in our 20s, bad luck, and unsupportive families have left us with approximately 45K in debt, not counting student loans. Given the evident increase in equity we explored refinancing as a way to consolidate debt, close credit cards with high interest, and get all our debt under one roof. Our current refinancing offer is valuing the house at 350, getting a loan of 280, which nets us about 40K in cash. This would allow us to pay off essentially every debt except for the student loans and our car. The catch is our rate goes from 2.99 to 5.25. Our payment goes from 1500 to 2000 a month, but it also means we don't have to keep paying minimum payments on all our cards.

The plan would be to refinance, pay off the debt, allow our credit scores to rise for a few years, and then refinance again once the market calms down. Is this an effective plan, or am I missing something?",finance,1659638313

My husband and I just moved out of our apartment. We gave them notice at the end of June letting them know that July would be our last month.

They wanted to do a move-out inspection so we let them know again that would would no longer be there and that they had full access to the apartment. They called 4 separate times across 2 days, each time asking for permission stop by the apartment to do the move-out inspection. Seemed weird but I thought nothing of it. 

We are completely moved out of the apartment by our date, but we cannot get in contact with them after multiple calls and voicemails to schedule a time to drop off the keys. We do not know of any existing drop-box and didn’t want to just leave the keys somewhere. August 1st rolls around and they finally call us back. I let the lady know the situation and she agrees to give us until the afternoon of August 2nd to bring back the keys without charging us for them since they are short staffed and closed the office early the day we were due to return our keys. 

I bring the keys back before the agreed upon time on the 2nd. Then the following day we receive the “official move-out statement” letter via email.

personalfinance,Should I cash out my 401K?,"All my life I have been told to never touch my 401K so I have just lived by that mantra.

I am almost 43 and I actually only started being able to save about 4 years ago. I have roughly $45K in my 401K. Last year I bought a $300,000 house at 2.64% interest over 30 years. From what I understand my house has gone up about $75K in value. We bought it below market value at the time not really understanding what we were getting into but long story short, we have about $50K worth of repairs to do.

My credit is good so I know I can likely finance the work through the contractors doing the work but the interest is pretty high. We could also refinance but then our interest rate would be im the 4-5% range. 

But, I also have this small amount in my 401K that would essentially cover everything without going into debt. And we also anticipate that we would likely get about $100K more for the house than we paid and likely more after we fix the issues.

My 401K hasn't really matured very much and now that my wife is working we could likely save up another $50K within 3-5 years. 

So my question is, do you think cashing out my 401K to cover the repairs makes sense?",finance,1659644133

Current salary: 60k + monthly bonus
Monthly savings: 600+ monthly bonus

Debt
Car: 9k at 0%
Student loans: about 200k, unsure of the interest rates due to the pause. I know it’s a lot, undergrad plus grad school.

Currently my employer does not offer a 401k option, but there has been talk of a program being started. I have a Roth IRA through chase with 2k contributed as well as an acorns later account (their Roth IRA) with about 800 dollars in it. Lastly I have a standard acorns account with over 1k invested. The acorns accounts were both started when I was still in school as a convenient way to start saving up. I am considering rolling over the acorns ira and cashing out the standard brokerage account. 

My questions:
1. Due to the lack of the 401k does it make sense to try to put a little money into the ira each year even though I have big student loan debt? I feel like with the 6k max contribution I could fall behind if I don’t take advantage.
2. How does the sub feel about acorns? Does anyone have experience with rolling over one of their “later” accounts? 
3. Should I keep my IRA with chase or eventually move to one of the big three, most likely vanguard?

You’d also need to write up rules about maintenance calls,margin calls and loan default into the LLC operating agreement. I also looked into cross-collateralization which would allow multiple loans to be under the same collateral. There are a few drawbacks I found such as if a member would like to withdraw I still don’t know if they would be double taxed bc capital gains and then distribution tax or if the LLC could directly transfer. Also I do know that if you do make a investment based LLC we may be required to get licensed.

personalfinance,48M Seeking Suggestions on Retirement Planning and Finances,"Overall, my wife and I feel like our finances and retirement planning are good, but I am open to suggestions for improvement. 

Background: I am 48 years old, male, married for 21 years, with children ages 18, 16, 8, and 6. My wife is 39 and a stay-at-home mom. 

Employment: In 2021, my total gross income was $138k in a medium cost of living city. My projected total income for 2022 is $145k. I work as a university professor and also have my own side business. I enjoy my job and plan to continue working a long time although I might cut back on my hours at some point.

Emergency fund/savings: We have $5k in checking, $44k in savings (Discover Bank with 1.5%), and $38k in I-bonds. We are working to convert the bulk of our emergency fund to I-bonds with $20k available in Nov. 2022. Our household expenses average $4,500 per month, including minimum mortgage payments. 

Retirement fund: We have $380k in combined retirement accounts, including $80k in Roth IRA. In 2021, we contributed $47k to retirement, including Roth IRA and tax deferred accounts. We are on track to contribute around the same for 2022. Based on $4k monthly contributions with 17 years of funding and a 6% annual rate of return, we could have around $2.4 million by the time I turn age 65. 

Pension: I have a small private pension from a previous employer that will start when I turn 65. There is a lump sum option (about $50k), but I plan to keep the pension for now. 

Social Security: I have 23 years making around 85% to 100% of the Social Security wage base contributing to Social Security. I would need 12 years to reach 35 good years of income. I could get around $4k per month in current dollars if I wait until 70 to claim, continue to make good money, and Social Security still pays out (that’s a lot of “ifs”). 

Housing: We own a nice home where we hope to remain many years. The current value is $700k with a mortgage balance of $104k and fixed interest rate of 2.1%. We have about 10 years left if we make minimum payments. We were making $750 in extra payments per month, but we are putting that $750 per month targeted to extra mortgage payments in I-bonds for now.

College Expenses for Children: My children receive 50% undergrad tuition reduction at the university where I work. Our oldest son starts college this month. He also received an academic scholarship to cover 100% of his undergraduate tuition. Our plan is to let our children live at home to attend the local state university and we will cover their undergraduate tuition not covered by scholarships or my tuition dependent benefit. If they want to attend a different school, they will be responsible for their housing and the difference in tuition/fees. We also have about $36k in 529 accounts. 

Vehicles: We have two vehicles both paid off. Both vehicles are older but in good condition. 

Health: My wife and I are in good health. Our children are in good health. 

Life insurance: I have $350k in a portable term life insurance policy that ends when I turn 59 and my youngest child turns 18. I also have $50k in basic term life insurance from my employer. We do not have life insurance for my wife. Social Security survivor benefits would be around $2k per month per child capped at $5k per month for household. 

Wife working: Now that our youngest child will start first grade, my wife has talked about maybe getting a part-time job while the children are in school. She only has a GED and worked minimum wage before getting pregnant with our oldest child. 

Possible inheritance/aging parents: We might receive some inheritance in the future. Our parents are retired with homes paid off and financially secure. 

Lifestyle: We live a comfortable but not a lavish lifestyle and try find a good balance. We track our expenses and follow a budget. I still drive the same car that I did 18 years ago. We splurge a little with a yard service. We like our house (.3 acres) but I don't like doing yard work.

The stock index correction was the FED's decision to increase the rate and tighten monetary and credit policy due to rising inflation in U.S. economics. This measure ended up making government securities fixed in dollars more attractive. Thus, investors started to drive their funds out from the risky assets, stocks, and cryptocurrencies. The Bitcoin fall is still continuing. As Bitcoin acts as a guide for the whole crypto market, the biggest part of altcoins is showing a long-term increase, as well.

Positive factors for Bitcoin in 2022

The acceptance of Bitcoin as a payment method in Salvador. Today, the amount of crypto wallets of Salvador citizens overpasses the number of their bank accounts. 

The USA is discussing possible perspectives of the Bitcoin integration into the USA economic system.

There also appeared a serious interest in The overcame 70% bar. Such an interest could be explained by positive forecasts for market growth and to protect their own reserves from inflation. Traditionally, in such situations, it was gold.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, accepted ETF trading by exchange-traded funds. That makes Bitcoin more available for smaller investors.

personalfinance,Laid off - Rebalance my debts/assets?,"Hi Reddit,

Just got laid off.  Looking to get my finances in order after ignoring them for the last 10 years.  Especially want to wipe out credit card interest if there's a clever way to do so without selling my stocks while I'm unemployed.

About Me

* Male, 30s
- Recently laid off
- Recent college grad
- No wife/kids
* Living with others = no rent
* Car paid off
* Credit score: 640 (high credit card utilization, 1 hard inquiry)
* Income before layoff: $100k base, tech industry

Life Plans

- Not interested in rejoining workforce immediately (no timeline).
  - Greatly enjoying personal time (family, hobbies, etc)
  - I think I'm recoiling after having no WLB for past 7 years.
- Am watching job listings and studying for future return to tech industry.
- Will be taking part-time college classes for industry certificates + personal interest + student loan deferment.
  - Would consider going for master's degree instead of returning to work, but haven't looked into it

Assets

* Cash: 7k
* Stocks: 195k
* IRA: 220k
* 401k: 20k
* HSA: 4k invested + 3k uninvested
* No home, but living rent-free

Debts

* Card 1 (14%): 14k
* Card 2 (7%): 10k
* Card 3 (0% til next year): 3k
* Student loans (3%-7%): 75k

Expenses

* Credit card payments: around 1000/mo total
* Health insurance: 350/mo
  - Not sure if eligible for zero-cost medi-cal or marketplace subsidies after layoff.  Waiting on county
  - Am healthy.  Only have insurance to avoid penalty / in case of emergency.
* Food, gas, everything else: 500-1000/mo?
  * Will be spending a lot less going forwards - have eliminated most unnecessary spending (eating out, coffee, etc)
* Student loan payment: 0 with in-school deferment
* No rent
* No car payment

Questions

1. Tired of credit card debt.  Sounds like I can take out a SBLOC since I have stocks saved up.  Should I try to get one at low interest rates to pay off credit card debts and increase cash available / on hand?  Would having available credit in SBLOC also help my credit score?
1. Is there anything I should take advantage of if I will have lower income this year?
1. Should I roll over my 401k into my IRA (both at Fidelity)?  Roth / back door stuff?
1. Worth moving my HSA, stocks to Fidelity too?  Elsewhere?  Would be nice to have everything in one place IMO, but have no other reason
1. Any other major / minor changes I should make right away / eventually?

Ideas / Plans

- Ask CC companies to lower interest rates?
- Find a 0% balance transfer card (not sure if possible with credit score)
- Find an advisor?  Are they expensive?  Thought this might be a good reason to consolidate everything with Fidelity/other.
- Hoping to coast for a while, but worried about low cash
- Planning to pay off all debts &gt; 5% (10k of student loan + all credit cards or SBLOC if I get one) within a year of getting new job

personalfinance,"""Downgrading"" car - Someone explain this to me/help me make sense of this and whether or not it's worth it please?","Hey all!

So, in an effort to fix some financial woes from years gone-by, I've been mulling over transitioning cars (again).

I currently have a 2019 Jetta R-Line w/ just shy of 61k miles on it. Due to negative equity (yay young dumb me!), I have a re-financed loan through my credit union at a 3.9% interest rate of $20,729.91. I currently pay $406.23/mo for this vehicle (this includes a life insurance payment in it in the event I y'know die and don't want someone stuck with my bill). When I checked the value of my vehicle on KBB, it rings in around $16-18k (though I know dealerships will likely toe the low end).

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago I traded in a 2020 Crosstrek for this car in an effort to lower my car payment (again, still dealing with the fallout of negative equity from 5+ years ago) at the urging of family - ""lower your payment, you're drowning!"" ""this is a great market to trade in, bang for your buck on trade ins!"" etc. You get the gist.

My car payment *did* go down, originally by only about $65. When I refinanced, it was for another 60mo loan, and that brought my payment down to what it is now. I went from a $530ish payment each month to $406.

But $406 is, in my eyes, still hefty. And still not my preference. My family in general gives awful financial advice and my mother is drowning herself in debt. I've worked hard to be at a point where I don't have much debt anymore - I have medical bills of around \~$2k, thanks baby!

&amp;#x200B;

The long and short of it is this:

Is it worth me trading this car in for something cheaper? My bank has pre-approved me for a $20k loan - I would be looking for a car in the $16k range (or cheaper if I can find one), preferably a well loved Subaru. I didn't realize just how impactful going from an AWD to non-AWD would be living in NH, but this past winter was rough.",finance,1659701761
CryptoCurrency,The US added 528k jobs added in July - What this means for crypto,"**What happened?**

The US added 528k jobs added in July, compared to a consensus figure of around 250k. S&amp;P500 futures have fallen over 1% on the news. 

**Why is the S&amp;P500 down?**

The figures indicate a strong labour market. The Federal Reserve has said the Fed's goal is to ""get wages down"", while the strong labour market shows that this is not happening. Most likely, the market  is pricing in higher rate hikes in the future. 

**What does this mean for crypto?**

Unfortunately, this is probably bearish for crypto. Crypto has been following the stock market a lot lately and risk-on assets tend to suffer in a high rate environment (as we have seen over the last 6 months). We could see some poor price action short term, which means have a good DCA strategy ready!

personalfinance,VA Cash Out Loan is it worth it?,"As the title says, I am looking at doing a VA cash out loan. Some numbers, house is currently valued at about 197,500. Currently mortgage is about 159k to go. 30 year fixed loan. If I refinance with this VA cash out loan, they offered to roughly 32k some going to debt, car paid off, a couple other things to be paid off, one high balance credit card. Which indeed would be nice. Then about 20k in cash out to me, yeah can get some things done to the house including a new deck, old one boards are starting to bow up. 

Mortgage payment would increase by about 600 a month. Car will be paid off next May without the loan and it is nearly all principle at the end of the loan, so the extra from the car payment will just go to the Mortgage payment if I go through with it. 

The new terms will increase my interest rate by about 2.75%. I was able to purchase this house before the market went up back at the end of 2020. Current interest rate is 3.8% and it will increase to 6.675% with these folks. Again, seems daunting. 

I've heard that one shouldn't do a refinance cash out for more than 75% of the value. Which this would be.

personalfinance,Defeated and confused about form w4,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I'm feeling really confused and defeated. My job has been withholding over 40% of my paycheck. I asked for it to be changed, and they sent me a form w4. I thought I filled it out appropriately, but apparently, I actually had them take out an **additional** $400 per paycheck. Like many Americans, money is pretty tight right now, and I really can't afford this.

The people in our payroll department are incredibly unhelpful. They never answer calls and just refer me to the form. I thought I was somewhat tax form literate, but I'm learning otherwise.

My question is -- how can I fill out the form such that I have ""2"" for my federal allowances and nothing additional withheld? I think my problem before is I put $400 in form 4(c), which I'm now understanding was an additional withholding on top of my normal withholding.

If I just want to have my federal withholding be for 2 allowances and nothing else, is my form w4 just left blank?

CryptoCurrency,I'm beginning to think that bears in this market may have entered their denial phase.,"# Bear behavior is similar to bull behavior right after we crashed from $69K:

Remember when we started to crash down from $69K, after the bull market peaked, and bulls were the ones in denial?

Bulls were saying it was a fake drop and we would bounce back to eventually $100K. It was ""obviously manipulation"". The drop was gonna be a bear trap.

Now that the bear market may have bottomed, we are starting to see the exact same thing from bear.

I'm seeing comments and posts about these latest rallies being fake, and probably manipulation. It will eventually crash to $10K. How it doesn't make sense, and how it's a bull trap.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8mcmblcrbxf91.jpg?width=698&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf6fdf96517f970f39c156baa173046b405533f1

It's been well over a month since we were supposed to be in a bull trap.

We dropped all the way down to $17.6K on June 18, and haven't found as new low since. And somehow managed to get as high as $24K.

# Bears have begun to switch their narratives:

The more telling sign is that bears have started to switch their narrative. The main narrative of bears has been macro economics, and the plunge into a recession.

The initial idea was that, if average Joe is struggling, he won't be able to buy much crypto. That's assuming average Joe really is the market mover in crypto.

Inflation was increasing, gas prices went sky high, home prices too, it was tightening the budget of average Joe.

The only flaw remaining in their argument, was that unemployment was still low, in a year when wages increased the most in decades. So most average Joes still had money.

But bears brushed that off and said mass layoffs and rising unemployment were coming.

But now those increased unemployment numbers didn't come. And unemployment is continuing to drop.

What's worse is oil prices have plunged from $123 to $89. And the housing market is cooling off. While the supply chain is continuing its recovery.

Energy was the #1 culprit of the increased CPI numbers. In fact, if you removed energy from the last CPI data, it wouldn't have had any increase.

The whole reason for Fed hikes has been CPI.

Lower CPI means the Fed won't have to be aggressive with rate hikes.

**The switch:**

So now I've started to see bears switch their narratives that if the economy and all those things are starting to do better, that means we're unlikely to see Fed printing any money to bailout a struggling market. 

So we won't see any bull market for crypto and will remain in a bear market. Based on the assumption that the stimulus is what caused the crypto bull market (if you check my past post on this, you will see that it's not entirely true).

Economy going to shit was what they originally said would cause the bear market. But now some bears have started to switch to the economy going well being bearish.

# How we bottomed in the last bear market.

The evidence is growing, and the picture is looking increasingly less in favor of bear narratives.

You only have to look at how we bottomed in the last bear market.

[2018 market bottom](https://preview.redd.it/8snms4ucaxf91.jpg?width=955&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db61c37b9a3dde18a738c2899e4ffd793f9d8ea1)

While the timeline is shorter (probably because we also had a premature and shorter bull market), the magnitude, and most importantly the ratio is almost the same, with a similar over 40% drop.

We had the same period of stagnation (crabbing), before crashing under the final support. Before crashing into limbo, but with a slowly growing uptrend.",cryptocurrency,1659718503
personalfinance,"Military, new job, late college, short-term disability, new house? GAS PRICES and everything in between. I am overwhelmed and need some direction.","Hey y'all, I've got what I think might be a unique situation. It's a least unique to our family since no one seems to agree on what we should do. I've got some back story explaining to do:

My (31f) husband (33m) was in the Air Force for a short time and ended up breaking part of his back and hip during the last few days of basic training. He graduated, but was given medical leave shortly after. In 2018 he began working at a local plant that paid well - roughly 80k. However, it's literally back-breaking work; 12 hour days, hard manual labor. This has made his Air Force injuries significantly worse. He finally had to take FMLA and short-term disability at 45% pay for 6 months this year to get partial surgery on his hip. 

His doctors are happy with the progress that he's made related to the surgery but have indicated he'll need another surgery on his hip and another on his back soon (within another 6 months ideally) since his range of motion is not improving in physical therapy. Well before he had to have surgery it's been clear that he'll need to find another path of income. This job is breaking his body and is not sustainable. As a result, he's been taking online classes at the local community college for around 2 years now. He can't go full time because he has a full time job, and he also can't attend in-person because his job has not been flexible with his schedule. 

We've been very fortunate that the VA has a program that will pay his tuition and associated fees while he is taking classes. However, there is a time limit to these benefits before they run out. He was also discharged from the Air Force in an weird window that I don't quite understand. Apparently his service was too short to receive his GI bill, but long enough to receive some small VA disability benefits, one of which paying for school tuition. This is important because we can't stack GI benefits meaning we will end up having to pay for his last 1-2 years of school out of pocket.

We've had some recent changes and opportunities pop up for us lately. I took a new job with a bump in pay from 60k to 85k (yay) but its about an hour away from our home (boo). My husband got accepted into a really great school about 2 hours away and he's finishing all of his online-offered courses this semester. This means from here on out he'll need to attend in-person. I've never been more proud of him. He's the first in his family to attend college and he WILL be the first to graduate. He's pursuing a field that he is truly talented in and has plenty of job opportunities. The best part is, not one of those opportunities requires any manual labor.

Because of the recent day-to-day commuting changes we are discussing the possibility of moving. I'm driving 2 hours a day currently, and he will be driving 4 hours a day if we stay where we are. Gas prices are insane right now and eating a large part of our budget. But I also know that interest rates are rapidly rising on homes, and I'm not sure if we should even buy because of this. 

All of this is also rolled into losing a significant portion of his income since he'll have to quit full time and find something part time in order to go back to school. I believe we can make it work since we've been stable during his short-term disability leave. Especially since we don't have to factor in costs for school right now but we will have to re-evaluate in another 1-2 year or so.

Okay, finally onto the ""please help me"" part. We have some equity in our home from paying down principal and it's appreciated in value as well. We've discussed the possibility of rolling over the current equity into a new house, then taking out a loan for the last 1-2 years of school. Or, buying a new house with 0% down with a VA loan and pocketing the equity as a safety net. With the VA we wouldn't have to pay PMI, and they've advertised that they can offer a full 1% lower rate than other lenders. With the way insurance premiums are rising I think we'll take the VA loan either way I'm just not sure what's the better option dealing with the equity.

ALSO, I just received an email today that the waiting period for my companies 401K match has been eliminated. I haven't put anything in yet since I figured I'd have to wait for matching, and with my husband being out on disability I figured we could use a little extra take-home pay just in case. Do I even consider 401K right now with him going back to school? Before this job I paid into the Teacher's Retirement System which isn't great but it's something. I actually haven't done anything with that fund because I'm not really sure how to roll it over into a new one.

Does anyone have any advice on what we should do? I'm even open to 'stay put in your current home' even though that would be hard to hear. We're really excited for new opportunities but we want to be sure we are making the best choice for our family right now.",finance,1659718909

personalfinance,Should I take out the loans or suck it up and deal with a toxic living situation?,"I’m (19F) currently a college student going into my sophomore year. My first year, I took out a total of $8250 in loans over the course of three semesters, $5,250 being subsidized loans and $3000 being unsubsidized loans (these have yet to accrue any interest because of some legislation that passed that pushed the interest away for now). These are all federal loans given to me by FAFSA.

My living situation at home, to make matters short, is incredibly toxic. My mom is incredibly controlling and pushes me to my breaking point regularly. She has been very emotionally abusive/manipulative to me my entire life, so going away to college freshman year was literally like a breath of fresh air. I came back for the summer and she has been extra controlling ever since. She also speaks to me as if I am 13 years old and lacks any respect for me whatsoever. I have an anxiety disorder which I was working on bettering with a therapist throughout my first year, and it’s like all my progress went away when I was back with my mom.

Okay, for the actual finances part: I was lucky enough to win some scholarships for this school year that would only require me to pay about $180 out of pocket &amp; take no loans out for this year. And while that’s probably the smartest choice, I feel incredibly tempted to take the loans ($3000 for Fall &amp; another $3000 for spring) and store it in a savings account so that I can use them to live in an off campus student apartment (which ranges from like $600-800 in my area) when next summer starts rather than have to go back home. I also work throughout the schoolyear but they’re on-campus jobs which don’t pay enough to fully cover rent + I have an internship I’m doing as well but it is sadly unpaid (law career route, been hard to find paid intern opportunities so far).

# **S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq fall Friday, but notch weekly gains after blowout July jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/04/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks wavered Friday in a volatile trading session after the July jobs report was much better than expected, as investors assessed what a strong labor market would mean for the Federal Reserve’s rate tightening campaign.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 76.65 points, or 0.23%, to end at 32,803.47. Even with Friday’s gains, however, it fell on the week. The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.16% to end at 4,145.19, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.50% Friday, falling to 12,657.56. Still, both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the first week of August higher.
*****
&gt; Losses were offset by bank stocks, which rose on hopes that interest rate hikes will continue at a solid clip. Energy stocks also gained, but technology companies slumped.
*****
&gt; The labor market added 528,000 jobs in July, easily beating a Dow Jones estimate of a 258,000 increase. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%, below the 3.6% estimate. Wage growth also rose more than estimated, up 0.5% for the month and 5.2% higher than a year ago, signaling that high inflation is likely still a problem.
*****
&gt; Stocks opened lower following the report, even as it seemed to indicate the economy was not currently in a recession. Job growth was expected to slow as the Fed continues to hike interest rates to tame inflation, but this report shows a labor market still running hot. That means the central bank may act more aggressively at its next meeting.
*****
&gt; “Anybody that jumped on the ‘Fed is going to pivot next year and start cutting rates’ is going to have to get off at the next station, because that’s not in the cards,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. “It is clearly a situation where the economy is not screeching or heading into a recession here and now.”
*****
&gt; Friday’s jobs report is a crucial one as it’s one of two the central bank will see before it decides how much to raise rates at its September meeting. Indeed, traders are already betting on a tougher stance from the Fed. Policy makers will have another jobs report and two more consumer price index numbers to weigh before the central bank makes its next rate decision.
*****
&gt; Major averages posted their best month since 2020 in July on the hope the Fed would slow the pace of its hikes. The S&amp;P 500 added 9.1% last month.

&gt; # Crazy Moves in the Bond Market

&gt; The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) declined over 2% on Friday, which for a sector of the financial universe that is known for its safety, is a relatively rare occurrence. Since the ETF's launch in 2002, only 3.1% of all trading days have been gains or losses of at least 2%. Not only was Friday a big move for TLT, but it was also the third day this week that the ETF was up or down 2% on the trading day. Talk about an uncertain environment! With investors looking to forecast the path and intensity of rate hikes against a backdrop of high inflation, stronger than expected economic data (like Friday's Payroll report) puts upward pressure on yields, while weaker than expected data suggests the economy is cooling off causing bonds to rally and yields to fall.

&gt; As mentioned above, three of the last five trading days have seen daily moves of plus or minus 2%. Only two other periods throughout the history of TLT have seen a higher rate of 2%+ moves in TLT, those being August of 2011 and March of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/TLT-rolling-5-day-moves-2-pct-plus-080522.png))**

&gt; Since TLT was launched in 2002, there have only been 22 trading days in which the ETF had moved 2%+ three times over a trailing five-day period. Those occurrences are shown on the chart below and they are clustered around three different periods - the Financial Crisis, the US debt downgrade in 2011, and the COVID crash. Needless to say, these were all very tumultuous periods in the markets and economy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/TLT-2-pct-plus-moves-080522.png))**

&gt; Interestingly, there have been seven years since 2002 in which TLT has had less 2%+ percent daily moves than we have had in the last five days! For the entire year, this week's three occurrences take the total number of 2% daily moves for TLT to 17. There are still five months left in 2022, but if there wasn't another day with a gain or loss of 2%, this year would still rank fourth in terms of total 2%+ moves. Not only that, but if this year's pace were to continue, it would put 2022 on track for a record twenty-nine 2% moves, surpassing the prior record of 22 from 2011.

&gt; The game is on as the market awaits tomorrow’s employment report and to see if the other shoe is going to drop on layoffs. Not to mention any deeper impact on the economy from inflation and the prospect of more aggressive rate increases from the Fed.

&gt; We are taking the excitement over the renewed bullish sentiment with a grain of salt. There was a similar rise in bullish sentiment at the end March as that rally stalled just before the bottom fell out.

&gt; Investors Intelligence Bulls/Bears Difference also rallied back above zero in late-March as it has the last few weeks. Red circles in the chart show comparable moves above zero during the 2008-2009 and 2015-2016 bears well before those bottoms.

&gt; We may yet push a bit higher, but our cycles and indicators are still pointing to a retest of the June lows with the potential for a lower low before the bottom over the next three months.

&gt; # Bulls Back Above 30%

&gt; While the rally has paused today, the S&amp;P 500 has continued to press higher in the past week and is currently hovering near resistance at the late May/early June highs. In response to those moves, investor sentiment has improved with the weekly survey from the AAII showing over 30% of respondents reporting as bullish. That is the highest reading since the first week of June when the S&amp;P 500 was at similar levels to now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment is a similar story in hitting the lowest level since the first week of June as it has fallen back below 40%. The further 1.2 percentage point drop marks the fourth week in a row that bearish sentiment has fallen, and the full decline since the recent high of 59.3% on June 23rd now sits at over 20 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; In spite of those further improvements, there continues to be more bears than bulls as the spread remains in negative territory. As shown in the second chart below, the bull bear spread has now been negative for 18 weeks in a row.

&gt; # Strongest July in Post-WWII Era

&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closed over 140 basis points higher on the back of favorable earnings from Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon (XOM). This was the third straight day in which the S&amp;P 500 gained at least one percent, allowing bulls to breathe a sigh of relief after a tough start to the year. These moves came even as a second consecutive quarter of negative real GDP growth was reported and the Fed hikes rates by 75 basis points.

&gt; Friday's move helped the S&amp;P 500 post its best July in the post-WWII era, finishing with a gain of 9.2%. Although the index is still close to 14% off of its early January highs, the market looks more inviting than it did at the beginning of the month, when the YTD declines were above 20%. As investors, we could just give ourselves high fives for the month, but it's vital to remain forward-looking. Following July gains of 5%+, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.6% in August (median: +1.4%), performing positively 60 percent of the time. Between the start of August and the end of the calendar year, the index has averaged a gain of 8.0% (median: +10.0%), gaining 80% of the time. Over the following twelve months (starting in August), the index has averaged an impressive gain of 15.6% (median: +15.4%), rallying 87% of the time. Based on past history, bull runs in July tend to bode well for the market for both the rest of the year and over the following twelve months.

&gt; # Rotating in August

&gt; Following the best July of the post-WWII era, equities have been getting off to a slower start in August with the Russell 3,000 experiencing a modest decline yesterday and the index fighting to move into the green as of midday today. Most of the move to start August appears to a degree to be rotational in nature. In the chart below, we show the average performance of deciles of Russell 3,000 stocks grouped by their performance in the month of July. As shown, both the best and worst performers last month have rallied in early August with the deciles of the worst performers seeing slightly larger gains. The losers this month have been in the middle of the performance spectrum as deciles 4 through 7 are each flat to lower over the past couple of sessions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080222-Deciles-2.png))**

&gt; Equities bottomed in mid-June and have been in rally mode ever since. As for how performance the past couple of days relates to the first half of the year's declines, again the worst performers have generally been outperforming. However, by this measure, the top performers from the 52-week high just after the New Year through the low in June have continued to fall this week.

&gt; # Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ecae7fb5af7b0fc9e5eb39e8799d234f/bd4d1a07ef884772-d5/s500x750/5b86f230776c4ad0a11ef3b49b6f23b328aeeb36.jpg))**

&gt; Inflation, war, recession fears, aggressive Fed rate hikes, lingering supply chain issues, layoffs, earnings misses, and lingering pandemic issues drove the market into official bear market territory last month.

&gt; Driven by hopes of a soft landing, a resilient labor market, pockets of positive economic and corporate results, and some rather seriously oversold conditions in big name tech and growth stocks the market has rallied smartly off the June lows.

&gt; At the end of July DJIA was up 9.9% from the June lows, S&amp;P up 12.6% and NASDAQ up 16.4. Summer rally 2022 has worked the bulls into a frenzy like a matador with his red muleta. DJIA logged its 7th best July since 1950, up 6.7%, qualifying as a “Hot July Market.”

&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of 7.2% on average in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year.

&gt; # Initial Claims Back to the Highs

&gt; Initial jobless claims came in matching expectations at 260K this week, up from last week's downward revision of 254K. That reading leaves claims 1K below the pandemic high set two weeks ago. Those levels are above the pre-pandemic range and consistent with where claims stood in the fall of 2017.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims have the benefit of seasonal tailwinds at this point of the year as the mid-summer peak works itself out. Given this, unadjusted claims have dropped to 205.6K from the high of 258.9K two weeks ago. Although that is a strong level of claims, it is above the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to the initial claims number meaning the most recent reading is as of the week of July 22nd. Although initial claims had fallen that week, continuing claims moved back above 1.4 million for the first time since mid-April. Unlike initial claims, and as we will discuss further in tonight's Closer, the deterioration in continuing claims has been relatively modest as current levels are not only well below levels from the two years pre-pandemic, but this week's reading would still make for some of the best readings since 1970.

personalfinance,"I don't understand my life insurance, especially the cost of living rider, please help eli5?","I can provide more info, but I'm not sure what's relevant. I live in NH.

I own a life insurance policy on my husband.  It was originally purchased by his parents 30 years ago, and transferred to me in 2020 (I didn't know it existed before that. One parent is deceased, the other has dementia, so I can't ask them about it.). It's an Adaptable Life/Whole Life policy. 

I just got a letter about my Cost of Living Adjustment Term Rider.  This will increase my yearly premium by about 23% this year.

Briefly, the current face amount is 50,500, interest rate 4.50, and according to the letter I just got--end of next month my premium will go from 493.33 up to 608.11, COLA Rider Coverage Increase is 6,000, COLA Rider Coverage Total is 11,500. 

Current Policy Surrender Value is 5,124.65, Loan Value 4,689.55.

I can elect not to increase my COLA coverage, and will not be eligible for future increases.

In short, I really have no idea what this all means.  Should I keep the policy with the COLA increase?

I can call the insurance company on a weekday, but I don't even know what to ask.  I'm seriously out of my depth here.

I am a 21 year old college student in NY that has $10,816.59 in a taxable brokerage account and started with $8500. I would like to sell ~$6000 of that stock and put in into a new Roth IRA (I made $8000 so far this summer at my summer job). Here is my confusion:

I see the federal long term taxable gains rate is 0% and the NY state rate is 4%, but also see there is a kiddie tax which would tax the sold stocks as unearned income. Im either going to sell $6000 worth to move to my IRA, or just sell all of it for now. Will I be taxed with the kiddie tax? I’m wondering if it’s even worth selling and moving stocks to the Roth IRA if I’m taxed.

With my student loans at 35k total (Bachelors, will be attaining my Teaching credential and my masters in education in May of 2023) with an interest rate at 4.5% would it be smarter to just make the minimum monthly payments for 10 years, and have them be forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and invest at the same time? Or should I forgo waiting for the 10 years and and pay them off rather quickly. Maybe in about a year or so. I will be making 60k, and my fiancé makes about 55k. Those are both before taxes.

investing,The best stocks or sector ETF's to own during rising rates?,"Tldr; I just want to know your top ETF's stocks you have bought for the rising rate environment and why? (Below is my just my current reasoning as well as some of my favorite)  


I've recently rebalanced my 401k to be pretty diversified into ETF's and am looking to increase my exposure in my retail account to single stocks, I've bought plenty of tech stocks over the last few years and sold them off during the fall of 2021. I'm very bullish on tech but I don't want to make the mistake of exposing myself heavily in the event the economy falters in 2023/24 due to interest rates causing a housing crash/recession. Everyone and their mom's have a different feeling on where the economy is heading, but for my own sake I try to stick with the most reliable info, and that as of right now is that rates will go up, probably beyond 3%, and the most recent job numbers seem to give the Fed reason to do so, but that is always changing. I also know that the issues with China's economy, Covid/MP, Supply chains, Capex and Europe all are things to consider but those are things I feel have less certainty to them.  


So my question is what stocks (individual or sector based ETF's do you believe will perform within the next 2-3 years as rates rise to 3%+?  


I've done some research about this recently and I feel Silvergate Capital is a really strong play on rates increasing as well as a pretty affordable P/E, also I am bullish on crypto so this makes sense to my values as well as generally doing well within the space with positive cash flow  


My second pick would be Wells Fargo or XLF if you want broad based diversification, obviously Financials do very well with rate hikes, and with the most recent job number it seems that the economy (for now) is strong enough to support a rate hike. I think Wells Fargo is in the best position to benefit from hikes than other banks, most notably BAC.  


My third pick would be a suite of DSF, Mastercard and Visa because obviously they do better when prices are higher (inflation), they also benefit from higher rates with outstanding balances and have performed very well in the recent years, the P/E's are a little high but I feel these stocks long term are pretty standard to have in any portfolio.  


My last few notable mentions are ones I also plan on picking up but are most hedges than anything, but I still feel will do will in the current environment. To hedge any upcoming wars or further aggression as well as a rebound in the aerospace/flight markets I would buy Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing.   


To hedge against recession risk I plan on buying SLV (Tracks price of silver) and GDX (Gold Miners ETF), along with UNH stock, which provides a healthy dividend and has very strong financials.  


My asset mix would probably be as such 55% Financials, 15% Defense/Aero, 20% Precious Metals, 10% Healthcare (UNH)  


10% In Wells Fargo, 10% XLF 20% Financials

5% DSF 12.5% Visa 12.5% Mastercard 30% Financials - Consumer Credit

5% Silvergate Capital, this carries the highest risk in my opinion, but I'm bullish on crypto and this stock is set to gain 16m/year income for every quarter point rate increase and it cash flow postive.  


5% BA, 5% Raytheon, 5% Lockheed Martin 15% Defense/Aerospace  


10% SLV, 10% GDX - 20% - Precious Metals/Commodities  


10% UNH stock - Healthcare  


After doing a lot of research over the last couple weeks and months I've found myself feeling pretty optimistic and pessimistic about the market, I thought about whether my favorite sector of the market, technology would be going up or down, but time and time again I find myself questioning the global political risks, inflation, and interest rates weighing on the housing market and growth stocks. I couldn't find a way to position my money into individual stocks. I recently bought AMD at 77 and sold for 97\~ a share, after being idiotic about my Roth IRA. I do want to take advantage of the one thing I know for sure will be happening, and I don't want to overshadow my decisions because of greed or fear, I want to make decisions based off a trajectory that's most certain. This portfolio is built under the assumption that rates will rise and that in the event of a recession I will have hedged against my losses, as well as adding defensive stock like LHM, RTX and Boeing, which I think will have always been great names, but now was the time to add to them for exposure.   


I was unable to update everyone on my IRA as the post would not let me, so a small update and where I'm invested now.  
20% BRKB - 10% QQQ - 10% VTI - 10% VIG - 10% HYG - 20% GDX - 20% ICLN  


I do enjoy holding individual stocks, but a ROTH IRA is not the place to do so, I will do what I said above with my retail portfolio, after maxing out to 20,500/year, and diversifying my assets across many different sectors and ETF's I feel confident I can balance my retail account between individual stocks while still having a good amount of risk tolerance and sector balance. I know that individual stocks are risky and many may not agree with my decisions but I enjoy doing this, and if I am one of the 90% who makes under market returns than I will live with my decisions in life happy enough knowing I'm financially secure and doing alright. I will hopefully post an update in a year or so while I sit tight in a position I feel comfortable while selling covered calls every month to help hedge my risk tolerance further. My %'s may change as I figure out which stocks have the best returns with covered calls and what not but this is my current estimation.

Bitcoin,Top cryptocurrency news: Coinbase is facing two fresh lawsuits amid SEC probe,"## Coinbase is now under increased scrutiny from regulators, as the business is the subject of multiple lawsuits. 

The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange, which is already under investigation by the **US Securities and Exchange Commission** (SEC), is now facing two fresh legal claims from two different law firms.  


On Thursday, Bragar Eagel and Squire, a New York-based law firm, announced that it will sue Coinbase for making false representations about its business operations. Pomerantz LLP has also filed a lawsuit against the exchange, claiming compensation for any losses incurred as a consequence of the defendant's breaches of federal securities laws. This lawsuit was filed to recompense the plaintiffs.

In both complaints, plaintiffs claim that Coinbase made misleading and deceptive assertions about its business, operations, and compliance activities between April 14, 2021, and July 26, 2022. According to the lawsuits, Coinbase failed to disclose that client cryptocurrency was held in escrow at Coinbase, making it part of a bankruptcy estate subject to bankruptcy proceedings in which consumers would be considered as general unsecured creditors of the company.

Furthermore, Coinbase reportedly refused to disclose that it allowed US individuals to trade digital assets that—despite its knowledge and complacency—needed SEC registration as securities. As a result of the aforementioned actions, the lawsuits claim that Coinbase's public claims were always, to a large part, misleading and fraudulent.

**Coinbase** **has already been involved in a number of lawsuits and controversial scenarios. The two new lawsuits came as the SEC investigates Coinbase for allegedly trading unregistered securities. In a related complaint, Ishan Wahi, a former global product manager for Coinbase, is accused of insider trading. Wahi, on the other hand, pleaded not guilty earlier this month in a Manhattan federal courtroom to two charges of wire fraud conspiracy.**",cryptocurrency,1659779890

I’m aware there wouldn’t be anything that would change the plot but am more so wondering if the others will speak to you differently.

My first play through I just listened to dutch and went for John first, than Faith, than Jacob. This time I decided to go for Jacobs region first because I wanted to get cheese burger unlocked for my companion early on in this run. I just completely liberated the whitetail mountains when this Idea popped up and was wondering could I get more interesting dialogue with the villians depending on who I go after next. Like would maybe John be more pissed off now that you offed his older brother or will he just act the same as if you were to attack him first? Or maybe Joseph will sound more upset in Johns eulogy if he’s already lost one brother(because on a side note bro didn’t seem to give A fuck about his little brother dying lmao)",technology,1659794237

personalfinance,"Seeking advice about Roth income limits, past contributions and variable income","I am 36 years old. I contribute to a Roth IRA by dollar cost averaging on a monthly basis. I have contributed $4,000 so far this year. Due to a series of unexpected bonuses at work and an annual raise in the next month, I am likely going to surpass the limit for 'full' contributions, possibly all contributions. I have no idea what my final income will be for the year. I am very concerned about halting contributions to the Roth and missing out on market opportunities ( I only invest in S&amp;P500 index funds ). I am even more concerned about having to pull my 2022 contributions out of the Roth due to over contributing (if my income gets too high) and miss an entire year of Roth contributions :(

\- Do I stop where I am at and put money typically earmarked for my Roth in a cash account to wait and see?

\- Do I go to the brokerage and reverse all my contributions (+ gains) from my account and stuff in savings?

\- If my income forces me to have over contributed, is a backdoor Roth even possible?

\- Should I hire someone to help me?

&amp;#x200B;

I am feel very unorganized and don't know how to move forward. Other possibly relevant information in terms of deductions:

\- I maximize contributions to traditional 401k

\- Maximize HSA contributions

\- I have a mortgage and itemized last year (\~15k deduction last year, bought house in April)

&amp;#x200B;

Other income sources:

\- Random small checks from other employer

\- High yield savings account at Ally (which seems to unpredictably raise and/or lowers its interest rate constantly)

\- Dividends in taxable brokerage account

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, my deductions allowed me to get healthily under the Roth income limit, so I didn't pay close attention to all sources of income.

Now that I am in this situation I feel overwhelmed by all sources of income, deductions, taking full advantage of investment opportunities, and mix in the variability that exists in my situation.

I am so afraid that I am going to screw myself out of the Roth, or make a mistake and get penalized by the IRS in some way.

personalfinance,Is this a crazy idea? Considering buying island property,"Hello! First time poster here, looking for diverse opinions.

I'll get straight to the point: I recently inherited $60K. I'm early 30s, in the U.S., making $115k/yr. I live well within my means and am mostly debt-free. 

I am considering using the inherited 60k to purchase a small plot of unimproved land on a relatively undeveloped island, out of state. The plots cost around $100K for 2 acres which is steep for raw land but quite reasonable compared to other lots this close to the beach. It's not in a flood zone, has no HOA or building restrictions, and has utilities available. 

Why I'm considering this: 

* I would be purchasing the lot to hold and build on in retirement (in about 30 yrs) so as to have a vacation spot where myself and my partner, our future kids, and their cousins can convene in the summer. Or if I get to retirement and life hasn't turned out as expected, would try to sell it at hopefully a higher amount. 
* Beach property will always be a limited resource and development on this island seems to be picking up so I imagine (although I'm pretty out of touch with real estate trends) that a plot of land here would only increase in value. 

Things that give me pause: 

* It's on an island that, unless I rented a house elsewhere on the island, I wouldn't really have any reason to visit until I maybe build a house there in \~30 yrs. And even then, building on an island would be a hefty/pricey project.
* I'm aware that land loans generally come with high interest rates so could still be paying upwards of $400/mo for 30 year loan.
* My partner thinks this is a crazy, impractical idea. We are also looking to purchase a home together within the next couple of years and while I have enough saved for half of a downpayment, the $60k could help us put more down on a house. 

Curious....is buying land on an island a crazy idea? Would I be better off putting the $$ towards a primary residence? Or even an actual beach house that I could generate rental income from now? Are there considerations to buying raw land or island land that I haven't thought of?

inflation,How to reverse inflation,"The primary and most significant cause of inflation is the great increase in the money supply over the past 20 years, and especially the past 2 years.  There is simply too much money chasing too few goods.  Since we cannot increase the real wealth production of the country, we need to remove a large amount of money from the economy.  The problem is how to do that.

The solution is to create a giant honeytrap.  People are reckless in speculating in real estate.  However, interest rates are rising and there isn't enough real estate.  Plus there's no way to destroy the money through real estate sales.

However, we can create fake estate to solve both these problems.  First, the NSA should create a tech company to use as a front to spy on Americans.  Once everyone is addicted to the dopamine high given by this company's website, the Fed then case use it to create ""virtual real estate"" that will sell for billions.  Everyone will jump on board because they know it's a Ponzi scheme, and they want to be on the ground floor.  After all the people with too much money have put it on in this -- let's call it a moronverse -- the Fed just seizes all the money and deletes it along with the moronverse.  This will cause the money supply to half.

If that's not enough to restore prices to affordable levels, we can always create a ""virtual currency"" backed by nothing and people will buy up that shit like toilet paper in 2021.",finance,1659797740

* Full Time -71,000
* Part Time +384,000
* Multiple Jobs +92,000

Unemployment rate slipped to 3.5 from 3.6, but labor force participation rate also moved down slightly from 62.1% from 62.2%. That implies some of that drop is from people dropping out of the unemployment calculation. Discouraged workers were up to 424k in July vs 364k in June.

This is also the second month in a row that seasonally adjusted full time workers have declined. Before this month's decline, they declined -152,000 in June.

**The top comment right now is asking about why the numbers don't add up to 528 so I'm adding that context here.** First, here's screenshots of CNBC [screenshot](https://imgur.com/oO7Elqd) and the [source article link](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/05/july-jobs-report-shows-more-americans-working-part-time.html) and the [BLS site](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZaMiRFWIAEZE73?format=jpg&amp;name=large) to back up the original numbers. 

They were all sourced before but screenshots because redditors don't like clicking links.

Anyway, the +528 is seasonally adjusted but it is from the Establishment Survey (pages 6-7 of the [Bureau of Labor Services monthly Employment Situation report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)). Only the Household Survey data reports the breakdown between part-time and full-time is only reported in the Household Survey pages (pages 13-41). The Household Survey is how we determine the national unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate among other stats.

There is a different sample population (Household is bigger N, Establishment is smaller) and some differences between how people are counted in each survey. For example, if someone works multiple jobs they appear multiple times in Establishment but only once in Household. If someone is self-employed they appear in Household but not Establishment. Household counts self-employed but total Total Nonfarm Payroll was 152,536k for Establishment and employed Civilian labor force was 158,290k for Household.

So the numbers are a little off because the data sets are different even though both are published in the same report by the BLS.",finance,1659800106

This was yesterday, August 5th. And this morning I wake up and my account is overdraft by $18k.

Turns out the transaction was done three times. Instead of taking out $10k, they took out $10k x 3 = $30k. 

I called Lending Club and the person on the phone immediately understood what I was talking about, and she let me know that they have received over a hundred calls this morning from customers with the same issue. They claim that they have been scrambling all evening/morning to figure out what has happened. She claims that they have gone as far as reaching out to Federal banking regulators to see what happened, and they are claiming it is an issue/glitch at Chase. They claim that no ""extra"" money has hit their end at all. The two extra transactions did not happen on their end. 

Called Chase, and was transferred to their claims department (somewhere abroad), but they told me that I am the first caller, and they have no knowledge of this issue. Their resolution is to send me a claim letter that I have to fill out and sign, and then mail back and things will be resolved within two to three weeks.

So they expect me to sit with a negative balance of $18,000 for two to three weeks.

Has anyone had this happen recently? Or ever? If what the CS rep at Lending Club told me is true, then there are hundreds of very upset people out there, some who had personal checks / mortgage payments / bills, etc. all bounce due to this issue. And from the defeated sound in her voice, and the ""thank you so much for not yelling at me sir"", I am inclined to believe the her that 1. This is widespread and 2. It is a glitch over at Chase

personalfinance,Advice on what to do with $10k my family was just awarded. Is there a right answer?,"My father recently informed me of some money that we acquired thru legal settlement and we have $10k just sitting in a savings account. My family has considered putting it in CD or purchase government bonds, as we don't necessarily need this amount of money just sitting earning measly interest. Although I'm studying accounting and finance in my undergrad, I know intrinsically this money would fare better if put into something that would yield a higher percentage than either a Savings interest rate or CD. I'm not necessarily asking for financial advice, but I want to lay out the parameters for what we've been thinking about doing.

We fortunately already have a fair amount of savings allocated in appropriate accounts, so no need to put it towards an emergency fund. We also don't really need this money right now, and to give an objective time frame, we probably wouldn't touch it for another 5-10 years. My father has already taken the liberty to purchase $1,000 in Amazon stock just because he believes this is a good play. After talking with him, his initial plan was to divvy this money between Amazon and Apple, as he believes these to be strong companies. I don't think this is a bad idea, but I was considering going an ETF or Index Fund route, though my knowledge on them is limited. 

Ultimately, it's my father's money first and foremost, so he will need solid reasoning on anything I pitch in regard to investments. I feel like I would know the answer if I just spent a couple more years finishing up my degree, but anybody can look at the current economic climate and realize we are are in a bear market. I think we are all under the agreement that we want to avoid crypto or anything super leveraged without sufficient reason, but if someone can convince this is the way, I'll listen.

My family just acquired $10k and we would like to invest it. My family isn't incredibly money oriented as we are immigrants.

EDIT:  Thanks all. Overwhelming answer is to include it in the budget which makes sense. For background I'm a physician (we are notoriously bad at this stuff) and am a partner in our practice. So get W2 but also distributions and a K1 end of year. 

Guess my mindset is - yeah it's an expense but not one I budget for as  we tend to do distributions in time for these payouts so it's a wash.  But then as we do the payouts (as income), guess I do need to offset that with an expense.

I'm sort of doubting that I'll regret this come retirement since it's not my 401K, and I still have over half of the ESOP balance remaining.

personalfinance,Looking for feedback - my current finances,"Looking for feedback on my wife and I’s current situation. 

Since we started making decisions together in about 2019 our approach has been to be more aggressive with our money while we are young (both 27). Here’s is where we are. 

No kids. 

I’m in sales and make safely 120k a year (depends on bonuses). She is in healthcare and makes between 30-50 dollars an hour (hours vary). We put her yearly income conservatively at around 55-65k. 

She has a mutual fund with about 20k in it and my 401k has about 45k ish. My company matches 10% if I contribute 10% and I do (contribute 10%). We currently do not contribute to her mutual fund. 

1 car paid off. 

No debt. 

Here is where we have been aggressive - houses. We bought a house in 2019 (Dallas) and did some work on it. Conservatively, if we sold today we would make 75k in profit. I was promoted in 2021 and we relocated to Kansas City where we bought a fixer upper. When we moved we did not sell our Dallas house and we are a year into a 2 year lease making $600 a month. Since buying in September of last year (KC fixer upper) we are all in at around 50k right now. Realistically we could probably make 15-25k but we aren’t selling right now and there is a few more things we can do on the cheap to increase the value. The goal is to make 50k in profit when we sell. 

We currently have about 35k cash in the bank. 

Both houses have interest rates in the low 3%s. Monthly expenses are probably about 4k-4.5k but we’ve been all over the place with renovations. 

I am posting because it is very difficult to know how we are actually doing while renovating a house. I guess you could say we live by the old adage “spend money to make money”. I don’t think this will be a long term strategy as we get older and have kids, buy another car, etc… 

We have been a little discouraged because our cash on hand isn’t increasing while salaries/wages are but again we want to be semi aggressive.",finance,1659896837

Imagine running a business with this kind of deficit. Can America just print more money and issue bonds to cover the debt? Isn't this like kicking the can down the road?

For the market to sell at a premium during a hiking cycle when most people believe in ""Don’t fight the Fed"" makes zero sense to me - especially when inflation is at a 40 year high and not close to be under control yet. 

On the other hand, shorting the market is statistically hard to do because you have to get the timing right and most people don’t do this well so I am not a fan of shorting the market. 

I am a fan of waiting for the market to dip again and then buying in. The hard part with this is this could take months to play out until we get a much clearer picture of reduced earnings going forward from companies. Earnings have been good and have not rolled over yet.

Hello all,

Back in March, I filed my wife and I's federal taxes via mail (jointly). Normally, it takes about 3-4 weeks for us to see the direct deposit in our account. This year, nothing has shown up and it is June. They were last last year too, but not this late. 

Our state taxes returns were deposited in the normal turnaround. I'm getting a little concerned because we are reaching the extended filing deadline of June 15(?). I have to do it by mail because, for whatever reason, ever since I got married in 2012, E-Filing continually fails when I try to process it.

    * Should I resend them in?
    * If I check the IRS's site for their current status, they can't find them.

financial,Parents don’t have good enough credit to co-sign on student loans.,"I will be attending university in about 20 days(hopefully). I received a scholarship, financial aid and federal loans that cover everything except for housing. Unfortunately I couldn’t get a co-sign on a loan with either one of my parents because their credit scores are too low. I also asked my grandparents but they declined. I need around $10,000 a year in loans. What should I do?",finance,1659910151
personalfinance,Finance or buyout my car,"I leased a 2018 Subaru crosstrek which is coming to an end this week.

The buyout price is 16k CAD tax in at 7.99% interest rate for 5 years.

I also have 4k in my savings account which I am thinking to use as a downpayment to bring the monthly payments down a bit. 

I also have 10k line of credit is at 7% interest rate.

personalfinance,I feel like I'm drowning - any advice is appreciated.,"Hi everyone. To start, I'm a 24 year old female trying to get back on my feet after a bout of pretty severe mental illness struggles. I live with my parents currently but I would love to get out on my own sooner rather than later. I'm living in MA, USA if that is helpful.

I started working for the first time in several years this past February. I'm making $15 an hour and working about 28 hours a week minimum but I can get up to about 38ish if I pick up shifts, which I try to do when my mental health allows it. I would say I average about $800 every paycheck (biweekly), after taxes.

I have about $28,000 in student loans with varying interest rates. I never graduated but have completed 5 semesters of college courses. Here is the breakdown. 

\- $7,358 @ 5.94% interest ($85 monthly)

\- $4,654 @ 5.35% interest ($50 monthly)

\- $5,930 @ 3.76% interest

\- $6,062 @ 4.45% interest 

\- $3,750 @ 2.75% interest

The last three loans are federal so they are currently in deferment but starting in September, the total monthly payment will be $122, for a total of $257 monthly towards student loans. 

I am also in the process of financing a used vehicle. I put down $3,000 and am looking at a 5.5% interest rate on $8,100, which includes a two-year warranty. This is a four-year loan term and my monthly payment will be $190. My car insurance will be about $100 monthly at least until the end of this year. I'm not sure of the rate after that. 

I am lucky to not have to pay rent to live with my parents and the rest of my monthly bills (phone, therapy, medication, etc. add up to about $100. I have also been paying about $100-$125 a month on gas. 

At the time of writing this, I've got about $3,600 left in my bank account. I have a trip coming up in September and I'm planning on buying a new gaming PC (my biggest hobby and I will use it constantly so I'm going to invest a decent amount into that. In my head, I have set aside about $2,000 for these events combined, which is likely to be on the high end of what I will actually spend. I have two more paychecks before I go on my trip.

To summarize, unless I am forgetting anything, my monthly bills total approximately $750. Now that I am writing this all out it seems much more doable but when I consider everything that I want to do (such as moving out) it feels so incredibly overwhelming. I want to save up but I also want to live my life now and not in 10 years, when my loans should be paid off if I don't defer/reduce monthly payments based on income or something like that. I could also throw extra money towards my higher-interest loans but like I said, I want to live now. I don't really go out and spend money much but my biggest goal is to be able to live alone/with roommates. Basically, I want out of my parents' house ASAP but I don't know how realistic it is on my current income, with the cost of everything skyrocketing these days.

Well, this is long enough so I guess I just would appreciate any insight into my best plan of action. I am a big planner but I feel so lost in the realm of trying to increase my savings, pay down my loans ASAP, or work toward moving out. Any thoughts are very welcome.

personalfinance,Capital One won't cash debt consolidation check,"I have three credit cards, Apple, Capital One and Citi Bank. 

After getting divorced in the mid 2000's I went the Dave Ramsey way, zero debt, paid cash for everything. Credit score was tanked from the divorce. Whatever, I pay cash. 

Fast forward a few years, can't move, no one will approve me with no credit. Cell phone plan, need a deposit. Car insurance rates are partially based on credit score. Employers run your credit. You need credit to live.  

So I started building credit. Nothing huge, one credit card. Small balance. Limit increased several times. 

Add second card. same. Buy a used car, finance it. Pay it off one year early. Add third credit card. 

Again, nothing crazy. 

I need a new truck, so I go to the credit union and get a debt consolidation loan to pay off the three credit cards and raise my credit score. 

Total for the loan was $3200. Apple cashed their check. Citi Bank theirs. 

Capital One has NOT cashed theirs. It has been two months since it was delivered via certified mail.

I waited one month, talked to the credit union, nope, not cashed but was delivered. 

So I call Capital One, what's going on? My auto payments are still going, I'm not using the card, it is not canceled. Why are they not cashing the check?

They said it's because their processing center is understaffed and overloaded. 

I find it very hard to believe that after two months they still have not cashed the check. 

What course of action do I have here? 

I feel like they are just making sure to make interest off of me instead of cashing the check.",finance,1659918888

- I finished college recently (this may). I have like around $30k in federal student loans that I have to start paying in November. 
- Around $30k of my current savings came from a hiring bonus for my new job that I just started. If, I were to lose my job (or quit) before 1 year of employment, I'd have to return my hiring bonus proportionally (for example if I lost my job after 6 months, I'd have to return 50% of my bonus). I don't expect to get fired or anything, but it's definetely dumb to do anything risky with that money until it's 100% mine. 
- My monthly income is good enough for me to continue  saving or start investing.
- I'm 23, healthy and single so not really any serious financial commitments for now (other than the student loans).

Anyway, I know it's not good to keep all this money in cash since it loses value due to inflation. My long term goal is to invest as much as possible but first I obviously want to get rid of debt.

Summary:

It is the largest single American investment to slow global warming.

It would invest nearly $400 billion over 10 years in tax credits aimed at steering consumers to electric vehicles and prodding electric utilities toward renewable energy sources like wind or solar power.

Energy experts said the measure would help the United States to cut greenhouse gas emissions about 40 percent below 2005 levels by the end of this decade.

 The tax credits include $30 billion to speed the production of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and critical minerals processing; $10 billion to build facilities to manufacture things like electric vehicles and solar panels; and $500 million through the Defense Production Act for heat pumps and critical minerals processing. 

 There is $60 billion to help disadvantaged areas that are disproportionately affected by climate change, including $27 billion for the creation of what would be the first national “green bank” to help drive investments in clean energy projects — particularly in poor communities. The bill would also force oil and gas companies to pay fees as high as $1,500 a ton to address excess leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, and it would undo a 10-year moratorium on offshore wind leasing established by President Donald J. Trump. 

 For the first time, Medicare would be allowed to negotiate with drugmakers on the price of prescription medicines, a proposal projected to save the federal government billions of dollars. 

 The package would cap the out-of-pocket costs that seniors pay annually for prescription drugs at $2,000, and would ensure that seniors have access to free vaccines.  

 Republicans successfully challenged the inclusion of a $35 price cap on insulin for patients on private insurance during a rapid-fire series of amendment votes early Sunday morning, forcing its removal. But a separate proposal that caps the price of insulin at $35 per month for Medicare patients remained intact. 

 A new 15 percent corporate minimum tax on the profits companies report to shareholders. It would apply to companies that report more than $1 billion in annual income on their financial statements but that are also able to use credits, deductions and other tax treatments to lower [their effective tax rates](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/us/politics/biden-climate-tax-bill-cost.html). 

 The legislation would also bolster the I.R.S. with an investment of about $80 billion, hoping to recover additional tax revenue by cracking down on wealthy corporations and wealthy tax evaders.",energy,1659922289

economy,Clouds gathering over the global economy,"An analysis of world economic statistics indicates that the peak of world economic growth was passed in the 1Q 2022, and since then the global economy has begun to slow steadily. This fact is well seen in the dynamics of exports of the leading industrial regions of the world, calculated on the basis of 12-monthly rolling data (the ratio of exports over the last 12 months to the previous 12 months), where peaks occur at the end of 2021 - beginning of 2022.

At the same time, most of the economic data is still at high or pre-pandemic levels, without causing any concerns among market players. However, a number of leading indicators in the past two months have already begun to point to a slowdown in economic activity. The most common and referenced leading indicator is the PMI, the Purchasing Managers' Index. The neutral level of the index is 50 points, which means that economic activity in the current month has not changed compared to the previous month.

Calculated on the basis of country indices, global levels of PMI indices reached in July their lowest level since July-August 2020, although they remain slightly above the levels of 50 p. The most noticeable drop in indices at the regional level was observed in the Eurozone, where the industrial sector is already experiencing a decline in activity. The sharp collapse of the PMI indices for the US, calculated by the S&amp;P agency, also raises questions, while the indices from the ISM (Institute for Supply Management) even managed to grow in July. And although financial markets are guided primarily by data from the ISM, the data from the S&amp;P should not be discounted, perhaps it better reflects the changes coming to the US economy. Here, apparently, it is worth waiting for the data for August - the data from the ISM have been declining since the beginning of the 4Q last year.

[World PMI](https://preview.redd.it/3dyiwueoxeg91.jpg?width=756&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f851714786d2092a657c0f0e31eb026664e6603)

At the same time, the attentive reader will probably notice that last year and the beginning of this year there were also significant dips in the PMI data. Previous short-term dips were caused by outbreaks of the delta and omicron strains of the coronavirus and the tightening of epidemiological restrictions that caused a decline in economic activity. However, this summer there are no new outbreaks and tightening of restrictions, with the exception of certain regions of China. Thus, we are dealing with a general decline in economic activity caused by internal economic factors, and not by external shocks.

Another good leading indicator of the health of the US economy is the demand for labor, tracked by the dynamics of the number of job openings. And here, for the third month in a row, from April to June, we are seeing a decline, and at an accelerating pace: if in April the number of job openings decreased by 174 thousand, then by the end of June the decrease was already 605 thousand. At the same time, key indicators of the labor market, such as the level of unemployment and the number of new jobs continue to remain at levels indicating strong economic growth. However, given the post-pandemic specifics, the latter probably only remain inert and are also caused in general by the shortage in the US labor market, which was observed even before the pandemic. At the same time, the dynamics of job openings is cleared of the influence of these factors and reflect the net demand of American companies for labor.

[Job Openings in US](https://preview.redd.it/cdaolz3ayeg91.jpg?width=756&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0120194aa01efc4b7e2b7e956e1cd3ae5d1b844)

The continued high rate of consumer consumption growth in the US should not be misleading. Due to high inflation rates, real disposable income (net of fiscal aid packages) in the US has been declining for the 4th consecutive quarter. Thus, the high consumer activity of Americans is ensured by the spending of savings, the level of which has already fallen significantly below pre-crisis levels. At the same time, the US population spent the entire fiscal stimulus in the 3Q of last year.

This behavior of Americans is easily explained: in the conditions of the rapid depreciation of money, the population tends to spend it on goods. However, firstly, savings tend to run out, and secondly, the Fed's actions are aimed at increasing the population's propensity to save, which is the inverse function of the propensity to consume. The increase in Fed rates makes financial investments more and more preferable, stimulating the abandonment of current consumption. Given that the peak of inflation in the US has probably already passed in June, the population in the US in the coming months will begin to reduce their consumption in favor of savings. We should not forget that in September we will see another increase in rates by the Fed, most likely by 0.5 percentage points, which will further increase the cost of consumer lending and the attractiveness of investing in financial assets. Thus, in the coming months, we should see a decline in consumer activity in the US.

At the same time, in the Eurozone, [retail sales already showed a fall in June, the first since February 2021, amounting to -3.7% YoY at once](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/retail-sales-annual). I have already talked about the weak dynamics of consumer demand in China, caused, among other things, by the policy of the PRC leadership [in one of my previous posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/we2zkg/why_does_china_need_the_pelosi_scandal/).

Thus, even a cursory glance at economic statistics indicates that global demand, both consumer and investment, is steadily slowing down. Already during the 3rd quarter, we can expect this trend to be reflected in a much larger amount of economic data, which will lead to a correction in the global stock and commodity markets, which now include in their quotes the so-called ""soft landing"" of the global economy - a slowdown that will reduce inflation, but maintain economic growth.

*  Sell Home A, take equity and put into Home B - I don't prefer this as Home A is a great rental property and has great potential

personalfinance,Moving credit card balance without a balance transfer,"Sorry if the title is confusing.

I have two credit cards. One with no balance, and another with $2,000.  The card with the balance has a high interest rate.

The card with no balance does not accept balance transfers. It does, however, have a 0% purchase rate.

Is there any way I can utilize this purchase apr to move the balance from the other card? Perhaps using some intermediary? 

I know I could open another card with a promotional balance transfer rate, but I'd really rather not. 

Thanks for any advice!",finance,1659937439
economy,The real reason they refuse to use the R word?,"So obviously we're in a recession at this point. Not just by the colloquial definition of two quarters of GDP contraction, but pretty much by every other metric, as well. Jobs...I know, I know. But those numbers are pretty much completely made up. Jobs available is literally made up, and the unemployment rate excludes terminally unemployed people (in other words, the worse the jobs market gets, the better the unemployment number is going to look in the long term). Employment participation and real disposable income paint very different pictures from the faulty metrics they would have you focus on.

So we're in a recession, and they don't want to fess up to it. Obviously nobody in office wants to admit there's a recession on their watch, but still...outright denying the elephant in the room is a new move. Politicians and fed officials haven't ever resorted to this level of gaslighting over a little recession before. I mean they come and go every ten years. Not like it's the first, or the worst (yet), and it certainly won't be the last. And it's not like they even have to take the fall for it. It's all covid's fault! And I mean that seriously. Like out of any recession in history, this is the one that everyone in office is going to get a pass on. So what's the big deal?

Welp, I think the big deal is that the fed has completely lost control of rates. If they admit there's a recession, that means the fed, by its very charter, MUST take action to rescue the economy. But what if the fed did step in and loosen policy, and interest rates didn't come down? Or worse, what if they continued to keep going up?

I think that's the real reason they won't acknowledge the recession that's become so obvious to anyone paying any attention. I think the fed is just chasing broader interest rates that are essentially the result of free market forces in the economy. I.e. supply and demand for capital, combined with inflation and risk aversion on the lenders' part. And now the fed is just along for the ride, hoping and praying that rates come down on their own before everyone finds out the emperor is buck naked.

Which of course they will come down, or at least we would hope. When asset prices start falling and the CPI starts to cool off, lenders should loosen up a bit. Not to mention start becoming more desperate for business as the layoffs start to speed up. With fewer people working and able to qualify for loans, that means less demand, and less inflation. Meaning the banks can lower rates, and that they MUST lower rates to stay competitive. Obviously if there are ten banks and five people in the market for a loan, the banks have to work hard to make their loan more attractive than the bank across the street.

So I think the fed is just buying time. It's kind of looking like rates might be topping out and starting to roll over, so the fed should be able to start easing soon without exposing themselves in the process. I'm thinking the second estimate will get revised down with inflation revising up, and the third in September will be revised down even further. By which time they won't be able to hide the true state of the jobs market anymore, by which time inflation will have cooled dramatically and it will be clear that rates are on their way back down (along with asset prices). And at that point, sometime early to mid Fall, I think that's when they'll finally admit, Okay yea we're in a little recession, let's do some easing and bring these rates back down.

Bonus prediction: I think we're looking at the digital dollar later this year or early next year. As they say, never let a crisis go to waste, and this will be the perfect time for the fed to get its CBDC. They will blame this whole thing on the stimulus, citing the fact that most of the stimulus money went into speculative asset bubbles instead of rent and paychecks. I believe they will refuse to cooperate unless given the authority to start issuing digital dollars as stimulus. Not that they're going to have to twist any arms, mind you. The options in front of the elected officials won't look pretty.

The only two alternatives are hyperinflation and outright state seizure of all private assets. The digital dollar will be the only viable option to keep people housed and fed without resorting to one of those alternatives. Because let's face it, what's going to be needed this time around will make the last stimulus look like a rounding error on people's tax returns. We'll be talking straight up UBI at that point, which would send asset bubbles and CPI to the moon if not strictly controlled. And if you've been paying attention, you will know the fed just so happens to have a CBDC all ready to go, beta tested and everything. Isn't that a fortunate coincidence? Almost like they've had this all planned out for months now.",finance,1659937474

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto isn't a ""community""","Infact, I completely discredit an asset and deem the person a shill when I hear the phrase ""they have a good solid community""

If you genuinely feel a sense of comradarity with those who invested in the same thing as you then your priorities are out of whack. You're too close and thinking and investing with emotion and not logic and reason.

Even if you have the libertarian sensibilities that were the foundation of BTC. You just share opinions on changing traditional monetary policy. Thats it. You aren't in a village raising a child.

Please stop giving /r buttcoin more reason to call ""crypto bros"" a cult. They're justified in that criticism a lot of times, especially when it comes to alt coins. Throwing words around like ""community"" is a good indicator of ponzi like behavior. MLM love that word.

devops,The best way to integrate terraform and Ansible,"I wounder if someone already done research on this. I'm very much like the way terraform make infra, and I like the way Ansible configure applications. I disike 'ssh-level' activity for TF, and Ansible suck at provisioning things via API. So I want to use both, each for the their's best.

The problem: I need to transfer data from TF to Ansible. Normally it's done via inventory, but I need not only simple things like IP addresses, I also need to update domain resource records (IN A) for those addresses. But a single address may be associated with multiple RR, and I need to know those domains in Ansible, so interface between TF and Ansible become ... muddy.

Additionally, staging and production are using different base domains, so I need to account for that.

Are there any nice solutions? I need a single source of truth (like 'foo.bar.example' and 'baz.bar.example' are pointing to this IP, and I want to let applications know what are domain names).

It sounds like a common database to lookup, or some initial configuration which is fed in both TF and Ansible, or what?",technology,1659950061
personalfinance,Buying a cheap house in a bad neighborhood to be close to grandparents?,"Hello! I currently live in Denver, have owned a condo for 5 years, made a decent amount of equity in the place and over the past few years have wanted to relocate not only somewhere cheaper, but my current situation (dog, etc.) requires a single family home. 

My grandfather (my only member on that side of the family left) lives in Syracuse, NY. He lives in a nice neighborhood, in a beautiful colonial house, which while I can afford a house like his, the inventory is non-existent, the property taxes are HUGE at 2.5%) and interest rates are high right now. 

I found this really nice little home (DOWN THE STREET FROM HIM, the neighborhoods swing that much) that would fit my needs perfectly, it’s only $120k, which I could almost pay cash for, my mortgage would go down by half to about $400, but when I showed him the home super excited, he told me it’s in a horrible area due to drugs, crime, etc. My bubble was totally burst. 

He says I need to consider resale value, and the overall environment. He’s a finance guy, as am I, so me explaining that I’m considering this house not to make a ridiculous profit, but to be happier and be closer to him is hard to explain. Even if I took a 20% loss on the home, it would almost be paid off, and I’m not worried about that amount of money. I’d rather be happy and see him frequently. I can run to his house if I need to.

My aunt (his estate executor) told me the amount of my inheritance and I can buy three houses in Denver after he passes anyhow. Am I being dumb by even considering taking a loss like this? I’ve always made good investments since I was able to. I’m 25 and feel like it’s finally time to have what I want. 

Tl;dr 

I want to move, sell a cash cow property in Denver and buy a cheap house next to my grandparents in NY but will be in a druggy/crime area and my grandpa says it’s a bad idea, could potentially take a loss on the house but would have 90% equity.

Here once agian FatManTerra exposed them (so check up his long thread where he describes everything in detail) that they indeed had money in the Anchor protocol.

The red flag here once again was some too high interest rates of 14% for UST on their exchange that's even more than what 3AC and other exchanges had.",cryptocurrency,1659955860
personalfinance,Pause Extra Mortgage Payments and Put Money in I-Bonds,"Does it make sense to pause extra mortgage payments with inflation?

Our mortgage has a fixed 2.1 percent interest rate. The mortgage balance is $104k and is our only debt. If we make no extra mortgage payments, the mortgage would be paid off in 11 years in 2033. We are 48M, 39F and plan to stay in our home for a long time. We are also contributing to retirement accounts (about 30% of gross income). I enjoy my job and do not plan to retire until at least 65. We have about $35k in I-bonds and are contributing $750 to I-bonds each month. We were paying $750 per month in extra mortgage payments but have shifted extra mortgage payments to I-bonds for now. If we took just the money in I-bonds, we could pay off the mortgage in about 3-4 years. 

I understand the emotional satisfaction in paying off the mortgage, but financially, does it make more sense to stretch out the mortgage?",finance,1659956350
CryptoCurrency,Why does every Analyst/Content Creator or basically anyone trading crypto highly believe that BTC will hit 16k or lower?,"Basically everytime I check Twitter on tweets by analysts, they all say that the macroeconomic conditions can't be ignored and that BTC will still go lower. On YouTube, 90% of crypto content creators say the same thing and most of them either say BTC is probably going to 16k or 10k. Why is this such a widely accepted number and why does everyone believe it's going to happen? The fed meeting which was supposedly gonna crash BTC somehow made it pump which wasn't expected. I for one would love for BTC to go lower as most of my assets on Binance are in BUSD but it seems like crypto has just been going up for the past month and now it looks like a far way from 16k. What do you guys think, is 16k still possible from here?",cryptocurrency,1659958976

 A series of inflation reports due out this week could propel or break the market’s summer momentum. Investors will get the latest gauge of how quickly prices are rising across the U.S. economy from three releases on tap in the coming days: PPI, CPI, and unit labor costs. The readings are expected to influence how Federal Reserve officials proceed with the rate hiking cycle and will be closely monitored after Friday’s monster employment report suggested more aggressive increases may be warranted to slow the economy. The U.S. economy added 528,000 jobs in July, according to the Labor Department — a figure over twice as high as economists anticipated amid expectations job growth would recede as tighter monetary conditions and company layoffs stoked fears of a recession. Moreover, the figure marked the labor market’s full recovery to its pre-pandemic level

stocks,"Why is the 10-year yield at 2.8% when the Federal funds rate is at 2.25-2.5% and we know more hikes are coming, probably to exceed 3%.","If we know additional hikes are coming, maybe a 0.5% or even markets are starting to ""price in"" a 0.75% rate hike, then why is the 10 year yield at 2.8%?

I understand the 2 year and shorter time frame bonds tend to track the Fed rate much tighter, but it's almost a guarantee at this point that the Federal rate is going to exceed 3%.

solar,Help: Solar loan vs cash payment?,"EDIT: I'm getting questions on my system being very expensive. Unfortunately, in NYC, the average price per watt for completed projects is closer to $4.88 in 2022. [Here is a state dashboard supporting that](https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/NY-Sun/Solar-Data-Maps/NYSERDA-Supported-Solar-Projects).

**Original post:**

Hello, I'm located in NYC and trying to decide if a solar loan makes sense, opposed to paying cash upfront. Specifically, I'd like to hear what you would do in this situation, and if you have any advice on things to consider that I may not have yet thought of. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I'm using the 26% federal incentive rate and I qualify for a 20% property tax abatement &amp; $5k NYS credit. I'm also rounding some numbers so not everything may line up

My system includes:

* 7.5kw solar system; microinverters and no battery
* electrical work (meter merges)
* roof work (full rip and reroof and gutters); $13,000 for this

**Cash Price**

Total: $49,300

Tax rebates: $17,820 ($12,820 + $5000)

Tax abatement: $9680

Cost after incentives: $21,800

&amp;#x200B;

**Loan Price - 25 years at 1.49% apr; Combo loan**

Total: $55,170 ($19,350 Bridge Loan + $35,820 25 year loan)

Includes a loan origination fee: $4350

Tax rebates: $19,350 ($14,350 + $5000)

Tax abatement: $11,030

Total interest over 25 years: $7175 (Monthly payment \~$145)

Total cost after 25 years (before incentives): $62,350

Total cost after 25 years (after incentives): $32,000

In total, I'll be paying $11,525 extra over 25 years...which seems like a lot. But with the loan fees, it comes out to be effectively a 2.7% interest loan

&amp;#x200B;

**Thoughts:**

I'm torn on this. 2.7% isn't a terrible interest rate, but it's paying a bill forever. And $11,525 sounds like a lot of money. Plus, my average ConEd bill is $160 for 3 meters, so now I'd be paying $145 solar + $20 ConEd (before net metering); without roof work, I'd pay $105 + $20, which is lower though

But the $49,300 could grow to much greater than $11,525. I'd have to sell some stocks at a slight loss but most of it can come from savings (1.5 - 3% interest) I had saved up for renovations + large purchases. And I'd get nearly $18,000 back next year",energy,1659963987
solar,(IL) Do federal credits apply to the cost of the system BEFORE or AFTER Illinois state incentives?,"I can't seem to find this answer online anywhere.

cardano,Cardano has sound technology and community,"Cryptocurrency communities are a new phenomenon, unlike anything we have known before. What is it like, how does technology relate to it, and what does the future hold? Let's try to answer these questions.

**How to define the cryptocurrency community?**

Bitcoin represents an attempt to create non-state global money. Anyone who agrees to it owns bitcoins. Cardano and some other projects take the original idea further and want to create an alternative financial system that is not dependent on governments. It must be acknowledged that there are many speculators in the space who are only looking for value growth and don't care about the ideals or message of cryptocurrencies. However, anyone who holds a cryptocurrency is giving some signal to others, including governments, that they know about the blockchain industry and share at least some of the ideals that are attached to it.

If an alternative independent financial world is to emerge, it necessarily competes with governments that need national fiat currencies to function. There is a direct link between fiat currencies and governments, and it is hard to imagine governments giving up their national currencies. The blockchain industry is a kind of unwanted competition that has grown up fast and is here to stay. Who exactly are the people who share the ideals of decentralization?

These people cluster around blockchain networks, which are inherently ubiquitous. Cryptocurrencies know no national boundaries and fans of specific projects are literally all over the world. Your neighbor may not know about Cardano, but you may be chatting about it on social media with someone from the other side of the planet. Today it is in the order of millions to tens of millions of people, which is more than in a small European country. 

Some people say that cryptocurrencies are a new religion born around technology. Money only works on the basis of trust. Anyone who uses fiat currency has to trust them, just like they trust the country they live in. People know the rules associated with the use of currency and the rules of the state at the same time. The use of fiat currencies is controlled by the state. If someone voluntarily decides to use cryptocurrencies instead of fiat currencies, it can be interpreted as a loss of trust or a kind of revolt against the state.

In many Western countries, the laws and rules of the state are separate from religion. States have created new social contracts that in many ways have replaced religion. Religion is tolerated, but usually does not interfere with the governance of the state, and certainly not with fiscal or monetary policy. We, therefore, do not think that religion is the best term for cryptocurrency communities, although it must be admitted that some commonalities can be observed.

In democratic countries, different political parties fight for power. They present their political program to the citizens and the people decide in elections what direction the state should take. Governments have a direct influence on the stability of the country, and therefore also on the stability of fiat currencies. European countries, for example, have had to decide whether to adopt the euro as their new European currency. 

Can we consider cryptocurrency fans as new political parties? We see two reasons why not. 

First, these parties are global and do not fight with specific political parties in any particular country. On the other hand, if a significant number of citizens of a particular country decided to switch to cryptocurrencies and the country in question tolerated it, it would be a kind of competition for the political elites. 

Secondly, every political party has its leaders. Blockchain networks are decentralized and have no leaders.  A decentralized network is maintained by a group of independent people. However, each project has its prominent face. In the case of Bitcoin, it is Michael Saylor, Jack Dorsey, Adam Back, and others. For the Cardano project, it is Charles Hoskinson. For the Ethereum project, the prominent face is Vitalik Buterin. We mustn't forget the teams that are responsible for editing the source code and have to interact with the community from time to time. We also have major pool operators, miners, influencers, and others. There are usually multiple prominent figures in each community who together form significant currents of thought, but also counter-currents. Even if these prominent personalities do not influence the functioning of the network and cannot, for example, switch it off, they form natural leaders for the community. 

Some influencers may play a fake game with the community just as some political parties play it with citizens. For example, representatives of VC funds try to promote a project in which they themselves have invested at the expense of another project. To promote their investment they are able to lie openly about their competitors. This behavior can be observed frequently. Haseeb Qureshi may tell you that Cardano only has religion and not technology. Mark Cuban will claim that Dogecoin has more applications than Cardano. Just as in politics, in the world of cryptocurrencies we see a lot of lying and trying to swindle others out of money. 

In our opinion, cryptocurrency communities are something between a religion and a political party. They are people who must first and foremost believe in the technology, i.e. a particular project. Next, they need to understand the mission of the project, see it as real, and share the same ideals as other members of the community. Cryptocurrency communities are based on belief in a project, social belonging, and a particular line of thinking or views on monetary policy. However, there is one thing that complicates this view. 

With religion and political parties, we usually choose only one. In the world of technology, this is not necessary and an individual can choose multiple protocols to use. Some members of the community try to force others to make a choice of only one project and consider the others as competition. The question is whether the competitive struggle will prevail and the individual communities will compete with each other like political parties, or whether the technical aspect will prevail and people will use individual projects in a similar way as they use Meta, Twitter, Amazon, or Google. That is to say, they will mainly deal with functionality and not ideology. 

A pragmatic approach to the use of individual projects does not necessarily mean that the desire to decentralize our world more is weakened. It would still be the case that the principles of decentralization need to be introduced into the current political and financial environment, which has little transparency, politicians are not directly accountable for their actions and the whole system is prone to corruption. 

With higher adoption, communities will be more transformed and further changed. Communities are beginning to vote on important issues, more akin to a political party than a religious movement. In Bitcoin, major protocol changes are being voted on. In the Cardano ecosystem, people are voting in Catalyst to fund projects to be implemented. The first DAO experiments are underway. While there is an emphasis on the independence of individual members, they all need to communicate with each other and occasionally come to a decision. 

We can imagine that in the distant future there may be project leaders or spokespeople who will talk to politicians. Indeed, this is already happening today, with fans of individual cryptocurrencies talking to politicians and legislators. They usually lobby for their project or against another project. These people don't necessarily have any mandate from the community and everything happens organically. Do you think communities will one day have elected or informal leaders, or would that somehow undermine the principles of decentralization? We don't have a clear opinion on this ourselves. 

It would be nice if all the cryptocurrency fans got together and formed one big strong group of people to speak out in unison. Insisting that this happens around one specific project is a form of centralization. It is already clear that this will never happen, and people reject it. Unfortunately, we don't think that individual communities will stop competing with each other.

personalfinance,HSA vs. Loans. Please assess my plan.,"Good morning, 

I recently started my ""big boy job"" and it's time to start thinking about how to optimize loans and long-term savings. 

I have 3 loans as follows:

Student Loan 1: CAD182,000 at 4.7% (i expect this to go up at the next rate announcement)
Student Loan 2: CAD72,000 at 5.7% (also floating)
Car loan: USD27,000 @ 4.85%. 
Salary: USD275,000 (fixed for 2 years)
My new job offers 403(b), but no matching until the January or July after reaching 1000 hours. I'm still waiting to hear back from HR about how that is calculated because I have my normal responsibilities from 8-5 but also occiaional on call and such which can make some weeks very long. But for now, no match. Once I am eligible I obviously will be contributing to get the match. 

Also, I have the opportunity to contribute to an HSA. HSA is triple tax advantaged, so it occurs to me it might be worth paying into that before exceeding minimum payments on the loans. 
Lastly, I have access to a 457b plan. 

All that being said, I wouldn't hate some feedback on my plan which is as follows:

1) Max out HSA contributions

2) Pay as much onto loans as possible in order of descending interest rate.

Then, in January or July when I get 403b matching it would change to this:
1) 403b to maximize match

2) Any loans that are above 6% at this time

3) HSA to max

4) backdoor roth

and finally around 5-7 years into the future, depending on salary growth and bonuses when the loans are paid off:

1) 403b to match

2) HSA to max

3) backdoor roth

4) 403b to max

5) 457b

6) 529 plan



Now that all that is said, is there a more optimal order to do things? For example, should I skip the HSA until my loans are more under control?",finance,1659968654

personalfinance,Avalanche Method Question,"Hello since I am graduating college soon I have been thinking about the strategies to pay down my debt. I have learned about the snow ball and Avalanche Method. I was wondering why the method has you pay off the highest interest rate loan first. From what I have read the goal is to minimize the interest spent so would it not be more optimal to pay off the highest principal times interest rate because it is the actual interest you are paying?

As a concrete example let's say you have the following two loans:

A $1000 loan with 7% interest
A $2000 with 6% interest

If optimizing for the interest rate the first loan should be paid off first. If optimizing for the yearly interest you would pay off the second loan first as the yearly interest is $120 vs. $70.

Thank you for the clarification.
Please note I am asking for the optimal way to pay off debt mathematically and I am aware that while losing some money on interest the snowball method has a higher success rate due to the psychological benefits.",finance,1659971935

Real GDP in the U.S. declined at an annual rate of 0.9% in Q2 – and that’s after a 1.6% drop in Q1.

While politicians refuse to use the “R” word, plenty of experts – including Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood – are calling for a recession.

In fact, she made the call even before the official data came out.

“We think we are in a recession,” Wood said in a recent CNBC interview. “We think a big problem out there is inventories — the increase of which I’ve never seen this large in my career. I’ve been around for 45 years.”

Based on how markets are doing, sentiment is certainly bearish. The S&amp;P 500 is down 14% year to date. Wood’s flagship fund Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) tumbled by 49% during the same period.

But investors are not giving up. CNBC noted Fact Set data showing that ARKK saw over $180 million in inflows in June.

“I think the inflows are happening because our clients have been diversifying away from broad-based benchmarks like the Nasdaq 100,” says Wood. “We are dedicated completely to disruptive innovation. Innovation solves problems.”

We have been saving like crazy, and we estimate that by the time we need to take out our loan from the bank, we will have a combined savings of 200k to put down.  
Due to the conditions of the pre-sale, we were already required to put down \~100k that goes towards the price of the home (700k)  
But today after watching some YouTube videos and a bit of research, it dawned on me the possibility of buying another property or possibly another presale with the 200k we've saved instead of using it for the down payment. We could then rent out or flip this second property.

But this means more risk of course, since we'll have to take out much bigger loans for both properties instead of concentrate on just one, and interest rates are sky high right now too.

On top of this, neither of us really know what we're doing when it comes to buying/owning property and all the financial stuff associated with it. We are just going step by step and figuring things out for the first time.

stocks,Are margin loans a better means of attaining leverage than LEAPS?,"I am using the ""Lifecycle Investing"" strategy proposed by Barry Nalebuff and Ian Ayres in their book of the same name, which states that one should use 2:1 leverage for the first few years of their career as a long term investment strategy. The way they suggest doing this is by buying index funds like SPY with margin loans and LEAPS, among other means. I am currently trying to determine which of the first two is the better option by calculating which of those two would require the lowest stock price change to break even.

Let's say I had $10,000, and I put it in SPY with no leverage. Since SPY has a 30-day yield of 1.42, we may assume that the dividend returns would be 1.42% over then next year, so the stock price could fall by 100-100×(1/1.0142)=1.4% (-1.4% change) and you would still break even because of the dividend. Since I use róbinhood (pls don't hate), if I want to use 2:1 leverage through margin loans, I can borrow $10,000 to buy SPY, on top of the $10,000 I own with my money. The margin interest rate is 5% right now, which is calculated by adding 2.5% to the target federal funds rate, which will also go up to decrease inflation. Assuming it stays the same however, the price change for SPY to reach break-even with margin loans, would be (5-(2x1.42))/2=1.08%. I pretty much took the interest rate, subtracted from it the 30-day yield times 2, because now we get twice as many dividends because we have twice as many shares, and then divided that result by 2 because we also get double the gains for the same change in price. Furthermore, we can also attain 2:1 leverage by buying a $205 9/23 SPY Call. SPY is currently priced at $413, and that call's ask price is $214, meaning that SPY's break-even price change in this case would be ((205+214)/413-1)×100=1.45%. Since you miss out on dividends with calls, we don't need to consider them here.

According to my methodology, and please correct  me if it is wrong, margin loans appear to be the superior option, especially for someone like me who is young and has a smaller account. The margin interest rate would need to go up by another .74% for the margin loan approach to have the same break-even point as the LEAP approach. You might say that's likely to happen given more future rate hikes by the federal reserve. But even then, each one of those calls costs $21,400, and thus this approach requires at least that much money, if not way more, to successfully implement. Finally, as prices fluctuate, your leverage will too. If I used the margin loan approach mentioned earlier and SPY fell by 25%, I would end up with $15,000 worth of SPY shares. Since I have $10,000 in loans, of that $15,000, only $5,000 would be mine, and therefore I would have 3:1 leverage. I would thus need to rebalance by selling stock to pay off my loans as the price goes down, and take out loans to buy more stock as the price goes up, to retain 2:1 leverage. The LEAP approach also requires rebalancing, but since each LEAP is ~$20K, you would actually need a lot more money than that to rebalance. Are there any factors that I have overlooked, or is the margin approach simply better?",finance,1659995917

\- A world crisis occurs Covid 19 spreads out of control and a pandemic is declared a month later, mass panic ensues, work stops, everything is shut down everywhere for months, and unemployment begins as a mass exodus insues.

\- Many people are laid off in fact the **unemployment rate more than tripled, from 3.6 percent to 13.0 percent**. \*\*\* (lowering the supply for the steadily increasing demand)

\- Of those that weren't let go, many started working remotely, and many of the remote workers moved to other cities where rent/mortgage prices were considerably lower, with no intention of moving back. 

This created a light financial vacuum as many of the “have-nots” upgraded In status

e.g. 

If I Lived in San Francisco or NY and my home costs were $4000 / month, I can easily afford $1500 in another state.  

\- Those that weren’t let go and not working remote were considered ""E**ssential**"" but are now doing **twice the work, yet NOT receiving twice the pay**

**-** When the hard questions were asked, many corporations looked the other way and waited for the right time 

\*\*\* (production is lower than ever increasing the demand over the supply  -- increasing costs) 

\- Many of the dedicated essential workers that remained felt overworked, many quickly burnt out, became fed up, and left to join the rest of the jobless \*\*\* (increasing the demand for supply)

\- Corporations realizing their greed is costing them both workers (lifeblood) and profit started raising the pay scale for certain “essential” roles, this attracted new and returning workers and provided both a false sense of security and appreciation for both groups. 

\- Edit:
Many restaurants and sporting locations closed down due to a general lack of business, and due to the governments random and repetitive closures. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* **Late 2020 / Early 2021**

December 2020 A poorly described Covid vaccine is developed and given to those that ""want"" it. People are confused about how works as the authority on medicine casually provides conflicting statements, people lose general faith in the system, and the country becomes more divided than when the pandemic first started

\- The damage has been done, but things return to a more livable almost “endemic” status over time. The supply of building materials is still low, and the demands have increased, creating more inflation, even more so since we've lowered the qualifications to attain "" **The American Dream**"" 

**Large corporations pick up on this,** which is dangerous because we’ve now opened the door for **the coldest and most unreasonable class** “ Corporations”. And **unfortunately, it's these SAME CORPORATIONS/TYPES that placed us into our last recession 10+ years ago** 

\- Companies start purchasing private properties by the 1000’s across the country via a $10 - 20 Billion budget, thus granting the ability to once again steer the market to drive up profits by increasing the median price of the one thing everyone needs: A Home, this creates a “trickle down effect” as everything else starts to increase in price. 

This is because the **qualifiers to reasonably purchase** a home were modified (lowered), and there are no other competing markets, factors, or LAWS put in place to keep these prices in check, creating an unfair advantage. and there’s no limitation on the type of homes: Houses, Apartments, Condos (same thing), Townhomes, etc., or who is purchasing them. Real estate moguls win and we’re none the wiser. 

\- **Rental markets went up by $300 - $600 / month on average**

**- People couldn’t afford to live in them so they pretty much gave up and lost to a struggle that they’ve been battling for likely years if not their whole life.**

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* **Early 2022**

Things cost astronomically more than they should.

**Take this REAL WORLD example :**

A house that was for Sale for $181,000 in 2020. 

A bit of work and renovation occurred and the home was flipped for $411,500 in late 2021, and now (Mid 2022)  goes for $480,000.  

**This is the profit that companies have made off buying, selling, and renting private property instead of limiting ownership to physical people.** 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* **Currently:** 

Employment Rates are back on track, but homelessness rises as the result of a general lack of affordability and increased cost of standard living. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: 

If you’re in a lease, I want you to ask this question at your next renewal: 

If my rent is increasing by **X amount** can you show me where **X amount** multiplied **by 12 months (avg lease)** equals \_\_\_\_ amount of work that occurred?

e.g. 300 x 12 = Can you show me $3600 worth of work/upgrades performed? 

**Hold these people accountable, and make them actually work for your hard-earned money.**",finance,1659996256
personalfinance,Looking to rent or buy for the first time ever,"Hello, I am 25 years old living in the Greater Boston area. Ideally, I’d like to stay in the Greater Boston area. I’ve been living with my parents since I graduated college. 

I don’t have any expenses at the moment, except for gas &amp; funding my lifestyle. Due to mental health, I’m looking for an apartment or purchasing a condo. Roommates or solo, either is good with me. None of my close friends are looking to change their living situation at this moment. I don’t know which I should do (buy or rent) as I know interest rates are going up and the market is still pretty crazy. Ideally, I want to keep saving to buy a multi- or single-family home, but I need to move out for my well-being. If I don’t truly want a condo, I feel like I should just rent. The idea of paying someone else $1,000+ a month really bothers me but I’ll get over it. 

I don’t know what I can afford but I’m confident that I’m a good candidate for either option. I spend anywhere from $1,000 - $2,500 on my credit card bill every month as I don’t have a budget at the moment. When I move out I intend to set a hard budget of $300/week for social &amp; groceries. The rest would go towards rent and utilities. 
I take home $5,000 a month post tax. 800+ credit score and I have $100,000 cash.

politics,Megathread: FBI Searches Former President Donald Trump's Florida Home,"Former President Donald J. Trump said on Monday that the F.B.I. had searched his Palm Beach, Fla., home and had broken open a safe — an account that, if accurate, would be a dramatic escalation in the various investigations into the former president. The search, according to two people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, after he left the White House. Those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents. The discovery of classified information at Mar-a-Lago was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it had found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

My credit score is 639 (oof from 750) right now and I was looking to try to consolidate my debt to get a lower interest rate. I got a really well paying job recently so I plan to no matter what throw around 1k - 1500 a month total to rip chunks off the ccs without touching them until them. I just want to try doing so at a lower interest if possible. What are my options to trying to get a lower interest loan to pay off just to due to the interest.

As it turns out I am a little over $6k in debt and have gotten approved for a 36mo debt consolidation loan at a 17.99% APR. I have until September 7th to accept the offer but need help from someone much wiser than I figuring out if it's a good idea to take it. The payments would land at $216.88/month which would be more than the combined minimum payments of $210 but I typically pay $10-30 above the minimum on each account which brings my actual current monthly cc payments to around $275. All but one of the credit card APR rates is above the 17.99% being offered. Please tell me if there's anything I'm not seeing. I admit it would be great to not have to log in to 6 different payment portals every month but I don't trust myself fully to pull the trigger without asking here first.,finance,1660010129
personalfinance,"Is it always best to completely max out your 401k, even if you're very young?","First off, I (21 y/o) want to start out by acknowledging that I know I'm in a very privileged and good spot to even have this issue/thought in the first place.

But, my company matches up to 50% of my total 401k contributions which I know is very generous. Thus, I thought it was a no brainer to max out my 401k this upcoming year.

But, after I take into account my spending on my Roth IRA (maxing it out) , HSA account (maxing it out), emergency savings, and rent + utilities, I'm left with much less money than I expected for personal spending (entertainment, travel, doing things with friends).

I know it's great to be in this spot but I'm asking this because I've seen some people raise the argument of ""living in the now **vs** living for the future"" and for some reason it kinda stuck with me. I'm still going to continue to contribute to my 401k (which takes up the majority of my monthly income) but I'm wondering if I should ease up on it because I'm relatively young and if I should get more aggressive again in 4-5 years.

Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'm putting in around 22-24% of my income into the 401k, HSA, and Roth IRA. Also, when I said maxing the 401k I meant maxing to the federal limit of 20500. 

Thank you all for your help!

personalfinance,Advice for a young person,"Im a recent grad looking to find a long term (5+ year) job i’d like to stay in. I currently work a fed job making $39k per year. The job is rewarding and extremely low stress. Next year I will be promoted and earn $48k per year which will be the last large increase in salary unless I applied for a higher level position at the agency. (I think I could easily get one, and make mid 50’s by year 3) The issue is my total commute is 1.5 hours per day and the hours are from 7-3, with no work from home option for 1 year. 

I recently got an entry offer for $55k in the private sector in the sports betting industry that I find extremely fascinating. The work will be slightly different but I know i’ll enjoy it. The office is about 10 minutes from my house however there is no WFH option at all. There also seems to be an opportunity to grow in the company and I think I can earn low six figures in 5 years. They have tuition reimbursement unlike the fed job i work at now. I’m starting my masters soon and this will be really helpful. 

I feel like the obvious solution will be to take the new job. I’m struggling with going all in on it because I don’t think it’ll be as laidback as the fed job and won’t have as many benefits. I’m a 22m still living at home and saving for a house in the next 6 years. I also fear it’ll be hard to get another fed job if I don’t stick this one out for a while and quit in my first month. 

Should I forget the laidback aspect of the fed job and go all in on advancing my career in private? Will the private sector that much more stressful than a fed job?  I’m young with no obligations and just trying to set myself up with the most enjoyable job possible.",finance,1660017350
Trading,I’m looking to get into trading. This post is long but outlines my current financial situation. Any advice is appreciated!,"I am 20 year old male living in the US. I am a full time student, and unfortunately have picked one of (if not) the most expensive programs offered at my school. For reference, the average cost of attendance (COA) at my school is roughly $30,000. My program includes roughly another $90,000 on top of that. I’ve been somewhat screwed over with the cost of on campus living but am looking to save by living off campus in the coming years. The good news, however, is that my proposed career path has one of the highest paying paying outlooks post-graduation and can only increase with time and seniority, not to mention there is a national shortage right now.

In the meantime, though, I am struggling to meet those up front costs. I work part time roughly 25-30 hours a week and can make anywhere from $900-$1,400 a month. In previous years I have not made enough money to owe federal income tax, and my state does not have state income tax.

I currently have $5,500 in federal student loans and can expect to incur roughly another $14,000 by graduation. I will not have to start repaying these until 2024. My goal in the meantime is to be able to start paying on the accumulating interest to reduce the overall cost of the loan across its lifetime. It is also worth noting that my parents have $7,500 in loans on my behalf and can expect to incur roughly another $15,000. I would like to help pay them back once I am financially stable although obviously I would prioritize my own loans first.

I have a credit card and pay the full balance every month, although I am a relatively new borrower and don’t have a very established credit history. I don’t have a car note or a lease in my name, although those are future goals of mine. My credit score is currently in the mid 600s and I would ideally like to get it in the upper 700s by the time I graduate in 2024. Any tips on how to do this would be greatly appreciated!

I have a retirement account through the Army (thrift savings plan) and they match up to 5% of my monthly paycheck. Since I am in the National Guard, however, this amount is relatively low and my Guard check is not my main source of income.

I have a basic emergency fund albeit it just sits in my checking account, so I am looking to move it into a savings account so I will be less likely to touch it. As for the rest of my investments, I have about $3,000 in a brokerage account mixed pretty evenly between stocks, ETFs, and index funds (some blue chip some more speculative). I try to continuously add to it as I can afford to. I am young and can afford to be a little risky, so I would say my overall risk acceptance level is moderate. I am looking to get into options trading.

I am particularly interested in buying calls (long calls) as the prospect of not losing more than the initial premium is particularly attractive to me and allows me to work within my accepted level of risk. I have no intention of actually executing any of the contracts as I don’t have the capital at the moment to buy 100 shares of much of anything worth actually buying 100 shares of. By that I mean large cap stocks with high volume (i.e. NOT PENNY STOCKS). That also means selling covered calls is off the table for the same reason, as it would require purchasing 100 shares of something up front.

I’ve consulted YouTube a little bit but was hoping to get some advice on here. In the long term I’d like to become competent enough to make trades on my own, but in the meantime was hoping for some guidance in replicating successes people have been having with their own portfolios. What are some good strategies when buying long calls? Any particular tickers to be looking out for in Q4 of 2022? Any general advice or good reference materials?

Thanks kindly!

Edit: Removed question flat out asking for advice on specific trades as that apparently is not best practice on this sub. Also, I’m curious why I’ve been downvoted when I said I’m okay with losing money upfront when like 90% of the advice I’ve gotten from people (on here, other subs, and IRL) is that, “You’re probably gonna lose money up front.”",finance,1660018673

Bitcoin,Inflation Reduction Act should be called Bitcoin Adoption Act,"I just took a quick look at the so-called Inflation Reduction Act and could find no part of it is reducing inflation; instead, it’s just printing money (AGAIN) and injecting more money into the market. 

So when people believed inflation is taken care of by the Act, people will forget about the problem and continue to spend, and they will find more money to spend due to the 740 billion injected. Then later, people will find the inflation isn’t reduced but increased which will make them untrusting the government and their monetary system.

I think both money injection in short run and increasing doubt to government monetary policy in longer run will just encourage people to buy more Bitcoin.

Like this Act.

EDIT 1: I know they EXPECT to raise money and cut cost, but the amount is not for certain, while the spendings are committed.

EDIT 2: I never said government can’t raise a dollar from their plan, but I’m quite sure they won’t be able to come up with the total amount they are spending. So the question is how much they need to make up the shortage - print.",cryptocurrency,1660034107

personalfinance,Optimizing house down payment vs. investments,"I and my wife are approaching our 30s and are looking to buy a house in the next 5 years. We have a comfortable emergency fund and have been stocking away the rest of our income into retirement savings, so the emergency fund is our only cash reserve. The houses we are interested in cost \~10x the amount we save/invest per year. So if we wanted to we could have a 20% down payment in about two years of aggressive saving.

Mathematically, what would be the optimum down payment/investment strategy that would leave us with the highest expected net worth in the long run (assuming that we will buy a house in the next 5 years)? Is it to save 20% for a down payment to avoid PMI and get a better interest rate? Is it to put down a down payment as small as possible while investing the rest? Should we try to delay the house purchase as much as possible?

Any insights are much appreciated!",finance,1660041465
CryptoCurrency,Tomorrow we will be getting new Inflation numbers in the US. That's the biggest economical event of this month and will influence Crypto accordingly.,"Tomorrow the United States will release the CPI for last month. As this month we won't be having any FOMC meeting or rate hikes this is arguably the biggest economical event and it will decide a lot, for the short-term and basically what the FED is going to do next. Obviously Crypto is going to move according to this CPI number too. Here are the two possibilities:

1. We get a lower CPI number, this is the likely scenario this time and is already predicted by almost everyone. If we get a 8.7% or so inflation it will indicate that inflation has actually peaked now and the FED did well with hiking. This is also good as the FED won't be needed to go very hard on the marhet with 75bps hikes anymore. We may very well just see 50bps and 25bps hikes throughout the year. And stock markets will rally just as Crypto.

2. We get a higher CPI number. This is highly unlikely as nearly nothing has been speaking for this in the last month but if we somehow get a higher inflation or even the same 9.1% inflation. It will indicate that the FED has to do more to control inflation. Resulting in sure 75bps hike next month and the 100bps hike still being a possibility. Crypto will therefore tank afterwards. And be under pressure until the next CPI.",cryptocurrency,1660042543
stocks,"The red flag that preceded a halving of global equities in 2000 and 2007 is back, warns Citi","Buzz is already starting for a 1% fed rate hike...

&amp;#x200B;

[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-red-flag-that-preceded-a-halving-of-global-equities-in-2000-and-2007-is-back-warns-citi/ar-AA10tfCk?cvid=2e001f5bc9ac428bd7d225938a590cb5)

 

We are a day away from data that could prove a turning point for markets.

If Wednesday’s CPI doesn’t reveal some slowing in prices, expectations will rise for a bigger Fed rate hike in September, possibly knocking stocks. But if it swings the other way, especially after surprisingly good jobs data, the view that things aren’t as bad as feared/Fed hikes may be done soon, could prevail.

 Wall Street does seem to be at pains lately to advise treading carefully with optimism that has the S&amp;P 500 set to break two-straight quarters of losses — up 9.3% in the third quarter so far.

“The central challenge to the notion that there will be a more meaningful Fed pivot is that the near-term inflation picture is likely to remain uncomfortably high,” said Goldman Sachs strategists Dominic Wilson and Vicki Chang in a late Monday note.

But amid the caution, there’s still plenty of stock buying recommendations out there from the sell side, that is the brokerages and investment banks. And that’s a fat red flag investors may want to heed, warns our **call of the day** from Citigroup.

“Our index of global sell-side recommendations is back to peak bullishness levels reached in 2000 and 2007, after which global equities halved,” noted a team led by chief global equity strategist, Robert Buckland.

“Analysts are net buyers of every sector in every region, but then they usually are,” he said, noting specific concentration on U.S. and emerging markets. “They are still bullish on cyclical sectors suggesting few fears of oncoming global recession.”

Citi calculates its index of global sell-side calls by aggregating those on all stocks in MSCI indexes, ranging from 5, a strong buy, to 1, a strong sell. Their index is above three almost everywhere. They note that analysts are never net sellers of their stocks, even in the case of bear markets. While it seems analysts get more bullish as equities rise, it could also be that the “market rises because they are getting more bullish.”

In any case, that “analyst herding” has triggered a red flag in Citi’s bear market checklist, which has eased to 6 from a potential 18 flags. Note, this particular flag gave a false sell signal in 2012, when global stocks were flat for the following 12 months. But still, what happened in 2000 and 2007 makes it worth noting they say.

Buckland and the team say analysts tend to get the start of bear markets wrong, by turning even more bullish when they should be growing cautious. “Even though they are starting to revise down earnings forecasts, falling share prices and cheapening valuations keep them positive. They eventually do turn more cautious as earnings forecasts fall further, but it is a slow process.”",finance,1660044861

&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures fell on Tuesday after another chipmaker warned about tough times ahead following Nvidia’s poor forecast in the prior session.
*****
&gt; Losses were contained as investors awaited inflation data this week that will determine the pace of future interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures lost 0.2% as chip shares declined in the premarket. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were little changed.
*****
&gt; Memory chipmaker Micron warned that revenue may fall short of its prior guidance because of ’macroeconomic factors and supply chain constraints.” The stock fell nearly 4% in early trading.
*****
&gt; It’s been a rough week for chipmakers. On Monday, weaker-than-expected revenue guidance from Nvidia weighed on the group. Nvidia was lower again in premarket trading Tuesday, shedding another 3% after a 6% decline on Monday. The iShares Semiconductor ETF lost 1.5% in premarket trading Tuesday after falling 1.5% on Monday.
*****
&gt; During Monday’s regular trading, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.12% and the Nasdaq Composite ticked down by 0.1%. Stocks had opened the session higher, but then gave up most of those gains before Monday’s closing bell.
*****
&gt; Outside of chips, a pair of Nasdaq-listed stocks were also taking early hits. Novavax slumped 32% in premarket trading after slashing full-year revenue guidance because of poor demand for its Covid vaccines. Upstart declined 13% in premarket trading after the consumer lending company reported second quarter results that missed both profit and revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 coming off its third consecutive positive week, investors are wondering if this comeback is just a bear market bounce are the start of a new sustained advance.
*****
&gt; “I think a retest is likely and investors need to be careful about buying in here,” Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Jim Lacamp said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “You should use a rally like this to sell some stuff that you’re trying to get rid of — you know, you don’t want the cheese anymore, you want out of the trap.”
*****
&gt; On the economic front, investors are awaiting the latest reading of the July consumer price index, due Wednesday, to find some clarity on the path of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve as it works to stamp out inflation, or at least slow it.

&gt; **Upstart (UPST)** – Upstart stock tumbled 12.2% in premarket trading after the cloud-based lending platform company missed Wall Street’s estimates on both the top and bottom lines for its latest quarter. It also issued a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast, saying that banking partners have turned more cautious due to the uncertain economy.

personalfinance,Seeking some feedback and thoughts on unusual collection situation,"Hi all. I have an unusual, or at-least I hope it’s unusual, collection situation and I’m hoping to possibly get some opinions regarding possible options. Please let me know if there’s a more appropriate sub I should post to instead of this one.

I received a bill for a medical service a while back. The charge was a duplicate of a debt that I previously submitted a check for directly to the provider. I contacted the provider by phone within a week or so of receiving the statement. The provider told me there was not a balance on the account so it must have been a clerical error and was resolved. I gave them all of the necessary information to access the account, and I asked that they verify the zero balance and to please let me know if there was any sort of issue that needed attention. I received no notification indicating otherwise, so I didn’t give it much thought afterward. 

About one month later, I received a notice from a collection agency that the account was apparently sold to. I immediately contacted them in writing explaining the previous situation and let them know there shouldn’t be any balance on the account and asked them to contact me. I also asked that if they believe the debt is valid, they provide me the supporting evidence, including account number, original provider, date acquired, and the like, to support this claim.

I didn’t hear back from them, but I’d learned my lesson last time, and I didn’t want to make any assumptions, so I followed up in writing a few weeks later. The collection agency contacted me a few weeks later and apologized for not responding sooner, but they must have overlooked, misplaced, etc. my request and would look into it immediately and contact me if there was a problem. I didn’t hear anything from them again, but the collection appeared on my TU credit report a few weeks later. I still had not received any information from the collection agency, but now this medical debt was on my report, with the potential to cause me some problems if I need to apply for a loan.

I sent another certified letter to the agency the next day requesting this information again. I finally received the information about the original debt, and replied with another certified letter, and enclosed copies of the original statement and the check that I used to pay the bill. The bill original debt was only $75. I received an email from the agency a few weeks later acknowledging the receipt of the information I sent to them. I replied and told them that I would be more than happy to help determine what caused this issue, but it is for a duplicate charge that was already taken care of and asked that they remove the collection from my report. They told me they contacted the original provider but were not able to verify the debt was paid. That was pretty much all I heard from them, so I assumed, again foolishly, that things were resolved. Fast-forward a few months and I contacted them again to let them know the debt was still showing up on my report and I was concerned things were taking this long to resolve. A few more months have gone by, and the collection is still there. I get it that things have been delayed due to COVID, but this is just getting ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, here’s the situation in a nutshell:

\- This is for a duplicate debt that was taken care of well before the collection agency became involved.

\- I was not provided any evidence supporting this claim for several months after requesting it multiple times.

\- By the time I was able to convince them to send me the information, the collection was already showing up on my report and reflecting poorly.

\- It is medical debt, and my understanding is the National Consumer Assistance Plan requires that collection agencies must wait at least 6 months/180 days before submitting a medical debt to the reporting bureaus, but it was submitted in less than 3 months, and before I was able to even verify and attempt to resolve things or get copies of the details of the charge.

\- It’s a pretty small debt, but there’s the principle of the situation. With the shoddy way the agency is handling the situation, there’s no wonder I ended up in this situation due to their poor record keeping.

I’ve tried to be accommodating and helpful, but this is just out of hand and needs to be resolved. What are your thoughts about the best way to handle this? Things should have never made it this far, and I don’t want it to show up as a collection that was paid in full or settled. This account should not have been on the report, and I’m worried the fact that it was even reported as a debt that had to go to collections is going to impact my ability to get a loan with an interest rate commensurate with my quality and history of responsible credit use.

I’m planning on disputing the account with TU, but this is an odd situation, and when I looked on the TU website to start the dispute process, there is a 100-word limit when explaining the situation. There’s no way I can stop through this and provide the dates, times, communication details, etc. in 100 words or less.

Any suggestions are much appreciated. I’ve never been in a situation like this and don’t want to misstep and possibly make things more difficult for myself. I relocate frequently for work and don’t want to end up with a mortgage with ridiculous interest rate because of this mistake that is beyond my control. I also don’t want to simply pay the duplicate debt in attempt to clear things up. There’s the principle of the situation, and I don’t want to encourage this sort of thing by paying the duplicate charge just because “it’s easier”. It probably seems like I’m making a mountain out of a molehill here, but collection agencies pull this type of behavior enough already because they think they can, and it’s BS.

Is there a more appropriate sub I should post to instead of this one?

personalfinance,Refinance or Trade-In My 2021 Car For a Cheaper One? Income Timeline In Post,"Hi all,

I am currently 25 and I purchased a car last year worth around 30k (financed 25k) on a relatively high interest rate (7.5%) since it was my first major purchase. I have the option to refinance the car at around 2% now and reduce the amount total owed amount by a good bit. I make a comfortable amount of money right now to budget all my expenses and save (&amp;invest) around 30% of my income. I am also not a US citizen and do not intend to be in the country for more than the next 4-5 years.   


Here is the dilemma - 

I plan on going to grad school next year and might not have a source of income. My parents offered to pay for all my expenses but I'd rather not have a $500+ car payment on that tab. Do I just trade my car in and get a car that I can pay off within a few months? My payoff amount is roughly equal to the value of the car.

personalfinance,I am only 23 years old and I’m about to start making more money than I ever thought was realistic. Problem is I have no idea how to manage it. Any advice?,"Hello! I have been financially insecure throughout my life. My parents never made much and I honestly didn’t think I really would. I fell into construction management during the pandemic and have loved it despite being at a company that barely pays me and works me like a mule. Another company stepped in and took notice of me. I accepted an offer from them for $75,000 a year. This will be more than double my current salary of $36,400 starting in September. 

I did the math on take home pay. These are weekly charges and I believe all of these items come out pre-tax (only unsure of whether the insurance comes out pre-tax)

Med+Dental+Vision = $54.42

HSA = $60 
(the company puts $500 in the HSA initially and you can contribute up to $3,150 on top of that. $60 per week would max it out for the year)

401k = $50 
(the company does 100% match for first 3% of salary and 50% match for the next 2%. I know I’m not taking full advantage of the 50% match but would rather keep the contributions lower until I pay off the credit cards I’ve racked up being broke first)


I’m in Florida so no state tax

Social Security/Medicare = $101

Fed Tax = $181


So my take home should be about $990 a week. I currently scrape by on a weekly take home of about $600 and I pay $1,200 a month for rent. I’ve been living in a super unsafe apartment and the lease is up in November. Apartments are expensive in Orlando but I want to live somewhere I finally feel comfortable. I just don’t know how much I can realistically afford without going overboard. In my head, these numbers don’t feel real because they’re just more than I thought realistic. Apartments approve you based on your pre-tax income and now my boyfriend and I are at about $100,000 a year gross, meaning we can easily get approved for up to $2500/month (I’m trying to stay around $1800-$2100 but most of the apartments I’ve toured and like are more like $2200-$2350 sadly). We agreed that I would pay the rent and he’ll pay utilities/groceries so I have to make sure I can afford the rent on my own. 


Does anyone have any advice for a clueless 23 year old that has done nothing but scrape by? I just have no idea how to make these decisions.




**EDIT**: I have received a lot of helpful advice. I have realized that I am being unrealistic, which is exactly what I was worried about. I am going to make a step up for sure because I want to feel safe and comfortable in my home but I will swallow the longer commute to pocket a lot more money in my savings. I'll increase my 401K to take advantage of the 50:1 match. My old target was $2,000 plus or minus $200. Many of you have helped me realize I can still make a compromising step up without over stretching myself with my new target at $1650 plus or minus $200. I will not be going over $1900 a month.

I'll be sitting down with my boyfriend to figure out a more equal split. We have a separate joint account that makes it easy to nail down our shared expenses and we'll just do it based on a percentage. If anyone has any more advice, I still appreciate it.",finance,1660055041

(Bloomberg) -- Stocks retreated as a downbeat outlook from another giant chipmaker added to recession fears, with traders awaiting Wednesday’s inflation report to gauge the path of Federal Reserve tightening.

The S&amp;P 500 dropped for a fourth consecutive session, while the Nasdaq 100 underperformed after Micron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of memory semiconductors, said sales may come in at the low end of or below its previous guidance. Treasury yields climbed, while the dollar fell.

Focus is turning to the question of whether US consumer-price index may have peaked in June after a blowout jobs reading eased worries about a recession, while corporate performance remained generally strong.

The rebound in US stocks has turned fragile, with stronger-than-expected economic data dulling optimism that the Fed would moderate the pace of rate hikes. Still, many are drawing confidence from corporate earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies that have beat or met expectations in 81% of cases.

“Until inflation abates and the Federal Reserve rebalances its priorities away from inflation and toward growth, tempting rallies are likely to remain unsustainable,” Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in a note to clients.

solar,Advice on which Solar provider to choose from?,"My family recently moved north of Houston and we are looking into Solar. While I'm familiar with the basics I'm still having a hard time with making a choice I'll be stuck with for 25 years. Three quotes stand out if anyone has some recommendations:


* Solar SME, Inc. $2.49/Watt, 14,650 kWh production estimate, $20,269 after tax credits. Equipment is MF10-440 panels and IQ8PLUS-72-2-US microinverters. They use W2 employees to perform the install.


* ESD Solar $2.35/Watt, 13,526 kWh production estimate, $17,773 after tax credits. Equipment is MF26-365W DNA 120 panels and IQ8PLUS-72-2-US microinverters. They use W2 employees to perform the install.


* NRG Clean Power, $2.75/Watt, 14,016 kWh production estimate, $19,536 after tax credits. Equipment is Q CELLS Q.PEAK DUO BLK ML-G10+ 400 panels and IQ8M-72-2-US microinverters. They use subcontractors to perform the install.


ESD seems the cheapest with a very low interest rate while still being well rated so I'm inclined to go with them, however I am aware of the slightly lower production estimate. Solar SME looks comparable in terms of equipment and price, paying slightly more for slightly more. NRG is also in that same range though the equipment is different; I'll admit I have no idea if that matters or what the difference is. They all seem good but I'm struggling to find what would make one the clear winner over the others, any help would be appreciated.",energy,1660056442
personalfinance,Chase Won't Cancel PMI w/ 78.81%,"We bought our house in 2018 with a 5% down conventional loan and refinanced when rates were around record lows in June/July 2020. At the time of the refinance, the market in our area was pretty good and I didn't think we'd hit the 80% LTV mark where we didn't need PMI but I thought we'd be close. 

We came in at 86% LTV so not bad but still needed PMI obviously. Fast forward to today - with interest rates rising, my assumption is that housing prices would be taking a hit and this was my last chance for about 1.5 years-ish to get rid of the PMI early. So I ordered the BPO - the value came back at 78.81% LTV - great news, right? Kind of...Chase says that since there were no significant improvements on the home (it's an apartment and most of their ""significant"" improvements involve adding square footage which is obviously not possible in an apartment) and I've had the **loan** for less than 5 years, that I needed to get to 75% LTV to get rid of PMI.

Is there anything I can argue to get rid of my PMI? I feel a little slighted because when I got the loan (both times), I was told ""it would be easy to get rid of PMI once your house appreciates to 80% LTV."" Not to mention we have made some improvements to the apartment including a little work in the kitchen and new built-out closets (totally about $5-7k if I hired the out the work).",finance,1660056651

economy,Landing won't be soft,"The current levels of financial markets indicate that most of their participants assume a ""soft landing"" scenario. Players hope that by tightening monetary policy, central banks will be able to cool the overheated economy. And this will allow reducing record inflation to the target levels of 2% without sacrificing economic growth. However, in my opinion, slowing down such high rates of inflation in the geopolitical conditions we are in is a very non-trivial task. The situation looks like the markets are too optimistic, and the reality can be much more unpleasant.

A ""soft landing"" is also forecast by most investment and think tanks, according to the Bloomberg Consensus Forecast. The IMF does not expect a significant slowdown in the global economy in 2023, although it predicts that growth rates will be inferior to pre-pandemic ones.

At the same time, the probability of a recession in the US, according to the Bloomberg consensus forecast, is 40% (against 33% in mid-July), 20% in China, 45% in the Eurozone, and 25% in Japan. Thus, there is a wide spread in analysts' forecasts: some predict a significant decline, while others are still optimistic.

The reason for maintaining good forecasts, despite the rapid tightening of monetary policy, is the good economic statistics on a number of components, which are characterized by more pessimistic dynamics on the eve of a recession. First, it is the state of the labor market. Thus, in both the US and the Eurozone, unemployment is at a record low level for decades, while there is still a high demand for labor and, as a result, high wage growth rates are observed. Secondly, in the US, the population retains a high propensity to consume. As a result, a number of analysts assume that this time everything will be different, and the increase in rates will not lead to a decrease in American consumer activity.

However,  [in my previous article, I already said](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/wiyynv/clouds_gathering_over_the_global_economy/) that the US labor market has already begun to show the first signs of weakness, manifested in a rapid decline in the number of job openings. At the same time, both the US and the Eurozone are experiencing a structural shortage of labor, as a result, unemployment may remain low even in the face of an economic downturn. As for the preservation of consumer activity in the United States, one must understand that miracles do not happen: real disposable incomes of the population have been falling for the 4th quarter in a row, consumption is financed from rapidly declining savings, and an increase in interest rates will inevitably reduce the propensity to consume in favor of increased savings because it is an axiom of economic science, tested by many cycles of monetary tightening in a large number of countries.

As a result, many of the econometric models used by analysts may not see an impending recession for the time being due to the continued good health of economic statistics. I believe that a significant deterioration in macroeconomic data will be observed during the current quarter. As a result, we may see a revision of forecasts by investment banks.

It should not be forgotten that central banks tend to miss the moment when it would be worth changing the direction of monetary policy from easing to tightening and vice versa. This was the case with the Fed during the period of easing monetary policy at the beginning of the 2000s, and then at the stage of tightening before the crisis of 2008-2009. It happened again during the tightening period in 2015-2018, as a result of which, less than a month after the last rate hike, the Fed had to start softening the rhetoric, and then the monetary policy. For too long, the Fed has kept monetary easing well into the post-pandemic period, fearing a slow economic recovery, that has contributed, among other factors, to a record inflation rate in decades.

I assume that the measures already taken by central banks may be enough for a soft landing, however, as we remember, both the Fed and the ECB plan to raise their rates at meetings in September: both, most likely by 0.5 percentage points. At the same time, let me remind you that their rates are already at or above the level at which the economy began to rapidly slow down in 2018. Thus, already in September, the Fed and ECB rates will reach critical levels for the global economy, but this will become obvious only after 4-6 months.

[Fed and ECB policy rates, &amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/60fzig595qg91.jpg?width=756&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b70ba0ca09cce3458bb5d411c542ec2e74175809)

It is easy, however, to understand the FOMC and ECB policymakers: it is difficult to stop the tightening of monetary policy against the backdrop of such high inflation rates. At the same time, one should not expect that after a rapid decline in inflation rates from peak levels, its further slowdown to target levels may take quite a long time: while at the beginning of the rapid rise in prices last year, inflation was concentrated mainly in a small number of components caused either by rising prices from a relatively low base of the pandemic year 2020 or by rising fuel prices (also, at the initial stage, due to the low base effect). However, in 2022, inflation is already frontal and is observed in almost all product groups, as well as in services. Slowing down lingering high inflation may require much more time and, consequently, sustaining elevated central bank rates for a long time. With such actions of regulators, it will be impossible to [avoid a global recession](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/wfqeiq/why_the_global_crisis_in_2023_is_inevitable_and/).

There isn’t a memo on the check, only a line that mentions tax refund and 2020

The amount would be a very nice amount to have, but this amount would reflect more federal taxes than I paid in 2020 (or 2020 and 2021 combined for that matter)

CryptoCurrency,A refugee's account of the dictatorship in Syria – in defense of decentralized money,"**A refugee's account of the dictatorship in Syria – in defense of decentralized money**

Did you know that: to send money from abroad to Syria, an individual loses more than 40% with the exchange difference alone – and that this is probably intentional, by the Syrian State? 

Check out this exclusive account of a refugee in Brazil who recounted his experience in the Arab Spring protests during the rise of the current dictator in the country. And understand why decentralized money is so important.

**TLDR:**

**For many of us, cryptos are just a tool for investment and financial speculation**, but for others they are a real and efficient way to transfer money without the need for intermediaries corrupted by central institutions of great strength, such as the Central Bank of a dictatorial government, which robs its citizens to supposedly finance weapons that will be used against the very victims of the theft.

It is further evidence that we need to work to encourage the adoption of these decentralized currencies, creating safe routes and alternatives for **the use of money**, which is nothing more than **a tool to optimize voluntary exchanges**.

**Introduction**

While returning from a trip, on Sunday, August 7th, I had the pleasure of meeting a Syrian refugee who has been living in Brazil for eight years, after fleeing the dictatorial regime in his country of origin.

In this report \[originally [published](https://cointimes.com.br/relatos-de-um-refugiado-sobre-a-ditadura-na-siria-em-defesa-do-dinheiro-descentralizado/) in Cointimes, in Portuguese\], I will explain what happened and bring arguments in favor of freedom and individual sovereignty, in addition to defending the use of decentralized peer-to-peer money as one of the means for both freedom and sovereignty to be possible, in the face of an aggressor state.

**An unusual encounter and a historical account**

A conversation that started with my curiosity about how to make the real Arabic tabbouleh, with my new friend explaining the traditional recipe – which I intend to put into practice later this week – escalated to the reasons that brought him to Brazil, followed by a personal account who filled me with hate and sadness, when I got to know another side of history, by someone who lived and saw a lot happen with their own eyes.

I intend to tell you a little of what was told to me in the three hours of travel with my Syrian friend, whose name and some other personal information I will keep secret.

In this material I will bring some historical data, for contextualization, but mainly the personal account of my temporary road companion. Some information I was able to verify from other sources, but much of what will be reported cannot be verified, as the country's current government has been working for years to control the narrative, manipulate the facts and even censor what the world knows about the Arab reality.

He told me that he has already given a lecture on the subject, facing questions such as “but is it true?”. I do not mean to question what cannot be verified. The aim here is to give a voice to an individual who has suffered at the hands of a tyrannical government and leave the questioning to yourself, the reader.

Embark with me on this journey that will cross the Atlantic Ocean, go around the coastal region of Africa and Europe, entering the Mediterranean Sea, to the country known as Syria (سُورِيَا).

**Historical context about Syria (سُورِيَا)**

Syria is a country located in Western Asia, part of the region known worldwide as the Middle East, southeast of Turkey and northeast of Egypt and Israel, west of Iraq – having been part of the Ottoman Empire, one of the greatest empires in human history.

Its capital, Damascus, is among one of the oldest civilizations in the world, as an inhabited city. It is currently very difficult to estimate the size of the Syrian population because of the war, but according to Wikipedia, this number is around 22 million.

Speaking of war, in March 2011 a civil war broke out between multiple sides, with the then president, Bashar al-Assad, leader of the current government called the Syrian Arab Republic, in control of the largest war force and the national army.

The civil war was initially marked by a series of protests against the current government that formed part of the “Arab Spring”, which began in Tunisia and spread to other countries, in reaction to cases of corruption in the government of Bashar al-Assad and an economic crisis that was beginning to take shape in Syria.

And this is where the report I had contact on August 7, 2022 begins.

**Protests, infiltrators and deaths**

Our Sirian friend, at that time, was studying at the university. And it was in the universities, as is often the case, where dissatisfaction with al-Assad's corruption began to take shape.

He told me that, over time, “older students” began to appear in his classes, who claimed to have been transferred from other universities, or were older professionals who wanted to re-enter the market, at a time when unemployment began to grow due to the economic crisis.

Over time, the students discovered that these people were, in fact, members of the secret police, infiltrating universities to discover plans for the protests before they took place, as well as trying to persuade university students in favor of the government.

Part of these discoveries occurred, according to reports, due to the sheer arrogance of these infiltrators who at some point used their position in a self-affirming way to gain popularity among students. Admitting to being members of Bashar al-Assad's army and secret police.

The response to the Arab Spring protests began to become extremely violent and our Sirian friend told us that several times he fled the police through the streets under hail of gunpowder, for which many of his own friends and university colleagues were hit and killed in public highway.

The UN estimates that more than 300,000 civilians were killed in 10 years of civil war in the country, but there is a very high chance that this number is tremendously higher, as there are estimates from **other sources that calculate between 400,000 and 600,000 dead**. Not to mention the missing ones.

The police shots were “justified” as a response to the protesters also using firearms, but according to the personal report, the shots coming from the side of the protesters were authored by more infiltrated actors, from the secret police, who shot at the police and soldiers of the regime. These actors were unmasked countless times by the students, as said.

To arrange the meetings, the university students used closed Facebook groups, since, as he told me, technological knowledge is very precarious even among the army and the secret police, who thought that Facebook was a device and not an application.

In this way, they were able to share maps with location and orientation for the protests, including safe escape routes, and they had about a minute and a half from the start of the protests to their stampede, to avoid deaths and arrests.

**Mandatory military service and the flight to Brazil**

It is a historical and well-known fact, under numerous complaints from NGOs around the world that the Bashar government was responsible for hundreds of human rights abuses, involving kidnapping, torture and execution of opposing civilians.

According to historical data and also as reported during my trip, military service in Syria is mandatory. Every man, upon turning 18, has to enlist and serve in the army during the civil war. It’s only possible to “escape” the obligation if go to study in higher education, graduate studies or by paying a fine of $8,000, but in the latter case, at the risk of being branded as a political enemy of the dictator.

As I learned in our conversation, the recruits passed several tests of loyalty to the state and were forced to torture and execute political prisoners. If any soldier refused to obey orders, they themselves were executed and made “national heroes”, with their families being told that they “died with honor in the war, defending their country”.

**To escape the decision between taking the life of an innocent person or losing his own,** our friend Sírio entered graduate school in a course that was not even related to his training.

Upon graduation, with no other options, he fled to Brazil in 2014, where he remains to this day. His brothers did the same, one going to Germany and the other to Turkey.

Escape, however, is not easy, as the Syrian passport is one of the least accepted in the world and requires authorization from the federal government of the destination country, in the form of a refugee visa.

Talking about entering a new country, I discovered that the visa is only granted after a thorough investigation involving INTERPOL (International Police), of which, ironically, the Government of Syria is a member.

There are reports of protesters and government opponents who are branded by the Syrian State in INTERPOL as terrorists, members of organizations such as ISIS and, in this way, are prevented from taking refuge in other member countries of the International Police.

Many of these end up trapped in hostile territory or forced to join the terrorist groups they were accused of being a part of, in order to gain protection.

There are even reports that Bashar al-Assad's own government is allied with these terrorist groups, from which he claims to be defending his population, and most of the conflicts between these groups and the Syrian Arab Republic are nothing more than staged for maintain the State of Siege and martial laws in the country.

But these facts, unfortunately, I could not verify.

**Economic situation and exchange rate in Syria**

In addition to his two brothers, who are also refugees, the Syrian told me that he has a mother and a 75-year-old father who are still in territory dominated by the tyrant. His father refuses to leave the country, out of attachment to his nation and the life he built there, during all his seven and a half decades.

His father is retired, receiving around 330,000 SYP (\~$80 USD) per month in Syria's public pension program.

With such a low monthly income, the brothers decided to help their parents financially by sending money from Brazil, Germany and Turkey to Syria, but they ran into a serious problem.

**More than 40% is lost when sending money to Syria**

As he himself informed me, what happens in the **Syrian Pound** (SYP) exchange market is a manipulation originating from the Central Bank, influencing private banks, which trade the SYP/USD with a spread of about 40%.

I checked this information and this is exactly what happens when trying to send **dollar** (USD), which will be converted to **Syrian pound** (SYP) by remittance financial institutions.

Looking at the $1 quote on remittance platforms and banks operating outside Syria, we have a quote of \~$2,500 SYP.

While the $1 USD quote is at \~$4,200 SYP domestically.

If, for example, our Syrian friend sends **US $100.00** to his father, through conventional means authorized by the government of Bashar al-Assad, the father would receive about **250,000 SYP**.

But, if the destination received the same amount directly in dollars, by other **unconventional means** (and prohibited by the Central Bank of Syria), it would have the equivalent of about **420,000 SYP**.

**The difference of 170,000 SYP (\~40%) is lost in the “halfway”.**

**Where does that money go?**

You must have wondered where that money goes – I asked the same thing.

According to the personal account, the difference – or spread – is absorbed by the Central Bank to finance the government and the war against citizens. Unfortunately, this is another point that would be impossible to confirm, in the face of a totalitarian state with censorship of information, but it would be something very likely to happen in a country ruled by martial law, in extreme conditions under constant armed conflicts.

Furthermore, by making international remittances expensive, al-Assad manages to make it difficult for groups opposed to his government to finance, making it difficult to raise funds to arm defenders, enable refugees to flee, or feed the population that is totally dependent on government's “goodwill” to provide all the necessary resources for life.

For those who wonder why not send the dollar directly: still as reported, it is forbidden for any citizen to carry more than $100.00. It's a crime, punishable by imprisonment.

I was able to partially confirm this information through the official website of the United Kingdom, where they communicate the warning of “severe punishments for the use of the dollar in Syria”.

**Cryptocurrencies may offer a fairer alternative to money remittances**

As most of you know, in addition to being a writer, analyst and researcher at Cointimes, I am also a volunteer engaged in the **Nano** (XNO) community.

During our conversation, I asked the Syrian if he had ever considered using cryptocurrencies to send money to his family, thus avoiding massive losses of almost half of the amount sent, in addition to funding the aggressor government he fled from.

He himself had not considered this alternative and part of this is due to the lack of information about the possibility of using decentralized currencies for the purpose of international remittances. He also asked me about sending fees, which were high on **Bitcoin** (BTC) and conversion fees to local currency.

The bitcoin network is currently at historically very low fees, at around $1.50 USD per transaction, but in April 2021 we saw average fees in excess of $60.00 during a high demand for the industry-leading blockchain.

Even so, the average rates during this year would represent a value much lower than what is lost with the alleged corruption of the Central Bank when using conventional means, in addition to allowing a sovereign and peer-to-peer remittance.

I explained that there are other decentralized and secure currencies, with advantages and disadvantages in relation to bitcoin, that could be used for financial remittances, including explaining my work with **nano** and how I believe (personal opinion) that it is the most efficient way to send or receive money around the world – especially as it has no transaction fees and is confirmed in less than a second, reducing potential losses along the way.

In addition, I am searching in the nano community to understand if we can, in some way, help with the exchange or so that this money can be used directly there.

I found that Turkey is a very easy country to convert cryptocurrencies by **Turkish Lira** (TRY), with Binance being one of the main platforms in the country. Through TRY, it would be possible to convert to SYP in the sequence, avoiding the loss of remittances with USD, creating a kind of money corridor.

Binance currently charges around 0.1% for peer exchange, plus a 1.5% fee for TRY withdrawals and deposits. A total of 1.6% to 1.7% (in case of two exchanges: XNO → USDT → TRY). Much cheaper than the fees charged for traditional services.

This is just one more example of the importance of Bitcoin (BTC) and the entire ecosystem that its invention allowed to have been built in the last decade.

**For many of us, cryptos are just a tool for investment and financial speculation**, but for others they are a real and efficient way to transfer money without the need for intermediaries corrupted by central institutions of great strength, such as the Central Bank of a dictatorial government, which robs its citizens to supposedly finance weapons that will be used against the very victims of the theft.

It is further evidence that we need to work to encourage the adoption of these decentralized currencies, creating safe routes and alternatives for **the use of money**, which is nothing more than **a tool to optimize voluntary exchanges**.

Privacy cryptocurrencies, like Monero, could make a great case here as well. Maybe even more if trying to send money directly to Syria, and protecting all the parties involved in it.",cryptocurrency,1660080007
personalfinance,Capital One 360 checking and savings: can't add spouse as joint account owner,"Hope this post is acceptable here—I'm wondering if anyone else has any experience with this situation. My husband and I have joint bank accounts at a local bank, but we wanted to change to a national one with more ATMs and higher interest rates. So a few weeks ago, I opened Capital One 360 checking and savings accounts, intending to migrate our money to these. But I am finding it absolutely impossible to add my husband as a joint account holder on either of them. For context: we've had a Capital One credit card for a few years. For most of that time, I was the primary account owner and he was an authorized user, but a few weeks ago (basically at the same time I opened the checking/savings accounts), I moved him to account manager and we set up his online access. So now he has a Capital One account that he can log into online, with his phone number registered and everything, and it works fine. But when I send him the joint account holder invitation for the 360 checking and savings accounts, it won't recognize his phone number, even though all the info on the invitation (his name, SSN, and phone number) matches.

I've called Capital One at least five times about this problem, and they keep offering me different excuses. None of their representatives seem to have any idea how to fix this problem. The latest excuse is that his phone number is listed on his account, but from their end, it doesn't have a star next to it verifying it as a ""trusted source"" or something like that. Apparently this happens sometimes when the phone number has been added to an account relatively recently, especially when the phone bill is under someone else's name (we have the same phone plan and it's under my name, not his). So apparently there is nothing they can do about this except for wait until Capital One's magical hidden system decides that his number is a ""verified source,"" and they have no idea how to make that happen or how long it might take.

I am beyond frustrated at this point, and ready to just cancel these accounts and try with Ally or some other bank instead. We never had this issue listing him as a joint holder when we opened our local bank accounts, even though at that time he was a new immigrant to the US and didn't even have his green card or SSN yet. Has anyone else had difficulties adding a joint holder to their CO360 account? Any insight into Capital One's phone number system and how to get it to recognize his phone number as a ""trusted source?""",finance,1660080431

Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm where many clients (e.g., edge servers or mobile/IoT devices) collaboratively train a model while keeping the training data decentralized. It has shown huge potential in mitigating many of the systemic privacy risks, regulatory restrictions, and communication costs resulting from the traditional, over-the-cloud machine learning and data science approaches in healthcare, finance, smart cities, autonomous driving, and the Internet of things. It is undoubtedly a dark horse in the current artificial intelligence field. As it is the key technology for artificial intelligence modeling without centralizing scattered private data, it also has significant potential in the private data marketplace. Over the past two years, Internet companies such as Google, Facebook, and Nvidia have started to explore business opportunities for FL. In academia, there were as many as 10,000 papers published on FL in 2021, which is significantly more than many other AI directions. Its recent popularity has surpassed that of training massive models such as GPT-3.

Following this increasingly popular AI trend, one of the earliest institutions to study federated learning founded a startup, FedML, Inc. (https://fedml.ai), which began as an open source research project led by Professor Salman Avestimehr and his doctoral student Chaoyang He from University of Southern California (USC). Recently, FedML has transitioned from “behind the scenes” in academia to “on the stage” of industry and completed its first round of financing in March 2022, which totaled around $2M. Investors include top-tier venture capitals, such as Plug and Play, GGV Capital, MiraclePlus (Dr. Lu Qi, former SVP at Microsoft), AceCap, and individual investors from UC Berkeley and Stanford, specifically the “Shannon Award” winning professor David Tse., as well as from alumni of the University of Southern California, and others. Since the company’s establishment, FedML has won multiple commercial contracts in scenarios such as smart cities, medical care, and industrial IoT.

After just a few months of research and development, FedML has completed many industrial product upgrades. In addition to strengthening open source community maintenance and API upgrades, it also completed the building of FedML Open Platform — the world’s first open platform for federated and distributed machine learning under the public cloud and FedML App Ecosystem, a collaborative application ecosystem.

On the edge side, Open Platform ([https://open.fedml.ai](https://open.fedml.ai/)) can complete the training and deployment of edge models with one-line command and supports access to mobile phones and IoT devices. On the cloud side, Open Platform supports free global collaborative machine learning, including multinational, cross-city, and multi-tenant public cloud aggregation servers, as well as private cloud deployment with Docker mode. In terms of experimental management capabilities, the platform is specially tailored for distributed training, including capabilities of experiment tracking, management, visualization, and result analysis.

FedML’s newly released collaborative App Ecosystem is also highly integrated with the Open Platform. At its current stage, it supports the open collaboration of more than 20 applications, fully covering mainstream AI application scenarios such as computer vision, natural language processing, graph data mining, and the Internet of Things. If the open platform reduces the difficulty of actual building deployment of a federated learning system to the lowest level, then the App Ecosystem is used to lower the AI ​​application R&amp;D threshold for practitioners. A company need not hire high-cost machine learning teams; rather, they only need one engineer who can do “one-click import” based on community results and use the application directly without intensive development circles.

FedML is also making rapid progress in community operations. At present, the open source version has accumulated 1800+ Stars, 500+ Forks, 1100+ Slack users from different countries around the world, and its open platform has attracted over 500 professional users in a short period of time.

We will introduce in detail the products and technologies behind the company as well as the founding team of FedML at [https://medium.com/@FedML/fedml-ai-platform-releases-the-worlds-federated-learning-open-platform-on-public-cloud-with-an-8024e68a70b6](https://medium.com/@FedML/fedml-ai-platform-releases-the-worlds-federated-learning-open-platform-on-public-cloud-with-an-8024e68a70b6)",technology,1660093496

SALMAN AVESTIMEHR (LEFT) AND CHAOYANG HE’S NEW STARTUP PROMISES TO MAKE FEDERATED MACHINE LEARNING POSSIBLE ANYWHERE (PHOTO CREDIT: USC VITERBI)

For three years, [Salman Avestimehr](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Avestimehr/Salman), USC Viterbi Dean’s professor of electrical and computer engineering, and just-graduated PhD student [Chaoyang He](https://chaoyanghe.com/) have been conducting cutting-edge research into the nascent field of federated machine learning. Now, the two collaborators have leveraged that experience into a new startup that promises to empower communities to build and connect AI anywhere at any scale. [FedML](https://fedml.ai/), the Federated Learning/Analytics and Edge AI Platform just closed a (pre)seed fundraising of approximately $2 million. The startup is backed by Plug-and-Play, GGV Capital, Miracle Plus, Acequia Capital, and several other top-tier venture capital firms.

Federated learning, a field Avestimehr and He helped pioneer, is a solution to the data-sharing concern that the public and enterprise have (due to privacy, security, regulations, etc.) regarding the machine learning-powered technologies that modern society increasingly relies on. These technologies depend on huge, centralized data sets of sometimes sensitive information to make decisions on, say, patient health. This type of confidential information is susceptible to security breaches, making everyday people distrustful of the technology.

Fortunately, federated learning allows AI technologies to use these personal datasets without centralizing or transferring the data. It enables machine learning from decentralized data at various nodes without concentrating any data in the cloud (i.e., “learning without sharing”), which provides maximum user privacy, complies with regulations, and reduces development costs.

But FedML takes that revolutionary approach significantly further. “Our new platform brings zero-code, lightweight, cross-platform, and provably secure federated learning out of the lab and into the hands of businesses everywhere,” said Avestimehr. The company’s technology provides users with the tools necessary to simplify decentralized machine learning and easily apply it to their data, whether in finance, healthcare, insurance, or more. “Our technology allows anyone to transform their data into secure and trusted intelligence with minimum effort,” Avestimehr adds.

“FedML goes beyond federated machine learning. We view *federated* as a broad concept that connects all AI Elements, including data, models, training methods, and computing resources. Thus, FedML also stands for Foundational Ecosystem Design for ML,” said He. “Our mission is to build a community building and sharing AI anywhere at any scale. Essentially, we are willing to be the connector of AI productivity, a collaborative AI marketplace that *connects* developers, AI enterprise, and data infrastructure in a social, secure, and scalable manner.”

To date, FedML has more than 1000 users worldwide and has already been adopted by several industrial and academic institutions. A video introduction of the FedML platform [can be seen here](https://fedml.ai/platform-tutorial/).",technology,1660093948

Many banks won’t approve an auto loan for a vehicle that is more than 20 years old. My other option is taking out a small personal loan although I know the interest is higher for personal loans. 

I know I could get a different vehicle that is slightly less old. My range for a vehicle is capped at $8,000. I can put down around $1700 - $2000. Jeep cherokees tend to be less expensive than other 4x4 vehicles of it’s age yet have the same reliability - that’s my reasoning. It will also be a hobby car that I can work on and customize.

The agreement is 398 for 72 months at 4% interest.

Or should I pay out the loan to its fullest (or until I want a new car) while investing the money that I would put down as extra payment? Investing whether it be through a Roth or my personal investment account.

personalfinance,Buying a house vs destroying student loans? Would this be irresponsible?,"Hello all, apologies in advance if this is a stupid question. I will try to only share pertinent information and not overshare.
My wife and I are potentially looking at purchasing a house. We live in southern Oregon that has faced a rather significant housing shortage. Like most places, prices have been insane, but now prices have started correcting and houses have been on the market for a few weeks before selling. We will most likely be here for another 4-5 years. Initially we were just going to rent for the entirety (our rent is ""cheap"" at $1340+utilities), but in light of recent changes, we are trying to figure out the financially smart option and catch interest rates before they rise. We are both healthcare workers making ~$260K. My wife's loans are taken care of, but I still hold a sizable $106K (I paid a good amount down during the forbearance, and I screwed myself out of PSLF and ultimately wouldn't save a ton). At present, I have just been chucking about 90% of my paychecks at my loans and we have just been living off of my wife's pay. At this rate, I could be done by Dec 2023, so we could afford a higher mortgage. So would it be smart to potentially build equity in a house at these lower interest rates and just pay off loans slower? I would love to have them just gone, but apart from paying less interest over time, there is only the benefit of peace of mind and investing. But at the same time, since we would most likely only stay for 4-5 years, would this be unadvisable in this market? A number of realtors and investors here aren't anticipating a significant price drop housing recession given the long standing housing shortage.
Again sorry if this is insufficient information or way too convoluted, we are just trying to make the smart long-term decision.",finance,1660104595

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I have about 135k sitting in my savings account. Bought a car in Feb'20 with \~7k left to pay. Student loans of \~33K (all federal). No credit card debt. 

The rational side of my brain tells me to 1) pay off all or a portion of the car note and student loans (note, I aggressively paid off \~25K of SL in FY20 but stopped once the rumblings about debt forgiveness arose...not holding my breath at this point) and 2) invest my money. 

The irrational side of my brain tells me to leave that money alone. I've always been a very risk averse person, but I recognize that this is extreme. I think one cause is that much of this money was saved up in the last 2ish years (making more than 2x what I did pre-pandemic and living expenses have dropped since I moved out of NYC). So I'm not used to having this much money, and I don't come from the most financially stable background (immigrant family; parents did the best they could). 

The kicker is that I work in finance and consider myself to be somewhat financially literate...and yet here I am. I'm addicted to seeing that savings balance go up each month, and I have a serious scarcity mentality. 

Last thing I'll add it that my job pays well and has high earning potential BUT I am coming to the realization I cannot sustain it much longer as the hours / intensity have seriously affected my health. So that creates some uncertainty for me, but I don't think I'd leave without something else lined up (and obviously as we enter a recession, I am grateful to just have a job).",finance,1660112021

Because the shot didn't work, they then gave an estimate which included xrays, urinalysis, medications, etc, that added up to around $1000. We turned to apple cider vinegar as a home remedy, and feeding him it seemed to help him, as he started peeing more. 

He has a really strong negative reaction to being fed it, so after we noticed he seemed better (around 4 days - 1 week of feeding), we stopped. And now, a couple of days after we stopped, his UTI has returned.

Forex,How will USD react to today's inflation data?,"All eyes are on today’s US CPI data which could have significant effects on near-term direction across financial markets. 

The Federal Reserve has opted for more flexibility in their hiking cycle, as future interest rate decisions will now be based on incoming economic data. While analysts are forecasting a softer headline print thanks to the pullback in commodities, core CPI, the Fed’s preferred measure, is expected to come in higher once again. 

Despite falling from its highs, the US Dollar Index has held a steady uptrend since May 2021, finding support around its 50-day EMA. However, DXY has recently failed to overcome selling pressure near 107, and its ability to break this resistance may depend on the market’s reaction to today’s CPI figures.

Another hot print would probably boost bets on sustained aggression from the central bank, and could support the Dollar towards new highs. Meanwhile, a soft print signaling a peak in inflation may reignite speculation on the Fed pivoting sooner rather than later, potentially putting DXY at risk of retesting a break below its 50-day line.

cybersecurity,CYBERCRIME: Twitter worker spied for Saudi rulers,"[**AFP**](https://www.afp.com/) has reported that a jury sitting at a federal court in San Francisco has found a former employee of Twitter guilty of spying for the Saudi-Arabia´s ruling family.  
Ahmad Abouammo´s defence team led by attorney Angela Chuang tried unsuccessfully to argue that he nothing more than accept high value gifts and cash from ""free-spending Saudi´s"" for simply doing his job as a client manager.  


&gt;*US prosecutor Colin Sampson said in his summing up that ""the evidence shows that, for a price and thinking no one was watching, the defendant sold his position to an insider of the crown prince""*

The prosecution accused Abouammo working with another Ali Alzabarah of being enlisted by Saudi officials between late 2014 and early the following year to get private information on accounts firing off posts critical of the regime. They used their position within the social media giant to steal email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and other private data to identify people behind various ""anonymous"" accounts.  
The jury deliberated for three days before finding Abouammo guilty on 6 of the 11 charges against him.  
Abouammo was bailed after the verdict was delivered to the court pending sentencing, despite concerns expressed by prosecutors that he might try to flee the country. His co-accused Alzabarah, a Saudi national, is being sought on a charge of failing to register in the United States as an agent of a foreign government as required by United States law according to the FBI.",technology,1660130408

 The July consumer-price index to be released on Wednesday may determine whether the recent rally for stocks and crypto can be sustained, as traders look for any signs of slowing inflation.

The market is expecting at least some cooling in inflation. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal forecast that the headline consumer-price index in July to fall from a four-decade high of 9.1% to 8.7% year over year, while the core CPI number will increase from 5.9% to 6.1%. 

Should the headline CPI match expectations, or fall below them, “the most likely case is we would have a slight rally,” Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Management, said in an interview. “It would definitely be good for risk.”

Still, the market might trade off “regardless” of the CPI, Hatfield said. He thinks expectations for the Fed to become more dovish about its pace of rate hikes may be too optimistic. Seasonality also plays a role, as the stock market tends to trade off in late August, September and early October, Hatfield noted.",cryptocurrency,1660133714

CryptoCurrency,"US-Inflation comes in at 8.5%, finally below estimates. Here is why that's really good for Crypto.","Just now, US CPI has offically been released and comes in at 8.5%. That's a good margin below the estimates of 8.7% and massively below last month's CPI of 9.1%. Markets will now probably start to rally. And that lower inflation was crucial for Crypto to continue its rally and expand it further on.

Also in my yesterday's post about inflation numbers I layed out the scenario of a lower than 8.7% inflation and that will mostly happen now. 

It has especially been important as the FED will have no arguement at all now to do a 100bps hike and weay be looking at a 50bps hike next month that could make markets pump even more as the FED is looking to pivot now. Who knows whether inflation has peaked now bit the US government will definitely make it market like that as we are going into Midterm elections. Crypto will have less moving forward from the FED and a reversal, at least for now, is actually possible.",cryptocurrency,1660135347

CryptoCurrency,In which use cases is it smart to apply Machine Learning &amp; Distributed Ledger Tech together?,"I read 10 studies about Machine Learning (ML) and Distributed-Ledger Technology (DLT) to identify use cases in the Industry 4.0 (I4.0), so you don't have to. And I will give you hints on how to profit from this.

**TL;DR**  
Core use cases in which DLT and ML are connected: The formation of intelligent intermediary-free platforms that democratize resources for ML services by making data private and trustworthy. Middlemen and central control entities become obsolete because the platform follows its own logic, which is achieved via technological components. The core aspect is distributed ledger technology acts as a provider of trusted data for complex networks and machine learning applications, while machine learning as the controlling brain of such platforms manages transactions and governance, as well as unleashes within applications the added value of services such as predictive maintenance, condition monitoring and others.

Search for projects which have industry partnerships and already build similar use cases as pilots or active products with them. ML &amp; DLT are aspiring applications sectors for the industry. Identifying cryptos associated to this matter early gives you a head start.

I know about IOTA, Vechain, [Fetch.ai](https://Fetch.ai), which do have similar use cases built or aspire to build in the future. Please list other projects I didn't list here in the comments.

**Application scenarios - Definition**

Self-organizing adaptive logistics (SAL) describes: ""The increase of flexibility and reaction speed of industrial and logistic systems in increasingly volatile and changeable production environments."" The goal is to coordinate in-plant and out-of-plant logistics to allocate resources to an order. The SAL consists of an order system that uses ML to dynamically allocate production orders. Dynamic in the sense that it reacts situationally to system failures and customer requirements. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles regulate logistics on the store floor by being networked with the warehouse and with each other as well as with the order system and by constantly exchanging information. 

Value-based services (VBS) is defined by the BMWi as follows: ""Process and status data from production and product use as raw material for the business models and services of the future"". At its core are industrial platforms that enable data collection, data analysis and data provision for user-specific purposes and, based on the findings, offer demand-relevant services to optimize production in this respect.

The BMWi sees Transparency and adaptability of delivered products (TWP), as ""Automatic collection usage-related data on delivered products for the optimization of business processes, for new business models and for the dynamic adaptation of product features."" Products that have already been delivered give the manufacturer the opportunity during the product life cycle to collect data and derive findings on the basis of which to modify and to modify and update the product on this basis. The challenge here is ensuring security in the entire infrastructure required for this

**Findings - Where DLT &amp; ML make sense**  
A common picture emerges from the separate consideration of the technologies in relation to I4.0 application scenarios. It becomes apparent that the two technologies overlap in the SAL, VBS and TWP application scenarios. In the following, the technologies are compared in the most relevant application scenarios in order to highlight synergies, and a concrete application example is then explained in order to present examples of common potential. 

In relation to SAL, DLT is mainly used as a documentation basis for orders, offers and transactions. Manipulation security and immutability of data create trust between different companies. A central ML control system mediates optimally matching orders to each other. The ML system solves the task of combinatorics and mediates the optimal requests &amp; bids. Transaction processes and control processes are automated via smart contracts. 

In relation to VBS and TWP, it becomes apparent that ML is the basis of the services. For example, in terms of industrial analysis through data mining. ML is the actual service for predictive maintenance, predictive quality and condition monitoring. DLT, on the other hand, is also the documentation and access medium here. It makes the used data flow of the services transparent, records for example operating conditions, users, time as well as used data. Proof-of-ownership via DLT enables access to the services in the first place and handles license management. In addition, it can contribute to automated triggering of predictive maintenance and by the likes of a SC executing at calculated threshold values. 

Looking at the characteristics of the technologies, it is noticeable that DLT in the area of SAL, VBS and TWP is attributed trust, privacy, data integrity and behavioral integrity. Trust is generated by being able to have confidence in the network and its participants without knowing them through cryptographic techniques, transparency of transactions, and equality of participants. Similarly, privacy makes it possible to participate in the network without revealing personal information. This is made possible by a combination of cryptographic techniques and a P2P network. The data integrity property exists because the network hosts data that is complete, accurate, and consistent because there is a consensus regarding transactions. And finally, behavioral integrity expresses that the participants are acting within the given capabilities and rules of the protocol. 

Regarding ML, the properties of inference and reaction are attributed. Specifically, the property of inference means that data is used as a basis for predictions and to support decision making in order to derive actions. The reaction property means that through direct interaction with the environment, the consequences of actions are understood, which enables optimization of systems in relation to a specific to a specific goal. All in all, the joint potential arises to create an overall system that is both infrastructure, as well as uniting unknown participants with each other and acting acts in an artificially intelligent manner. The latter in particular is conceivable if machine learning applications can run automatically on smart contracts. Thus, the previous relationships would be replaced by complex logic and increase the benefits of DLT. In this sense, ML can help complement and improve DLT. On the other hand, DLT can provide a trustworthy database to enrich ML models. In this sense, DLT improves ML.

**TL;DR**  
Core use cases in which DLT and ML are connected: The formation of intelligent intermediary-free platforms that democratize resources for ML services by making data private and trustworthy.

**Methodology**

The literature used for the assessment consists of a total of ten sources, which are  distributed equally among the technologies. Important for the selection of the sources was the application of the technologies. The literature should relate to application scenarios and examples of Industrie 4.0 applications. Therefore, the evaluation criteria used were the application scenarios of the Industrie 4.0 platform of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). In addition, it was important that one survey per technology in each case the current state of use of the technologies for each technology. This results in a mix of practice-relevant research reports and surveys on the current and planned use of the technologies in the Industrie 4.0 environment, which address potentials in the respective application scenarios.

I have a sneaking feeling all these people are the ones who took some losses but didn't get completely owned by the market yet. They want to feel the good times will continue. They fail to realize the economy has been dead for 2 years now. The only reason we made it was FED expanding it's balance sheet by  gargantuan levels. Think about this, you and I were given literally FREE money during the pandemic. Retail participation in 2021 was higher than the cumulative 12 years before it. That's insane.

‘Across 352 spikes of inflation &gt;7% in the world bank data, price stability was fully restored just 1.4% of the time’  [https://www.macrodesiac.com/zoltan-says-the-quiet-part-out-loud/](https://www.macrodesiac.com/zoltan-says-the-quiet-part-out-loud/) . Keep in mind we're still at 8.6% inflation. Maybe inflation will come down, maybe it won't. But rest assured, FED won't start cutting till it's too late. And it takes time, it's not going to get under 2% this year. It's not going to be a touch and go recession either. Companies have contagion. There's too much debt laying around that simply cannot be processed at such high interest rates. Maybe FED will not raise. But if they don't cut in the next 6 months, many companies will go bankrupt simply at these interest levels. Credit card debt is rising really fast. I mean the 'second highest increase on record' fast. [https://capital.com/blockbuster-us-jobs-report-hides-consumer-weakness](https://capital.com/blockbuster-us-jobs-report-hides-consumer-weakness) The consumers are what took us out of the recession last time. This time there are no free checks coming and they are already choking. I guess the key point is, it's not about increasing or decreasing rates. It's about how much time will rates be at these levels. The longer the time , the tighter the hold of recession around the economy. Are you more likely to mortgage a house or buy credit card debt if the rate of servicing is this high? We needed $4T to get us going during covid, but now the trap is set completely. Not the mention, a pumping stock market is bad for inflation too.

I do admit I'm a bear here.  But I'm not an open one at all. I'm actually worried sharing this post here. Noone wants to hear this, or the fact that we're heading into a recession.

CryptoCurrency,Change My View (CMV): Crypto pumping off the CPI data highlights several issues with the asset class,"As to not make this one of those ""wall of text"" posts here are the main 7 issues:

1. The narrative of the assets class as an inflation hedge again is put into question. It dumps with high inflation and pumps when low 
2. The reaction solidifies crypto as the ""shadow"" of traditional equities markets. It follows what the NASDAQ says 
3. The asset class is not only the shadow of traditional markets but in particular the USA. Crypto is not decentralised but an ""American brand"" 
4. As an ""American brand"" the asset class is therefore subject to regulatory policy in the US. Crypto will act in accordance with the FEDs wants 
5. If the actions of the FED determine the stability of the asset class. Then the asset class isn't decentralised or internationally dependent. It is an extension of American hegemony and thus the US financial system.  It will act in a way that extends or solidifies the system rather than subvert it 
6. In line with (2) it can be stated that the asset class is a function of Capital flows in traditional markets not utilisation or adoption 
7. In line with (2/6) It  an be stated that the asset class is not a currency, commodity or ""alternative asset class"" but  predominantly unregulated equities that act as a ""casino"" for traditional capital. Higher risk for higher returns",cryptocurrency,1660141741

personalfinance,"Refinance, taking advantage of huge equity to create a short term rental?","\*Throwaway account due to financial information\*

I'm looking for people to offer advice and/or shoot holes in my plan before I pull the lever on it.

My partner and I have been very lucky with our real estate purchases and are now in an area of upstate New York on a piece of property valued at over a million dollars (latest Zestimate not an actual appraisal is around 1.2M.) Its more property than we need for our small family and we would like to take advantage of the equity we have in the home by either selling and downsizing or refinancing with a HELOC or Cash-out Refi and buying something smaller outright. We've got around 700-900k in equity depending on the appraisal.

The current plan is to refinance and use around $500k to purchase a new home outright for us to move into, and to spend around $50-70k in improvements to our larger home before listing it as a short term rental. Interest rates are crazy right now and I wish we would have done this about 6 months ago, but it is what it is. 

I've done some research on the short term rental market in my area, as we are a popular tourist destination for families coming up from New York City. The home is a large 4 bed/3bath home but the real selling features are the in-ground saltwater pool, hot tub, tennis court, our own pond, and forest with hiking trails. I'm using AirDNA which gives data such as occupancy rates, average daily revenue, etc. and is all filterable based on set criteria like size of the rental. From that site's data I would expect to see an occupancy rate of above 60% and the average daily rate of $700. I expect the ADR will actually be much higher as there is not many homes in our area with the amenities that we offer and the few that come close have ADR's closer to $1k. All that would put gross revenue at above $150k. As we are new, we would likely hire a property manager for the first couple of years to get us up and running which would cost around 25% which would bring us down to $115k. That would be more than enough to cover the additional mortgage expense of the refinance as well as bring in some nice almost passive income.

My biggest fear would be the housing market crashing and us going underwater on the mortgage, but unless the short-term rental market also dries up that wouldn't necessarily be an issue. What other giant red flags do you see here?",finance,1660142681

Economics,Investors shun Pakistani bonds over rising default threat,"Investors are on alert for Pakistan to follow Sri Lanka into default as the south Asian country struggles with soaring commodity prices and tighter credit conditions. Pakistan’s foreign bonds due to mature in 2024, 2025 and 2026 are trading firmly in distressed territory, at about 71, 65 and 63 cents on the dollar, respectively, according to Bloomberg data. The country’s debt has been among the worst performing this year of any issued by emerging market countries, signalling investors’ concerns over the pressures weighing on the developing economy. 

The surge in global energy and food prices since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February has fed inflation and caused Pakistan’s trade deficit to widen, draining its reserves. With its foreign exchange reserves dwindling to about $9bn, enough to last another two months, a liquidity crisis is looming. “Going into the Ukraine crisis, Pakistan wasn’t in a good place to start with,” said Gareth Leather, senior economist at Capital Economics. “The explosion in commodity prices has led to a rapid deterioration in its current account and rising government spending.” The discount on the country’s bonds remains smaller than for other emerging markets. This is because of expectations that an IMF bailout coupled with bilateral financing support may help Pakistan avert a default this year.",finance,1660143812

personalfinance,[NJ] Planning for 2022 Estimated Taxes - Need Help Unraveling this Knot,"Good morning! I've been trying to figure out the right course of action for a tax situation we're about to be in and all the research I've done and calls to the NJ Bureau of Taxation has just seemed to confuse things further. There's a confluence events all coming together that is really just making everything complicated.  


Nothing's gone wrong ""yet,"" but it's basically a swirl of LLC pass-through estimated taxes, new jobs, moving out of the US, and, oh yeah, getting married. Sorry for the length of this, but there's just so many things that could impact A) Do we need to pay estimated taxes now to avoid penalties later and B) How much do we need to pay.

\#1. My fiance started two small single-member LLCs this year and made a small amount of income from each. (Pass-through taxation, so it goes to personal income tax). He doesn't have any W-2 or other income.  
\#2. Because of the LLCs and no W-2 to just increase withholding on, we knew we would potentially need to make quarterly estimated tax payments.  
\#3. For US Federal Taxes, my fiance did not make enough in 2021 to have to file an income tax return, and was a US Citizen for all 12 months of 2021, so as far as we can tell he passed the test on [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes) to not have to pay Federal Quarterly Estimated Taxes for 2022 and thus we haven't.  
\#4. For New Jersey Quarterly Estimated Taxes, the test is different; he doesn't have to pay estimated taxes if he estimates he will owe less than $400 taxes by the end of the year. Based on our projections before now, we had thought he would owe maybe half that form his LLCs. As a result he didn't pay any NJ estimated taxes, and according to NJ Bureau of Taxation we do not need to include any ""self-employment"" tax in determining if we will owe more than $400.  


Here's where it starts to get exciting.

\#5. My fiance actually managed to parlay some of his freelance work into a full time, salaried gig at a much higher pay rate, and will be starting that work next month.  
\#6. The new job is based outside the US and requires him to be on-site, so we are moving out of the US completely for his new job and will be living in the country where his new work is located.  
\#7. As best I can tell, starting next tax year once he's been out of the US for 12 months, he won't need to pay US Federal or State taxes on the income from the new job as it will all be foreign-sourced income.  
\#8. His LLCs are both incorporated in New Jersey as well, and he'd like to continue them as side gigs as well, keeping the US-based bank accounts he uses to keep their finances separate.  


Now the question is, will he owe NJ taxes on the ""worldwide income"" he will earn in 2022 from the new foreign job? He's lived and had his primary residence in NJ up to this point, so the concern is the new foreign salary earned for the remainder of 2022 will be NJ-taxable. If that's the case, he will anticipate owing more than $400 in NJ taxes by the end of 2022 and will need to pay a quarterly estimated tax by the next deadline in September.  


Complicating this further, we are planning to have a quickie wedding in the US before we move over, and would likely now be filing our 2022 taxes jointly. How will that impact any estimated taxes he would owe? My salaried W-2 job pays fairly well, and can be done remotely once we move, so we anticipate having an AGI greater than $150,000.   


We originally thought we'd just take the safe option and pay estimated taxes assuming his new foreign job salary would be NJ-taxable. Worst case scenario he would get a refund if it means he over-payed at tax time. However, now that we will likely be married-filing-jointly, we're concerned how my high salary will impact his tax burdens and the amount we would need to pay in estimated taxes to avoid any penalties.

personalfinance,"Is it worth paying off my debt early? And if so, from what source?","I currently have an outstanding personal loan with:

* Original balance: $35,000
* Current balance: $24,000
* Interest rate: 7.86%
* Minimum payment: $1,100
* Currently paying: $1,500
* Maturity: November 2024 (36 month term)
* Expected Maturity (due to overpayments): February 2024 (18 months from today)

My options and sources of repayment would either be:

* Emptying my investment account: Currently valued at $22,000, 100% VTI
   * If I empty this, I'd just immediately convert the monthly $1,500 I'm currently paying into the loan into monthly investments into VTI. It would take me about 14 months to get back to my current balance.
* Converting some of my company granted stock to cash, and using that
   * Caveat: I work at a tech company, so our stock got battered pretty hard this year but is definitely expected to rise in the future, so I'd be sacrificing those gains
* Waiting until the end of the year for my performance bonus
* Continuing to pay $1,500/mo
* Drop down to the minimum payment of $1,100

So the ultimate question is - should I pay it off now, using some of my investment money? Wait for my (cash) bonus to pay it off at the end of the year? Stay the course at $1,500? Drop my payments down to the minimum?

How does inflation factor into all of this? CPI is higher than my interest rate - given that, would it make sense to ""hold onto"" this debt and instead invest anything extra now?

personalfinance,Treasury Bills vs HYSA Historically?,"Hi personalfinance. 

I'm looking for opinions on Treasury Bills vs HYSAs. 

Historically speaking, how closely do something like 4-week Treasury Bills yield better than a good HYSA? 

4-week T-Bills are back about 2% (last auction was 2.14%) \[[historical graph from yGraph](https://ycharts.com/indicators/4_week_treasury_bill_rate)\] One can ladder 4-week T-bills easily through [TreasuryDirect.gov](https://TreasuryDirect.gov) with auto-reinvestments, so a quarter of the total investment is always less than a week away from maturity. So liquidity isn't too much of a worry. Plus, T-Bills have a limit of $10 million per household, not $10k per SSN like I-bonds.

[Bankrate.com](https://Bankrate.com) is showing HYSAs just now hitting 2% (only one bank is listed at or higher as of the afternoon of 10 August '22). Even 1 month CDs have only just crossed the 2% mark. I've been with Ally Bank for a while. They have been regularly raising rates recently, but only just to 1.6% most recently. Is there a good place to find historical data for HYSAs? A quick search yielded [this](https://www.finder.com/history-of-savings-account-interest-rates) which looks like the market average interest rates (not HYSAs specifically) and only since 2010. 

I'm wondering how long it will remain the case that 4-week T-Bills might outperform HYSAs? I can't find sufficient information to see how that has played out historically. Would rolling savings in short term T-bills be slightly better performing than an HYSA? Or would it be easier to just chase whichever online bank is posting the highest rate, if the funds to be saved don't exceed the FDIC limit?

Prior ](https://www.mondaq.com/Home/Redirect/2804510?mode=author&amp;article_id=1220156),  Winston &amp; Strawn LLP                                              

The recent cessation of operations by some cryptocurrency exchange companies has led the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) to increase its scrutiny of bank/digital asset partnerships, particularly of how those partnerships are marketed and the extent of federal deposit insurance coverage. As a result, on July 29, 2022, the FDIC issued an advisory (the Advisory) regarding the applicability of deposit insurance for bank accounts linked to ""crypto companies."" The [Advisory](https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2022/fil22035b.pdf) was issued one day after the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board accused Voyager Digital (Voyager), a cryptocurrency exchange company, of misleading consumers about its federal deposit insurance arrangements.

### WHY THIS MATTERS

* Historically, the FDIC has not taken an active role in regulating the digital asset space.
* The recent market volatility resulting from the insolvency of digital asset businesses has led the FDIC, along with other prudential regulators, to increase scrutiny of bank partnerships with digital asset companies.
* Digital asset companies and their partners should ensure that customers are clearly informed of the limitations of FDIC deposit insurance.
* Failure to clearly inform customers can result in the FDIC or other federal bank regulators taking an enforcement action.

### The Context

In July 2022, Voyager filed for bankruptcy, leading several customers to question what would happen to their non-cryptocurrency deposits held with the company. On July 28, 2022, the FDIC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (collectively, the Agencies) issued a cease and desist letter to Voyager requesting it stop making ""false or misleading statements"" that allegedly confused consumers about whether their funds or the company itself were protected by the FDIC. The Agencies alleged that Voyager made various misrepresentations to its customers online, suggesting that: (i) Voyager's accounts are FDIC-insured; (ii) customers who invested with the Voyager cryptocurrency platform would receive FDIC insurance coverage for funds provided to, held by, on, or with Voyager, and (iii) the FDIC would insure customers against the failure of Voyager itself.

The FDIC stated that Voyager, in making these alleged misrepresentations, violated the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1933, as amended, which prohibits anyone from implying that deposits are insured when they are not. The alleged misrepresentations, the FDIC claimed, had the potential to be particularly confusing for customers because Voyager maintains one or more deposit accounts at Metropolitan Commercial Bank (MCB), an FDIC-insured depository institution, for the benefit of persons who make U.S. dollar deposits in their Voyager accounts. Consequently, the FDIC clarified that while MCB is FDIC-insured, Voyager is not. As such, customers of the Voyager cryptocurrency platform do not receive FDIC insurance coverage for all funds provided to, held by, on, or with Voyager. Most importantly, the FDIC does not insure customers against the failure of Voyager itself. The agencies demanded that Voyager remove any statements suggesting anything to the contrary.

### The FDIC Advisory

One day later, on July 29, 2022, the FDIC published the Advisory to address misconceptions about the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage. The FDIC expressed its concern regarding the risks of consumer confusion or harm arising from crypto assets offered by, through, or in connection with insured depository institutions. In particular, the FDIC expressed concern regarding confusion by non-bank customers who might ""mistakenly believe they are protected against any type of loss"" or might ""not understand the role of the bank as it relates to the activities of the non-bank, or the speculative nature of certain crypto assets as compared to deposit products.""

The FDIC contemporaneously published a [Fact Sheet](https://www.fdic.gov/news/fact-sheets/crypto-fact-sheet-7-28-22.pdf) in further effort to address misrepresentations about FDIC deposit insurance by some ""crypto companies."" The Fact Sheet makes clear that the FDIC *only* insures deposits held at insured banks and savings associations and—most relevantly—*only in the unlikely event of an insured bank's failure*. The FDIC does not insure digital assets issued by non-bank entities, such as crypto companies. Specifically, FDIC insurance does not protect against the default, insolvency, or bankruptcy of any non-bank entity, including crypto custodians, exchanges, brokers, wallet providers, and neobanks. As a result, it is more technically accurate to say that a cryptocurrency exchange holds its money at a U.S., FDIC-insured bank, rather than representing that the cryptocurrency exchange is insured by the FDIC.

The Ofac has decided to sanction code and speech and knows it will take years to play out in court. Now every dev team in the world has to live in fear if it does not institute on chain full KYC aml for all defi protocols.

I tried to tell people for the last two years that the end game of the government was to force narcware at the software level, I begged people on reddit to take the Fatf revision drafts in 2019 and 2020 serious, that the drafts were openly stating that they want narcware on wallets and they want all wallets fully doxxed and declared, they want an gap in chain history to be criminal. 

I am not paranoid. I understand the law. The lawyers to Ledger and Trezor understand the law. Coincenter understands the law. **Reddit does not understand the law.**

The point of shutting down Bitmex to US customers was to create precedent for the Banking secrecy act applied to US citizens involved in crypto and precedent for extraditing foreigner non US citizens. This shows deliberate premeditation by the Department of Justice, State Department, and Treasury to force US aml/kyc laws and SEC/CFTC licensing regimes through violence against non US citizens. Their long goal was to violently intimidate other countries into complying with our laws. 

We are already looking at every american being a felon because 6050i revision was passed in September 2021 and will come to term in January 2024, where it will go into effect as enforceable. The government is openly long conning us to enforce global KYC on Defi, and software wallets, and eventually hardware wallets. They know they're violating the 4th and 1st amendment and they intend to get away with it through terrorism using Ofac.

They have long had a desire to destroy end to end encryption, this is an open plan Bill Barr had, they want golden keys to all encryption, they do not want permissionless systems to exist, and yes they can sanction the repository of monero code, and begin enforcing these strict liability 30 year prison sentences onto anyone who uses monero and gets caught. 

You people are not using your brains. The only way to convince Federal prosecutors that a protocol can comply with US sanction and aml laws is to enforce KYC and licensing systems, this is crony gangster capitalism to benefit Terrence Duffy, SBF, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and american Web 2 Tech companies, and US private equity by using \*Terrorism\* to put their permissionless competitors out of business, and enforcing the KYC necessary to enforce the licensing system! and they're taking your privacy!

personalfinance,Better to Dispute or just pay a bogus $207 bill sent to collections?,"Summary - I was incorrectly sent to collections for $207.  What is better for my credit score, dispute it or just pay it?  


8 months ago, I ordered, then cancelled, a Verizon SIM card.   The support person who cancelled it for me (or so I thought) said I was all set.  The tracking number that I had been sent for the FedEx package shows the package was halted.  No more emails, no bills.  2 months ago I am denied for a credit card, and upon checking my credit report, see that I have 207$ unpaid bill in collections, from Verizon.  I'm stuck in limbo - Verizon Support can tell me the order was canceled and that it was weird that I was billed, but can't undo it because it's already been sent to collections.    The collection agency doesn't care that the order was cancelled and the SIM cards weren't shipped.  
I have spent hours on the phone getting transferred from dept to dept and hearing various stories about what is or isn't possible, whether it's Verizon or Convergent (collection agency) that needs to fix this, I would like to just be done with this.  But from what I've read, it seems like even if I just pay the $207, I will still have a ding on my credit score for 7 years.  If I were to somehow successfully dispute this, would that be better or equally bad for my score?  at this point I don't care about the $207, I just don't want to ruin my credit.",finance,1660180675

personalfinance,Looking for advice regarding student loans and saving for a home,"Hello all,

Here is my current situation. Sorry for the very long post and thanks for reading...

# Income

I am a paramedic and make $69K base annually (does not include mandatory overtime, extra shifts, etc.), and am projected to get a raise to $75K base in the upcoming months. My wife is in paramedic school for the next two years and only working per diem right now as paramedic school is very challenging and I want her to focus on her studies (she only brings in about $400/mo). She is expected to graduate Spring 2024 and hopefully have a similar salary to mine. However, my wife has several health issues that have sometimes made it hard for her to maintain full-time employment, and I do not want to rely on her income.

# Goal

Our goal is to purchase a home sometime in the nearish future. I understand that in today's economy, this goal seems impossible and may take many years unfortunately. We are located in the Austin, TX, area, and the cheapest starter homes in our area start at around $300K currently.

# Debt

Currently, we have $27K in student loan debt, and I am still working on my bachelor's degree, which should cost approx. $6K more. We have no other debt. Both cars paid off and we pay our credit cards in full every month. All student loans are federal and I would be eligible for PSLF. Both of us have credit scores &gt; 740.

# Savings / Budget

We currently have about $27K cash in savings. It has been very hard for us to save money over the past couple of years as our rent and cost of living has nearly doubled since the pandemic. A lot of our savings have come from small windfalls vs. from our paychecks. Naturally, our wages have not increased enough to match the insane cost of living. Our combined net take-home pay is around $4k/mo base. Roughly half of it goes to rent and utilities, usually a large chunk is also spent on my wife's medical bills (she has several medical conditions that require frequent specialist visits, ER visits, and other procedures/medications), and the other part of it to food, groceries, and household goods. We are usually left with nothing to save at the end of the month now (rent has doubled in two years and we haven't found anything cheaper within a reasonable commuting distance).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, we are looking for some advice on a path going forward. I currently have 4 classes left to complete my B.S. in Health Science, but unfortunately, it will not result in any additional benefit for me in my current career (my employer does not offer raises or incentives for having a degree). I regret starting this program but I feel like I am so close that it would be dumb to not finish my degree. At the same time, I could be spending all that extra time and effort working overtime and trying to save money and supporting us while my wife is in school. I cannot do school and work extra shifts at the same time. I have tried and it is too overwhelming attempting to work 96 hours/week and take classes.

# Questions

1. Do I quit or delay school and focus on working extra to try and increase income? Or, do I finish school and wait until the wife starts working to try and save for a down payment? We are worried that with the way home prices doubled and interest rates tripled in two years, that two more years from now, home ownership will be completely unobtainable. We are also tired of renting.
2. If I don't quit school, do I take out more student loans to help fund the rest of my and the wife's tuition and living expenses or just pull from existing savings?
3. Should we focus on paying off student loans quicker to lower our debt-to-income ratio or continue attempting to save money for a down payment? We have $27K debt and also $27K savings, so obviously it's tempting sometimes to just wipe it all out, but then we would have nothing.
4. How much should we attempt to save or is necessary to purchase a home? Two years ago, the same homes we are looking at now were $150-200K at 2% interest and now they're $300-400K at 6% interest. My average yearly cost of living raise of 3% is obviously not cutting it but there isn't anything I can do about that as paramedic pay is terrible pretty much everywhere and we used to be considered well paid for the region.

personalfinance,My wife is pregnant and the due date is right around the time we're going to start looking for a house (Apr-23) -- need help on mortgage strategy!,"Hey all -- so my wife and I were married a few weeks ago. Tonight, we found out she's pregnant! It wasn't something we were actively trying for (ideally wanted to save a bit more money), but overall we feel so lucky and blessed.

My questions are basically around how our mortgage approval process will work and how close up to the ""home buying"" date are banks looking for pay stub information? For example, will her W2 for 2022 be sufficient? A pay stub from mid-March? Our ""plan"" was basically to have her stay home to raise the kids once we have them, so we're not really planning on her ""continuing"" on in the workforce once our baby (hopefully) arrives in mid-April. I have sufficient income to take care of us, but my concern is basically getting the best possible interest rate.

Given we just got married, we're needing to save a bit more money between now and April to feel comfortable with having enough of a nest egg for a down payment + closing costs + rainy day fund ,etc. etc., etc. So hoping to have a house by May/June/July timeframe (fingers crossed the housing market is in ok shape).

So the question is -- how do we best go about our mortgage approval process? Is it going to be super challenging given she may not have a job by the time we find a house (e.g. if we end up buying in June and she's home with the baby).

Thanks all!

EDIT: Another wrinkle. She's actively looking for a new job right now (the current place isn't great for her mental health). So I guess she may not be eligible for maternity leave at her new company given she won't have been there for over a year? (Just based on a quick google search of FMLA).",finance,1660185931
gaming,"Problem with the ""Modern Fighting Game""","Okay, I know we've heard about the modern gaming industry broadly as a whole 1,000 times everywhere we go. But those usually only talk about Western games, while I'm here to talk about fighting games in general and the modern trend for them as a whole. 
Quite frankly, modern fighting games are greedy as hell. They release a half roster and then expect you to buy 5 season passes to fill the rest of the roster. You pay full price for a fighting game just to not even get the full list of characters/stages, and I never see anyone talk about it. It's not fair to the consumer who already is paying full price for a fighting game (which, to me, is already ridiculous, seeing as a fighting game is a mostly online experience) to give you a product that pales in comparison to the previous installment. 
There are examples of FG DLC done right! Like the recent melty blood which charges nothing extra for new characters (regardless of the quality of the game), it's a genuinely great thing to see. But in general, I feel like the toxic FGC is too busy to understand how greedy a lot of modern FG devs are and are too fed up with petty issues to see the overall problem. That's enough for my goofy silly rant but I just wish people could understand more.",technology,1660186964
personalfinance,W-4 Federal Withholding help,"Hey there,

My first post in here. 

I’m active duty military and have never really had to worry about taxes since it’s all taken out automatically for me. My wife is a librarian at a school and when she started we had to fill out a W-4 form and estimate the amount of taxes to be taken out. Well come tax season for last year we got her tax form from the school that said she only paid 47 dollars in federal taxes and we kinda got screwed out of a refund like I would normally get. Fast forward to recently and federal taxes were being taken out after we had discovered the problem up until June. My wife went on summer break and want getting paid until she went back to school 2 weeks ago.  She just checked her pay stub and it said no federal taxes are being taken out again. Is this something that has to be re-certified every year? I’d really like to avoid potentially paying taxes again.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated as we have no idea how to do this correctly and if the federal taxes that have been taken from her previous paychecks are even enough. No one at the faculty at her school can help us since it’s considered “tax advice” which is frustrating. She has the ability to change the withholding stuff online through a system called Workday.",finance,1660193842

personalfinance,Is buying a second house a good idea or should I share rent on an apartment?,"Background:

I bought a house about a year ago because my mom's boyfriend's landlord was going to sell it. Now my mom will be moving in with said boyfriend and rent will continue to come in covering rent plus a few hundred dollars (being in the family they will take care of small maintenance typically).

Current:

I am looking for a place to live when my mom sells her house and will be living with an old college roommate of mine who is looking for a cheaper/larger place to stay. We could share rent on places in the area at about 600-700 a piece per month. If I purchased a very cheap house in the area I could likely get 80% of the rent from him a month and it still be 100-200 bucks a month cheaper for him.

Question:

Is the risk of a potential falling out (not very likely) or even just change in location of my friend worth the savings for the both of us? I am currently self employed in a not very stable online job. If I transitioned to local work even on the retail level I should be able to personally handle the mortgage of the house by myself though it would be an uncomfortably large percentage of my income.

Possible setbacks:

Income is not w2 so would need a cosigner on the loan (first house has my mom on the mortgage but only me on the deed idk how she pulled that off)

Interest rates are at stupid levels right now (first mortgage is a flat 3%)

High risk of declining income to the point of financial pressure

CryptoCurrency,Your One Stop Dashborad for Economic Conditions and How Not to Guess but Actually Know What Interest Rates Markets are Expecting.,"**Accuse me of moon farming all you want. I'm planting seeds and fertilizing with moon dust! Gimme some of them moons!**

TLDR Click the link for charts of all the macro economic data most of you will ever use. Scroll down and click the second link near the end to see what markets are expecting interest rates to be.

Lots and lots of talk about inflation, economy, market expectations for interest rates etc.

I wrote a lot describing my dashboard. If you you just want to see how to know **and not guess** what expectations are for interest rates scroll down to the bottom.

I posted [this dashboard](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/dashboard/75149) a few months ago and reposting again for all of you. Don't open it on mobile. You can but I dont think you'll like it.

I've made a few changes since I last posted. First chart shows interest on treasury bonds of different maturities. If the bond market expects healthy economic growth then longer dated maturities will have a higher yield (interest) than shorter term bonds. You can see about March, 2022 different portions of the treasury bond market started to invert, and much more so since then. This is the bond market saying ""yes even though this bond is due later we're accepting a lower rate than a shorter duration bond because we believe economic conditions will cause the price of the longer duration bond to increase more than a shorter duration bond"" This is what usually happens during a recession. If both a 2 year bond and a 15 year bond have a 1% change in yield (interest rate) the price for the 15 year bond needs to move much more for that to happen than the 2 year bond. So when economic conditions start to deteriorate shorter duration bonds tend to be sold in exchange for longer duration bonds in anticipation of lower yields (higher prices) on longer dated treasuries.

The next chart shows pretty much the 1st chart much more simply. The dotted and solid black line become negative when different parts of the yield curve are inverted - a signal but not a guarantee of further deterioration of economic conditions. Its a pretty big signal though. Click 'view on FRED' then zoom out and if its not already selected click the option to highlight recessions. You'll see that dotted or black line going below zero has preceded every recession since 1980. Maybe further back but FRED doesn't have a data series for it. The red line is the yield on the 10 year treasury, its informative because it tells you whether or not long term interest rates like mortgages, business, personal loans, etc are most likely going up or down.

'Next the St. Louis financial stress index. This is your goto gauge for whether or not the financial system is functioning normally. A simple way to interpret this is anything below 0 is less than average financial stress, above 0 more than average financial stress. You can see the heart attack the financial system had during March, 2020 as the Fed needed to act and provide liquidity to financial markets. Zoom out and you'll see the multiple heart attacks during the financial crisis. According to the gauge everything sitting real nice and easy right now as far as the financial system is concerned. So anything you read about someone saying the financial system is going to explode its worth at least asking the question whether or not its showing up in the St. Louis financial stress index. If it isnt, why not? Maybe its just a lot of hot air.

Next up just a chart of the S&amp;P500 along with its implied volaility (the VIX)

Real GDP growth (aka GDP growth adjusted for inflation)

The current job markets situation. This one the Fed will be watching real closely as it hikes interest rates. It has a dual mandated - price stability and maximum employment. Right now its in an unfortunate place where price stability might very well come at the cost of higher unemployment. They're trying to thread a needle here that is probably impossible at some point they might have to re-evaluate what's more important - further bringing down inflation or stabilizing the employment levels. If you want a good for future economic conditions ignore the unemployment rate (because it lags) instead look at initial and continuing jobless claims. This is people filing for unemployment benefits.

Employment population ratio - just another way of looking at the employment situation. It tells us what percent of the US population is employed. Its important because unemployment numbers only counts those who are looking for work. People who are not looking for work or have given up looking for work are not counted in unemployment numbers.

Next up inflation, and employee earnings. I'm sure CPI were all pretty familiar with now, that't the const of goods and services. What is plotted here is headline inflation, which includes food and energy. Core inflation strips out food and energy and that isn't what's graphed here. The weekly earnings numbers might be a bit confusing. Average weekly earnings here is NOT adjusted for inflation. The median REAL weekly earnings are adjusted for inflation. Whenever you see REAL in these data series that means 'adjusted for inflation.' When we look at numbers unadjusted for inflation we see it actually looks like people are making more than last year. When we adjust for the increase in the cost of goods and services we see people are actually making significantly less.

New orders of capital goods excluding defense related capital goods and aircraft is another good indicator for gauging the health of the economy. When its going up it means the manufacturing sector is purchasing more equipment to make more things because they expect there will be more demand for things they produce. New housing starts are also a good indicator. More housing starts = anticipation people will buy more homes, and more construction jobs.

Next up is Headline inflation, Core inflation (food and energy stripped out), and the price of energy.

Second to last chart is the birds eye view of the housing market. You got new housing starts, national average of 30 year and 15 year mortgage rates, median home prices, and how many new homes are actually being sold.

Finally there's the FED. We got fed funds rate (what everyone cant stop talking about right now), Borrowing rates at the discount window - this is where banks borrow money if no private bank will lend to them, they borrow right from the FED at the discount window rate. You can see its higher than the fed funds rate (the rate at which banks borrow from each other) this is to make borrowing from the FED an option of last resort. The solid black line is the money supply. The purple line are assets on the federal reserve balance sheet. They go up with each other because the Fed increases the money supply by purchasing assets, usually treasury bonds but not always, from banks. Those assets on bank balance sheets get swapped for money. Finally we got the reserves of banks in green. This is the money banks have on deposit with the federal reserve. This is also money that is not being lent out in the private economy, and if its above the reserve requirement set by the fed its because banks don't know what else to do with it and see it as less risky to have it on deposit with the fed than to lend it out.

**Knowing what Market Expectation are for interest rates (fed funds rate, the rate everyone is talking about)**

Every day there's a post guessing about what market expectations are for the fed funds rate. You don't have to guess you can know this by looking at fed funds futures. [Here's the link you need](https://www.investing.com/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor).

You can see that on Sept 21 the market has priced in a 66% probability fed funds target will be between 2.75-3.00% There's a 34% probability the market has priced in for interest rates being 3.00-3.25% When you look at this tool the numbers will probably be different because as long as fed fund futures are trading these numbers will be moving around. If these were the numbers before the next rate announcement, and the FED announced a range of 2.75-3.00% you would most likely see some selling off of risky assets because right now the money is on a lower interest rate. If they announced 3.00-3.25% there's a chance you would still see a bit of a relief rally because a 34% probability is still priced in for rates higher than 3.25% At any rate now you don't need to guess what the market is expecting interest rates to be. You can know exactly what market expectations are. And you can see what expectations are all the way out until the middle of 2023.",cryptocurrency,1660197757
personalfinance,Advice Needed - ETrade Line of Credit,"New Reddit username for anonymity...

About a year or two ago, I took out a line of credit with Etrade against my stock portfolio to start a new business venture. At the time, I had alternative means of paying off that line of credit regardless of the success or failure of the new business venture, so I viewed it as low risk. However, soon after taking this line of credit, my ""alternative means"" of payment quickly dissipated (should have expected that) - since then, as you well know, interest rates have gone up and my 3% LOC is now over 5% - my new business venture is bringing in cash flow, but not as much as I had hoped by this point in time. I'm avoiding compounding interest, but not really making a dent in the principal. 

I'm about ready to cash out enough of the stocks held as collateral to pay off the LOC and free up a little bit of cash flow (no longer throw away hundreds in interest every month and increasing with every interest rate increase) - my plan would be to sell close to as much stock with capital gains as stocks with capital losses, to minimize tax implications. To do this, I would drop my overall stock account value by 48%, but it would free up monthly cash flow, reduce my personal stress, and allow me to start slowly rebuilding the brokerage account without feeling like I'm throwing money away on interest. Additionally, as the new business continues to grow, I would plan to put some of that revenue back into the brokerage.

I guess I'm just looking for validation - is this plan the smart financial move, or do I keep floating this brokerage LOC at 5% or more interest with no other short or mid-term means of paying it down?",finance,1660197885

# ‘He Was Helping Us’: Investors Cheer CEO Accused of Scamming Them

## Crowd at Manhattan courthouse applauds alleged fraudster and denounces prosecutors. ‘Because of EminiFX, I have only one job right now.’

[Evan Peng](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AVzOIRhVPLA/evan-peng)10 August 2022, 12:00 BST

For Louisiana Francois, who sank $10,000 into what prosecutors say was a Ponzi-like crypto scheme, driving four hours from her home outside Boston to watch the man who allegedly took her money appear in court was an easy call.

But she didn’t go to condemn him. She went to cheer him on.

“I’m standing with Eddy Alexandre, because he was helping us,” Francois said. “As a nurse, I used to have two jobs. Because of EminiFX, I have only one job right now.”

EminiFX was the platform Alexandre marketed as a crypto and foreign currency exchange based on a unique proprietary technology. Federal authorities say that technology was smoke and mirrors and that Alexandre scammed hundreds of clients out of at least $59 million, luring them with “promises of huge passive income returns.”

They allege he actually invested just a few million dollars of the funds, adding rewards to his clients’ balances for recruiting others to the platform and using the growing influx of cash to keep his first victims happy with handsome “returns.” He promised weekly gains of at least 5% and to make them millionaires as the platform traded for them through its “Robo-Advisor Assisted account,” the US says. 

A preliminary report by the court-appointed receiver in a parallel, civil suit brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission reckoned the damage at more than 62,000 EminiFX clients bilked of as much as $250 million.

Along the way, the government alleges, Alexandre dipped into the giant trough to treat himself to a new BMW and other luxuries.

Alexandre was arrested in May and charged with commodities fraud and wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty.",cryptocurrency,1660209271
CryptoCurrency,"In a World where banks rule and create money out of thin air through fractional reserve banking, how will crypto currency play a role? What incentive do these banks have to get rid of the fiat system? I see a list of crypto currencies that will be pushed through the ISO 20022.","SWIFT ISO 20022 Timeline and ISO 20022 and The Federal Reserve 

MX/ISO 20022 mandatory adoption is intended to occur in several stages. High-value, cross-border payments in the European Union will first transition to ISO 20022 in November 2022, particularly payments involving the Target2 system, the real-time financial settlement system used by central banks in the Eurosystem. The U.S. Federal Reserve will fully transition to ISO 20022 by November 2023. The old MT/ISO 15022 messaging system will continue to be partially used until 2025, after which the vast majority of MT/ISO 15022 messages won’t be permitted. 

SWIFT believes that if current timelines are met, 79% of high-value payments by volume and 87% of high-value payments by value will utilize the ISO 20022 messaging system by 2023.

ISO 20022 Coins and Cryptocurrencies 

A variety of cryptocurrencies are currently ISO 20022 compliant. These include: 

Ripple (XRP): Member of the ISO 20022 Standards Body. XRP is designed to be a bridge between the crypto and fiat worlds and is used for a variety of purposes, including cross-border settlements. XRP can currently process approximately 1,500 transactions per second. 

Stellar Lumens (XLM): Member of the ISO 20022 Standards Body. Like XRP, it is designed to be a bridge between the crypto and fiat worlds, with a specific focus on cross-currency conversions for individuals rather than institutions. According to developers, XLM can process up to 3,000 transactions per second, but real-life transaction processing times have historically been much slower. 

XinFin (XDC): Compliant. XinFin is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible delegated proof-of-stake blockchain intended to function as a digital asset network for enterprises by combining public and private blockchains with interoperable smart contracts. XDC is XinFin’s native currency. XinFin offers up to 2,000 transactions per second and finality in as little as 2 seconds. 

Iota (IOTA): Compliant. IOTA is a centralized blockchain ledger intended to handle Internet of Things (IoT) based transactions. Many believe the network has a lot of potential, but it has also faced criticism due to its centralization, security flaws, and the high number of hacks and attacks it has suffered over the last several years. 

Algorand (ALGO): Compliant. Algorand is a major Layer-1 blockchain attempting to solve many of the problems inherent in competitors like Ethereum. It is reportedly able to process approximately 1,300 transactions per second. While it does promote decentralization, Algorand’s proof-of-stake consensus method has led to concerns about whales dominating the ecosystem. 

Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR): Rumored to be compliant. Hedera Hashgraph is a distributed ledger platform that is similar to a blockchain but operates somewhat differently. Hedera Hashgraph is intended to overcome many of the limitations of traditional blockchains and can perform 10,000 transactions per second (with some reporting speeds up to 500,000 transactions per second) with a high level of security. Unlike blockchains, Hedera Hashgraph does not use miners for transaction validation, instead, utilizing a feature referred to as a directed acyclic graph to sequence transactions without splitting them into blocks. HBAR is its native cryptocurrency. 

Quant (QNT): Compliant. The Quant Protocol is designed to solve interoperability issues between major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple via its Overledger interoperability network, and intends to connect all blockchains via one comprehensive operating system. Quant Protocol is EVM compatible and considered by many to be an Ethereum Layer-2, but unlike other Layer-2s, it does not require any modifications to the base chain in order to become operational. QNT is the Quant Protocol’s native currency and is paid by developers in order to create and operate dApps on the network. 

Cardano (ADA): Rumored to be compliant. Cardano is a proof-of-stake, decentralized blockchain network founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. It is currently the world’s largest proof-of-stake blockchain. ADA is its native currency. 

ISO 20022 and Ripple 

Ripple is now the second-largest Fintech firm in the United States. Its currency, Ripple (XRP), is also one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap and is the largest ISO 20022 compliant crypto today. Ripple even sits on the ISO 20022 Standards Body, which gives it a significant voice in how the standard is implemented and developed.  

Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are relatively slow and mainly used as a store of value, the Ripple ecosystem is designed as a digital payment network and protocol designed for near-instantaneous settlements between banks and other major financial institutions. In addition to providing collateral for settlements, XRP is often used for quick currency conversions and cross-border remittances.",cryptocurrency,1660215316
economy,FED is creating the next recession...,"It is AMAZING that almost no one is paying attention to how the FED is causing us all to focus only on its short term interest rate.

However, it's mostly about the FED stop purchasing long term bonds, and letting the free market decide what is the rate.

The FED is creating this entire show around interest rates in order to keep everyone focusing on that, instead of focusing on its BRUTAL intervention in the long term bond market.

This intervention is the significant part in holding the market from falling, since once the FED stops buying all these long term bonds, their rates will rise DRAMATICALLY.

This allows the FED to hike rates without TOTALLY COLLAPSING the long term bond market and the housing market with it immediately.

Although it started reducing its purchasing of long term bonds, the FED is doing it EXTREMELY SLOW, while running the ""short term interst rate"" show like it is the most important thing.

Obviously, the media and all of us are totally hypnotized by the FED interest rate show, just like a hypnotized person looking at the pendulum in hypnosis show.

And all of this is in order to show that the FED is fighting inflation.

SHOW TIME will arrive when the FED really pulls out its sticky fingers from the bond market.

stocks,Inflation and current rally,"Hi everyone, thank you for taking the time to read this and think with me.

The current rally made me think about a scenario which I see playing out in the near future. 

Scenario:
The current rally will drive inflation further up and will scare the FED and CB’s around the world. The next rent hike will be a response by the FED and will be higher then expected. This will either crush the current market or make no difference at all and drive inflation even further (as this new rent hike will not have next to no effect).

Besides that, a new energy crisis is looming coming winter, for europe at least. Covid might be back in a lesser form. 
And a war between China and Taiwan is starting to become pretty likely, so much so that the US is going to spend 56B to start up a chip production line in the US. 

This is a scenario that I see play out. How do you guys feel about this? If you have a different view please explain this in detail so we can discuss and I can learn.

stocks,Bloomberg: US Producer Prices Fall for First Time Since Early in Pandemic,"[Graph from article](https://i.imgur.com/NSKL3YV.png)

&gt; A key measure of US producer prices unexpectedly fell in July for the first time in more than two years, largely reflecting a drop in energy costs and representing a welcome moderation in inflationary pressures.
&gt; 
&gt; **The producer price index  [PPI] for final demand decreased 0.5% from a month earlier and rose 9.8% from a year ago**, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The pullback was entirely due to a decline in the costs of goods, though services prices only edged up.
&gt; Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called **core PPI rose 0.2%** from **June** and 7.6% from a year earlier. **Both the overall and core figures were softer than forecast.**
&gt; 
&gt; The figures suggest some pipeline inflationary pressures are beginning to ease. Commodity prices, including oil, have dropped sharply in recent months, and there are indications that supply-chain conditions are improving. 
&gt; 
&gt; Consumer-price data out Wednesday also showed a welcome moderation in inflation in July, largely reflecting a pullback in prices at the pump. Even so, inflation remains stubbornly high and will likely keep the Federal Reserve on an aggressive path to curb it.
&gt; Goods Prices
&gt; 
&gt; **Some 80% of the decline in goods prices was due to a 16.7% plunge in gasoline prices,** the report showed. **Diesel, iron and steel scrap and grains also decreased**.
&gt; 
&gt; **Services prices rose just 0.1% in July**, led by an increase in fuel margins and transportation and warehousing. Meanwhile, prices for portfolio management, food and alcohol retailing and long-distance trucking declined.
&gt; 
&gt; Thursday’s report adds to separate data from S&amp;P Global and regional Fed banks that showed a pullback in prices paid for inputs like materials in July. 
&gt; 
&gt; Risks remain, however. While supply chains have started normalizing, the war in Ukraine, labor negotiations at West Coast ports and China’s zero-Covid policy represent potential logistics speed bumps for US producers. 

&gt; Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- which strips out the most volatile components of the index -- increased 0.2% from June and 5.8% from a year earlier**
&gt; Costs of processed goods for intermediate demand, which reflect prices earlier in the production pipeline, slumped 2.3% -- the most since April 2020. More than half of the drop was attributable to a plunge in diesel costs. Excluding foods and energy, these costs dropped 0.2%.

Other snippets from CNBC:

&gt; Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been **expecting an increase of 0.2%**

&gt; On an **annual** basis, the index rose 9.8%, **the lowest rate since October 2021.** That compares to an **11.1% [year over year] increase in June** and the record **11.6%  [year over year] gain in March**

&gt; [This is] the first month-over-month decrease since April 2020, the month after Covid-19 was declared a pandemic

&gt; Most of the decline came from **energy**, which **declined 9% at the wholesale level**. That contributed to a **1.8% drop** in prices for **final demand goods**

In case it causes confusion, let me emphasize that there are two 'core' PPI figures presented here.

- The main 'core' PPI which excludes food/energy increased 0.2% month over month, up 7.6% year over year
- Another similar metric strips out food, energy, *and* trade services. This figure also increased 0.2% month over month and is up 5.8% year over year.",finance,1660222631
personalfinance,Tips on Refinancing Car Loan,"I am searching for tips on what to look for when refinancing a car loan. I have a little under $9000 left with a 8.74% interest rate with Ally (my credit score was low at the time of purchase). But for the last two year, my credit score has jumped very high and I want to search for a low interest rate. Below are some questions:

1) If I was to get a pre-approved rate, would it damage my credit score?
2) How do you know if the rate offered is good? What information or keywords I should focus on when reading the fine print?
3) Is it ideal to refinancing now while the interest rates are higher than normal?
4) Any specific refi companies that I should look forward/research?

(Also, if there is a better sub to point me to for this, please do, I just know personalfinance has some good info)

I'm currently a grad student getting my doctorate, and have seven semesters of school left before I graduate.  I have used up the savings I had saved prior to starting school in the first year of school, and will be living off student loans for the next two years and four months until I graduate and get my big person job.  If it matters at all, starting salary would be between 175k-200k after I graduate, and anticipate paying in some LARGE monthly payments to chunk down loans ASAP after graduation. (Like hope to pay off my loans in 2-4 years post-grad).  In regards to paying for school, it seems I have two options to pay for the rest of school.    


1:  A family member offered me a lump sum of money to pay for the rest of school ($125,000 roughly) right now, and would be giving it to me at a flat 4% interest rate.  I asked them if they could defer interest accumulation until closer to graduation, but frankly, pretty much said no.  So take the money now and pay a lower rate (but start accumulating interest now) for the next 2.5 years until I graduate and start making money? 

Orrrrrrr option 2:  


2:  I take out federal student loans incrementally, semester by semester, at a higher interest rate.  Federal Subsidized loans are 6.54%, and I would need to go above the amount they give me and take out additional Grad PLUS loans that are sitting around 7.9% currently.  I tried to do some math, and  I would be taking roughly $23k Spring 2023, $19k Summer 2023, $23k Fall 2023, $23k Spring 2024, $16k Summer 2024, and $12k Fall 2024 to cover tuition and cost of living.  


Any recommendations?  I tried to do some interest math, and it just made my head spin, so I thought I'd see what the good old reddit mind has to say.

personalfinance,House purchase: Higher Downpayment for lower monthly vs. Higher Emergency Savings?,"Title is our conundrum.

Details:

Dual income = gross 125k/yr.Take home is about 6200/mo after 401k/HSA. That's the low end, disregarding any bonuses/extra pay periods.

Current Emergency Savings + Down Payment fund Total = 62,630.

Our current plan is: 6mo ES = 30k, and the rest goes to down payment/closing costs. We have a little bit of liquid cash left over, totalling around 8k as well, some of which we expect to use for the move(movers, locks, furnishings...). All these numbers are excluding any vested savings.

We're looking at a house around 250k purchase price and the monthly estimate from our lender currently is apprx 1750(PITI+HOA). If possible, I'd like to bring that number down to the 1600s, but that would most likely require buying points or a higher downpayment.

I wonder if it would be a sound idea to take a little out of ES to go towards a higher downpayment, and thus lowering our monthly, or would that be quite stupid as ES is ES and you never want to be caught without? Help us settle the debate! We'd be First Time Home Owners.

I spoke with my student loan advisor through my program and she advised I consolidate my loans to have a lower interest rate overall and to utilize public student loan forgiveness (PSLF) and pay as you earn. She also recommended that I max out my retirement through work so that my taxable income is less therefore paying even less for my student loans. She explained the first two years my payments will be minimal because this years’ income is next to nothing. My tax bracket is higher than I’ve ever been in so my net pay will be almost half of my gross. What’s your take on this? Do I keep with the current plan or try to pay off my debt as fast as possible?

inflation,What Truly is Inflation and How is it Caused?,"Even as I am typing this post right now, we are currently losing our money. How, you might ask? Like if I have 5 dollars on me right now, my money didn’t just go down to 4 dollars? Well, that my friends, is where inflation comes into play!

I figured talking about inflation during periods where we are currently experiencing a lot of it would be a good idea. Knowing what's going on around the world as well helps you become more aware of any next steps to take.

\*\*This is a brief description. If you want more details, I highly recommend watching this video ([https://youtu.be/WtQGCbH6J-0](https://youtu.be/WtQGCbH6J-0)) for a more detailed explanation.\*\*

So what is inflation?

Inflation is really just the broad increase in prices of any good or service over a given period of time, whilst the value of your money declines. This is essentially where you are able to buy less for more.

Now why exactly is this important? Well I mean the impacts of inflation are pretty huge, impacting the entire economy. Ranging from consumer spending and business investing all the way to actual government tax policies and interest rates, take inflation lightly, and it can really bite you in the butt.

But with all this being said, how in the world is inflation even caused? Well that’s a great question. After multiple years of experimenting and analyzing, economists have come to a conclusion of the 3 main effects which act as a catalyst towards inflation.

Cause #1: The Demand Pull Effect - this occurs when supply is low and demand is high for a good/service, so businesses hike prices up to drive the demand away, ultimately contributing towards inflation.

Cause #2: The Cost Push Effect - This 2nd effect is really the result of increased production costs, therefore, increased selling prices too.

Cause #3: Built In Inflation - This final effect is really caused due to primarily the increase in prices of goods and standard of living, hence, the wages and salaries of employees must also increase to be able to meet this standard of living as well.

Now, even with these effects stated, there are still some more other ideas of how inflation would be caused, maybe like through rising federal reserve interest rates, increased money supply, devaluation, and so much more. But regardless, what you really need to understand when it comes to inflation is that the purchasing power that you hold will drop, even if the intrinsic value of a good or service remains the same.

I hope this cleared up some of your doubts about inflation, and let's all hope that our current situation of inflation (really now hyperinflation), will go back to normal.",finance,1660230982

CryptoCurrency,A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.  
But its not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many ague more secure because of it.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952)

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the ""merge."" In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on.

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 19,118,581 BTC out there at a cost of 24,340.01.

That means, the market cap is 24,340.01 x 19,118,581 = 465,346,452,725.81 (465B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,739,028,516. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price is .50 that means the market cap for Cardano is .5 X 33,739,028,516  =16,869,514,258 (16B)

You'll need a 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 30  
33,739,028,516 \* 30 = 1012170855480

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 1.23 Trillion. That’s only 0.11% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.  
Take Luna for example. You probably lost your investment. Period. But, you never know.  
Look at Ripple. Look at Shib.  
Both were thought to be dead, but they live.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With chains like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens are metadata attached to an asset.

The metadata are things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset.

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.  
Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.  
But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.  
Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.  
IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable.""

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.

Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.

The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.  
What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if its not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.

The second problem, is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.

Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

personalfinance,Sanity Check: Assisted Living: What order to draw down finances? Helping Ailing Family Member,"Sanity Check: Assisted Living: What order to draw down finances?

Situation: Retired Father in Law (FIL), retired early due to multiple strokes fell down the stairs earlier this week and is in the ICU. He’s 64, in declining health, and was barely making it on his own at his 3 story townhouse with a walker and a paid helper 6 days per week.

He’s still in the ICU. I moved his bed onto the main floor of his house, but now he can’t reach a shower and it’s not a good long term solution. My wife and Sister in Law (SIL) are looking into Assisted Living. He doesn’t need full on nursing home care yet, but we’d like him to live in “The Sandpiper” from better call Saul, playing bingo, talking with old folks, being fed, and close to his set of grandkids (mine). We are not looking for him to move in with us. Luckily he has a sizeable nest egg that he doesn’t want to spend. 

I don’t have the numbers in front of me and have not run through it with him since pre-covid, and my wife and SIL are using their Powers of Attorney to try and get more information on this as FIL is still pretty out of it at the hospital (thought Bush was president yesterday).

From what we can tell he has: 

- Full Social Security Benefits (about $2000 a month we think)

-A pension he can draw from starting next month at age 65 with a face value of about $200,000 and a monthly payment of $1200 per month. When he was still of sound mind he stated he wanted to cash this out when he was 65 and I think that’s probably a good idea. 

-Somewhere between 700,000 and 1,200,000 in his 401k. We don’t know the exact number and it’s been a few years. It was $700,000 in early 2019 and the market is up since then. 

-A paid off house worth $550,000 on Zillow “Zestimate”. SIL wants the house and that is a separate discussion.

Here is what I think should happen.

Step 1: SIL and Wife visit FIL as much as possible in the Hospital.
Step 2: SIL and Wife use POAs to confirm financial matters
Step 3: SIL and Wife withdraw $50,000 from 401k to reimburse SIL for private payment of the health workers she has been sending over, and use the extra for additional care when FIL is first out of the hospital.
Step 4: SIL and Wife tour assisted living facilities and sell FIL on moving into one
Step 5: Cash out annuity once FIL turns 65. He is in ill health and he’d have to live past 80 in order for it to make sense cashing out the annuity per my fuzzy logic.
Step 6: Use money from annuity to get FIL moved into assisted living, most places want $100,000 on the books before they let you in.
Step 7: Sell house, give money to existing financial advisor using the investment plan he had set up to maintain money. This will put over $1,000,000 total in the 401k, up to $1,500,000 depending on how his investments have done.

We are still shopping, but a decent assisted living place should be around $8,000 per month. If he’s pulling $2,000 per month from social security, his savings should last him 14-20 years in the nice assisted living assuming he earns no return on his money, and his costs don’t go up. If he needs more care this would be shortened, but presumably the length of stay would go down. He is in poor health now and would have to last until his 80s before he ran out of money. Beyond this, if he needed to use Medicaid he’d have to have depleted all of his savings anyways.

Is there anything we are missing here?

Would you change anything financially?

Thank you all for the assistance. We are just now really starting to think through this and don’t want to make any long term decisions for at least a month.",finance,1660237934
personalfinance,withdrawing from 401k to pay off credit card debt,"I'm confronted with a situation.

I just got a judge to sign off on court orders and I'm finally free to deal with my finances.

My divorce: it started in August of 2019, I had financial restraining orders and to leave my separate property and to maintain both homes.in April of 2021 I lost my job, company got bought out I wasn't needed. 

Unemployed until April of 2022, in February I started to fall behind on my mortgage payments more than 60 days my credit suffered. Over the previous year I had to rely on credit cards, repairs of a totaled minivan, and I had the kids 50/50 in a 3/3/2 schedule that came out to 1 week me and 1 week for mom over 14 days.

I got the final decree of the divorce on March, moved in April. Got kids 50/50 with full rights to education and medical, got cars and no child support to pay. 

Wife didn't like it and refused to sign.

My divorce got signed yesterday. I started the process of consolidation of credit to pay off on a lower interest rate than the credit cards, and I was notified that because of the late payments on the mortgage I'd have to wait a year since the last late payment before I could qualify. Other creditors just flst put didn't give me a personalized reason other than the automated : late payments, high revolving credit usage, poor credit score of 580.

My 401k has 32k on it. My penalty is 10% after income taxes I guesstimate a total of 22k cash out.

My interest payments per month to credit card debts across 7 accounts total of 42k is at 588$ a month.

Is my thought process to pull out my 401k pay off my highest Apr credit cards would save money in the long run as I don't have to lose 588$ in interest per month?

I'm also gathering child support from another kid of 1k I got in March, and I'm getting a signing bonus on the 15th of 3k would give me about 26k in cash to throw. I'd have no savings and low cash until the first of the month. My take home after taxes and depositing into hsa is about 3.4k per 2 weeks.
I'm not using credit cards since about December of 2021. So using the credit cards and falling into debt again should not be an issue while I'm employed.

Am I thinking clearly? My mother says it's too high a cost, but doesn't give me very good reasons for it.

*Should I go forward with my plans coming Monday when all the cash is in my bank account. The 401k cash out takes about 3 days if I start before EOB today.*

Edits:

401k was from the job that had let me go in April 2021, I qualify to withdraw cash.

The house I got is worth 241k and at 4.1% with only 88k balance. Refinance has been denied by 3 banks, ally, bofa, and axos for the same reasons as consolidation or personal loans. Rbfcu has gotten the same automated denial, but a human is looking into what we can do. Currently reducing my high cc balance as soon as possible.

Edit:
I'm currently employed since April 25th at 110k in software development for their corporate side of things. Super easy and secure. Company growing. Good for at least 2 years in a privately held company.

Credit score is at 580 with mortgage late payment of over 60 days back in February/March",finance,1660239561
litecoin,An attack on altcoins in the privacy sector seems to be starting.,"&gt;The U.S. Treasury decided to come out of the woodwork and send a shot across the bow of the “crypto” industry yesterday by adding the open-source privacy project Tornado Cash that runs on Ethereum to the list of sanctioned entities. In the process, the department highlighted a few things: The U.S. federal government is dead set on ensuring that U.S. citizens are completely surveilled and subjugated; altcoin projects aren't as decentralized as advertised; and while Bitcoin is significantly more immune to these types of attacks compared to the altcoin projects out, there complacency isn't an option. There are many things that can be done to ensure the network is as robust as possible against efforts by the state to curb bitcoin adoption and usage.  
&gt;  
&gt;By adding Tornado Cash to the sanctions list, the Treasury Department highlighted many shortcomings of the Ethereum ecosystem which claims to be decentralized. Almost immediately services like Alchemy and Infura — centralized API and node infrastructure companies leveraged by many companies and individuals “using” Ethereum — cut off their users from accessing the Tornado Cash contract.  
&gt;  
&gt;from *bitcoin magazine*

MWEB increases the privacy of LTC, will this be better out of policy regulation? I know that the major update of LTC some time ago has enhanced privacy, does this help to resist regulation? At least these altcoins are not based on the contract mechanism of ETH ecology. So it may be more difficult to sanction, but for some trading platforms that require KYC, it seems to have little effect.

personalfinance,equity vesting and taxes,"a percentage of of my equity vested on my work anniversary this summer. lets say its 100 shares for simplicity. company policy (or maybe its Carta policy) is to withhold some shares for taxes as vesting is a taxable event. the info session said it should be the federal 22%. i just checked my account and i was taxed at 45% and i only have 55 shares now. HR says it includes social security, medicare and city and state tax etc. still seeks like a lot but maybe 45% is accurate. but what bothers me is withholding shares for taxes hurts a lot more than withholding cash. because in my case our stock price has gone up 45% since vesting. id much rather pay the cash equivalent than lose all this upside in share growth. i already asked if i can opt out. they said no. is this a normal policy?anything i can do for future vesting dates? sorry if im being a brat, its my first time experiencing equity.",finance,1660240175
stocks,Village Supermarket: Regional Store Operator,"TLDR at bottom

Market Cap: $325.74MM
Share Price: $22.52      

	VLGE.A is a regional player located in New Jersey that operates 38 stores consisting of: 30 grocery stores, 5 Fairway Markets, and 3 Gourmet Garage Specialty Markets. 
	 Its stores feature specialty departments, such as an on-site bakery, an expanded delicatessen, various natural and organic foods, ethnic and international foods, prepared foods, and pharmacies. This allows it to have a good brand connection and sense of local connection in its relatively high population density area of Northern New Jersey which gives it a competitive advantage to Walmarts not only because of its larger offering such as bakeries and restaurants making it half-mall, half-supermarket, but also a really strong brand image.
	It is not the fastest to expand and is actually under-leveraged, even as a small player in the industry and the region, though it did announce a 15-20 million dollar project for a retail center in which it will retain a 30% interest with a Village store also.
	
I have been talking a little much about the business since it is fairly simple, but lets get to the financials:

	Revenues have been 2.07B in the LTM with operating margins of 1.8% lower than the 2.1% average pre-COVID, though higher than the 1.6-1.7% levels from April of 2020 to July of 2021.
	FCF margin for the LTM is at 1.2% though that is primarily due to seasonality and the average hovers around 1.4% - 1.7%, with the FCF in dollar amount being $24.2MM.

	Though a 7.5% TTM FCF yield is in itself pretty good, we can not simply look at that in isolation and we have to acknowledge that though Food and Staples Retail has been particularly volatile in the last 6 months due to supply chain issues, inflation, and other macro challenges resulting in problems, especially INVENTORY MISMANAGEMENT.

	Well lucky for us, inventory turnover ratio has been increasing 3% annually for the last 6 years for VLGE.A, even through post-COVID macro challenges and inventory itself has risen at a steady and reasonable rate with gross margins actually increasing, compensating inflation challenges.

Moving onto to the balance sheet, being under-leveraged means that ROA &amp; ROE are slightly lower than industry averages with ROA of 2.6% and industry of 3.5-4% and ROE of 6.6% and industry of 17.4%. But the upside to this is that stocks like Village trade closer to their equity value and in this case, TBV is 337.39 or P/TBV of 0.97 and BV of 361.58 and P/BV of 0.9.

	Though I won’t go deep in their balance sheet, they have 120M in cash, 44M in LT investments, 560MM in NET PP&amp;E
On the assets side and 70M in LT debt and 300M in leases on the liability side. Though all of this already looks pretty great, what I love most about their balance sheet is that they have 225M in current assets and 153M in current liabilities or a current ratio of almost 1.5x with half of current assets being in cash which is good for any company, amazing for a food and staples retail company where the industry average is 1.1x and the big players hover around 0.8x-1x.

Going onto the valuation, though they are under-leveraged, they love to expand and invest in themselves through capital expenditure which has resulted in average equity annual growth of 5.3% over 15 years and revenue CAGR of of 4.2% over that time with GDP being 3.5%.

Did i forget to mention that they have been paying a 1 dollar per share dividend annually for the last 15 year. Now yes, i understand a no growth dividend isn’t the best but it is a yield of 4.44% with the BBB bond effective yield being 4.85% with likely not as strong equity value for those triple B companies.

Along with this they repurchased 1% of shares in the last quarter. and have an authorization to repurchase 1.66% of shares more.

Just to note, insider ownership is at a good 12.8% and 7% of shares being owned by ones of the directors and founders.

I believe that it should be trading at least above $30. I think a 1.5x TBV would be a fair valuation at a price of $35 or a 5% FCF yield considering its incredibly risk—averse and stable business. Also, i did a DCF model with a TGR of 2% and DR of 10% giving a $33 intrinsic value though i believe that is very Conservative given they have been able to grow 4.2% and have a WACC of 3.084% and have a weighted average interest rate on LLT debt of of roughly 2.4%.

I also think this is a great stock for anyone who needs the dividend income considering the history of payout and the low beta of 0.17.

TLDR: stable food and staple retailer with strong regional brand value that is under leveraged and has continuously invested Into the business through expansion, Acquisition, and returning value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and has a large margin of safety/discount to intrinsic value.",finance,1660240660
dot,DOT rewards on Kraken,"Just noticed DOT rewards on Kraken were reduced starting in back July? Was this because of DOT, or Kraken? Will rewards go back to original interest rate at some point?",cryptocurrency,1660241546
economy,"Inflation in the US overcame the peak, but there are nuances","At the end of July, price growth in the US slowed down by a little more than 0.5 percentage points, up to 8.5% YoY. The reason for the slowdown in inflation was the decline in motor fuel prices following oil prices, which amounted to 7.6% MoM. This decline in gas station prices resulted in a barely noticeable 0.02% deflation in July. The dynamics of prices for American grade oil in the first ten days of August allows us to hope for a slowdown in inflation by the end of the last summer month: the average price of WTI in August is still $91.2 per barrel against $99.8 in July, having decreased by 8.6%. Thus, we can state that the peak of price growth in the US has passed.

At the same time, the analysis of data on price dynamics indicates that it is too early for the US central bank to celebrate the victory over inflation and begin to complete the cycle of tightening monetary policy. Excluding volatile fuel prices, monthly inflation in the US was 0.41% vs. 0.36% in July last year: in terms of annual growth rates, this means a price increase of 4.9%, which is almost 2.5 times higher than the Fed target level of 2%.

Despite the decline in annual growth rates to 8.5% YoY, the growth of annual inflation excluding fuel prices accelerated by 0.35 percentage points, up to 6.0%. Thus, inflation in the United States is becoming more and more stable: the acceleration of inflation, excluding fuel prices, is fully supported by rising prices for a wide range of goods and services. At the same time, the decline in prices for gasoline and diesel may contribute to an increase in household spending on other goods and services, which will only support high rates of growth in prices for them.

Polkadot,Pastel Network x Parity Technologies - Enhancing Polkadot’s NFT ecosystem,"Parity will collaborate with Pastel with the goal of providing Pastel’s Sense and Cascade protocols to its NFT ecosystem. This collaboration signifies the continued successes of both Pastel and Parity, and is a massive step forward for the overall NFT ecosystem. It is a testament to the growing need for NFT reliability, security and verifiability, solved via Pastel’s advanced infrastructure.

&amp;#x200B;

**Partnership Roadmap**

In the immediate term, Parity will bring Pastel’s Web3 protocols into the Polkadot Ecosystem which can easily be integrated with Polkadot’s layer-1 parachains and their NFT and DeFi dApps.

  
These two protocols which will be integrated are Sense and Cascade.

* Near-Duplicate NFT Detection ([Sense](https://sense.pastel.network/)) → Deep-learning technology that assesses the relative rareness between NFTs to detect counterfeits, scams, or copyright infringement and provide a certification of authenticity.
* NFT Data &amp; Metadata Storage ([Cascade](https://cascade.pastel.network/)) → Fully distributed, permanent and entirely redundant storage protocol. Pay once and store forever. Prevent centralized points of failure, monthly subscription maintenance, IPFS pinning &amp; 404 errors.

Given the lightweight nature of these protocols and their interoperability as Web3 Open APIs, any Polkadot ecosystem member will be able to directly access Pastel’s near-duplicate NFT detection and store NFT metadata in a cryptographically secure, redundant, and distributed manner.

In the longer term, Pastel will work directly with Parity Technologies to develop fully decentralized and trustless interoperability via a communication bridge. As a non-parachain blockchain, Pastel Network can achieve trustless communication with Polkadot via a Substrate instance. This Substrate instance can be deployed to Polkadot via a common-good public utility or community-operated parachain. Initially, Pastel’s Network of high-compute validators (“SuperNodes”) can serve as a federation of off-chain agents.

With this type of interoperability, Pastel and Parity can bring decentralized NFT permanence and security to the entire ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does the integration work?**

Pastel Network has not only worked relentlessly to develop incredible infrastructure for the NFT ecosystem, but to also deliver it to network partners in a lightweight, seamless manner. Partners of the Pastel Network such as Parity and along with other native blockchains or dApps communicate directly with Pastel via open Web3 APIs.

During NFT minting on Polkadot, secure and authenticated REST API calls pass the hash of the candidate NFT to Pastel Network. The return responses — 1) a JSON file with the relative rareness score in the case of Sense and 2) the SHA3–256 hash for the JSON file stored in Kademlia which itself contains the SHA3–256 hashes of the set of redundant copies of the JSON files in Kademlia — are signed by randomly selected SuperNodes operating on the Pastel Network. Smart tickets write and store the outputs to the Pastel blockchain, which is returned to Polkadot and included as additional Response fields in its NFT standard.

solar,Lessons Learned/ Tips from my Install,"Installed 4KW array for $2.95/w in less than 30days  in SF, California.   


Lessons Learned/Tips:

1. How old is your roof? 
2. Learn what local your solar regulation is.
3. Battery vs Local NEM Regulation? 
4. Learn what DC/AC ratios are:  
TLDR: 400w Panel / IQ8M Inverter 330w: 400/330= 1.21 ratio   
side note: my Array Plate is 3.3kw since IQ8M Peak is 330w.  
Clipping is fine, simulate 1vs1.21 ratio on pvwatts or opensolar. (the cost of the upgraded Inverter may outweigh the additional solar production.)
5. Take photos of main panel/service line, Mainpanel, sub panel and panel location and send this to the installer. 
6. Do you plan to add EV/Heatpump/water heater? 
7. Know your numbers: Current annual kwh and Solar Offset Target, have copy of electric bills to send to solar provider. 
8. Do your own research on OpenSolar + PVwatts: Simulate the array yourself! 
9. Decide if your going to tilt or lay flat.  Specifically if you have a flat roof.
TLDR: typically better to tilt; at least to keep the panels cleaner. Up to 10-15% impact on production.
Search amount of tilt for zip code. Then consider if you’ll want to go through structural engineering if the degree is too big. 
10. Know the players: with examples  
Broker - typically marks up the material and contracts a local installer for install and maintenance.   
Local Installers - Full service, sell, install and maintain. 
Subcontractors - Broker or installer will need additional labor.  Large solar install project may require more labor than whats staffed.   
Lead aggregators - Energysage  
""DIY"" installers - Homeowner pulls the permit and a guy with a truck ""assist"" you. 
11. Learn the What if scenarios: What happens if my inverter goes out? Truck roll cost? Who will come for X? Panel dies? 
12. Don't wait for a sale or price drop, pricing typically gets worse and every month you spend researching is another electric bill you paid. Supply may get better, but labor is driving cost now. (in my region.)
13. $/watt is important, but its a guideline: Installer/Supporter, Panels, Inverter, Timeline, location, complexity need to be balanced. 
14. Get a price check (dont pay) from project solar to get a baseline price. 
15. Buy color matching paint for the conduit
16. Provide drinks, snack or lunch for the crew. Happy workers lead to better outcomes. (maybe they will climb the ladder to paint the conduit)",energy,1660254137

OFac is the nuclear option that enforces Facta, because the US courts won't do anything to undermine national security, all the spooks in FairFax Virginia need do is toss a scribble across the desk tied to something related to US national security over foreign threats, and the Judges will enforce it. Very few judges will lean libertarian in the states, very few. If they can Sanction code repositories, in blatant transgression to the 1st and 4rth there isn't much stopping the US government.

&gt;""The Eth bros *need* to re-frame the reality of this situation as being a broad attack against all privacy/anonymity. It's not. It's an attack against a common pool where you swap your personal units of Eth for the units of Eth derived from the proceeds of crime (hacks and criminal state actors and such). They left Monero untouched.""

&amp;#x200B;

The US gov can attach 30 year prison sentences to citizens who get caught using monero, that is the trajectory, rooted in how the law around Ofac works, and law on how the banking secrecy act works, and laws on how Facta and the Panama papers played out. Tornado cash creates the precedent of the US gov sanctioning not just addresses, but repository of code itself, which would be protocol level. They're saving Monero and Ledger and Trezor for last, because they know it will be the hardest legal battle, but they do intend to come for them. They're exerting soft power and this clear fascist power grab on purpose against any permissionless system that creates a more complex online infrastructure. If Monero is not accepted on western exchanges, not accepted at western merchants, criminal, and incapable of participating in smart contract features, particularly for indelible publishing on things like Odyssey, then the foreign policy of the US will have largely been accomplished, they have a long game. They can (and are) rug pulling the surrounding ecosystem associated with Monero as a form of soft power to make Monero irrelevant outside dark markets. When things like Thor try to use atomic swaps or integration with monero, you can all but expect Ofac already has plans to sanction it, and is aware of it.

stocks,I have hope for an ANOTHER lower CPI report,"The latest inflation report was much better than expected and the next question becomes; will it be ‘too good’ and set the bar too high for the next report?

I’ve been watching closely and I think we’re headed to another shockingly low number.

The last headline inflation number was announced at 8.5% YoY, down from 9.1% the month previous, and with the optimistic estimates of 8.7%.

During this time, up until the last day before the data release, the Cleveland Fed nowcast estimated July’s inflation at 8.82%, so they likely overestimate figures.

I’m not sure what August’s forecast is, if somebody knows it please chime in, but my point is this: Cleveland Fed nowcast for August is currently at 8.38% and dropping daily. You can see a screenshot of their daily adjustments here: https://imgur.com/a/jL0cfKG

Another huge factor in this is oil prices dropping, heavily affecting inflation numbers. The only reason oil went down was because OPEC increase of oil supply; something that we’ve recently agreed to continue and even push harder. Notably, not all countries met OPEC expectations on the increases in the last month, so there’s even more room for improvement than this second increase implies.

My only concerns are that the market might be scared by a potentially inevitable 0.75% increase by the Fed, as they look past the fluff and tackle real inflation. Regardless, we’re not worried about a 1% increase anymore, inflation numbers will be very good on the next report, and there’s a chance (though unlikely) that the Fed does a 0.5% increase instead of a 0.75%, which would be insanely bullish for markets.",finance,1660263955

CryptoCurrency,Crypto is suspiciously ideal for vampires,"What has always been one of the biggest problems of vampires? The transfer and safekeeping of their assets in case an angry pitchforked mob burns down their castle.

A Vampire can and usually does live in a castle where he can store value, but the place might be ransacked and looted. Vampires live forever so even if it happens once every 50 generations, it is quite the nuisance.

A Vampire can alternatively be mobile but he can't carry much treasure with him. We're talking gold and assets here. Let alone valuable art. (Boom, NFTs!)

Wealthy Vampires could of course invest their money and keep it in banks and offshore accounts but the trading is done at day. It's called DAYtrading. A Vampire trading in the US would have to live somewhere else on the globe where it is night when it's day in the US. So he could daytrade at night. But the night is needed for sucking blood and corrupting virgins and on top of that dealing with money is considered to be beneath Vampires anyways.

CRYPTO can be stored on a chip that they implant into their bodies or hidden easily inside a castle. Vampires have perfect memory. Therefore they could just memorize the 12 or 24 Word Code. You can trade Crypto at any time of the day and there are LOTS of virgins in the crypto community.

Vampires are masters of mind control and some of them control vast armies of underlings who do their bidding. In theory this is ideal if you want to farm moons. They can have several people shitposting and give the moons to their Masters.

I also want to point out that the home-crypto of this subreddit interestingly is called MOONS. Not chickens or stones or Schotterknickers, no MOONS. THE one natural light that Vampires can see without turning to dust. I assume calling it BATS would have been too obvious

Getting interest rates in Crypto... How is it called? That's right, it's called STAKING. Like the stake that you drive through a vampires heart. I don't know why they called it that, but they did. Vampire Humor I assume.

And how do you get blood these days? You can't just buy it as a private person. Unless you know where and you can do it anonymously and pay - with crypto.

Vampires LOVE their valuable are that they collect through the centuries. But unlike them that art can decay, especially paintings. And SUDDENLY we have a NFT market that CONSERVES the art and the value of the art. NFTs are made for vampires who won't die for centuries.

If you look at the evidence and you combine the dots the everything picture is that of s nosferatu

personalfinance,What do I do with my expendable income?,"I'm looking for some advice in terms of how to better utilize my money, as well as budgeting and potential investments, with an end goal of living a balanced life.

I'm 26 years old single and my take home pay is around $100k annually, I live in a low cost of living city.Here is the monthly income break down (take home pay):

\+$4000 from my 9-5 job (fixed)

\+$1850 from one of my parent's rental property that I manage (fixed)

\+$2500-$3000 from my Airbnb (variable)

Here are the monthly expenses:

\-Airbnb property mortgage: $1500 (fixed)

\-Utilities + home related services: $500 (fixed)

\-Groceries + restaurants: $400 (variable)

\-Gas: $60 (variable)

\-Phone: $50 (fixed)

\-Car insurance $40 (fixed)

\-Subscriptions: $35 (fixed)

Here are some context for the list above:

My salary is $85k annually, I put away 9% and company matches 6% on the Roth IRA, maxed out on my HSA contribution, and plus some medicare related expenses, $4000 is the final monthly take home pay.

For the Airbnb, It has 3 bedrooms, I live in one and I rent out the other 2. Since I work from home most of the time, it's easy for me to manage. I had thought about saving up and investing into a 2nd Airbnb property but with that I think it will be difficult for me to maintain my 9-5.

As of now, I have 19k in student loans (\~4% interest rate), and 10k in the stock market, 5k in savings. I'm debating whether I should pull everything out from the stock market and pay off the loan all at once in September (when they resume the interest rate ), or if there is a better long term approach to pay off the loans in my situation.

So with all that said, my monthly expendable income is around $5765-$6265, lets say I splurge $265 on some random things, that will leave me with $5500-$6000. What would be the right thing to do with my expendable income, if I want to achieve financial freedom as quickly as possible while maintaining a comfortable lifestyle?

(P.S. I want to be honest and say that although I understand the importance of making the right financial decisions at an early stage to set the path of financial freedom straight. However, I don't want it to be all about saving money and end up missing out on the good things in my 20s. I went through phases of wanting to explore and experience different cities, travel the world, meet new people and drive a fancy car, but I always ended up giving myself a reality check, because I understood the financial consequence and hindrance of pursing that lifestyle. And that's how I ended up on the opposite side of the spectrum; I live in a neighborhood where there are barely anyone that are in the same age group as I (don't get me wrong, my neighbors are awesome!), as people of my age tend to flock to the big cities, I drive a $6k used car that I got 2 years ago, nothing wrong with it, reliable and has everything I need. But in terms of the bigger things, I get a sense that they start to take control of my life's direction, such as all the properties I manage are preventing me from leaving this place and starting somewhere else anew. I constantly experience this internal conflict, it feels as if I traded my youth and energy for the safer path, but in the end I don't know if it's worth it. All my life I've been prioritizing stability/longevity over taking risks because of family influence and that caused the fear of the unknown, or even worse, the fear of losing what I've build. That's why I've come here to seek guidance from the wise ones, those who had living through similar experiences, as I hope to gain some clarity on the path to financial freedom.)",finance,1660283950
personalfinance,Got in a bad car situation trying to figure out the best way out,"I co-signed on a car with my ex. (Mistake but not the point of this story. However, it’s relevant.) 

This new car he got with no trade in and no money down. It’s a 38k loan with a nearly 11% interest rate. The payments are $709 a month. 

His other car is worth 6k but he owes 12k on it. It broke down and would be $900 to fix. He called them and told them to take it after he got financing for the new car. Hence, no money down and no trade in. 

Well, I just found out they don’t want to take the jeep back. They’re offering to let him keep it and he’d only have to pay $200 a month. Logic says to sell the new car and get out of the payment on the new one he couldn’t really afford in the first place, keep the old one, not have a repo on his credit, and try to get things turned around. They could come after him for the extra 6k on the original car loan even if they repo it, so he’s still most likely going to be liable for it even if he lets them take it. 

Anyway, that’s all great, but he loves the new car and his kids love the new car, so he doesn’t want to get rid of it. I’m trying to come up with *creative* solutions to make this all work somehow that eventually leads to getting my name off the one car. 

I was considering maybe advising him to fix the jeep, sell it for what he can get for it, putting that money towards the new car loan, and trying to refinance that loan for a better interest rate so lowering that payment and getting my name off it. He’d have that extra $200 payment a month for the old one, but if the other payment was lowered, maybe they’d balance out to about the same and he wouldn’t have a repo on his credit. 

Or perhaps I was thinking he could lease his old car out for say, $300 a month. We have 3 friends I can think of off the top of my head that need a car. He would use that to keep paying it off, (again, avoiding the repo), help get his credit better to where he could eventually get the new car in just his name. 

I just think it’s dumb at this point to let the other car get repossessed when there’s a way to avoid tanking his credit even further. (And, again, keeping the new car is dumb, but he seems set on it.)

So, if anyone has advise that isn’t sell the new car or has input on why my plans would or wouldn’t work or any other creative ideas of their own, I’d love the feedback!",finance,1660285518
vet,Can't get Vets to move fast enough to take care of my Dog and I feel something is really wrong.,"My Dog Strider is 8 years old, male, and is a German Shephard Blue Heeler mix.  Starting this last June he started having yellow soft stools and vomiting occasionally.  He would vomit once every couple of weeks and almost all of his stools were no longer black and firm but more loose and yellow.  Noticing a pattern I took him to the vet where they took a fecal sample.  The fecal sample revealed a negative result for for both giardia as well as parasites.  

The Vet advised to wait ""a while"" and see if he improves.  I waited a few weeks and he continued to vomit and have loose yellow stools.  I asked to make an appointment and the vet made me wait a month due to staffing shortages.  I came back with Strider in late July and they did a GI Panel.  The GI Panel didn't return anything abnormal accept he had cobalamin levels at the low end of normal.  They advised it could be indicative of disease of the small intestines.  They advised to supplement him with Cobalequin for a month.  They ruled out pancreatic insufficiency and acute pancreatitis.  So I then gave Strider Cobalequin for his low levels and the Vet also prescribed him Mycequin as an antibiotic.   

I continued this treatment all through July and August.  Strider continued vomiting and passing loose yellow stool.  I called the vet again and they prescribed him a GI diet with the Hills Biome hydrolyzed protein formula. They told me to wait a few weeks and see how he adjusts to his diet.  I waited a few weeks and not only is he still vomiting and passing loose stool but now it's happening more frequently.  He's starting to pant heavily all throughout the day and he's lost 4 lbs in the last two weeks.  I called the Vet and they keep telling me they can't schedule an ultrasound because the vet is under staffed and the specialist they call in to do the ultra sound isn't available for another 3 weeks. 

My dog just vomited again and it's midnight and I'm stressing out.  I love my Dogs as much as I love my human members of my family.  My dog is getting lethargic and he's not looking the same, I know he's in pain and I know something is wrong.  I called the vet and implored them to do something and they said they couldn't move things any faster.  I called over 15 other veterinary clinics in the area and outside of the area and they all tell me they are not accepting new clients due to staffing shortages caused by Covid.  

What should I do I feel like taking him to the emergency room somewhere, I really don't care about the cost I just want my boy to be ok. I've attached a couple photos just to show his poop and vomit and what it looks like.  Any information on what I should do is much appreciated, thank you.

CryptoMarkets,How long will the bear market last?,"General speculation around traditional trading markets often falls close to the eventual result. Additionally, since everything is so regulated and stable in such markets, it doesn't take long to notice a change in valuation and call it out.

On the other hand, market trends in crypto fluctuate so much that it's difficult to say whether these changes are just a phase or here to stay for long. That’s one reason why people took so long to recognize the bearish sentiments around crypto. The evidence was all there. It just wasn't believable at the time.

With everything considered, it was expected to happen. There was such a high influx in the beginning that it became impossible to sustain. Still, it's pretty impressive to see the length of time that crypto remained bullish. 

Before going any further, it’s important to understand the primary reason behind the current scenario. That would give us a general estimate on how long the bear market will last.

Recently, the US Federal government decided to hike interest rates. The point was to control the looming threat of inflation and avoid another recession. However, it ended up affecting every capital market. Since the US is so central to global financial valuations, the hike in interest rates also affected crypto.

Now, several experts claim that the current crypto bear market will last at least 2 years. Note that those projections also factor in global financial situations. 

However, when analysing anything from that perspective, you must also take international trade relations and national financial projections into account. It’s no secret that national economies end up impacting one another regularly. So, you can't really predict how the US economy might be affected by other unforeseen factors in the future.

All of this has already been considered by crypto experts. However, setting a hardline number to anything isn't really effective. Think back to the beginning of this answer. The primary point was that trends in crypto change a lot.  Just to be safe, though, take an estimate of 1 or 1.5 years.

Taking a broader look, a bear market will be beneficial for crypto in the long run. It will temper aggressive individual behaviour and will bring some overall market stability. It'll also encourage a shift to quality tokens. 

Considering this information, people tend to think that the whole ‘bear market’ phase was a fake-out. It wasn't. The crypto market is just better at bouncing back. Still, it’d be safer to moderate investment behaviour and stick with the prominent tokens for now. 

After all, in an uncertain time, minimising risk should be the first priority.

Crypto isn't under any real threat. Sure, it's facing a downward trend. But this also allows improved regulations to be introduced into the crypto space. Besides, the whole reason behind crypto taking off was because it was based on blockchains. Blockchains, as you know, will be the base for Web 3.0. So, there's no way that crypto is leaving now.

stocks,"Tiger 21, an exclusive club of investors, says the ultra rich are doubling down on stocks","The members of Tiger 21 – a peer network of ultra-high net worth entrepreneurs and investors – are putting most of their money to work in the stock market for the first time.

Tiger 21 consists of 1,200 members with a cumulative $140 billion in assets, and individuals must have at least $20 million in liquid assets to qualify for membership.

Its founder and chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt, told CNBC on Thursday that although real estate had historically been the most popular destination for members’ money, they were now seeing some “real bargains” in the stock markets.

This has, in part, pushed public equities to the No. 1 spot for Tiger 21 for the first time since the network’s inception.

Sonnenfeldt said members are not focused on stock picking for the most part, so much of the equity investment is channeled into ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and index trackers, while technology has been among the most popular sectors. Public equities now constitute 27% of the membership’s overall asset allocation.

“You have a lot of the FAANGs that have come in from much higher prices — they are thinking there is a lot of benefit there, and obviously one of the big areas is energy, not only on the oil and gas side, but much bigger growing interest in renewables and how to play the solar opportunities, the wind opportunities,” Sonnenfeldt told CNBC’s “Street Signs Europe.”

“They know this is the biggest investment theme perhaps in human history, and it is getting a lot of their attention.”

After a dismal first half of the year on the back of soaring inflation, tightening monetary policy and recession fears, stock markets have staged a relief rally in recent weeks, and received a further boost Wednesday after U.S. inflation was shown to have cooled in July on the back of a fall in oil prices.

Many investors have increased their cash holdings to weather a likely recession. Sonnenfeldt said the cash allocation of Tiger 21 members has historically held solid at an unusually high 12%.

This is because they are primarily “wealth preservers” who have sold businesses and live on roughly 2% of their net worth, and therefore use cash reserves to shore up around five years of living expenses, he said.

In the short term, Tiger 21 noted that members are using their ample cash to look for deals and inflation hedges.

“But they also want resources to pounce on an opportunity and they have been seeing them in increasing numbers, so their cash actually just ticked down from 12% to 11%. It may sound like a small amount, but it probably suggests that members are quite bullish over the long term,” Sonnenfeldt said.

“They have recession fears — a majority of our members think that we are going into recession — and still between real estate, public equity and private equity, it is a 76% allocation, so that is pretty confident in the long term.”",finance,1660295008

stocks,FED is creating the next recession...,"It is AMAZING that almost no one is paying attention to how the FED is causing us all to focus only on its short term interest rate.

However, it's mostly about the FED stop purchasing long term bonds, and letting the free market decide what is the rate.

The FED is creating this entire show around interest rates in order to keep everyone focusing on that, instead of focusing on its BRUTAL intervention in the long term bond market.

This intervention is the significant part in holding the market from falling, since once the FED stops buying all these long term bonds, their rates will rise DRAMATICALLY.

This allows the FED to hike rates without TOTALLY COLLAPSING the long term bond market and the housing market with it immediately.

Although it started reducing its purchasing of long term bonds, the FED is doing it EXTREMELY SLOW, while running the ""short term interst rate"" show like it is the most important thing.

Obviously, the media and all of us are totally hypnotized by the FED interest rate show, just like a hypnotized person looking at the pendulum in hypnosis show.

stocks,The Fed won't slow its rate hikes because the economy is still strong enough to take more tightening,"[Full Article...](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/fed-rate-hikes-pivot-july-cpi-tightening-mohamed-el-erian-2022-8)

Investors shouldn't be too uplifted by signs of cooling inflation: the Federal Reserve likely won't slow down their rate-hiking regime because the economy is still strong enough to take more monetary tightening, top economist Mohamed El-Erian said.

Instead of pulling back, the central is going to have to ""consolidate its gains,"" he said in an interview on CNBC, noting the July consumer price index came in better than expectations. ""They can't celebrate.""

Indeed, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Wednesday that it was too early to ""declare victory"" on inflation.

""I think the Fed is going to welcome the latest print, but it's not going to slow down in any significant manner,"" El-Erian said.

He expects the next Fed rate hike to be ""somewhere between"" 50 and 75 basis points, saying that's still substantial given that the last two increases were 75 points. 

The July CPI report that showed cooling inflation as well as last week's payroll report that showed 528,000 new jobs were added last month indicate that Fed policymakers ""can continue doing what they're doing because the underlying strength of the economy is still significant.""",finance,1660309528

gaming,How likely is for the Joey Drew Studios to manage to pay for the lawsuit?,"I'm on a phone so I'm sorry for my English!

In case you don't know who I'm talking about, the Joey Drew Studios are the guys who made the Bendy And The Ink Machine games. They've changed their name multiple times so maybe that's why you didn't recognize them.

A while back people have noticed that their shop was canceled and later the reason for it was given: Phat Mojo, the company who produced the merchandise for them, are suing them for (take a big breath) HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. Not even Scott Cawthon, the creator of Five Nights At Feddy's can pay for that. 

I don't know the whole context, but I think it was due to the poor sales of the merchandise they produced for Showdown Bandit, a Joey Drew Studios game that didn't selled well.

Considering that Joey Drew Studios is a small indie company, I think it will be impossible to pay for all of that, even if they sell all of their stuff. Like Bendy And The Ink Machine has probably made around 5 or 10 million dollars based on my own estimations. I think they might be able to pay for it gradually, instead of  paying it all at once, but I'm not sure if they can do that.

And if they lose in court and fail to pay them, what will happen with Bendy as a brand? Will they lose the rights for the franchise and they will be given to Phat Mojo? Will be now a fall into the public domain?",technology,1660311453
personalfinance,Looking for Advice - Saving for Car vs. Retirement,"I've been having a fight with myself over how to approach some of my savings goals. At 32, I finally find myself in a spot where I can meet all my needs and comfortably save for a few different goals. In my current position, I've got an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a pension, and of course paying in to social security. I also have a Roth that I've had for a while but haven't started contributing meaningfully to until last year; I'm currently maxing this out.

In other words, as long as I can stay in this position long term, I feel pretty secure in my retirement. But I also want to save for a car. I'm still driving a 2008, and I don't think it will last much longer, and I'm looking to get a plug-in hybrid vehicle. I have to save up for a solid down payment, with the hopes that the federal tax credit will help offset the cost (and maybe prices will fall in the next year or two).

My dilemma is both practical and ideological. **Would it make sense to halt Roth payments for a year to allow myself to save up faster for a new car?** That's the practical question, and I've got it in my head that it would be a terrible idea to sacrifice that long-term growth. But I also study climate change for a living, and the new lately on that front has been abysmal. I'm in a head space where it seems to make more sense to just sacrifice the Roth for a bit to get something I want and need now, because who knows what kind of future we're even going to have? My other retirement savings should keep me secure on the off-chance that everything will be okay.

Does this seem reasonable? Would it be terrible to suspend Roth payments to save up faster for a vehicle? Are any of you asking yourselves similar climate-related questions? Thanks in advance for the advice!",finance,1660311551

**Critical flaws found in US Emergency Alert System**  
The US government is warning of critical vulnerabilities in its Emergency Alert System (EAS) that, if exploited, could enable intruders to send fake alerts out over television, radio, and cable networks. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in an advisory it was recently informed about the flaws in EAS encoder and decoder devices, adding that they were successfully exploited by Ken Pyle, a security researcher at cybersecurity firm CYBIR. There is a sense of urgency to the advisory because the exploit “may” be presented, with proof of concept code, at the DEF CON conference in Las Vegas next week. The DHS is urging organizations that operate the EAS to ensure that their devices and supporting systems are updated with the most recent software versions and security patches, are protected by a firewall, and are monitored, with audit logs being regularly reviewed to ensure there is no unauthorized access.

**Twilio confirms hack**  
The communications integration company confirmed that unauthorized actors gained access to customer data as of August 4th. This appears to be a result of social engineering, with several employees tricked into handing over login credentials. This used SMS phishing messages purportedly from the company’s IT department. The company was aware of these phishing messages and contacted carrier to stop the messages. But the threat actors rotated through carrier and hosting providers to continue the campaign. This indicates an operation that is “well-organized, sophisticated and methodical.”  Twilio informed impacted customers directly. TechCrunch reports it learned of the same threat actor using a similar campaign against other companies. It’s not clear if these campaigns succeeded.Cloudflare confirmed it got hit too. The company said three employees fell for a similar phishing scam. However its use of hardware-based MFA keys prevented intruders from accessing its internal network. The details again show the attackers as being methodical and sophisticated, obtaining work and home numbers of Cloudflare employees and family members in an effort to make phishing successful. It’s estimated at least 76 Cloudflare employees received phishing text messages within the first minute of the attack, with the phishing domain only registered 40 minutes prior.

**Deepfake cybercrime increasing**  
VMware released its annual Global Incident Threat Response Report, looking at the landscape of cybersecurity threats across its large client-base. Unsurprisingly, the report found that ransomware and business email compromise attacks showed a continued steady climb in frequency, representing a combined 70% of security incidents over the past twelve months. However cyberattacks using deepfake tools showed a 13% increase on the year, with 66% of respondents reporting at least one incident. VMware also noted that outside of direct cyberattacks, the FBI reported an increase in complaints of people using deepfakes and stolen identity information to apply for remote work positions. The report also found a surge in zero-day attacks, up 51% on the year.

**Former Twitter employee convicted in Saudi spy case**  
On Tuesday, a former Twitter employee was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.  Ahmad Abouammo, a US resident born in Egypt, maintained that he was simply promoting the social media platform in the Middle East and North Africa. However, the jury was shown that Abouammo received a Hublot watch and $300,000 in wire transfers in exchange for confidential Twitter account information on Saudi dissidents who criticized the Kingdom and its royal family. The bribes came from a top aide to Mohammaed bin Salman, the now de-facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. Abouammo was found guilty of acting as an agent for Saudi Arabia, money laundering, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and falsifying records. He now faces 10 to 20 years in prison.

**Introducing the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework**  
At Black Hat, Amazon Web Services, IBM, Cloudflare, Splunk, Palo Alto Networks, Okta, CrowdStike, and several other cybersecurity companies announced the formation of the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework to create a common data standard for sharing security information. The idea is to create a set of specifications for product and services to standardize alerts from different tools and speed interpretation of data. Currently vendors offer proprietary dashboards that require manual labor and custom code to move it to other tools. OCSF standards will be available on GitHub. Companies expect to integrate these specifications into products within the next few months.

**New flaw found in Intel SGX**  
Intel introduced software guard extensions, or SGX, to create a trusted execution environment to protect sensitive code like encryption keys even on compromised systems. Flaws in SGX aren’t anything new. Since 2018 researchers have discovered seven serious security holes with it. At the Black Hat conference, two PhD student security researchers presented a paper about an architectural flaw in the Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller or APIC that completely breaks SGX guarantees in most 10th, 11th, and 12th generation Intel CPUs. This attack doesn’t require a side-channel, but does require root privileges. The researchers see this as particularly problematic for cloud instances, where one vulnerable server would cause a “significant threat to enclave security.” Intel released mitigations for the vulnerability starting August 9th, rolling out through server OEMs.

**CISA should split from DHS says Chris Krebs**  
Former CISA director Chris Krebs called for significant adjustments to the U.S. government’s approach to cybersecurity on Wednesday. During a keynote address at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas, Krebs proposed the creation of a “U.S. Digital Agency,” which would incorporate elements of CISA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Department of Energy as well as parts of the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. The goal he says is to add privacy, trust, and safety issues to the existing security priorities.

CryptoCurrency,Is PoS Really Better than PoW?,"There's so much hype around ETH movement to PoS, but the cost to be a validator is so bloody high. At 32ETH, there are few people who can afford that. There is already a trade-off. Sure the transaction fees are *supposedly* going to drop. And this is significant.  But PoS with those specifics means that the validators are going to basically the rich. I though we were supposed to be moving away from the bank, moving away from all the centralized institutions of the federal reserve and their shenanigans and the government control.   


Maybe it is unlikely, but why can't the government just print some more dead presidents and be a validator. Or more likely the big banks remove a drop from their  buckets of cash, the oil cartel etc. There is an underground movement that warns against ETH adoption. They claim that ETH was a big business plan from more or less the start and I'd have to say it's more and more credible. We've seen massive ETH investment by institution(BTC as well to be fair), but it's the fact that Goofy Gensler of the SEC seems to support ETH(and BTC) especially with the way he spoke about it earlier this year. He sort of flirted around the question as usual but stated that ETH and BTC were the only two coins he could see as commodities.

We have seen the ridiculous attack on Ripple by the SEC, which would make sense since XRP seems to have such a great use case and benefits but is a serious threat to the status quo of Wall Street Finance, and likely also to ETH itself. The common knowledge in financial circles that individuals who work with the SEC soon go on to work with the finest at Wall Street so it is not a question as to the tight links and relationships between the two.  We see now that the SEC lawsuit against Ripple was misguided if not malicious and is a case the SEC seems to be losing, perhaps badly. Interestingly, the SEC claims XRP is a security as it is not decentralized, although the Howey test, the gold standard of security identification would probably beg to differ. Regardless, is it perhaps not the case that the SEC is against the ""centralization"" of XRP, but rather the fact that it's lack of decentralization means Wall Street can't simple come in and either buy up all the tokens before they moon, or use their vast resources to take over the token governance and enjoy profits and control from that position.

personalfinance,Is it more economic for me to just buy a house rather than rent?,"Hi, I am coming on 20 years old and live in an area in Texas where rent averages around 1200-1800$ on the lower end. At the moment I live with family since I just got back from military training ( I am a reservist) so I am not paying rent. But obviously this is not a good permeant solution and I need to leave hopefully sooner rather than later. Would it be a better idea to just eat the extra cost of getting a house or renting a place anyway? Either way I would have roomates and would be able to afford it but I am worried about leases and having almost no control over whether I get to live in a place for the long term without the price of rent going up.

Apologies for the lack of in depth info, I generally don't use reddit lol.

I have never lived on my own. The closet Ive came is living in a ""Dorm room"" for AIT and even then I was with 2 other people with pseudo parents watching us 24/7

My income comes in or around 34k a year, but like I said I have multiple people who could be a roomate who are also ready to move out. Ive been employed almost constantly since my 16th birthday and the longest I have gone without a job is around 9 months in sophomore year of highschool because I was moving around a lot.

Money is the only issue, I don't have very much for any kind of down payment. But on the flipside money for getting renting an apartment or house becomes tricky since at a minimum for everything I've seen you need first and last months rent + security deposit + utilities. so at a minimum I would be out around 3000$ While the people I intended to roomate with could help, It still just appears like I am getting stiffed if I rent, with high rates that are ONLY getting HIGHER.

I am not scared of having to be the handyman if I were to BUY a house. Id rather buy a shitbox house and fix it. But I just want to know what's more economically feasible.

#The Shill Response

The standard response of shills have been:

**I. Crying about Trump.** The crybabies dishonestly attempt to insert ""false equivalency"" and ""slide"" arguments regarding Trump or Trump Jr. or Jared Kushner. They are off topic responses designed to limit discussion on Biden corruption.

**II. Crying that Hunter Biden did not hold office.** Voicemails, email, business transactions, wiring transfer orders, text messages and news reporting all confirm that Hunter Biden is involved in policy, domestic and abroad, bribery, domestic and abroad, and is involved with US defense contractors and works under Bohai Harvest specifically for the interest of China's state owned interests, where the interest is specifically stated (with pictures) that China wants American resources. Hunter Biden is a traitor. Hunter Biden sees no problem selling out a billion in US tax payer dollars for a few night with crack and hookers. Hunter Biden sees no problem selling out American resources to China for a few nights with crack and hookers.

**III. Focusing on Hunter Biden's genitals.** We understand that the unemployed moderators and jannies across the Internet are gay. They are obsessed with Hunter Biden's private parts. They use this to distract from the corruption, because they are desperate to defend a drug addled pedo because they religiously serve a political agenda that seeks to enslave the world with authoritarianism. Because these mods and jannies have no leg to stand to defend this, they project and accuse fervent researchers of wanting to look at Hunter Biden dick pics.

**IV. State actors are pushing disinformation and misinformation.**  There are 3 pictures that have been making the rounds that are intentional disinformation:

1) Natalie Biden with cocaine on her nose. It's not Natalie. Sure, it's a striking resemblance, but it's verified as being a cam girl. The shills use this to say ""the data is fake"" but, really, their argument is what's fake. Anyone with the data knows this picture isn't real.

2) Joe Biden with asian girl. This is actually a BDSM video from xvideos that has been around for years. The face of the old man is clearly visible in portions of the video and is, in fact, not Joe Biden. Shills love to use this type of disinfo to muddy the waters.

3) Hunter Biden with five young girls. This is not Hunter Biden, as Hunter Biden has never sported a black soul patch. Shills are using this to poison the well and distract from the corruption.

Other tactics, in this realm, include misnaming Natalie as Hallie, misnaming Zoe as Natalie and intentionally getting facts wrong to confuse everyone so that they can them claim falsehoods are being spread around as an excuse to censor information.

**V. Blatant Censorship.** Suppression is occurring where the news is ignoring the data. The news is in on it, showing that they can't be trusted and serve the liberal agenda. Big Tech is also in on it. But outright bans, deletions, harassment and death threats are happening to people who share the most damning stuff. This is why it is important to saturate the Internet with proof.

#Shill Groups

**1) Paid actors:** One group is upvotes.club. They aren't politically aligned, they merely get paid. Reddit accounts are bought and sold, upvotes and downvotes are bought and sold. Posts and comments are bought and sold. This group operates on many platforms.

**2) Political Actors:** ""Correct the Record"" was doxxed in John Podesta's emails and Shareblue was the bigger, badder replacement. American Independent, PACRONYM and other shill groups exist that engage in these behaviors, participating in, what amounts to, a giant RICO scheme.

**3) State Actors and their contractors.** Mossad has been heavily involved in suppressing Hunter Biden data, as well as the Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein issues. They even create cut outs that work for US Intelligence and make fake threat reports to villainize people who want to share information about political corruption in the US. SITE Intelligence Group, for example, pretends to be ""online extremists"" to justify censorship and submit threat reports on their own astroturfing to the US Government painting certain groups as ""domestic terrorists"". In fact, SITE Intelligence Group are  foreign terrorists who have weaponized the Internet against Americans.

It is important to understand shill tactics, so you can point them out, in plain language, to shut them down.

#Lies About the October Surprise

Some of you may recall that the first leak was purportedly the abandoned laptop where the data was given out in October of 2020. 

This leak was summarily dismissed as being ""Russian Disinformation"" by US Intelligence. They lied. They m
anipulated the news, social media and used a tremendous amount of Internet astroturfing to accomplish this to cover for corruption. They belong in jail.

Former CIA Agent John Sipher says he was proud to sway the election away from Trump with the “Hunter Biden Laptop Letter”. He is also a fellow at The Atlantic Council, of which Burisma was a 250k a year donor. You do the math.

https://i.redd.it/0slghyp92za91.png

Politico's KYLE CHENEY, NATASHA BERTRAND and ANDREW DESIDERIO were first at bat to blatantly lie to you. Take note, you cannot trust Politico about anything as a result of their disinformation.

https://archive.ph/jmcrg

Politico published lies when it stated:

&gt; No evidence has emerged, beyond the purported correspondence, that the former VP was involved in or profited from his son’s overseas work or abused his position to support it.

We have hundreds of emails that prove this is a false statement, pictures, videos, and even a voicemail from Joe Biden, himself. This was all on the laptop.

&gt;It’s not totally clear. The New York Post, which published the first installments of the leaked emails, claimed they proved Joe Biden met with an adviser to Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where Hunter Biden was a board member. But the emails alone don’t substantiate the claim.

It is perfectly clear, based on a single picture that was heavily censored by Big Tech, that Politico lies.

https://i.redd.it/e0dsor2soxb91.png

&gt; But there is no evidence that Hunter Biden ever struck a deal with the Chinese company, let alone that his father got a cut—income from China does not appear in Biden’s tax returns, including from the year of the alleged transaction. 

Politico lies about the Hunter Biden Chinese influence peddling because, in 2020, we already knew all about Bohai Harvest, Rosemont Seneca and the Sinopec deal proved Politico was covering for an ongoing scheme. Again, RICO charges are appropriate.

personalfinance,Taxes: How to be Tax Efficient,"Over the last several years our (43M and 40F) has increased significantly and is about to increase again.  I realizing the tax requirements coming and am starting to think about how to be tax efficient.  I do not have issue paying taxes, I am not here to complain about taxes...but I do want to work within the system to get the benefits that are offered that I would qualify for.  Thought I would list out what we are doing now and ask the subreddit if I am missing anything.

Income is now 265 salary, potential for bonuses and cap gains/divs from investments bringing that to 300k.  Next year that might go up to 300k salary.  Lets just work with the 265k salary as the rest is theoretical or more complicated.

**Deduction:** 265k salary we will most likely be taking the married standard deduction of $25,900 so that makes it 239.1k that can be taxed OASDI and Federal (we don't have state tax).

So first about deduction.  We have always taken the standard deduction as every time I have attempted to itemize deductions I don't get anywhere close to $25.9k  We own a home with a mortgage but the interest on that is just $5,400.  In our state you can also claim sales tax as a deduction but that is like 10% on sales purchases and we do not spend $259k a year on sales items.My wife and I both work from home like 80% of the time and we both have a room that acts as a home office.  I've heard you can technically deduct that but I'm not sure if you can if you are an employee and its not like your own business.  Also I know its supposed to be 100% dedicated to work but its also just our computers so we do things non-work related on the computers in there too.  We do charitable giving but as far as I can tell the max you can deduct off that is tiny, like $300.  I don't understand when I hear how people lower their taxes through charitable giving when that is the cap (not why we give btw just saying). Other than that can't think of any other deductions.  We are sort of a standard dual income with kids couple so anything I should consider to look into?

**FSA/HSA:** After assuming standard deduction its 239.1k. Then we use a child dependent care FSA at $5k and an HSA at $5k which reduces that further to 229.1k for OASDI and Federal.

**401k:** After that we max 401k reducing federal by 41k (OASDI doesn't reduce) so that would be 229.1k for OASDI and 188.1k for federal that is taxable.

**Tax-loss harvesting:** For investments I did have one that was down for the year so I sold that and bought a different fund to get the tax loss harvest of $3k but that will probably just apply to reducing gains so it wont affect income tax, just mentioning I am doing that.

**Tax Credit:** We have 2 dependent children so that should be a $4k tax credit.

After that I am out of ideas.  So 7.65% on 229.1k is $17,526 and federal on 188.1k is $32,815.  So I am getting we will end up owing $50.3k in taxes minus $4k credit so $46.3k taxes...plus anything from cap gains or 22% off bonuses.  So that would be a 17.5% effective tax I believe.  I think that is about it but thought I'd check if I am missing any other options.",finance,1660322361
personalfinance,"Credit Card Dispute, eBay/Dell claims I sent an “empty envelope”","Hello all,
 
Back in June I went shopping for a new laptop and found something through Dell’s eBay page that I liked, purchased it, and then ended up finding another for a better price from a place in-person.

Didn’t think I would have an issue opening up a return request given both of the vendors are large and I literally didn’t open the box.

I opened my request, and shortly after got a message that the return was approved but was followed up with a message that my account had been suspended for fraudulent activity. Well, I tried to chat with eBay and they told me I was no longer protected with their “buyer protection,” but I was free to send back the package.

I was slightly worried about the suspension and returning since the support seemed unhelpful, and even suggested that if I didn’t receive a refund to open a dispute with my card company.

I shipped off the item and waited for about a week after delivery before trying to see if I could get some help, but got the same unhelpful message that I was no longer protected so I would have to escalate to a dispute.

Opened a dispute, about a month goes by, and eBay responds with that Dell stated I sent an empty envelope, and a big daunting letter that my account had been suspended for high risk/fraud, when literally I was suspended before even shipping off the package. They even suggested that there has been prominent fraud taking place between Dell &amp; eBay transactions, so therefore I was guilty by association.

I’ve responded with basically entailing my shipping details with FedEx showing both package weights were the exact same (~10lb), my chats with the eBay support suggesting to open a dispute, but I’m still worried about having to eat $2000+ for a product I don’t even have anymore.

My question is for anyone with knowledge about how disputes are handled and if I have a good chance of winning.

Glad to share images of the letters via PM, but man this has really ruined my day. I surely thought eBay/Dell would verify my package details instead of just saying I sent an “empty envelope” that weighs over 10lb.",finance,1660322424
personalfinance,Anyone with recent experiences regarding refinancing (student/auto loans)?,"I'll try to keep this short - I am a recent graduate that will be starting work soon. I have about $150k in student loans (6% variable, private) and $22k auto (5.9%). Not too worried about paying these off, but I obviously want to minimize the burden as much as possible. Based on my reading, it is a great idea to refinance after \~6 months of on-time payments as you'll likely receive great reduction in rates. 

However, most of the reading I have done was dated pre-2021 which, as we know, was a very special low interest rate environment. 

As such, I am curious if anyone recently has tried refinancing and received solid offers, even with the on-going Fed rate hikes. Appreciate all insight!",finance,1660323048
business,FED is creating the next recession...,"It is AMAZING that almost no one is paying attention to how the FED is causing us all to focus only on its short term interest rate.

However, it's mostly about the FED stop purchasing long term bonds, and letting the free market decide what is the rate.

The FED is creating this entire show around interest rates in order to keep everyone focusing on that, instead of focusing on its BRUTAL intervention in the long term bond market.

This intervention is the significant part in holding the market from falling, since once the FED stops buying all these long term bonds, their rates will rise DRAMATICALLY.

This allows the FED to hike rates without TOTALLY COLLAPSING the long term bond market and the housing market with it immediately.

Although it started reducing its purchasing of long term bonds, the FED is doing it EXTREMELY SLOW, while running the ""short term interst rate"" show like it is the most important thing.

Obviously, the media and all of us are totally hypnotized by the FED interest rate show, just like a hypnotized person looking at the pendulum in hypnosis show.

And all of this is in order to show that the FED is fighting inflation.

SHOW TIME will arrive when the FED really pulls out its sticky fingers from the bond market.

CryptoCurrency,"Here's how dropping oil prices are about to reshape macros, and will help free up the crypto market from its bear market.","Preface: I'm focusing on just the crude oil aspect, but that doesn't mean oil is the only factor. There are many other factors with major effects on the market. It has just somehow placed itself in the middle of it all.

# Intro

Oil prices have been dropping from $123 all the way to $92. And for a few days were even around $88.

What happened? OPEC has been increasing its output, and has agreed to return to its 2027 roadmap of increased outputs.

Also, the blockade of oil in Libya was lifted. Libya is one of OPEC's main members, and is finally able to start filling its quotas.

But at the same time, demand has been disappointing, and has been below expectation for the summer.

Thanks in big part to China's economic turmoil, which has caused a much lower demand in oil.

For those who aren't familiar with the oil market, summer is when the demand for oil is at its highest for the year. So its typically where we see the highest prices for the year.

With continued increase output and growing supply in the coming months (thanks to several OPEC members being behind their quotas and having to play catch up), and the summer soon to be over, crude oil is likely going to continue its drop.

# Oil in relation to inflation and CPI

Energy, and primarily oil cost, has been the biggest culprit for the increase in CPI in June.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hmfcvnfiebh91.jpg?width=686&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=294dd18fb86a31026733f181b902d6d40c804f37

In fact, if you remove oil, the CPI wouldn't have increased at all in June from the previous month:

[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)

Lower oil prices, means decreasing CPI, which then translates to the Fed looking at softer rate hikes, or even lower targets.

On top of lower cost at the pump, lower oil prices also means the cost of transporting food and goods will become cheaper. Creating a double whammy in lowering inflation.

# Oil in relation to the supply chain

One of the main culprit of the economic downturn resulting from the Covid crisis, is the supply chain.

It's been in the process of recovering, but hasn't fully recovered yet.

There are several things slowing the recovery, and one of them has been high fuel costs.

With dropping oil prices, the supply chain will have an easier time at recovering.

# Oil in relation to GDP

One of the big culprit of the negative GDP in the US, since Q1, has actually been the trade deficit. A trade deficit that has suffered mainly due to Covid and the supply chain disruption.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j53eik88fbh91.png?width=621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d19a6cabb95c3faa25211e68a6746d647d805aae

Dropping oil prices will help alleviate the supply chain disruption, lower the trade deficit, and improve GDP.

We've already seen how the drop in trade deficit has helped the last GDP numbers a little. But we will only see the real effect on GDP in the next quarterly results.

# Oil in relation to the war in Ukraine

Despite heavy sanctions, Putin has been able to continue to finance the war, as well as retain power, thanks to Russia's mighty energy industry.

It's its biggest source of income.

But there is an Achilles heal.

Russia has to sell a lot of its oil at a discount to countries like China and India. They're willing to take the risk of ignoring sanctions and helping out Russia, but that comes at a premium.

Russia was able to handle giving discounts, since oil was trading so high.

But with oil prices plunging, it's getting increasingly difficult to give those discounts. And Russia is now getting a massive cut of its income.

If oil prices continue to drop, it would be the equivalent of tying a noose on Putin.

# Oil in relation to crypto

What does all this have to do with crypto?

With oil helping improve a lot of the macro economic landscape, the world will be able to finally begin its slow exit from recession. Or at the very least the United States, crypto's biggest market.

It will also free up crypto from a lot of external fear and uncertainty. Removing a lot of the fuel from the bear market.

They know we know. Their endgame is the imprisonment and extradition of anyone who writes things like Samurai (or other spicy code), and there will be nowhere to hide in the world but China and Russia and Iran, non extradition country, like Snowden.

stocks,WSJ: U.S. Consumer Sentiment Improved in August From Early Summer Low,"[Graph from article](https://i.imgur.com/Aqw4q70.png), and [link to article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-sentiment-improved-in-august-from-early-summer-low-11660323092). A TL;DR can also be found [here](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-08-12-2022/card/consumer-sentiment-rises-better-than-expected-university-of-michigan-survey-jkdORhpGIIJ5boHDAAz0).

&gt; U.S. consumer sentiment rose in early August, continuing its climb from a record low earlier this summer as inflation expectations improved.
&gt; 
&gt; The preliminary August estimate of the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index, which surveys consumer attitudes on the state of the economy, **rose 3.6 index points to 55.1 [vs. FactSet consensus estimate of 52.3] from a July reading of 51.5.** Consumer sentiment has increased since **dropping to 50 in June—the lowest reading on records dating back to 1952.**
&gt; 
&gt; Future inflation expectations improved but remained elevated, according to the report. **The median expected year-ahead inflation rate fell to 5%,** the lowest since February. And **median long-run inflation expectations held steady at 3%**, a rate above inflation ahead of the pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; A significant portion of consumers, near **48%, continue to blame inflation** for eroding living standards. Higher-income people, for example, said household finances were down and that they had less to spend on big-ticket items.
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. consumer inflation remained close to a four-decade high in July but eased slightly to an 8.5% annual pace, a modest slowdown driven by a decline in energy prices that was led by a steep decline in gasoline prices.
&gt; 
&gt; “The slowdown in inflation is probably constructive for consumer sentiment,” said Aditya Bhave, U.S. and global economist at Bank of America.
&gt; 
&gt; Prices for gasoline and food, compared with other expenses, can have a disproportionate effect on inflation expectations because consumers spend on these categories more frequently, Mr. Bhave said. **The average price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline in the U.S. this week fell below $4 in August for the first time since March**.
&gt; 
&gt; “Lower prices at the pump, combined with potential cresting in annual inflation measures, should allow sentiment to gradually ascend in the months ahead from its record low set in June,” Mahir Rasheed, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in an analyst note.
&gt; Gasoline prices can have a disproportionate effect on inflation expectations, which eased in the latest University of Michigan survey.
&gt; 
&gt; The University of Michigan report joined a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey released Monday showing that inflation expectations fell in July. The Fed believes that expectations influence inflation’s future path as workers demand raises to offset inflation and businesses feel more comfortable raising prices.
&gt; 
&gt; **Despite low levels of sentiment, households have continued to spend solidly**, a disconnect that Mr. Bhave said should eventually resolve. “At some point, that’s got to resolve and I think the popular view is that eventually spending will slow down in line with sentiment,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; **Retail sales rose 1% in June**, as shoppers weathered higher prices for goods that rose in price, including groceries and furniture. Consumers also spent more at restaurants.
&gt; 
&gt; The Commerce Department is set to release July retail sales numbers on Wednesday. “It’ll give us a really good view into the trajectory of the consumer going into the third quarter,” Mr. Bhave said.

-------

My separate comment: this metric is increasingly useless in predicting the state of the consumer if at 3.9% unemployment and expectations of 3% inflation over the next 5 years, the sentiment is worse than the worst of '08.",finance,1660327781
stocks,From here everything depends on oil prices - so where do you think they're heading?,"The price of oil has an impact on the price of almost everything. While oil doesn't have any direct impact core inflation numbers it does have a large indirect impact simply because energy is an input to almost every good and service in the economy.

We seem to be at a crossroads right now with some analyst believing oil is going higher and others believing the trend from here will be neural to lower.

I know next to nothing about the oil market, but here are a few things I believe are important:  


* **Oil demand has declined in 2022.**  
With few expectations almost every year has seen increased demand for oil but 2022 has been an exception in part due to China lockdowns, less office commuting, and some amount of demand destruction. We can say with certainty that demand for oil will recover at some point, but whether that will be in a month or 6 is less clear.
* **The US has been releasing oil for the SPR**  
In an attempt to keep oil prices down the US has been releasing oil from its strategic reserves, but these reserves are now running out. Releases from the strategic reserves will come to an end over the coming months and at some point the US will need to begin refilling these reverses, increasing demand.
* **Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues**  
Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows no signs of coming to an end anytime soon and by the end of 2022 Europe plans to end all imports of Russian oil. This is likely to reduce Russian oil output further tightening supply.
* **Secular underinvestment**  
Secular underinvestment and political grandstanding against oil companies has resulted in little spare capacity. To bring more capacity to the market will take time and requires an unlikely amount of political pragmatism.
* **Recession?**  
If global growth slows and the US enters recession this should cap demand near-term. However recession odds are largely tide to oil prices. If oil prices rise significantly so will recession odds, but increased recession odds will reduce the price of oil. In recent weeks the bond market and commodity market seem to be pricing in an increased risk of recession, however the stock market and stronger than expected earnings and economic data seem to be suggesting the opposite.
* **Oil alternatives**  
Investment in nuclear power, green energy sources and increased usage of EVs could offset some of the demand for oil in the West longer-term. China and Germany are also likely to turn to coal as near-term alternative to oil. However higher natural gas prices could also have the effect of increasing demand for oil as some industries seek alternative energy sources.

On the surface it seems at least for the next 12-24 months there will be an ongoing trade-off between economic growth and oil prices. If global economic growth accelerates too much oil prices are likely to move higher which could push up inflation and trigger a US recession from higher rates and higher prices. The bull case here is probably that China lockdowns continue until at least the end of the year and Europe reconsiders Russian oil sanctions while investing in domestic energy production. However this seems unlikely.

My guess is that if oil prices continue to fall we could see a second wave of inflation caused by in part by lower oil prices temporarily boosting confidence and causing the Fed to pause hikes prematurely. Then again I have no clue and I'd assuming the market knows more than me. Curious to hear what you guys think.",finance,1660329424

personalfinance,Direct Unsubsidized Loan of 10K to help pay for law school vs. private,"Hi all - 

I am a law student going into my final year of law school, and feel like I have made some mistakes with taking out loans. My father pushed me towards doing private loans for the last two years largely because of the lower interest rates. Right now I have about 50k in private loans. We don't qualify for unsubsidized loans, so my school (after filling out a FAFSA) has automatically awarded me 10K direct unsubsidized loan to pay for my tuition this semester. The interest rate is quite high (6.54%) but am thinking I should still take it as maybe there will be a payment pause that will be extended by Biden? Or, should I replace the 10K with my own money and then just apply the money to my last semester to prevent the interest from accruing for fall semester? 

Also- why federal &gt; private, especially as a grad student? The interest rate is so high, and I know I am limited anyways as to how much I can take out (my school limits us to 20,500 for federal loans).",finance,1660334031

personalfinance,Should I sell my house?,"Edited to add/clarify

A little backstory, I bought my house approximately ten months ago at 20 yrs old. The house I bought is a two bedroom one bathroom house with a pole barn that appraised for 81K. I purchased the house for 68k and put closing costs into escrow making my total loan amount right around 72k. The reason I was able to get it for 13k under appraisal is because I purchased from a family member. I currently owe a little under 69K as of right now. 

I feel as though I could list it at or around 110k with the updates I’ve made. Tore up all carpet, refinished hardwood, fixed the roof, painted house, gutted kitchen/dining room, etc etc. 

I was recently laid off due to no fault of my own. Employer was not paying me at our agreed upon rate for five and a half months. 

I quickly found a new job that pays the same hourly, but with more consistent hours. I no longer have any savings, and I am a single mother. I now work at a title company and see interest rates are raising a good amount, but also see the housing market is slowly starting to decline in my area. In 2015 my house appraised for a little over 50k and in 2021 it was at 81k with only minor updates. I fear I will lose my ass if I hold onto it. 

I also am in dire need of a new vehicle. If I sell my house, I would no longer qualify for a new mortgage loan due to not having a long enough work history given I just started a new job. Which means I would be forced to rent, and my monthly expenses could almost double with rent and a new car payment. 

Is it a good idea to sell my house and make right around 40k off of it, settle at an apartment for a year, and buy another house when the housing market inevitably crashes? Or should I hold onto what I have, and ride out this tight budget I am currently working with?

My debt including mortgage and credit cards is right around 71K. My monthly expenses total about $1200 a month including bills and average unexpected expenses. If I sold the house, I could pay off credit cards and be debt free, but would again acquire a debt when purchasing a new car that would still be less than the debt I’m in now.

# **Dow closes up 400 points, S&amp;P 500 rises for fourth straight week as investors warm to cooler inflation - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/11/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks rose sharply on Friday, clinching the fourth straight positive week for the S&amp;P 500 as investors celebrated signs that inflation may be peaking.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 424.38 points, or 1.27%, to close at 33,761.05. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.73% to finish at 4,280.15, and the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.09% to 13,047.19.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rose 3.26% on the week, notching its longest weekly winning streak since November 2021. The Dow was up 2.92% for the week, while the Nasdaq Composite moved higher by 3.08%. For the Nasdaq, it was also the fourth positive week in a row.
*****
&gt; The averages have been boosted by positive news on the inflation front. The consumer price index was flat from June to July, thanks in large part to falling gas prices, which lowered headline inflation. The producer price index showed a surprise decline. On Friday, import prices also fell more than expected.
*****
&gt; This week’s moves have extended a market rally off its mid-June lows. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 16.7% since the lows, and has cut its losses from the peak in half. The Dow had gained nearly 13% and the Nasdaq Composite has rebounded 22.6%.
*****
&gt; The positive news has bolstered investor confidence, leading some to believe that the recent gains are more than a typical bear market rally.
*****
&gt; “We are not arguing that the market will make new highs this year (we are more in the trading range camp), but we would not be surprised to see a run toward the highs as inflation eases and the Fed slows the pace of rate hikes,” Michael Darda, chief economist and market strategist at MKM Partners, said in a note.

&gt; # VIX and Volatility Have Historically Increased August through October

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/68b1e7f12dc8ccdadd077b69e5bd7c7a/17946972bd670247-1d/s500x750/14cedaf89a9fd48dad4f61e19abee9bc8415ae56.jpg))**

&gt; Historically speaking, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) tends to reach its seasonal low in late-July or early August and slowly begin climbing towards its seasonal high, usually in the month of October. This may be due to the fact that the two worst performing months of the year, August and September (by average performance) precede it. VIX’s seasonal pattern can be seen in the following chart.

&gt; October’s volatility peak is also visible when closing daily percent changes are analyzed. October has hosted the most daily moves in excess of 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 7% and even 10% since 1930. Do not fret over the ten times S&amp;P 500 has moved more than 10% in a single day. Six of the ten occurrences were way back in the 1930’s. Only four have occurred more recently and out of those, two were actually positive days (10/13/2008 +11.58% and 10/28/2008 +10.79%). Only three of the ten days with moves in excess of 10% were negative days: 3/18/1935 –10.06%, 10/19/1987 –20.47% and 3/16/2020 –11.98%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c97cdfde9fdb3ead4650f09a5bfeeadc/17946972bd670247-31/s500x750/d7fc2cba796719dd3d486147337a13ab3fbffb73.jpg))**

&gt; Putting all but the +/-1% moves table data into a bar chart adds a quick confirmation of October’s heightened volatility versus all other months. Volatility’s trend can also be observed as the frequency of sizable daily moves tends to decline from March through July then an increase in August lasting until October.

&gt; # High Short Interest Revival

&gt; As we detailed in last night's Closer, whatever name that it might be given—meme stocks, yolo trades, or ""stonks""—there has been a trend recently in which there has been strong performance of highly volatile names loved by the most risk tolerant retail investor. That is roughly a year and a half to the day of the meme stock mania where highly shorted names saw massive short squeezes driven by the retail community.

&gt; Since the mid-June lows, highly shorted names have again been outperforming. Below we show the chart of an index covering the 100 most highly shorted stocks going back to early 2020. The vast majority of 2020 gains have been erased, however, this index has also risen 46% since its June 16th low (the same date as the broader market's low). On a relative basis, the most heavily shorted stocks have been outperforming the Russell 3,000 in that time resulting in the relative strength line to break out of the downtrend that has been in place since the peak of the meme stock mania in late January of last year. That being said, the index itself has much further to go in order to break out of its downtrend off of that high in price.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081022-SIPF-1.png))**

&gt; Below we show the stocks within the Russell 3,000 that currently have the highest levels of short interest as of the end of July. The only stock with more than 50% of its float sold short is Torrid Holdings (CURV). The next highest is a company that frequently finds itself high up on the list of highly shorted stocks: Dillard's (DDS). While those readings are elevated, they are well below what had been the most heavily shorted stock a month and a half ago. As of the mid-June update, Redbox (RDBX) had an extremely elevated reading on short interest that was closing in on 100%. Today that reading has collapsed back down to a still elevated but less extreme 41.5%. We would also note, however, that RDBX is a messy story at the moment in the midst of an acquisition (confirmed to go through in the past 24 hours) with the potential to save the company from bankruptcy.

&gt; Other notables on the list of most heavily shorted stocks include grill-maker Weber (WEBR), Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), Upstart (UPST), Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV), Beyond Meat (BYND), Groupon (GRPN), and Nikola (NKLA).

&gt; Below is a look at price charts for most of the heavily shorted stocks listed in the table above. While many of these names are up huge since mid-June, the gains hardly register on six-month charts because they got hit so hard in the first half of the year.

&gt; # The Nature of Risk

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2e7c24f3af99c0197abcfb74fd392c6c/e2f796e9605c0091-8f/s500x750/d2cc94d79f2dab634b5a2cb53aa808454c4d29f0.jpg))**

&gt; Here is a little sneak peek into the 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac from Justin Mamis’ The Nature of Risk that is remarkably apropos now. 2022 continues to track this Sentiment Cycle rather closely.

&gt; Just before we presented at the CMT Association’s 2022 Annual Symposium veteran technical analyst Helene Meisler shared Mamis’ Sentiment Cycle along with her analysis of where in the cycle the market was at the time at the end of April 2022—in that brief pause between disbelief and panic (green circle).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f7776586866f6c633e54944732814347/e2f796e9605c0091-7e/s500x750/5179db6b975ce431bbac4c5ce8484a90afacdd84.jpg))**

&gt; Comparing the current chart of the S&amp;P 500 below we’ve highlighted in yellow that area of disbelief Ms. Meisler pointed out in April. The June low correlates quite well with Panic and we are now hitting the first level of Anxiety.

&gt; This dovetails with our seasonal/cycle outlook for a lower low or retest of the lows over the next three months as we are in the worst two months of the year and are smack dab in the “Weak Spot” of the 4-Year Cycle from Q2 to Q3 of the midterm election year, which sets up the Sweet Spot and the Quadrennial Rally.

&gt; We will know more tomorrow after the big CPI report comes out. If CPI cools considerably that would suggest we have passed the Panic point and are on the other side of Discouragement and climbing the Wall of Worry toward Anxiety before a higher low at Aversion.

&gt; # Inflation Still Top Of Mind for Small Business

&gt; While fewer respondents to this month's NFIB small business survey reported that they observed higher prices, inflation continues to be a front and center concern. The percentage of respondents reporting inflation as their biggest problem has risen further to another record high of 37%. That completely erased June's drop down to 34%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080922-NFIB-MIP-1a.png))**

&gt; While broad inflation is currently the most pressing problem, other inflation-related measures also rose in July. The percentage of firms reporting cost of labor as their single most important problem rose to 9%, although that is still below the record high reading of 13% at the end of last year.

&gt; While we often combine that reading with the percentage of responses reporting quality of labor as the biggest issue as a gauge of labor market health, the latter problem dropped 2 percentage points to net out the rise in cost of labor. On a combined basis, these two concerns are now tied with March at 30% for the lowest level since January 2021 (28%).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080922-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

&gt; One other combined reading that we often check in on is the percentage of respondents reporting government requirements or taxes as their biggest issues. Over the past few decades, Republican administrations have usually coincided with lower readings whereas Democrat administrations would see a higher reading. With inflation concerns surging this year, a historically low share of businesses are concerned about government action. The combined reading fell to another record low of 16% in July with the entirety of that drop on account of a 3 percentage point decline in government requirements and red tape.

&gt; # Risk of Default Declining

&gt; We like to use credit default swaps (a product that pays out investors if a reference company defaults) to track risk premiums in the corporate bond market. When risk premiums rise, credit default swaps get more expensive, and the spread implied between risk free rates and CDS rises.

&gt; As recession fears intensified throughout the first half of 2022, both the investment grade and high yield credit default swap indices skyrocketed, gaining 106.7% and 110.5% between the start of the year and the highs, respectively. However, earnings were not as bad as feared, economic data is starting to come in better than expected, gas prices have fallen, and CPI seems to have peaked in June. All of this has caused substantial declines in CDS index spreads, with the risk premium associated with each falling by about a quarter since their summer peak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/CDX-IG-2-081122.jpg))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/CDX-HY-081122.jpg))**

&gt; Although CDX High Yield's spread is well off of its highs, it is still above the average over the last ten years, implying a still elevated risk related to recession and potential defaults. We can also tie CDS indices to the performance of actual corporate bonds. The option-adjusted spread (a proxy for the credit risk over risk-free rates for a given investment) for high yield bonds in the ""cash"" market has a 0.88 correlation to CDS over the past decade. Notably, the CDX HY spread remains above its long-term average, while that High Yield Average OAS is below its average, implying investors may be getting under-compensated for the risk they are taking in the high yield debt market.

&gt; # Normalizing Sentiment

&gt; Sentiment has continued to head back towards more normal levels as equities press higher. The latest reading from the AAII on the percentage of investors that are bullish on the S&amp;P 500 over the next six months reached the highest level since March. At 32.2%, bullish sentiment is now only 5.5% below the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The reading on bearish sentiment meanwhile has dropped to 36.7% which is also the lowest reading since the end of March; the last time this reading was below 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Although both bullish and bearish sentiment are closing in on one another, bears continue to outnumber bulls. The bull-bear spread rose to -4.5 this week extending the streak of negative readings to 19 weeks long. At the moment, that is the third longest streak on record and would need to continue for at least three weeks more to tie the second-longest streak on record of 22 weeks ending in December 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; While the bull-bear spread remains negative for the AAII survey, other sentiment surveys have been showing more bullish sentiment. The Investors Intelligence survey has had a positive bull-bear spread for three weeks in a row now, and the NAAIM exposure index has shown investment managers have been quick to add exposure to equities in recent weeks. Standardizing these three survey results (measuring each one in how many standard deviations from the long-term average they are), the NAAIM and Investors Intelligence surveys are now back into positive territory. In other words, these two surveys are actually showing sentiment as having moved slightly above what has been the historical norm. Meanwhile, the AAII reading is far more negative even if it is trending higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; Additionally, those are the first positive readings in some time. For the NAAIM index, the z-score has not seen a positive reading in 15 weeks. That is the longest stretch without a positive reading since the first quarter of 2016 and prior to that, there have only been a handful of other streaks that have gone on as long. For the Investors Intelligence survey, it was an even rarer streak ending at 29 weeks long. That was the longest since one that went on for roughly a year and ended in May 2009. Prior to that, you would have to go all the way back to 1995 to find a longer streak.

&gt; Then there are the AAII results. Still going at 32 weeks long, the z-score has only been negative for as many consecutive weeks once in the survey's history, and that was during 2020. All of this is to say that the AAII survey has been leaning more pessimistically than other surveys even as overall sentiment has largely made its way back to historically normal levels.

stocks,Can we finally declare the end of the bear market?,"# Stock Rally Builds With Longest Weekly Run of 2022: Markets Wrap

* US consumer sentiment rises to three-month high on outlook
* BofA says cash racing to stocks, bonds as inflation fears ease

 

Stocks finished the week on solid footing, with traders assessing  whether an inflation slowdown could soon make the Federal Reserve reduce  the pace of its most-aggressive tightening campaign in decades and  prevent a hard landing.

Defying the crowd of skeptics who dubbed  the rebound a bear-market rally or short-covering, the S&amp;P 500 had a  fourth straight week of gains, the longest such run since November. The  gauge recouped more than [50%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/out-of-the-woods-the-s-p-500-recovers-50-of-year-s-drawdown)  of the losses it notched between its January peak and June nadir, and  approached its 200-day average -- a line crossed by the Russell 2000 of  small caps. The Nasdaq 100 pushed further beyond its technical  bull-market threshold, following a surge of over 20% from June lows.

As  equities climbed, Wall Street’s fear gauge crumbled. The Cboe  Volatility Index slumped back below 20, the average level since its  inception. The VIX notched its eighth straight week of declines, the  longest losing stretch since 2019. Meantime, the S&amp;P 500’s 14-day  relative strength index (RSI) topped 70 -- which is seen by some traders  as one indication of an overbought market.

The next few weeks will be crucial in determining the  sustainability of the rally. With the earnings season almost over,  economic reports mixed at best and many Fed speakers unwillling to sound  too dovish, some analysts see the chances of a breather. To Matt Maley  at Miller Tabak, stocks are indeed getting overbought on a  very-short-term basis, so a decline or sideways move “would not be the  worst development in the world.”

For now, flows have been robust. [Global equity funds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/bofa-says-cash-racing-to-stocks-bonds-as-inflation-fears-ease)  lured $7.1 billion in the week through Aug. 10, Bank of America Corp.  strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote, citing EPFR Global data. Bond  funds had an intake of $11.7 billion, while $4.3 billion was pulled out  of cash.

“The music hasn’t stopped,” said Matt Bartolini, State Street  Global Advisors’ head of SPDR Americas Research. “The labor market  continues to be positive, earnings growth continues to be positive. So  largely, if there is a recession, it’s going to be relatively shallow.”

Lindsey  Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally, said the market’s  about to enter what is often considered a “sketchy period.” 

“Historically,  September and October are notoriously volatile, sometimes featuring big  stock market drops,” she wrote. “After a more than 10% rally since  mid-June, a bearish seasonal trend is good reason to temper  expectations. I expect this market to continue to be reactionary and  driven by headlines until we have more clarity on where exactly  inflation is headed as we approach 2023.”

Data Friday showed [US consumer sentiment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/us-consumer-sentiment-rises-to-three-month-high-on-outlook)  climbed to a three-month high on firmer expectations about the economy  and personal finances. Inflation expectations were mixed, with consumers  boosting their longer-term views for prices slightly, while reducing  their year-ahead outlook for costs.

Fed  Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin was the latest official to  call for continued rate increases, while acknowledging that this week’s  inflation figures were encouraging. His San Francisco counterpart Mary  Daly told [Bloomberg Television](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/fed-s-daly-says-cooling-inflation-is-welcome-but-no-victory-yet)  that the slowdown in price pressures may mean it’s appropriate for the  central bank to slow the pace of hikes to 50 basis points in September--  but noted the fight against inflation is far from over.

“The Fed  is unlikely to claim victory until inflation reaches target, but recent  data support our view that peak Fed hawkishness is behind us,” Bank of  America strategists wrote in a note to clients.

personalfinance,Financial Planning for a Teenager,"I'm 18 years old and working from home. I live in Asia and I'm getting paid in Euros since I work for an overseas company. My income right now is about RM4500 per month. If there are any bonuses (rarely), my salary will be RM15K (Malaysia).

I'm planning to head to university in about 2 weeks' time and work part-time at my current job and I expect my cost to go up (RM1,000 for rent/mo + RM1,500 &lt;---- from usual spending on food)

I have RM16K in Savings (in case of emergencies).

**I was thinking of investing my salary as planned below :**

**30% into ETFs (60% into S&amp;P500 and 40% into NASDAQ for potentially larger gains)**

**Already invested $3000 (and in profit of 12.08%)**

**15% into EPF (something similar to a Roth IRA) with an average annual return rate of 6%**

**20% into Savings (Peaked at RM16K and the rest is invested into ETFs)**

**20% into Needs (food, transportation costs, rent)**

**15% into Wants (Going outside with friends, clothes, new phone, watches (crazy about watches))**  


**FYI: I have about RM14,000 ($3100) invested in the Crypto Markets and I am currently at break even. I plan to hold on to crypto for the next 3 years but stopped accumulating more.**

My parents are not paying for my school fees since I do earn the most out of all my family members. My school fees and 25K (for Foundation 1 year) and 110K (for Degree 3 years).

So I need to gather 135K in funds over 4 years to manage. The reason why I peak my Savings at RM16K is so that at least some of my money will be generating profits over the 4 years.

What do you guys think? I'm gonna take a loan at a rate of 1% per year as well to help out my student tuition fees. I think this loan is actually useful since it beats inflation compared to the interest rate increase.

Any tips or recommendations will be helpful.",finance,1660355808

personalfinance,Cash payment vs. 12 months interest free credit card?,"I know this sounds like a homework question, but it's actually a legitimate one since I recently purchased a Macbook Pro. I got a new 12 month 0% interest credit card from Best Buy, but I noticed that unlike Apple Card which charges equally like Scenario 2 below, it gives you the flexibility of paying just minimum payments of $30 for the next 11 months and paying the whole sum at the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I pay cash, it's $2000. 

If I pay with 12 months installment, there's no interest for the next 12 months, with $30 minimum payment every month.

What's the interest rate that we use to discount the installment payments? Is it 10-Year Treasury?

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 1:** 

$30 payments for the next 11 months ( $330) and a lump sum of $1670 at month 12.

$166.67 equal payments for the next 12 months.",finance,1660358822
cardano,"Venture Capital, Crypto, and Cardano","I've been following the space pretty closely for some time now, and wanted to give back with some discussion.

The crypto space as a whole has a big problem to address, Venture Capital (or VCs for short).  In short, these folks usually come into various industries and speak with early stage companies in hopes of beefing up the balance sheet, accelerating growth, providing liquidity to founders, and ultimately making a return.  This usually ends up being a double edged blade - either the company does extremely well with the added firepower, or they flop in the next few years as the fund mandate demands results and distributions.

How does this pertain to crypto, and Cardano in particular?  Well as you may have seen, there is no shortage of institutional presence in the industry as a whole.  In fact, many retail folks *welcome* them in as it means green days are ahead.  The problem that I usually see is, their existence as an entity, or assortment of entities runs as an antithesis to the original cypherpunk / crypto philosophy of decentralization, while at the same time still strengthening whoever they partner with, albeit **in their own way.**  Lets run some scenarios.  Mind you, VC has a presence many if not most cryptos, even in some Cardano projects IIRC.

- Crypto A, whether a first mover or 3rd mover, has VC funding.  

- Crypto B is purely community led, and has refused VC funding

- VCs, now that they have a vested interest in seeing A become the ""winner"", deploy vast amounts of capital to repeatedly and endlessly bombard B with FUD attacks, DDoS attempts, scandal research, literally anything you can think of that can be used as a legitimate or illegitimate arrow against B.

- B suffers from this constant barrage via direct price action, developer adoption, regulatory reframing, retail word of mouth... all re-funnelling back to price action which affects funding and sustainability of core development.  Once that goes you either already have a feature complete, competitive blockchain... or a limping chain that will be dead eventually aside from the most devout followers. Lets assume the latter.

- VCs, now reigning in the glorious victory of A, proceed to begin its exit strategy to meet its fund distributions.  Either they release it all into the market, pandemonium ensues, and therefore a key institutional opportunity and increased centralization, or the assets are taken up by another institution in a ""pass-the-hat"" deal. Either way, what do you end up with?  Centralization with a large party having an outsized voice (assuming stake based governance) on what happens with that chain or project.

- As an aside,  VCs often true to form participate in predatory LP token extraction and hopping. This is where a new DEX or DeFi protocol emerges, VC comes in and buys up / mines all the token incentives, dumps, and leaves for greener pastures... often destroying the incentive structure of the protocol in its wake (like a parasite leaving a host cell once its been beefed up using its resources).  This happened a lot in Ethereum is how the concept of protocol-owned liquidity came from (which is interesting but not a perfect solution for that paricular sub segment).  

This continues to be a problem in the space, and while the best solution would probably be to collectively say NO to VC and remain pure, not only is the allure of large $$ extremely alluring to devs that need to pay their staff and/or to realize some early rewards for their efforts, they and the community must face the reality that they will become retainer to another protocol make them a semi-centralized entity akin to themselves, and attack in return. Personally I do feel like this is one of those cases (centralized vs decentralized) where the following holds true: You either win the right way, or survive long enough to decimate the opposition, all the while becoming your antithesis in the process.  For the criticisms I may have given Charles in the past, it is important to take note and replicate what he is doing to keep alive in the brutal war that will only continue to worsen as blockchain becomes more ubiquitous in our society and VC and other interested parties doubles down on looking out for number one - and that is to relentlessly keep building and putting the **good** word out.

personalfinance,Should I trade in my car now or pay it off first?,"I've been wanting to trade in my car for about a year now. I currently owe roughly $1800 left on it. I really like the car but it has a recurring issue that I can't seem to fix; the gas mileage is horrible. We're talking maybe 120 miles per tank. I used to get nearly 230 when I first bought it in 2018. 

I've taken it to two different local mechanics who ""fixed"" the problem but then the issue would come back a month later. The last time I took it in to get this looked at I went to the Kia dealership I bought the car from and their solution worked for about 2 months. 

Every mechanic has confirmed there are no leaks anywhere on the car and no cracks in the fuel tank, so despite all of these other repairs I can't figure out what is wrong with my car. For those curious it's a 2011 Kia Soul. 

I really like this car and I'm even considering getting another Soul, or at least another Kia. But I wanna trade this one in either ASAP or as soon as I pay it off. Which of those options would be better? Or would it be better to use something like Carvana and then take that cash as a down payment?

Carvana estimated my car's value at like $7500 about a month ago, but I know the car market is pretty scuffed right now with prices being ridiculous, even for used cars. (PC gamer here, GPU market is the same way.) 

Some additional information:

I pay $200 a month on my car and have never made a late payment.

I can technically pay off the whole car right now with a chunk of my savings account, but I'd prefer not to do that in case of an emergency. 

Question: If the dealership/Carvana asks about problems with the car, am I obligated to tell them about the gas problem since it's not obvious until you drive it for a few days? Or could I get into legal trouble over that if they find the problem later on?",finance,1660392066

3. perform exploratory analysis
4. perform one hot encoding for categorical variables
5. perform rescaling (minmax, standardization etc)
6. use basic ml models like knn, rfm, logistic regression etc to train and test (kfold etc)
7. get different metrics and interpretation (f1, accuracy, precision, recall etc)
8. make confusion matrix

economy,TPI Composites (wind blade manufacturers) improve Q2 net margin loss to (1.2%) compared to (8.7%) last year - total cash up 26% YoY and liquidity improves,"TPI Composites Inc (NSQ: TPIC) manufactures and sells composite wind blades, and related precision molding and assembly systems to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). It operates in the United States, Asia, Mexico, Europe, Africa, India, and the Middle East. The company was founded in 1968 and is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Although their revenue decreased 1.41% to $452.4m compared to last year's quarter - their net losses improved by 86.2% in the same timeframe with a loss of ($6m).

As a result, their net margin loss improved from (8.7%) to (1.2%), hovering just below the breakeven threshold.

TPI Composites has been consistently growing its revenue and has a yearly growth streak of four years since FY17. The company has also been previously profitable in FY17 and FY18, having achieved a small net income of $39m and $5.28m, respectively - before net losses began in FY19 onwards.

In the short term, the current assets and current liabilities can measure a company's ability to pay short-term debt or obligations due within one year. TPI Composite's short-term liquidity percentage in Q2 was 69.6% (current liabilities/current assets) - which represents unfavourably high levels of short-term liabilities. Current assets and current liabilities were $620m and $431m, respectively.

However, compared to last year's quarter current assets were actually up 11.2%, while current liabilities decreased by 1.7%. Last year's short-term liquidity percentage was 78.7%.

Investors should still note that only nine months ago, current liabilities had actually become higher than their current assets. All eyes will be on whether this year's Q3 can avoid the same problem occurring again and ensuring this isn't a cyclical financial strain.

In the long-term, total assets for Q2 climbed 4.4% to $982m from levels one year ago - while total liabilities decreased by 1.8% to $431m. This actually represented a much more controlled long-term liquidity of 43.9% than compared with short-term, as well as improving from last year's 46.7% - however, with uncertainty around where interest rates are heading, companies should be aiming to continue improving their liquidity.

Total cash levels have actually increased 26% since last year to $155m, slightly relieving investor fears of the company increasing debt or potential share dilution if cash was urgently needed. To have increased total assets and total cash, while decreasing total liabilities simultaneously is a remarkable achievement (if it doesn't reverse).

TPI Composites release its Q3 earnings for the year on approximately 07 November, 2022.

Locating victims under the rubble is a precarious process. While current rescue devices are bulky, unreliable in data transmission and inaccurate in sensing survivors.

The device can crawl through tight spaces and is equipped with a life-detecting algorithm that uses data from the environment to help rescue personnel optimize their search for survivors. An artificial intelligence-based sensor system mounted on top of the robot hears, smells, and looks for trapped survivors through a microphone, carbon dioxide and an infrared camera.

Unlike traditional robots built with a rigid form, Sleek uses air pressure to grow and extend its tube-shaped body to navigate fallen buildings.

stocks,I think too many people are too confident in this current rally,"I keep seeing people showing concern this is a bull trap and then everyone tells them that this mentality is going to get them in a state of regret. The thing is, a major recession is always accompanied by some of the largest bull rallies on the way down and accompanied by characteristics that people never think that it’s going to go down again.

What seems obvious to me is if you look at the market, over the pandemic it skyrocketed in the fastest and largest bull market in history, but meanwhile there were global lockdowns and businesses shutting down left and right, the government went into accelerated debt and all this growth was literally free money being pumped into the markets from the Fed. Where do people get the idea that a major correction isn’t due/over? Where is the abundance of production and profits that would justify the market still being this high? (Especially if prices and evaluations are quantified next to inflation, the real inflation is also much higher than the manipulated 8.5%)

While the job market is doing relatively well, there are still reports of large layoffs happening and showing no sign of slowing. We have had literally One single good report but anyone that read the report saw that food, shelter and energy were still up, and food shortage issues are expected to get worse toward the end of the year.

But the biggest hint of all is that the Fed still has made no signs of a pivot and I think a lot of people are confusing inflation being past it’s peak with the actual issue being resolved. Supply chains are barely recovered, inflation around the world is way worse than America and if their economies hit hyper inflation their contributions to supply chains will only get worse.

I’m just going to say it: there is no full resolutions to justify the markets at these prices. There are too many signs showing this is an emotional (greed) bull rally trap. None of the underlying problems have been solved, monetary policy will not change until at least 4-5% inflation, and instead of the Russian situation getting better- intel shows when winter comes it will only get worse and China/Taiwan is now a potential new threat. Maybe this rally will last another month or so, but new all time highs are probably not until after another downturn. Thoughts?",finance,1660399114

stocks,What's happening in the market cont...,"A few months back I wrote the post below on where I think the market is heading. It's aged pretty well and seeing all the FOMO posts recently made me want to post a quick update.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uzurrf/whats\_happening\_in\_the\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uzurrf/whats_happening_in_the_market/)

TLDR from previous post: Market rallies on the back of strong earnings until \~3Q of this year. At this time, people will start to talk about FOMO since they missed the bottom. At the same time, consumer demand begins to contract and the death spiral begins. This will result in a strong recession in 2023 and we will see the bottom only when the fed steps in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I think the future of the market all comes down to inflation. Will supply recover to meet the continued strong demand, or will that only happen through demand destruction with further rate increases? If supply does recover without demand destruction, we could achieve the soft landing, which is what the market is pricing in now imo. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I see with the soft landing, even if achieved, is the lack of slack in the current economy. We have the lowest unemployment in decades, and I don't see that going any lower. This means that both demand will stall at current levels (only grow in line with wage growth) and productivity will stall outside of efficiency through innovation. IMO, this means that if we achieve the soft landing, the future of the economy still isn't great. We will only see growth through inflation, and there isn't much room at all to grow real GDP. The FED will have to play a tight rope of managing money supply so inflation doesn't go rampant, without destroying demand to the point of the recessionary death spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

The FED may be able to walk that tight rope for a while but at some point it's going to give. Also, once the consumer starts to slow spending, the death spiral will begin on its own, regardless of inflation. Never underestimate the American consumer to spend money they don't have on things they don't need -- but I do think we will see weakening in consumer spending later this year as the cost of inflation catches up to consumer balance sheets. This could start the death spiral by Q4 this year and bring on a real recession. If they continue to spend, and inflation eases, then this death spiral could be pushed off for who knows how long, but ultimately I think will occur in the next year or two due to reasons mentioned previously.

We live off of my salary for the most part with his base salary to supplement (mainly our travel bug if we are being honest). He gets pretty great bonus checks ranging anywhere from 5k-30k with his sales job so we have been throwing those into the markets while things are down. My question for y'all is: should we use those checks for the mortgage to get 20% equity in the home and thus knock off the PMI OR keep investing it?

I currently have \~ $200k in equity in my home ($277k remaining on mortgage and can sell for $480k). Mortgage rate is 2.875%.

  
If I sell, I would use \~$50-100k of the cash to put towards a new home and invest the remaining funds in something different (purchasing local rental property in new state or some other TBD investments). I do not need the cash from the sale for purchasing my new home because I already have money for down payment and have been preapproved for a new mortgage even when considering my current home a debt with no income from it.

  
I can get $2500/month in rent with my current property, and I would plan on having it looked after by a property manager with a 8-10% fee. My current mortgage + HOA payment together are $1750, and the area my home is currently in has a very strong rental market.

  
However, my thoughts are that with higher interest rates now, if I have to finance a larger amount for my new home I'd end up spending a good chunk of change on the interest for the mortgage.  
Additionally, since this questions seems to come up often, I have in my early 30s, and this would be my first investment property.

personalfinance,Rent or buy? Looking for some more opinions… [Raleigh],"Hey all!

I know this conversation has been done to death, but any input/thoughts would be appreciated.

Here’s the gist:

Currently making ~93k a year in a team lead position in tech in San Diego. Interviewing next week for a PM role in a new department based out of Raleigh, which would likely pay 115-120k + stock bonuses. My wife currently makes ~64k but after our move would likely make closer to 40k. (She’s paid pretty well for what she does)

We currently have 25k liquid savings, 33k accessible via 401k loan, and if offered the position I would likely receive a 10k relocation bonus as well, and all moving costs would be covered in addition. They also cover the first month’s rent or mortgage. 

No credit card debt, mainly my student loans which are still cruising ~65k with a 4% interest rate. 

We’re considering whether we rent short term (6-12 months) upon moving, or just aim to buy right off the bat. 

Obviously, interest rates are bananas, so I’m not super eager about jumping into a purchase atm. It’s also an entirely new state/area so I feel like some time to get acclimated makes sense. 

On the other hand, it would be hard for me to get settled in knowing a move is on the horizon. And it’s hard for my wife to shake the idea that renting is “throwing money away” vs building equity/ownership in a house. I can see both sides honestly. 

Just curious if anyone else is in a similar boat. I don’t expect house prices to swing either direction in the coming year, but I’m hopeful interests rates simmer a bit.

ethereum,TC: A rational action plan,"Good morning / afternoon / nights everyone. I'm writing this because of the huge rage that lies in the air since the TC censorship came up, only incresing with the arrest of a innocent man, that has everyone one of us (DeFi believers) pissed off. 

I want to share my main point of view on this maybe preventing someone from doing something they'll regret later. I'm most specifically talking about the people who wants to straight up challenge federal law by doing stuff like masivelly using Tornado Cash, or some other random stuff like that driven by full hate hype train and payback hunger. We can be a lot more rational than that and strike 10x better but we need to be patient, breaking federal law is no small thing, specially in the US.

We all know that sadly Tornado Cash is the first but not the last proyect to fall by some conservative government regulations. Specially in the Ethereum eco-system, the home of most DeFi proyects. Ethereum is driven by a philosophy that can (and i hope, will) change the world as we know it, but of course there will be casualties along the way, imagine that some random nerds from one day to another create some technology that sustrains your control and power over the mases, the US government only did what their survival instinct dictated them to do to keep their power. 

Now, this is a war declaration, i agree 100% on those that are super pissed off and want to massively strike back because of the hate this kind of injustices cause. But we need to be smart. The first step to keep sustraining power to them is stop using centralized infrastructure. There's no true  decentralization if the proyects are hosted in centralized platforms. Thats just centralized ""decentralization"".  
There has been a VERY good post in this sub with most details about how to migrate to dex platforms, for the code, repositories and even the nodes. You can check it  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/wl98rl/the_tornado_cash_opportunity_how_we_can_learn/).  
Also, if you are a contributor (like me) i would suggest to try to contribute as anonymous as possible, maybe creating trash GitHub accounts that you then discard, avoiding KYC in every situation. If you run a proyect, do as Satoshi Nakamoto and use a pseudo-alias to not be exposed.  


I really hope the Ethereum Foundation to reorder the priorities in the roadmap with what happened, considering at least in some point to develop a lightweight client. And if that happens, run that client, that way you would be helping to migrate from centralized nodes. Currently centralized nodes represent roughly 50% of the nodes of Ethereum. That simply cannot still that way if we want DeFi to be truly decentralized and not some cool concept.    


As a last point, and i really want to stress this out, BE PATIENT. Ethereum isn't even 10 years old, the eco-system is still very very young, and a lot of things need to happen. But as history as taught us every time it happened, human will always wins, if a new finnancial system has to replace the traditional one. It will happen no matter how much they try to avoid that from happening.",cryptocurrency,1660425249

stocks,Are you buying at these levels?,"Hello all,

Cheers to the bull on recent market rally.

I have been on sidelines since Dec-Jan and I have enough cash ready to deploy. I am not trying to time the bottom but waiting for better economic environment. I did not buy in June thinking it would drop more and then I got busy in July with my new baby. I barely checked market and news in July and first week of August until last Monday when QQQ was 315 and SPY was 410 and I said to myself this will likely pullback and then I will start buying, but I was definitely wrong and market kept ripping.

Now everything is overvalued again. Forward S&amp;P 500 P/E is close to 19 which is high while Fed is hiking. AAPL is few dollars to ATH. MSFT is close to 290. TSLA is 900.

I am not an expert, but I cannot wrap my head around this massive rally. Fed is still hiking. Inflation seemed to have peaked but too soon to tell before August CPI.  However, it does not seem we will revisit June bottom, and that is ok, but I am hoping for a pullback in S&amp;P to below 4000.

My current plan is to start small DCA'ing next week and wait until September (most volatile month and before next fed meeting) and start buying at lump sums if S&amp;P 500 goes below 4000.

&amp;#x200B;

But are you buying (not scalping) at these levels? and if so, why do you think market might further rip from here while Fed is still hiking with no signs of pivot and economy is still slowing?

stocks,When do you sell stocks in this environment?,"Traditionally, I've always followed the valuation level sell strategy, having an exit plan for stocks that reach specific P/E, P/B, P/S levels.

However, with the market being so volatile during the last year, I'm trying to reevaluate my approach. They say you should never trade ""news"", however, trading news in this environment was quite beneficial for me: from Disney to Charge Point, I was able to secure solid 20-30% gains for pretty much my entire ""gaming"" portfolio during the last 2 weeks.

And here is where I'm stuck now: market is very illogical and relying on fundamentals isn't beneficial in the short term.

Would it be a better thing to utilize ""take profit"" strategy on individual stocks, securing specific profit levels on all the plays made on the ""trading news"", then reinvest those gains into stable broad ETF, like SCHD which performs relatively good in current environment and is more protected from loses in case there is another drop so that I can wait a better buying opportunity for risky plays when the market gets red?

P. S. I now have about 50k in my Roth IRA and HSA accounts (starting from 20k in the beginning of the year) and use it exclusively for all the risky ""news based"" trading during the last 6 months, so tax issues aren't a concern for this specific case.

I'm not a bear, but I'm almost confident that many stocks would drop again in fall and winter (Fed is still gonna be proactive, European winter is a shit show, etc). It feels like reinvesting all the gains into more stable ETF could be a good strategy in this environment.

P. P. S. I know that timing the market is usually frowned upon, but I was super lucky this year getting huge gains in both brokerage and retirement accounts by following the stories about Ukraine, inflation, Netflix earnings and all the other fun things.

CryptoCurrency,I believe we're going to see a large sell-off this week,"I'm going to keep this concise and simple. Fundamentals and technical analysis, the two tools you can use to make projections.

**Fundamentals:**

Bitcoin (btc) has no inherent value as of today. It is also, to my knowledge, impossible to calculate an inherent value for bitcoin. It is entirely driven by speculation. What we do know is that btc drives the market, much like the S&amp;P drives the US stock market. Therefore I can't possibly give estimates for tops or bottoms.

The Federal Reserve (FED) continues to combat hyperinflation. The theory, originally, was that btc would be an excellent hedge against inflation due to limited supply. This theory has been debunked countless of times, with btc price correlating negatively with rate hikes. The reason for this is likely Occam's razor (the most obvious explanation), with less money to spend, people will spend less on speculative assets such as bitcoin. In plain English, do you spend money that you cannot/barely can afford to lose on btc? Probably not, as most people simply do not trust bitcoin enough as for now.

Bitcoin is therefore currently not a hedge against inflation, unlike other well-trusted assets.

We are currently in a landscape of roaring inflation and interest hikes to combat it. People have less money to spend today, than they had six months ago.

Btc has not, in recent times, presented any sort of technological leap that should increase buyer interest.

Therefore, fundamentally, buying pressure for btc (and therefore cryptocurrencies in general) is low today, compared to six months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

**Technical analysis (TA):**

On the daily chart, btc has been dropping in price since 10th of November 2021.

Recently, btc has rallied from about 17500 USD (June 18th) to about 25000 USD (august 13th), in the span of almost 2 months.

Many believe this rally to be confirmation of a renewed bull-market. Some hypothesize that the bull-market is actually still roaring.

Volume has been quite choppy, however, it has been the largest bout of volume since the start of the bear market. I find myself questioning; ""where is this money coming from?""

By now it's evident that volume is dropping:

&amp;#x200B;

[Volume slope](https://preview.redd.it/cvob1kbomkh91.png?width=1495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=018dd933d1692393b8075b7a377c194081eed430)

This could signal an observant stance by the market as a whole. Not a lot of people are willing to buy, but likewise not a lot of people are willing to sell in an up-trend.

This bodes ill for a continued up-trend with no large movement, no large-volume influx recently and a fundamentally bearish look.

\-

We have a very recent spiking double-top:

&amp;#x200B;

[Double top](https://preview.redd.it/sqs1osn7nkh91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2c448d38ba1a45714d429b688e4c185d01cc25f)

Which also, from a TA perspective, bodes ill for continued upward momentum.

\-

The slope of the rally is weak.

&amp;#x200B;

[Slope is weak compared to overall down-trend](https://preview.redd.it/uegbgsrnnkh91.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d3003689c5fdd00005e324e26d24d2e2aea90a4)

This signals weak buying pressure and is more indicative of a bear flag than a trend-reversal. Notice how when the trend changed in July 2021, it happened in a sharp momentum.

\-

Triple-tap pattern emerges.

&amp;#x200B;

[Triple-tap pattern.](https://preview.redd.it/f0h2anreokh91.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3da76b435c7071084bffec6fb615ac3e8d7a56ed)

The recent high's are barely worth mentioning. As the price reaches a new high, sellers are very quick to take profit and short's are eager to enter. This is indicative of a bullish momentum slowing down and a possible trend reversal.

\-

**My current strategy**

This is an area I am looking out for (scaled down to 1hr).

&amp;#x200B;

[Different outcomes](https://preview.redd.it/3scjtwkrpkh91.png?width=1498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f9d367fb5e6aeae0ad69e4e42a71c93e4fe702b)

This is also why volume is dropping. People are unsure what's going to happen next and they want confirmation. We could go into the squeeze and confirm a bullish momentum. We could go into the same squeeze and turn bearish. We could also break the trend-line within the next few hours and go bearish. BEWARE OF FAKE-OUTS which are rampant in crypto.

When I gather everything, I'm bearish. It's not that I don't like crypto, I love crypto, but I'm a trader and this is my analysis. 

I'm a novice trader and crypto enthusiast for the last five years (although I started mining btc in 2012 and then gave up cause it was very unprofitable (ouch)).

personalfinance,"Monthly financial analysis for job offers in Boston, MA and Wilmington, DE","Hi everyone,

I’m trying to decide between a job in Boston, Massachusetts and a job in Wilmington, Delaware. There are many factors, including family factors, which are not financial. However, I’d like to a rough idea of the major financial consequences.

The job is Boston has starting annual gross income of 70,000 and will increase to around 100,000 over 10 years. The job in Wilmington has starting annual gross income of 50,000 and will increase to around 75,000 over 10 years..

I know that when I use the Nerdwallet salary calculator, it tells me 70,000 in Boston is roughly equivalent to 50,000 in Wilmington, and 100,000 in Boston is roughly equivalent to 75,000 in Wilmington.

However, I’m wondering if I can do a slightly more detailed analysis on a monthly basis. Here’s how I’ve done my rough analysis. Can you let me know if there’s anything I’ve overlooked?

I’ve decided to fix my salary at 70,000 in Boston and 50,000 in Wilmington for simplicity.

I did some Zillow searches and spoke to some real estate agents and identified some condos near Boston for 350k and some condos near Wilmington for 120k. Although I’ll rent for the first two years, I’ll eventually want to buy a condo probably. I used an online mortgage calculator and got an 1800/month mortgage payment for 30 years for Boston compared to 600/month mortgage payment for 30 years for Wilmington. I used a 4.5% interest rate.

I’ve earned 70,000 and 50,000 a year in California and Maryland and I imagine federal tax withholding in Massachusetts and Delaware will be similar. Also, in the past, I put away 7% of my monthly income into a retirement account and received a 7% match from my employer. I’m estimating an annual gross income of 70,000 will translate to 3800 monthly take-home income. I’m estimating an annual income of 50,000 will translate to 2800 monthly take-home income.

I’m estimating that in Boston, my employer and I will contribute about 532 per month to my retirement account (532 = 70,000/12 \* 14%). I’m estimating that in Wilmington, my employer and I will contribute about 392 per month to my retirement account (392 = 50,000/12\*14%)

I’m estimating that in Boston, I’ll spend 1800 of the 3800 take-home income on the mortgage, 450 on the condo maintenance, and rest (1550) on living expenses (food, transportation, etc). I’m estimating that in Wilmington, I’ll spend 600 of the 2800 on the mortgage, 200 on the condo maintenance, and 1550 on living expenses, allowing to me save an extra 450 per month to my retirement account.

Thus my total retirement saving in Boston will be just the 532/month from my 7% contribution and my employer’s match. My total retirement saving in Wilmington will be 392 per month from 7% contribution and my employer’s match plus an extra 450 per month, for a total of 842/month. Thus, I’ll save an extra 310/month for retirement in Wilmington.

At the end of the comparison period of 30 years, I’d own my condo near Boston or my condo near Wilmington. They’re currently worth 350k and 120k, for a difference of 230k. But the difference will probably be more in 30 years. I know that in the last 40 years, the home appreciation has been about 3.5% annually. That would make the homes 980k and 340k, but that seems somewhat uncertain.

In the meantime, the extra 310/month will have been accruing. If I estimate at 10% annual return on the retirement savings, the accrued difference will come to 700k. (I used the future value function in Excel to calculate this, with fv(rate = 0.1/12, number of periods = 30 \* 12 = 360, monthly payment = 310).

Thus, the main tradeoff is between the greater value of the house in Boston and the greater amount of money I’ve will have been able to put into my retirement account in Wilmington, which should be appreciating faster than the house. I will also be able to collect more social security if I take the job in Boston because I’ll have had greater average income.

I know this is a very rough analysis with lots of assumptions? Are there major errors? How can I make it more accurate?

personalfinance,[CA] Took a bad new car deal. How do I move forward with financing it?,"Hi, I'm a university student and just bought a car and financed a loan on it with my dad as the primary payer. Unfortunately, I only realized it was a bad deal afterwards. I can't undo it and I just want to make the best decision moving forward.

I was initially quoted 9% interest with my dad who has a good credit score with me co-signing in hopes of getting my credit up. The monthly payment was $550 and they kept it $550 by dropping the interest rate to a low 6% through adding warranties through some ""offer"" the bank had. In total, I put down 7k and took out a loan for 33k for a car that was 26k. (I know.) I went back today to take off around 6.5k of warranties which is thankfully possible, but they told me keeping it would be in my best interest because of the way interest works. They didn't explain this the first time, but they told me my best decision was to keep the current arrangement for 6-12 months and to wait for interest rates to drop either through the Feds or my own credit improving having my name on the loan. Because the initial payments on any loans are going to be mostly interest, they said it was better to pay a lower interest rate now while protecting my car and then after a while I could I refinance the loan and get a prorated refund on the warranties. While I haven't done the math myself and to be honest I'm still confused about the entire deal, my interest would instead be working for me as protection instead of going straight to the bank. It's just a feeling, but I really don't feel like the dealership and financial guy I was speaking too was actaully looking out for me.

I still need time to really digest what he stated, but at this point I need to decide whether I'm better off taking those warranties off or not. If I refund them, they will go towards my current loan's principal. The dealer said that interest rates were high because the feds raised them recently which I know, but I had a friend who also co-signed with his parents get their loan refinanced through a credit union after around 6 months from a 9% interest rate to 2%. The biggest difference between our situations would be that he banks with the credit union (which might allow them to achieve a lower interest rate) and that his entire loan amount is less than mine because he bought a pre-owned car. I asked this on reddit on a different subreddit and was suggested to remove the warranties and refinance with a credit union immediately.

My question is how likely is it for me to get a lower interest rate through a credit union now when I couldn't through the dealership? The loan currently is through CapitalOne. Would the rate go down because I have a lower principal through removing the warranties or because it's through a credit union? I'm not really familiar with what interest rates are normal with people who have good credit (my dad). They also said taking my name off the loan probably wouldn't change much. If I do get a good interest rate now, then I would have no real reason to take the warranties so I could get rid of them know which is what I want. I'm afraid that it'll just look good on paper and not actually be good for me. I'm also worried about getting multiple hard credit pulls on both our credits just to find out...

Because this seems like a convoluted issue that's time sensitive as well, are there any other resources I could go to? Financial advisors working pro-bono? My dad knows little English so it's up to me to not allow myself to be \*\*further\*\* taken advantage of here. This is honestly going to kill my mood until its resolved.",finance,1660447285

2. BTC has a currency element to it, which is/will be seen as a threat to USD. Government will want to issue CBDC at some point and they will not want competition. Fed could also use ""monetary policy transmission"" argument to ask for a ban on BTC.

China tried mining ban but this is US we are talking about. And where US goes, rest of the western world follows. I know BTC mining stabilizes grid, x% of energy used is clean and all that. But as climate concerns take centre stage, the bar for banning BTC gets lower each day. Finally, US could still encourage crypto while banning BTC.

stocks,Let's Talk About Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD),"Note : English is not my first language, sorry if i can't articulate my point properly.

**Background**

Early this year AT&amp;T spinoff their entertainment division, WarnerMedia to merge it with Discovery. The combined entity is now known as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).

WBD started their first trading day, on April 11, 2022 closing at $24.78, but now the share price is at $13.78

**Why the stock dropping so much**

There are several reasons that might explain:

1)General market condition 

During April to July, we see a market correction across all indices, so WBD might be a victim of ""IPO"" at the wrong time.

Moreover, there seems to be general apathy toward media stocks as of right now that contributed to the price performance. You named it, from social media like Meta, Snap. Streaming co like Netflix, traditional media co like DIS, PARA, video game maker like TTWO, Ubisoft, RBLX.

2)AT&amp;T shareholder don't want to have anything to do with WBD

Most AT&amp;T shareholders are in it for the dividends, and yet WBD don't pay dividend and will likely to remain so in the few years as their priority is to reduce their leverage. So, it is likely that the stock tanked due to selling pressure from forced owner.

3)Management quality?

This is probably the major overhang. David Zaslav, the CEO seems like a capable and competent guy for the jobs, a long time veteran in media business. But unlike Disney, WarnerMedia on its own is a clusterfuck with no clear vision. Adding Discovery makes it even harder. Can Zaslav fixed it?

So far there are already questionable decisions like shutting off Batgirl when it is already finished, relaunching of new streaming services (when they have already invested billions growing HBO brand), DCEU problems, etc.

4)Very high leverage

Thanks in large part to AT&amp;T, WBD is saddled with very high level of debt. Of the $142 billion of total assets, about $53 billion is funded by debt, and total liabilities of $89 billion. To put thing into perspective, the current market cap for WBD is $33 billion. So every profit that they make, mostly will go to debt holder, instead to shareholders (yes, this is oversimplification).

5)Last result is not encouraging

The consesus estimate EPS for Q2 2022 is $0.12, yet the company record an earning loss (EPS) of $1.5

**Why this trade might work?**

1)It is cheap

Yes, a terrible investment thesis, especially when they just recorded an earning loss. All the potential synergy might never realizes, making this investment a total value trap. But again, it is cheap as of right now, and for all we know, all the bad things have already been priced in, no?

2)They have a strong collection of IP

DC Universe, Wizarding World (Harry Potter), Every shit HBO made (Game of Thrones, and i dont know), CNN, Oprah Winfrey, etc. 

Also, this can possibly makes them for prime takeover target.

Netflix prove that you need strong IP to win long term in media business, something that they severely lacks. Amazon bought MGM last years. It is no secret that big tech, whether it is Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and even Meta has lofty ambition in media industry.

3)Seems to be a favorite amongs superinvestor?

Michael Burry, David Einhorn, Seth Klarman loads up the position during Q2 2022. Buffett, bought shares in PARA, but i believe there are not much differences in business thesis between WBD and PARA.

4)Industry Tailwind

Both Disney and Netflix are planning to raise prices, signalling the priority for profits amongs media business. Cinema is making a comeback, midterm election means increasing ad spent for both parties, etc. 

An industry going back to its roots should be perfect time for David Zaslav to shine.

**What do you think?**

Personally, i have small position in the stocks. I see this as special situations where heavy selling pressure exist due to AT&amp;T shareholders selling their stake instead of business performance issue.

While high debt level is cause of some concern, they manage to lock the interest rate between 3%-5%.

Overall still manageable. Earning loss probably related to M&amp;A, and in due time should normalize to profitability.

investing,Encore Capital (ECPG) Analysis (+DCF),"What's up guys, I made an analysis on the debt purchaser Encore Capital. Please leave your thoughts on it. I would greatly appreciate some Feedback.

## The Business

Incorporated in 1999 as MCM Capital Group, Encore Capital has been in the business of specialty finance. More specific: debt buying and recovering. The company buys defaulted consumer debt for a fraction of the face value and will try to recover it from the debitors. With an industry size of $15 billion dollars, Encore Capital has a market share of around 10% with $1,6 billion in revenue for 2021 (1). It is the largest of five big agencies in the US and has expanded to UK and Europe with the acquisition of Cabot Credit Management (CCM), which is the largest debt purchaser in Europe.

## Industry Enviroment

The debt collection industry has grown at a CAGR of just 2,7% since 2017 (2). Now it’s experiencing problems to further increase their portfolio purchases, which showed to effect in Encore’s recent purchase history. Encore is the industry leader by revenue with a large market share, which rises the questions for further growth opportunities. Both the industry and the company mainly get their supply in receivable portfolios from credit card debt. As both the amount of credit card debt and the delinquency rate have decreased significantly since 2018 (7), Encore Capital hasn’t been able to expand it’s portfolio investment due to the resulting decrease in supply.

## Acquisition of CCM in 2018

On July 24 2018 Encore bought CCM for around $415 million ($234 million cash / $181 million stock). In the same year CCM brought in $523 million dollar in revenue and $100 million in pre-tax earnings. This acquisition is more than just fine to me at an P/E of 4. Going forward to 2022, those numbers didn’t change much.

## Financials

## Revenue Drivers

To generate revenue, Encore buys receivable debt and collects it. If it’s investments in collectable debt decreases, it’s future revenue takes a hit. For the forecasting of it’s future cashflows, we at first have to find out in what way todays investments will affect future earnings.

The price at which Encore bought debt in the last 3 years was on average 11,1% of it’s face value.

On average Encore has recovered $1,88 for every dollar it has ever invested in debt. 4-5 years after it’s purchase 80% of the estimated revenues are earned.

|Purchase Year|Collections / Estimated Collections|
|:-|:-|
|&lt;2012|98%|
|2012|97%|
|2013|92%|
|2014|93%|
|2015|91%|
|2016|87%|
|2017|80%|
|2018|74%|
|2019|60%|
|2020|45%|
|2021|12%|
|Total|82%|

**Table 1: Collected Recoveries divided by the estimated possible collections (in US)**

Collections in Europe go much slower as it took 4 years to earn 50% of the possible estimated collections. Should this improve, Encore cought see more rapid turnover.

To keep up it’s revenue Encore needs to maintain it’s purchasing volume. Quarterly purchases have started to decrease significantly in the last half of 2018. Only recently has there been an increase in the last quarter of 2021. Encore explaines that purchases are still under pre-pandemic level, which is caused by a shortage in supply. They also believe this shortage to be temporary as a result of the pandemic.

## Revenue Accounting

Understanding how Encore’s revenue is calculated important to understand the business. To put it simple: Encore invests in debt, which is written off immediately. Then it accounts the discounted estimated cashflows of that debt. Revenue gets earned as time passes and the discount on the assets decreases, which raises it’s present value. The company stated that the revenue can be simply calculated by multipling the portfolio balance with it’s Effective Interest Rate (EIR).

## Cost Structure

Encore’s cost structure is composed of wide variety of cost types:

* Salaries
* Cost of legal collections
* General and Admin
* Other operating expenses
* Collection agency commissions
* Depreciation &amp; Amortization

We will further analyse how they behave in relation to revenues.

|As % of Revenue|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|Average|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Salaries and employee benefits|27,3%|26,6%|27,8%|26,8%|25,2%|23,9%|26,3%|
|Cost of legal collections|19,5%|16,9%|15,5%|14,4%|15,9%|15,7%|16,3%|
|General and administrative|13,0%|13,3%|11,9%|10,5%|9,9%|8,5%|11,2%|
|Other operating|9,8%|8,8%|10,2%|7,7%|7,3%|6,6%|8,4%|
|Collection agency commissions|3,5%|3,7%|3,6%|4,5%|3,3%|2,9%|3,6%|
|Depreciation and amortization|3,4%|3,4%|3,1%|2,9%|2,8%|3,1%|3,1%|
|Total operating expenses|76,5%|72,7%|72,1%|67,7%|64,5%|60,8%|69,0%|
|Interest Expense|19,3%|17,2%|18,1%|15,5%|13,9%|10,5%|15,8%|

**Table 2: Costs as a % of revenue**

As revenue has risen, most costs have remained stable or only risen slightly. Still we will assume the operating margin to not improve any further and remain at the level of 2021 (40%).

## Industry Comparison

|Company|Encore|B2Holding (4)|Intrum (5)|PRA Group (6)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|D/E (Q1 2022)|2,7|2,1|2,6|2,3|
|EBIT / Interest Expense (Q1 2022)|7,7|2,3|3|3|
|Operating Margin|39%|41,5%|36%|34%|
|Return on Asset (EBIT / Assets)|13,7%|3,7%|7,3%|8,6%|
|Return on Equity|29,6%|11,5%|26%|13,8%|

**Table 3: Comparison of important ratios**

As interest expenses consume less of the operating income, Encore has been able to give itself an edge in terms of it’s return on assets and equity. The operating margin is in line with industry,

## Balance Sheet

## Debt Level

Encore Capital has used a portion of it’s cashflow to pay back some debt, which brings it back to the level of 2015. Meanwhile the equity has grew, decreasing the leverage of the company.

Until Q1 2022 interest expenses have eaten into the operating income of the company with a portion of 40%. That’s alarming, but as the company has increased earnings and decreased debt, the interest expenses are well covered by the companies operating income. A good edge for the company, if you look at the rest of the industry.

## Tangible Book Value

As most of the assets of Encore Capital are made up of investments in receivable portfolios, the determination of the real value of those assets is packed with giant amounts of uncertainty. In my opinion, there is no good base to make an accurate tangible book value calculation. If you take the audited equity at face value, that might at least help as a reference to keep in mind.

## Cashflow Statement

## Buybacks

Most cashflow has been invested in receivable portfolios. Only in the year ending in 2021, Encore has used lots of cash for buyback of over 20% of it’s shares. The company’s collections of receivable portfolios where much $400 million higher than purchases of new portfolios, which left Encore with lots of excess cash that couldn’t be invested into new receivables, as the supply has dried up. Regarding the low stock price, Encore has put it’s cash to good use with those significant stock buybacks. If the opportunity for heavy investments in receivables arises again, the buyback might become more of an exception than the norm.

## Recent investements in receivable portfolios

In the new Q-10, it’s stated that collections and purchases have balanced out a bit. As long as the company isn’t falling short on supply of receivables, it could be able to extend it’s business even further in the long-term. Until then, stock buybacks and debt repayment will be a good alternative in the short-term.

## Anomalies

**Table 4: Operating Cashflow in relation to revenues**

Large amounts of net income have been received through changes in recoveries. So we will take a look at cashflows in relation to revenue. As you can see that percentage varries greatly, even though revenue has grown steadily. Still it’s a valuable metric to see if our valuation model provides realistic cashflow numbers.

## Other points

## Insider Trading

Insider trading activity has been flat for the last 3 years, with no major purchases and some sales in the range of $60-$70 dollars per share. No good news to find here.

## Risks

* Delinquency rates and the size of the credit card debt burden are determining factors of the companies ability to grow or remain stable. If delinquency rates stay at an all-time low, revenues could stay flat or decrease for several years
* Encore’s collection activities are heavily dependant on legislation. Any disadvantagous legislation could damage the companies operating profit

## DCF

* Revenue Growth
   * For the past 5 years Encore’s revenue excluding changes in recoveries, has increased at an CAGR of 5%. As the supply of recoverable portfolios has been weak, I will consider an expansion at that rate at 5% as a best case
      * This could prove highly conservative, if Encore can expand it’s revenue through M&amp;A and an incresing market share
* Operating margin
   * The operating margin of 40% is the current margin of the company
      * 30% has been the average since 2016, which I will use as the bear case
* Interest Expenses
   * Interest Expenses have been declining relative to revenue, as revenue has grown and debt was retired
      * Encore’s target leverage lies between 2,5 and 3. So we will assume that interest expenses will continue to eat a portion of the operating profit
* Share repurchases
   * Actually if there isn’t enough supply of purchaseable portfolios, Encore could buy back more shares with the additional cash
   * So in the Bear Case the Share Repurchases should be slightly higher than in the Base Case
   * We will still use a low percentage as a depressed operating margin would result in lower cashflows

||Bear Case|Base Case|Best Case|

|Operating margin|30%|40%|“”|
|Interest Expenses / Revenue|10%|“”|“”|

personalfinance,Family Mortgage as a win-win for all questions,"I wish to finance my son and daughter-in-law's home.  I wish to do this as a win-win for them and me.  They both have stable incomes and I am not worried about repayment.  I will document and use https://www.nationalfamilymortgage.com/ to ensure IRS is fine and pay taxes on the interest.  I will sit down with both of them to be sure everyone is on board and agrees it is a good thing, so as not to breed resentment or misunderstanding.  


I am single, retired and until I take SS (I'm 67 and waiting until 70), almost all of my income comes from investment and savings allocated 50/35/15 invested in equity/bond/money market and I am currently an adherent to the bucket strategy.

Questions:

My thinking is that I would use the mortgage to replace the bond portion and some cash using their mortgage repayments instead of cash for my needs.   This would all be funded from the non IRA part of my portfolio.  IRA would then be exclusively equities.  Between mortgage repayment and cash I would not likely not need to touch IRA or any equity for expenses until I take SS.   Once taking SS means I would not need to draw any more cash to cover expenses.  Is this reasonable thinking?

Since I need the income, I would plan to charge an interest rate 1/2 way between best bank rates they could get and AFR rates.  I'm thinking that is fair to them and reasonable for me.  i.e.  if AFR is 3.5% and best rate is 5%, I would set a fixed rate at 4.25% Thoughts?

I currently rent, not own.  Doing this would preclude me from buying anything for my housing, which is OK with me, but does leave rent increases something I live with.

If in future, they wish to take a mortgage out from a bank, will their credit rating be hurt by this?

Anything else I or they should consider?

many thanks for your input.",finance,1660485267

personalfinance,Should I sell second vehicle?,"I’m on parental leave for the next 6 months and work from home when I resume working. My family has a second vehicle which we don’t use much anymore (I had to replace the battery recently cause it wasn’t being driven enough) and I am wondering if it’s worth selling it now or holding onto it in case we have a need for a second vehicle again. It’s in great condition, low mileage (60k km), cheap on maintenance and is really a great car for being a 8 years old.

The listings I’m seeing for similar vehicles are thousands more than what we paid, and I’m still making payments on this car so selling it would give us a nice amount for savings ($5000+ CAD) and also drop our monthly expenses down $200 CAD. It would give us some more financial space for new baby expenses.

On the other hand, if I sell the car and find after 6 months find that we need a second car again we’ll be worse off cause I’ll have to pay taxes on a used vehicle purchase again, and car prices are still wild.

It seems like it would be a good thing to do. Pay off the remaining loan with my HELOC (lower interest rate than the loan) so the bank is off the ownership, list the vehicle and see if we can make some money on it.

Maybe there’s more for me to consider. Would you sell or keep the car?",finance,1660489610
stocks,Market Rebound Draws Wary Eye From Some Investors,"Stocks reached another milestone in [their comeback last week](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-markets-dow-update-08-12-2022-11660299658?mod=article_inline), with the Nasdaq Composite rising more than 20% from its mid-June low to end its longest bear market since 2008.The rally has stirred a familiar debate: Will the rebound continue?

Some investors are starting to believe the worst of this year’s rout might be behind them. Data last week showed gauges of both consumer and producer prices [falling in July](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-july-2022-consumer-price-index-11660077986?mod=article_inline), offering some hope that inflation might be [at or close to a peak](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-definition-cause-what-is-it-11644353564?mod=article_inline). 

The labor market also [remains robust](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/july-jobs-report-unemployment-rate-economy-growth-2022-11659646690?mod=article_inline). Employers added more than half a million jobs in July, while the unemployment rate ticked down to close to a half-century low—hardly things investors would expect to see if the economy were in or on [the brink of a recession](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-this-is-a-recession-we-might-not-know-for-months-11659173402?mod=article_inline).📷

On the flip side, the Federal Reserve [isn’t done raising interest rates](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-raises-interest-rates-by-0-75-percentage-point-11658944935?mod=article_inline), leaving richly valued parts of the market vulnerable.Much of what has surged the past several weeks is precisely what led the market lower during its punishing selloff in the first half of the year. [Meme stocks](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-rivian-amc-gamestop-stock-market-psychology-11660250193?mod=article_inline) such as [AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC). and [Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BBBY). have climbed 107% and 111%, respectively, since markets bottomed for the year on June 16. Shares of cryptocurrency-related companies such as [Coinbase Global Inc](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/COIN). and triple-leveraged exchange-traded funds tracking the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index have also soared.

The S&amp;P 500 is up 17% over the same period but remains down 10% for the year. With inflation remaining near multiyear highs, some investors worry parts of the market are in for another punishing selloff, especially if the Fed has to raise interest rates for longer than expected. When interest rates were at historic lows, investors got big returns from piling into shares of richly valued, often unprofitable companies. 

The fact that bond yields were so low made even the riskiest stocks—as well as other investments, like cryptocurrencies—look like an attractive proposition for many investors. Rising rates reverse that dynamic.“I can’t argue that this pace \[of market gains\] is going to continue,” said Nancy Tengler,chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments. “Whether we are in recession now or are going to be in one in the third or fourth quarter, you know economic growth is going to slow.”That means it is prudent to be even more selective about what types of companies the firm is putting money into, she said.📷

One factor that has clouded investors’ outlook is debate over how far into the future the Fed will have to keep raising interest rates.Since the Fed’s July policy meeting, some investors have bet [the central bank will pivot](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-bet-fed-will-need-to-cut-interest-rates-next-year-to-bolster-the-economy-11658694486?mod=article_inline) from raising interest rates to lowering them next year to boost economic activity again. That has helped spark a rebound in not just stock but also bond prices. 

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which falls as bond prices rise, fell to 2.848% Friday, down from its mid-June peak of 3.482%.📷

Skeptics, however, warn that it might be too early to assume that the Fed will change tacks in 2023. July’s CPI and PPI readings were good news for the markets. And they certainly gave wind to the idea that the Fed will raise interest rates by half a point at its September meeting, instead of three-quarters of a point as initially expected.📷

But just one or two lower inflation readings won’t suffice in convincing the Fed that inflation is dissipating, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. Some factors driving inflation higher have also yet to ease. Last week’s CPI report showed grocery prices rose 13.1% in July from a year ago, the fastest pace since 1979. Housing prices [also increased](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-housing-affordability-in-june-was-the-worst-since-1989-11660312801?mod=article_inline). 

Given the way the Fed typically likes to see [multiple consecutive economic readings](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-michelle-bowman-says-large-interest-rate-rises-could-continue-11659802500?mod=article_inline) before changing tack on policy, markets might be running ahead of themselves, Mr. Colas said.Many investors are skeptical the recent rebound in more speculative investments will shake out differently this time.",finance,1660490230
personalfinance,"0% Promotional Rate on CC with debt I am slowly paying off, how bad are they?","I currently have a promotional 0% interest CC which is carrying debt (groceries, utility bills) that I can pay down a month or so before the end of the promotional date with my income, which is stable. I pay rent in cash because the service fee is a bit steep.

The money in lieu of CC debt was used to invest in the stock market-- *Foreword: Please do not replicate this strategy, because in most cases it's a dumb, irresponsible thing to do. After some careful accounting I decided that it is feasible to borrow from my future self to invest now and went ahead with it*. 

I have emergency savings, but I don't touch that as a general rule unless it is truly an emergency.

The issue I see now is that the carried debt is eating into my credit score, something I already figured would happen. Historically, my credit score always recovers once I zero out my debt, but I have always wondered about the mechanics of it. 

So here's the question (a sanity check rather): under what circumstances should I start worrying about credit score when on a 0% promotional interest rate? I.e. do credit rating agencies permanently ""ding"" people that carry credit card debt over longer periods (in this case, 12 months)? For additional context, I have been paying down my CC debt every month since I started.

personalfinance,Is it always better to carry debt if the APR is minimal? How about Sequence of Returns Risk?,"Reddit seems to universally advise taking on debt, or not paying off debt, if the interest rate on that the debt is lower than what you could obtain in the market. 

Mathematically it makes sense. If we assume the market return for each of the next n years is 10% and your loan has a 5% interest rate, debt will work in your favor.

But is this really something that you should always do? Are there circumstances in which it would be better to pay off the debt in a lump sum, even if the interest on the debt is relatively low?

---------------

One possible case where paying off low-interest debt instead of investing in the market might make sense is in regards to [Sequence of Return Risk](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/sequence-of-returns-risk/). 

(Edit: as other's have mentioned, this risk is eliminated if you have a job and can service the debt from your income, instead of selling the amount you invested. But what if you are a retiree where your SS only covers basic living expenses, and your 401K/portfolio would be used to service the debt?)

Assume you have 100K of debt at 5% interest that matures in 5 years, and you need to make a principal payment of 20K each year, plus the interest. You receive a lump sump of $100K, and chose to put it into the S&amp;P 500 instead of paying off the mortgage. 

Unfortunately, the market declines by 20% the first year, leaving you with $80K. You then have to sell $25K to pay the first year principal payment and interest, leaving you with $55K. Even if the market gains 17.5% for the next four years, such that the average gain was 10% per year for 5 years, you are not going to be able to pay off the principal + interest payment by the 5th year.

You would have been better off had you paid off the debt with your lump sum in the first year.",finance,1660496091

For context, I recently graduated college and was living with family, but they were abusive for years and I knew I had to escape somehow. I was able to leave in secret with a friend’s help. My financial situation is dire, I only have 2k in savings, and part of my abuse was financial. They stopped me from getting a job in order to ensure that I couldn’t leave. 

I have no car and no health insurance, though I suspect I need dental work. I don’t have a credit card. I have a phone paid by one of my parents but I would like to find a way to get a no contract phone, and one that my family won’t be able to track me with. The only debt I have is federal student loans (of the 7.5k I had, I paid off 2.5k, leaving me with 5k). My next payment isn’t until 2024. Will the payments I made establish a credit history? My credit score is in the 680s. The first thing I’m doing is finding a job near my friends place so I can help pay for rent and a car down the road, but I’m really struggling with my health.

personalfinance,Stay in current smaller home with 15 year mortgage or move to larger expensive home with a 30 year mortgage? (baby on the way),"Hi,

My wife and I are in our mid 30's, currently no kids but that's about to change with one on the way (will be one and done). Our current mortgage + taxes + insurance is about $1,100 a month on a 15 year mortgage with a 2.4% interest rate. Current house is 1,500 square feet. We make combined $165k year before any bonuses (maybe another $12k combined but not factoring into budget). The proposed new house would be $2,100 a month (would be putting $150k down from sale of current home), but with a 5.2% 30 year mortgage rate. My wife and I each put 15% into our 401k's (before matching) and combined have about $500k saved in our 401k's / IRA's for retirement.

Our current house is fine but we just don't have that feeling of it being our long term home. The area is also just good to decent, we would like to be in an area that is a bit newer, safer, and has better schools (which the new house would have). The biggest pro to our current home is the low monthly payment and expenses. We can travel, have hobbies, save money, and overall within reason not worry about money. That of course will change with a new house and especially a baby. For daycare we are being quoted $1k a month so there goes a big chunk of change for 4 years or so. With the existing house if one of us lost our jobs for some reason we could swing the payments, but there's no way in the proposed newer more expensive house. 

One last thing, we also want to ideally retire at 55. Maybe that's just a pipedream but with our current home I feel it's more realistic as we would have it paid off before then. With the newer house we would be resetting the mortgage clock and have it paid off when we are in our mid 60's.

What do you think we should do? We keep having this desire to move into a larger home in a better area but at the same time keep worrying about the costs. We've done a budget of every single bill and with estimated day care costs we think we would have around $2,700 left over each month with the new more expensive house, while having $3,800 left over each month with our current home.

 ""Investors Take Sunny View Of Gloomy U.S. Jobs Data""

 *By* *E.S. Browning* Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

**May 7, 2001** 12:01 am ET 

 The economic indicators are gloomily heading south. The stock market is cheerfully heading north. What gives?

Economic hopes took a hit Friday, when investors learned that April unemployment, at 4.5%, was far higher than expected. Wages also were up more than expected, sparking worries on inflation. On top of that, President Bush's spokesman said the White House feared that strong first-quarter growth numbers, which had helped to boost stocks, might have to be revised downward.

It sounded like the economy might be heading down again, and stocks initially fell Friday morning. But then, curiously, the market turned around and stocks put in a substantial gain.

Some attributed it to a renewal of the old bull-market mentality. Hopes spread that the Federal Reserve now will stimulate the economy further by cutting rates by yet another half-percentage point when it holds its next policy meeting a week from Tuesday.

 But it is possible that an even simpler explanation is behind some of the buying: Over the past month, a lot of investors have begun to bet that the economy isn't going to get much worse and may well entirely avoid a recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. Given all of the job cuts announced in April, the reasoning goes, an uptick in unemployment isn't a bad surprise at all. It is a sign that companies are taking their medicine and that the economy is hitting bottom.

There are plenty of experts who think that is fool's logic, that recession could be around the corner and that the market is headed down again. But that skeptical view is in the clear minority now. Expectations for technology stocks had fallen so low that the mere idea that the economy could be reaching bottom has been enough to give them a serious boost and help pull the entire market back up.

 ""I think that even a 5% unemployment number is not so steep as to really affect the broad economy,"" says Tim Morris, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust in New York. ""In a way, this is positive news because this is what companies had to do to get a handle on their earnings and margins. They had to attack the labor component of their cost structure.""

That helps explain why the tech group has been surging. On Friday, despite the negative economic news, the tech-led Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.11%, or 45.33 points, to 2191.53. It was up 5.6% for the week and ahead 34% since April 4. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.43%, or 154.59 points, on Friday, to 10951.24, up 1.3% for the week and up 15% since March 22.

 For the year so far, the industrials now are up 1.5%, but the beleaguered Nasdaq still is down 11%. The broad S&amp;P 500, which gained 1.44%, or 18.03 points, to 1266.61 on Friday, still is down 4.1% so far this year and is 17% off its record close of March 24, 2000.

It isn't that investors such as Mr. Morris have turned totally bullish. Mr. Morris has boosted his tech holdings to 18% from 12% of his portfolio, a 50% increase in a month. But his exposure to tech and communications stocks still is below that of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, which is around 26%. He had sold so much tech stock that all he had to do was turn somewhat less pessimistic in order to spark a sharp jump, in percentage terms, in his exposure.

George Cohen, president of New York money-management firm Cohen Klingenstein &amp; Marks, made a similar argument in a report to clients last week. ""It is our view that the economy is very close to the weakest point in the current slowdown, probably we are past it,"" Mr. Cohen wrote. His firm sold a lot of its tech holdings more than a year ago and shunned them until a few weeks ago. Now, he told his clients, ""the quality technology companies that have defined markets and huge profits have had their stock prices overcorrected. It is time to move back into them."" 

 There are plenty of people who are less hopeful about the economic data.

Bob Bissell, president of Wells Capital Management, Wells Fargo's money-management arm, agrees that, in all probability, ""we are past the worst"" in the economy, although he, too, says he wouldn't be surprised to see unemployment go to 5% before companies finish downsizing.

But he disagrees with Mr. Cohen on an important point: He doesn't see how technology companies can turn in business results to justify their huge recent stock gains. [Juniper Networks](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JNPR) has more than doubled since April 4. [Intel](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/INTC) is up 36% and [Nokia](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/nok) is up more than 50% since then. What are they going to do now to justify further gains?

Even the best of the economic numbers still look weak, Mr. Bissell notes. Strong auto sales helped spark first-quarter growth, but many of those sales were made at little or no profit. He thinks the economy will remain weak and bonds may do better than stocks as the Fed keeps cutting interest rates in an effort to stave off recession.

""We think some major sectors of the economy will still go sideways for a while, including technology,"" he says. ""Companies aren't investing a lot of money in new technology initiatives. They still are in a wait-and-see mode.""",finance,1660503309
stocks,"Market jump after Fed rate hike is a ‘trap,’ Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson warns investors","[Morgan Stanley](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MS) is urging investors to resist putting their money to work in stocks despite the market’s post-Fed-decision jump.

Mike Wilson, the firm’s chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer, said he believes Wall Street’s excitement over [the idea that interest rate hikes may slow sooner than expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/fed-decision-july-2022-.html) is premature and problematic.

“The market always rallies once the Fed stops hiking until the recession begins. … \[But\] it’s unlikely there’s going to be much of a gap this time between the end of the Fed hiking campaign and the recession,**″** he told CNBC’s “[Fast Money](https://www.cnbc.com/fast-money/)” on Wednesday. “Ultimately, this will be a trap.”

According to Wilson, the most pressing issues are the effect the economic slowdown will have on corporate earnings and the risk of the Federal Reserve over-tightening.

“The market has been a bit stronger than you would have thought given the growth signals have been consistently negative,” he said. “Even the bond market is now starting to buy into the fact that the Fed is probably going to go too far and drive us into recession.”

## ‘Close to the end’

Wilson has a 3,900 year-end price target on the [S&amp;P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX), one of the lowest on Wall Street. That implies a [3% dip from Wednesday’s close](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/stock-futures-tick-up-ahead-of-key-fed-decision.html) and a 19% drop from the index’s closing high hit in January.

His forecast also includes a call for the market to take another leg lower before getting to the year-end target. Wilson is bracing for the S&amp;P to fall below 3,636, the 52-week low hit last month.

“We’re getting close to the end. I mean this bear market has been going on for a while,” Wilson said. “But the problem is it won’t quit, and we need to have that final move, and I don’t think the June low is the final move.”

Wilson believes the S&amp;P 500 could fall as low as 3,000 in a 2022 recession scenario.

“It’s really important to frame every investment in terms of ‘What is your upside versus your downside,’” he said. “You’re taking a lot of risk here to achieve whatever is left on the table. And, to me, that’s not investing.”

Wilson considers himself [conservatively positioned](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/04/bear-market-rally-setting-stage-for-correction-morgan-stanley-warns.html) — noting he’s underweight stocks and likes defensive plays including [health care](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLV), [REITs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IYR), [consumer staples](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLP) and [utilities](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLU). He also sees the merits of holding extra [cash](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DXY) and [bonds](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y) at the moment.

And, he’s not in a rush to put money to work and has been “hanging out” until there are signs of a trough in stocks.

“We’re trying to give them \[clients\] a good risk-reward. Right now, the risk-reward, I would say, is about 10 to one negative,” Wilson said. “It’s just not great.”",finance,1660503725
solar,Signed a bad loan today,"I signed a bad loan today ($42K for 10.3kwh) and I want to cancel it. The salesman told me I was under $3 per watt and I'm getting a good deal with tax credit and they will take care of everything (permit, install, maintenance). My monthly payment would be $120 and it would cover all my electric needs for the year and then some I could sell to the power company, which I'm currently paying $200 to a month. And he showed me a chart where it shows you paying 1K a month for electricity if your rates go up 7% a year for the next 25 years! Is that even possible, I'm such a fool! The only good thing was the loan was 0.99% interest rate. I'm new to solar and I fell for it. I'm in Florida, what are my options to cancel? Am I stuck with this?

Edit: the company is current home. The loan is for 25 years and when the salesman left I realized, oh shit,  that's a long time and a lot of money! Thanks for your responses, everyone. I will cancel in writing tomorrow and definitely shop around more. I got 10k cash so I'm gonna try to leverage that and negotiate this time. I'm usually one to take my time on financal matter so I was surprised I fell for this (reason I got such a low rate was cause of my high credit score).

CryptoCurrency,Crypto should be the de-facto currency of Space Colonists,"Historically, as people moved away from their local governments, they tended towards less attachments and less cultural cling; opting to change and mold who they are and what’s important to them in the new world. 

I think something similar will happen to those who choose to leave Earth at some point in the future to go out to some far flung worlds, or even within the local solar system.  

Here is why I think crypto should be the de-facto currency:

**1. Space Explorers can choose what benefits of crypto they want in this new world.**

For example, do they most want security? Or a quick way to do business? Maybe smart contracts become important to them and their lives, or maybe all of the benefits can be intertwined and used. I’m assuming at this point many more advancements will have been made and the best aspects can be rolled into one. 

**2. The people who will be using this currency can feel confident that it’s “theirs”**

For this point, I’m thinking partially of American colonists who after coming to the new world were seeing less and less eye to eye with their home government, especially with the taxation issue.

Instead of having to rely on some far off land for your monetary policy, you could have direct control over your own.  

On top of that, you also wouldn’t need to be dealing with private corporations from back home and could do with your currency as you saw fit. 

One draw back or challenge here is still the fact that you would presumably still need to trade with your home world. Although transaction fees and network speeds might make it easy to exchange at that point. 

**3. Integration of new explorers into the monetary system should be easy.**

Here, I’m thinking of people from different nationalities or cultural groups being able to interchange and exchange their currency easily and fit into the financial ecosystem from the get go. 

**4. Tinfoil hat time, if we meet intelligent life, we could possibly trade with crypto.**

This is tin foil for obvious reasons but it makes sense to me that they might be able to pick up the tech and community driven ideas behind crypto instantly and maybe would be willing to trade. Or maybe this is complete garbage but either way seemed like a fun thought.",cryptocurrency,1660506124
stocks,My opinion based off my DD,"This is solely my personal bias opinions for September. Fed was told to QT by reducing the balance sheet starting in June at $45B and September up to $90B, so far they continue buying bonds and flooding the market with cheap money hence interest rate is not going up since June except mortgage rate. Second, market is hype-up by inflation CPI drop below analysts expectations at 8.5 but historically still very high. Mean while the Fed promise to bring it down to 2% but everything they do is opposite. This Fed seem to be influenced by political and market driven more than fighting inflation for average working Americans. Many working-class Americans have to decide to cut down on goods for necessities such as rent, food, utilities and gas. This Fed will hit a road block eventually because despite gasoline prices slowly trickle down, groceries, rent, utilities still high and affect people directly on daily basis.

Im a disabled combat Marine and I get a stipend monthly (3750.) I am finishing school for engineering. My take home starting engineering will be around 4400 ramping up to 5750 after a few years without OT. I don't know how long I can work as I have multiple injuries so I'm looking at the best way to invest in my situation. I'm looking at paying off my home because I have the payments from the VA so if I have no mortgage I can retire early with it (although I'm scared they will remove it eventually.) My home is 460k at 2.75% (Payment = 1875 + 200 in insurance) with no tax payments due to my state rules.

Since the interest rate is so low it seems like a bad idea but I know I can retire in my 30's if I do it and I dont see any other way to retire as early unless I get roomates. My expenses if I payoff would be roughly 1200 and my income would be roughly 3750.

Also is that extra 2550 enough to retire on after expenses? Or are emergency expenses too much (House, Vehicle, Dog bills, Travel, etc) I still plan to try to work but I dont know for how long.

personalfinance,Question about student loans,"I’m sending in my application for the Radiography program at school this month, it’s a two year, full time program and I’ve basically been advised to make a plan to pay my bills while I’m in the program bc I won’t be able to work full time as it will be a large workload. I dont have much of a savings, but my job is rather flexible so im spending the time between now and the start of my program (next Summer) working as much as i can to establish a savings. My question is, would it be wise to take out a student loan that my school offers to pay off my rent a few months in advance once i begin school? I dont currently have any debt aside very small balance on my credit card. I’ve never taken out any loans because my financial aid will pay for the entirety of my schooling, and I have decent credit. I rent an apartment with my boyfriend and we split bills down the middle and would prefer to keep our financials separate but if it came down to it, he could help out here and there. My thinking is that it would allow me to focus on school and I could spend those several months working part time still to continue paying it in advance (or rather keeping it in my savings and paying it on the due date every month). I’m admittedly am not someone who understands loans, interest rates, etc so forgive me if this sounds like a stupid plan, lol. Pls be gentle.

I was shopping for a good interest rate to refinace my (22.99%) auto loan and ended up with two hard inquiries within the same week (one in my TransUnion, one in Equifax). Cred Union A had the best rate I could find at 5.99%, so I went with them. While Cred Union B’s refinance offer wasn’t the best, they did offer me a $3500 credit line credit card based on the hard pull they did to get me that offer. This high limit card would be great for my young credit, as my collective limit across cards is $5300 right now.

I keep my utilization at 2-9% and my payments on-time. My aim is to get my credit as good as I can, of course.

Would it be detrimental or recommendable to take Cred Union B’s credit card offer? The hard pull is already done. But I’m torn because of the specifics involved, such as the hard inquiries being done on different bureaus and how the 14-day rule for rate-shopping works.

|HELOC|172|
|Utilities|80|
|Food/Misc Spending|750|

I recently got a raise at work bringing my salary to 60K. I have a 401K with 15% deductions. Currently, I have $7251 in a standard Wells Fargo Savings account (.01%) and another $8290 in cash (I know, stupid but it's because of how my parents handle their portion of the bills). I took the personal loan to help my parents out of a situation so they've been paying it but I'd like the monkey off my back, so I hope to have that paid off within the next month or so. I pulled the HELOC to replace my roof, but not sure if I'm using that money as effectively as I could. I've also had some dental issues so I haven't been able to save as much as I could have, but that hiccup has been addressed (hopefully).  

Now, here are my thoughts/concerns:

1) I need to move the cash and my savings account money into a HYSA. This money is a 6 Month EF, not sure if I should use it to pay off some of this debt or borrow from it to create a down payment for my next home. 

2) I'm about $6K away from the 20% threshold on my Mortgage to remove the PMI, should I make that a priority even though it's not really part of ""my"" monthly debt? 

3) I currently have a \~790 credit score, should I explore more Credit Cards to increase my available credit? (I currently use one CC for everything because it gives me 2% cashback. I don't really fly and use the card regularly for the same things each month. 

Obviously, with the market the way it is and my finances in their current state, I'm in no position to buy a house ""tomorrow"" but I do want that to be my end goal. So I'm looking to put my ducks in a row. How should I proceed? Am I being too lofty with my ideas/goals? I do plan on pursuing a new job in the 75K range, should I make that more of a focus or should I be able to manage with my current job? I live in a relatively HCOL area in Florida, in case that matters as well. Thanks for going gentle on me.",finance,1660510691
economy,US Economy: Schrödinger Recession,"In the first half of 2022, the US economy formally found itself in a state of recession: for two quarters in a row, a decrease in GDP was recorded compared to the previous quarter. However, despite this, neither the regulators nor the economic community considers this state of affairs a recession so far. What is it connected with?

Surprisingly, this is again the effect of the coronavirus. The main reason for the economic slowdown in the 1Q (-0.4% QoQ) and 2Q (-0.2% QoQ) was the decrease in its stocks, which include both raw materials and finished products in warehouses throughout the chain of production and sale of goods. What was the reason for their decline?

There was a surge in the incidence of the Omicron strain in the United States in 1Q, which led to both tightening of some restrictions and a decrease in production volumes due to the large number of workers who were on sick leave. At the same time, the demand of the population for goods remained at a very high level, which led to a reduction in stocks from manufacturers and sellers. In the second quarter, a surge in cases and lockdowns were observed in China, which led to a decrease in the supply of both intermediate goods and those intended for final consumption, which contributed to a further decrease in stocks. 

Excluding changes in the dynamics of inventories included in the gross investment indicator, the US economy continued to show growth in the 1H of 2022. However, its main components, such as personal consumption expenditures and capital investment, have shown deterioration. Thus, consumption growth rates slowed down by 0.2 percentage points to 0.3% QoQ, and capital investments showed a decline of 1.0% in Q2 against an increase of 1.8% a quarter earlier. Government consumption expenditures decreased during both quarters by -0.7% QoQ and -0.5% QoQ respectively.

Of interest is the change in the demand structure of American consumers: a decrease in the consumption of goods in Q2. accelerated by 1.0 p.p. to -1.1% QoQ, while growth in service consumption accelerated by 0.3 p.p. up to 1.0% q/q Thus, the structure of consumption in the United States is gradually returning to the pre-pandemic. A decrease in consumption of goods in the US helped reduce the trade deficit and had a positive impact on the contribution of net exports to US GDP in the 2nd quarter. compared to the previous period.

[US Real Personal Disposable Income and Consumption](https://preview.redd.it/ktpx8dq50rh91.jpg?width=756&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00dc797be57eb981635794008dd89c4ddb53caef)

Of great interest is the change in the demand structure of American consumers: a decrease the consumption of the goods on in Q2 accelerated by 1.0 p.p. to -1.1% QoQ, while growth in service consumption accelerated by 0.3 p.p. up to 1.0% QoQ. Thus, the structure of consumption in the United States is gradually returning to the pre-pandemic. A decrease in consumption of goods in the US helped reduce the trade deficit and had a positive impact on the contribution of net exports to US GDP in the 2Q compared to the previous period.

I'm guessing that 3Q will also bring interesting results, and in itself, the value of US GDP growth again can tell us little about what is actually happening with the US economy. Given the tightening of monetary policy in the US, as well as the negative dynamics of disposable incomes of Americans, we can expect a further slowdown in their consumption growth. At the same time, even a slight decline in consumption is very likely. Given the absence, as of mid-August, of any significant epidemiological restrictions in the world, we can expect a significant recovery in stocks, which will also be helped by a slowdown in demand.

Capital investment is also likely to show a decline, on the back of a significant increase in the cost of borrowing due to the tightening of monetary policy. However, the recovery in inventories is likely to significantly outweigh the decline in capital investment. As a result, gross investment is likely to show growth in 3Q.

Government spending will likely continue to lower in Q3. Due to the persistence of the downward trend in the consumption of goods, we can again expect a significant positive contribution of net exports to the quarterly dynamics of US GDP.

Reduced consumption of goods in developed countries could be a significant threat to many emerging economies, [whose domestic demand has never recovered to pre-pandemic levels, and post-pandemic recovery was largely provided by huge external demand](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/we2p7p/why_does_china_need_the_pelosi_scandal/).

personalfinance,[US] Need help Refinancing a Car Loan,"I (19M) just purchased a car this week and need help refinancing the vehicle since I have since released it was a god-awful deal. I currently have a loan for 33k with 7k down for a car that's worth 26k. 

I was quoted for 9% interest with my dad as the primary buyer and myself as a co-buyer. This was dropped to 6% with the addition of multiple extended warranties that I plan to remove worth 6.5k. I went to the dealer to remove these fees, but the finance manager told me that it would be in my best interest to refinance 6-months to a year later and then get a prorated refund on the warranties because my interest would shoot up back to 9% so ""my interest would work for me as protection"". I was told in another post that this was probably BS dealership talk and doesn't account for me finding a lower interest rate now. I love would take the car back, but unfortunately there is no cooling-off period for new cars, and I own it the second I drive off the lot and sign the papers.

Please bear with me because I don't know much about loans and interest rates but if I get those warranties refunded, it will go directly to the principal of my current loan leaving a remaining balance of 26.5k. From there I can refinance the loan with less principal and hopefully less interest. I have a few questions about doing this.

1. Why was my initial interest rate of 9% so high? I know there are multiple factors to this, but my dad has a great credit score (&gt;800) and I have little history, but my score is around 720. Could it be because the loan-to-value ratio was high off because of the added warranties?
2. My mom also makes the most of the money, but it was my dad's and my (part-time) income that was used to calculate the interest so should I get my mom to co-sign with my dad instead for more stable income? Or could I just include her income even if her name isn't on the loan?
3. Is it safe to get prequalified/preapproved through multiple credit unions in order to shop around rates? We already had our credits hard pulled, and I believe there a 14ish day grace period to shop around letting our credit get pulled. Would it make sense to get it hard pulled as well like 6 times within that period?
4. Is it safe to talk about bank/credit union employees about my situation and what's my best move? I was fooled by the finance manager at the dealership who obviously will not agree that removing extras is a good idea. I don't want to be fooled again by a credit union who simply wants me refinance with them no matter the costs.
5. What else should I look for or avoid when finding a credit union to refinance with? I heard prepayment fees should be avoided because I do plan on trying to pay off the loan as soon as possible to avoid interest. Other than that is it simply lowest APR?
6. Is it safe to talk to a [Credit Counselor](https://www.consolidatedcredit.org/ask-the-experts/how-much-does-credit-counseling-cost/) or something similar even if it's a free session? I really want to speak to someone who's a professional for this instead of simply having to rely on a few reddit comments, but I have no resources. I really feel helpless and taken advantage of here. I'm a university student, but I'm not sure who there can help me either. My dad doesn't know English very well and has to get cataracts surgery soon so he can't see very well.

economy,"A New Taxation, Rather Than More Agents","Too often in today’s day, people like to complain about a problem, but fail to give any type of solution. Last week, I spoke about the [Additional 87,000 IRS Agents](https://wherearetherationalpeople.substack.com/p/just-what-we-wantedanother-87000) and what it means for the middle class. There are those that feel this is a good thing. They don’t see these agents as an attack on the middle class, but instead a way to get those avoiding taxes in big business and small business to pay their fair share. I don’t believe this is how it would be used, and I say this based off previous actions whether they be historical or in the recent years. At the least it increases an undue risk, the risk of the government using this extra authority to pressure compliance where it is not justified. At worst it comes to fruition and they are used as a means by the current regime, whoever it may be at the time, to force compliance and punish those they disagree with or see as an obstacle in their way under the guise of “law”. But I do not want to get stuck in the mud there. I want to focus on what we all can agree on: we want the best for our country. 

This week, I present a solution that doesn’t divide and doesn’t have the risk associated with giving the government too much power. A solution that attacks the heart of the problem rather than muddying the waters even further.

For years politicians have used tax rates as a way to divide the people. They run consistently on the idea to either cut tax rates or raise them for public goods. The issues often don’t come down to whether a person actually believes in the tax rate change or in the change in public goods. Often, they are intermingled, where even if a person for example is pro-increased tax revenue, they do not agree with where the tax dollars are coming from. They take a subject where many times most can agree or disagree and intermingle the situation until the split is closer to 50-50.

For years they have used taxes and tax laws as a way to instill fear on the people. The undue fear that you are doing something wrong while giving the government the ability to find a way to make you a criminal. It relates back to the infamous quote from the head of Stalin’s secret police, Lavrentiy Beria, “Show me the man and I’ll show you the crime”. 

The additional funds for the IRS neither fixes these problems nor the problem that big business is often getting away with too much of a tax break. Big business has the financial means to hire top of the line accountants and to understand to the full extent of the law the tax loopholes they can take advantage of. Middle class Americans do not have these types of resources and thus leave themselves vulnerable, not out of some dastardly act but because they don’t have a team of experts working on their financials. If they did, they could take advantage of these loopholes as well. Other times these loopholes aren’t cost effective until you make a certain amount of money. If the extra money you pay to find these loopholes is $40,000, but due to your income it saves you $10,000 it is a net loss of -$30,000. However, big business and high net worth individuals can take advantage by spending the $40,000 and saving say $200,000 off of their higher income creating a $160,000 net gain. 

The additional 87,000 agents is not going to create an atmosphere that catches big business and high net worth skating on taxes. They are doing it legit with all the extra resources they have to understand the tax loopholes put into place for them and that is why this will only hurt the middle class. What I believe most of us want is for these big businesses to pay more of their share. That is where I come to my proposed solution that would solve a problem and unite us rather than divide us.

The solution consists of getting rid of the Individual Tax Return as we know it, setting a certain threshold for those returns, creating a system where most of returns are corporate returns, putting the onus on the corporations to both pay and report, and making big business pay it’s fair share.

**The Solution:**

**1.** **Individual Tax Returns Are Removed for Anyone Earning Under 1 Million Per Year**

· This is a figure most can agree as a good standard for high wealth and this threshold would be raised each year by the CPI.

· It takes away the intrusiveness of taxes. Why does ABC Inc. pay you $100, then tell you, “You owe the IRS $30”? Since when does anyone do that? I have never been with two parties and given Friend A $100 and told them, “Now you owe Friend B $30”. I would give Friend A $70 and Friend B $30.

· In the new system: the corporation with all their accountants relays, by your social security number, what they paid you that year. If you earned more than 1M then you must file a corporate tax return (further details later on). If you made 600k from one corporation and 401k from another you would need to file a corporate return as the IRS. The IRS would receive details from both of your employers by your social security number showing a total of 1.001M.

**2.** **Corporate Returns Based Off Revenue and Net Income**

· Big Business every year skates by on taxes by showing a lack of net income due to loopholes and write offs. There is no acceptable reason why UBER for instance pays 0 in taxes in a given year when they bring in billions in revenue while Uncle Bob’s Taxi Service pays $100k in taxes based of a 1M in revenue. 

· A new taxation-based system from corporate returns where there is a low tax rate based off REVENUE and an additional tax rate for NET INCOME. No year will go by with a corporation having to pay 0 taxes, especially those that are so large.

· For example, let’s use a 3% tax rate on revenue and a 1% tax rate on net income. Sticking with UBER who brought in 17.4 B in revenue and showed a net loss last year, would pay: 17.4 B x 3% = 522 M. They would have $0 owed on net income because they made a net loss, so in total they would pay 522 M for the year in taxes. Then when they become profitable, they would still pay the tax on revenue and would pay an additional tax on net income so if they had made 1B in profit last year on 17.4 B in revenue they would have paid the 522 M + (1 B x 1%) = 522M + 10 M = 532M.

· This would be Federal Tax which would be paid by businesses that do businesses in America. Foreign companies, for instance Toyota, would have to show revenue based off of sales in America not globally and would owe taxes only on that amount.

· Individuals making more than 1 M would need to file as a corporation and pay the same rate for any income above 1M plus State Tax.

· This Federal Tax would be for corporations that do business in multiple states. State Tax would be paid by corporations that only do business in one state. The State Tax can never be higher than the Federal Tax rate to keep fair competition for small businesses. 

**3.** **Less to Oversee**

· From what I could find, in 2021, approximately 166 M individual tax returns and 32.5 M corporate returns were expected to be filed. If we only had corporate returns by removing the secondary transaction from corporations to workers, we can almost entirely remove the 166 M individual returns that need to be overseen. If we wanted to be generous and say 1 M of these people, make over a million per year we have reduced the amount of returns to be processed by 165 M.

· With 165 M less returns to be monitored, we wouldn’t need the extra 80 B that is going to the IRS. That is an 80 B savings alone. The current IRS system would have enough to handle the smaller number of returns and possibly even be able to reduce it’s staff for more savings.

**4.** **Take Away One More Thing to Be Divided About**

· Why are we fighting each other over 87,000 new IRS agents? We shouldn’t be and we wouldn’t be under this new system.

· Corporations would be the focus not the people. The possibility of ramifications and burden would rely on them. The onus would lie on the ones with the resources to report.

· If tax rates went up because of mishandling it would directly effect the corporations rather than the people. The corporations may thus have more reason to not act as haphazardly as they have in the past, i.e the 2008 Recession, due to knowing their negative actions will directly affect their costs they can’t avoid (tax rates on revenue) rather than be pushed towards the people’s tax rate (income tax).

**Conclusion**

There are rippling effects that would come from this such as retirement accounts, tax credits, etc. for the everyday people. In economic theory, wages would lower to make up for the difference the worker is paying in taxes similar to those in states without state tax where the cost of living and wages are lower. However, the above solution is as far as I will go into this system for now as this is an article not a book. I want this to be an enjoyable read that opens the mind to possibilities. One that harbors new ideas that could unite us closer rather than divide us further. An article that shows we have more options than to fight over the divisive solution they give us. These types of ideas will most likely never go anywhere as we do not control the levers. But we can control the ideas and sometimes ideas find their way.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on paying off about $11k on the ol' credit card,"After getting a good-paying job, I've been absolutely pouring money into what I owe on my credit card. When I opened my monthly statement, however, I noticed my interest rate is 18.00%; it used to be 9-10% through my credit union. I'm not sure what changed, or WHEN it changed, embarrassingly enough.

I suppose the first step would be to call the credit union and negotiate a better rate. What's my next step if that doesn't work out? Should I transfer to a new credit card, or would I be better off opening a personal line of credit to pay that off, or something else?

For reference, CreditKarma says my credit rating is about 670; however, when I had a hard pull on my credit a couple of months ago, it was 695 and should be about 10 points up from that now. (Used to be low 800s.... working towards that once again.)

EDIT: Scant on details, my apologies. Income of $100k/year, with a mortgage and car payment at about $1100/month together. I've been putting about $2200/month on the credit card.",finance,1660521701
personalfinance,Balance transfer from existing card onto an ending 0% APR promotional card?,"I had used a Chase card for a 14 month 0% APR promotional period back in May of last year, and now has come the time for the period to end. I was looking to avoid accruing interest on this card and was setting up a 0% balance transfer to do this.

My promotional period ended in July, with a closing date of August 21st for the first month of the new interest rate. If my balance transfer processes before the 21st, will I still have accrued interest on the remaining statement balance, or will this be avoided with the transfer? 

Also, if my transfer does not process in time and interest is posted on the account, is it possible for Chase to grant me a grace period/courtesy for this? Thanks for the help.",finance,1660523083
personalfinance,Treasury Direct I Bond question,"So the current interest rate on these bad boys is over 9% and I'm tempted to max out my personal yearly limit of buying them, but...with interest rates rising across the board isn't it a guarantee that this rate will increase when the current rate expires in October of this year?",finance,1660529424
personalfinance,Is a TIPS ETF a safe 1y investment for a college student?,"Do TIPS follow the CPI?

What's the catch?

Assuming inflation isn't negative, could one lose money in an etf with no fees that follows the CPI? 

The website says that the interest rates increasing will cause TIPS to drop. Is that directly because of the interest rates, or because of the interest rates' effect on inflation?

solar,Can you take the Federal solar tax credit twice?,"Background: I had a system installed on my house last year, 12.91 KW. It was turned on in October and everything was great. I took the tax credit and I've been paying back the loan. 

A month ago a big storm hits the area and blows over a tree right on the house, everyone is OK, but the house is going to need major repairs, and I've lost between 7 and 14 panels + some inverters. 

We are in a good position and have decided to add a second story to the house, using money we have saved, some borrowed and then the insurance money. Our total roof space will grow  and I've asked the architect to optimize the new roof for solar, so we should be able to add a few more panels. 

Insurance will be paying out for the damaged panels, so it would be wrong to claim a second tax credit, even if it was allowed, but my question is the new panels. 

Has anyone seen any guidance on taking the credit on expanding a solar system? 

For example I have 34 panels currently, and say the new system is 40, can I take the 30% on the cost of 6 new panels and inverters? 

Thanks.",energy,1660532617

Newly Covered Today:

1. Wow! The Netherlands arrested the developer of Tornado Cash on Friday (Aug 12). The stakes just got a little higher in crypto.  I suspect a lot of crypto platform developers will feel a little less easy about relying on their open source/decentralized credentials as a shield against government action. [https://www.fiod.nl/arrest-of-suspected-developer-of-tornado-cash/](https://www.fiod.nl/arrest-of-suspected-developer-of-tornado-cash/)
2. An interesting point has been made that validating blocks in ETH 2.0 that contain Tornado Cash or other sanctioned transactions would be a violation of the sanctions while not validating those blocks can also lead to financial penalties (“inactivity leaking”) in ETH 2.0. The fear is that this could lead to protocol-level censorship to accommodate sanctions.

personalfinance,Cash flow vs interest rate vs saving,"I have $3k left on my 2% auto note at $210/month and $6k left on my 15% CareCredit-type medical debt account at $200/month. I've been paying everything leftover toward the medical debt lately, but I'm wondering if going for paying off the car to more quickly improve cash flow is a decent strategy for my situation.

My partner had to quit his job for health reasons in spring and just started working in a much lower paid position part time again now. The plan is that he will work his way back into his previous level in the next 1-3 years after finishing recovery.

I've never gone backward in income, so it took me too long to adjust my budget and I'm still cutting stuff out now. Still, our cash flow is fairly tight right now (still contributing to savings and retirement but not huge amounts). The third option is to just save and not worry about trying to pay off debt in this situation.

Thoughts?

Tl;Dr: Partner had to quit his job due to health, destroying our budget and I didn't adjust soon enough so the cash flow is a bit tight as I'm still cutting and getting stuff cancelled. Spend a small lump sum to improve cash flow, continue spending all spare cash on paying down high interest debt, or just save and survive?",finance,1660551094

After going through my current finances and investments they suggested a Whole Life Insurance policy. Details: 

Whole Life 20 Pay 
Loan interest rate: 4.65 % 
Initial death benefit: 79,271
Monthly premium: 150, or 1800 a year. 

After 20 years, they stated I would no longer pay anything into this account and that it would accumulate on its own. 
Based on the illustration they gave me, (it is based on dividends of the year 2022 and could fluctuate is what I’ve figured) by age 65 I would have an end of year benefit for $371,605 and a net cash value of $329,112. (EDITS ARE BELOW I MADE A MISTAKE ON THESE NUMBERS) 

Something seems… off. I’m not well versed in finance, so please correct me if I’m wrong. I looked through these documents they gave me and read all the fine print and I can’t seem to find if there’s some hidden fees I’m missing. 

Am I missing something and are their additional questions I need to be asking?

Edit: in a matter of 15 minutes after posting I now realize I was totally about to make a horrible decision by doing this. I can put my money elsewhere. Thank you!

Edit: I made a slight error on one segment, it was not a projected cash value of $329,112 at age 65 as I was looking at the life of policy and not my age. What it would actually be at age 65 is total cash at $105,192 and $188,284 in benefits. My mistake!

stocks,New York Empire State factory gauge plunges in August deep into contraction territory,"The New York Fed’s Empire State business conditions index, a gauge of manufacturing activity in the state, plummeted 42.4 points to negative 31.3 in August, the regional Fed bank said Monday. This is the second largest monthly decline on record and among the lowest levels in the survey’s history, the regional Fed bank said. Economists had expected a reading of 5.0, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal. Any reading below zero indicates deteriorating conditions.

**Key details:** The index for new orders dropped 35.8 points to negative 29.6 in August. The shipments index fell 49.4 points to negative 24.1. Unfilled orders fell for the third straight month. Labor market conditions weakened. The prices-paid index fell 9 points to 55.5, its lowest level in over a year. In addition, manufacturers were not optimistic about the six-month outlook.

**Big picture:** Economists were expecting a small retreat in the factory index, not a rout. The U.S. manufacturing sector, which was a strength during the recovery from the pandemic, is facing a steep drop-off in new business. The New York data, and a similar reading from the Philadelphia Fed, are seen as early indicators for the health of the factory sector in August. The closely-watched Institute for Supply Management’s barometer of American factories fell to a two-year low of 52.8% in July.

**What are they saying?** “We caution to not take too much away from this report as it likely paints an excessively downbeat picture of manufacturing. We look for a soft economic rebound in the second half of 2022 to keep manufacturing growing in a low gear,” said Oren Klachkin, economist at Oxford Economics.

Notably, it has the financial support of Andreessen Horowitz, the prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm that was an early investor in everything from Facebook to Airbnb.

Andreessen Horowitz is considered royalty among early-stage investors, so its backing is a powerful sign of support, and perhaps a rebuke to Mr. Neumann’s critics, who have described his leadership of WeWork as a cautionary tale of corporate hubris.

The firm’s investment in Flow is about $350 million, according to three people briefed on the deal, valuing the company at more than $1 billion before it even opens its doors. The investment is the largest individual check Andreessen Horowitz has ever written in a round of funding to a company.

Flow is expected to launch in 2023, and the venture capital giant’s co-founder Marc Andreessen will join its board, these people said. Mr. Neumann is planning to make a sizable personal investment in the firm in the form of cash and real estate assets.""",finance,1660574213

investing,"Don't fight the Fed, but there's more","I'm not a market timer in the sense that I don't sell when the market goes down, but I will sit on my cash when there are certain events that make it logical the market will be moving lower. One of those is the old saying ""Don't fight the Fed"" meaning invest aggressively when the Fed is lowering rates, and be more conservative when they are raising rates.

I came across another market sentiment today that I may have overlooked and perhaps others can share some history. The 10 year treasury hit a 52 week peak on 6/13. The S&amp;P hit it's 52 week bottom on 6/17. The 10 year treasury has been trending lower while the S&amp;P 500 has been trending higher. 

For all the talk of the Fed raising rates, there's not ben much discussion of the Fed unwinding their massive balance sheet. Also consider that the Inflation Reduction (sic) Act will require the issuance of more debt, if both the Fed AND the treasury are sellers, seems like that would cause prices to fall and positively affect equities. But it seems counterintuitive that the Fed raising rates would lead to a lowering of the 10 year treasury rate?

This is why no market sentiment is cut and dry. Like Warren Buffets 2 Rules of investing: 1, don't lose money. 2, don't forget rule number 1. Well he took a major loss selling the airlines.

Anyway- I got him home on Friday night and on Saturday morning he had diarrhea, ate some grass, and did like a green-grass-induced vomit.

I fasted him for 12 hours and then switched him to half plain rice/half his normal kibble (orijen)

He seemed to perk up for about a day and was peeing and pooping normally but today when I went to get him from his crate, he had thrown up inside of it, and he hasn’t peed or pooped at all since then…he is interested in food, but not interested in water. He is also very low energy. Usually he’s pretty hyperactive but he is mostly napping in sunbeams and loafing around.

personalfinance,(Canada) Difficulties deciding what to do with my retirement funds after changing job.,"Hi all,

Long story short: I changed jobs a 2 months ago and now have to deal with the retirement funds I had accumulated through my previous employer's plan.

My current situation;

* In my early 30s;
* 150K left to pay on my house (325-350K value), with 4 years left at 2.2% before I need to renew my mortgage;
* My car is fully paid, and I expect to have to change it in about 2 years;
* Around 80K in annual salary (around 53K after federal and provincial taxes, so roughly 1K a week, net);
* About 10K in my checking account (reason on why so much sitting in there lower in the post), with a steady income that make it increase, and not decrease;
* 40K in my bank's TFSA, invested in a moderately aggressive investment fund;
* 30K in my bank's RRSP, invested in a moderately aggressive investment fund;
* **72K (18K immobilized, 54K non-immobilized)  in my previous employer's retirement fund plan in ""X"" investment establishment. (THIS IS THE PART I AM ASKING ABOUT).**

About the 10K in the checking account: I maxed out my RRSP this year, and I invest 750$ a month in my bank's TFSA, I am waiting to be able to invest through my current employer.

Now, in my current situation, I can't invest, nor will have access, to my current employer's retirement fund plan, at ""Y"" investment establishment, for another 4 months. And, the problem is that I now need to decide what I will do with my funds in my previous employer's retirement fund plan, at ""X"" investing establishment, within the next month. My options are as follow;

* Do nothing, and keep the funds in my previous employer's plan, at ""X"" investing establishment, which has the advantage of low administrative/management fees (0.75%), but the disadvantage of giving me very little control or say over those funds;
* Transfer the funds into another, personal, portfolio at ""X"" investment establishment, which allows me to better control my funds, but has a 1.6 to 1.8% administrative/management fee, which is not guaranteed won't go change later on;
* Transfer all my funds to another investing establishment, at which point, they will be turned into a LIRA;
* Cash-in my funds (NOPE).

In my current situation, I am torn between the fact that I lose control of how my funds are managed if I keep them in my previous employer's plan, and the fact that I would pay a lot more administrative/management fees (around 1% more seems massive to me) if I moved them into a portfolio where I can actually manage and move around my funds a little. There is also the third option of transferring everything elsewhere, but I am not that knowledgeable about the offering of other investing establishments.

Any help or tip on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,How do I choose a different type of fund on Vanguard from Money Market Fund?,"Hi, I was pretty new to IRA in 2020, and signed up for Vanguard.

My YTD return is 0.16%, and made $29.30 from $11,000 in. In the beginning, I was getting like $0.05/mo, but last month is was $13.72 from dividend.

investing,Third Point accumulates a position in $DIS. Gives 5 suggestions to unlock further value.,"Dear Bob:

Congratulations on a terrific quarter and positive momentum in Parks, ESPN, and media and entertainment. We were particularly pleased to see the strength in DTC subscriber growth, the key driver of Disney’s long-term transformation towards less volatile, ultimately higher margin cashflows with a greater return on invested capital. As we wrote to our investors at the time of our initial investment in 2020, which highlighted the extraordinary potential of Disney+, we liken this evolution of the Company from “analog” theatrical releases towards digital distribution to Microsoft’s transition from selling software in plastic wrap boxes to a SaaS model. We expect to see the quality of Disney’s financial results improve as the Company’s business shifts further.

We have had over two years to observe management navigate the most challenging time in Disney’s history, as you led the organization to simultaneously grow the DTC business, guide the Parks from pandemic closures to record-revenues and profits, and create quality entertainment content. This quarter’s results are an important proof point that Disney’s complex transformation is succeeding and our confidence in Disney’s current trajectory is such that we have, in recent weeks, repurchased a significant stake in the Company.

We have also filed Hart-Scott-Rodino approval with the Federal Trade Commission so that we can engage with management and the Board in order to work directly and constructively with all parties, since the Company will likely require additional strategic, capital allocation, and governance changes to ensure its success.

I realize some of our suggestions may already be in the works, but since we do not possess any material non-public information, we thought it might be useful to share our thinking on five important initiatives that we believe will unlock further value in the near-term.

1.
Cost Cutting: Disney’s costs are among the highest in the industry, and we believe Disney significantly underearns relative to its potential. We urge the Company to embark on a cost cutting program that addresses both margins and the disposal of excess underperforming assets.
 
2.
Dividend Policy: In a prior letter, we proposed that the Company continue the policy initiated under Covid when parks were closed to suspend payment of a cash dividend. We urge the Company to preserve this policy and use free cash flow to pay down debt, repurchase shares, or organically reinvest in the business.
 
3.
Hulu: We believe that integrating Hulu directly into the Disney+ DTC platform will provide significant cost and revenue synergies, ultimately reigniting growth in the domestic market. We urge the Company to make every attempt to acquire Comcast’s remaining minority stake prior to the contractual deadline in early 2024. We believe that it would even be prudent for Disney to pay a modest premium to accelerate the integration but are cognizant that the seller may have an unreasonable price expectation at this time (while noting the seller has already made the decision to prematurely remove their own content from the platform.) We know this is a priority for you and hope there is a deal to be had before Comcast is contractually obligated to do so in about 18 months.
 
4.
ESPN: ESPN is a great business that currently generates significant free cash flow, enabling the Company to pay down debt and increase strategic options down the line. In addition, we realize ESPN content is part of the bundle being offered to subscribers of other products, both in Disney’s Linear and DTC businesses. Despite these advantages, we believe that a strong case can be made that the ESPN business should be spun off to shareholders with an appropriate debt load that will alleviate leverage at the parent Company. The important questions to ask before commencing a spinoff are:
 
Will both companies be better off?
Will the needs of customers be better served?
Can any synergies that exist between the two companies be replicated by contractual arrangements?
Will the transaction contribute to creating long-term value for Disney shareholders?
 
While acknowledging that broader capital structure considerations may be at issue, we believe that the answer to all four of these questions is affirmative. Employees of ESPN could be compensated in a security directly tied to their performance. ESPN would have greater flexibility to pursue business initiatives that may be more difficult as part of Disney, such as sports betting. Customers of ESPN and sports leagues would be better served by a focused management team driving a leadership position in sports distribution. We believe that most arrangements between the two companies can be replicated contractually, in the way eBay spun PayPal while continuing to utilize the product to process payments.
 
Lastly, as a result of this transaction, both companies will attract shareholders seeking the respective qualities of each company, allowing the Disney parent multiple to expand as its earnings growth rate increases and the remaining business is no longer haunted by the specter of cord cutting. While I understand you have considered this idea in the past, we urge the Company to retain advisors to reassess the desirability of the transaction in the current environment, recognizing that a key determination would be the proforma capitalizations, cashflow and credit profile of both companies.
 
5.
Board Refresh: Disney is a world-class company that deserves a world-class board of directors who possess diverse talents and experience with strengths in technology, advertising, and consumer engagement, as well as proven track records of leading large complex organizations and creating shareholder value. This is not meant to single out any current board members, but we believe there are gaps in talent and experience as a group that must be addressed. Third Point has identified potential board members who we believe would make essential contributions to the Company’s Board at this critical time. We would be happy to make an introduction.

I look forward to discussing these topics with you, Christine, and when practicable, the Board and company advisors.

Sincerely,

Daniel S. Loeb

personalfinance,Should I repair my old car or find another used car in this current market?,"I'm deliberating whether I should purchase a used car for under $15,000 or stick with my 2003 Honda Civic that needs repairs.  The engine in my 2003 Honda Civic needs to be replaced and it has 159,200 miles on it.  I work remotely and have only driven 22,000 miles in the past four years since I've owned it.

Repairs will run \~$2500-4500 and I'm not sure how extensive the damage is aside from the engine, because they haven't done a thorough inspection.  I have $70,000 in savings so I wouldn't need to get a loan with interest if I purchase a ""new"" used car.  I paid off most of my student loans and I have under 10K in federal student loans (it's currently on pause due to the pandemic-- I was holding off payments to see if government loan forgiveness would be enacted). I live in the California Bay Area and my total monthly expenses for rent, food, other bills, and spending is around $2,100.  I just received a 15% raise and my current salary is $79,000/year.

I know that all cars in the market are really expensive right now, almost double in certain cases, due to the chip shortages and high demand/low supply; I heard that prices are predicted to decrease in late 2022 or early 2023, but it likely won't be pre-pandemic prices and it might take even longer for used car prices to decrease.  I'm considering purchasing a used Honda Civic within the 2008-2015 range for the sake of longevity, safety improvements, and hopefully less upkeep in repairs (aside from regular maintenance).  Most used Honda Civics from this time period range from $9,000-15,000 with 80,000-140,000 miles on them. Would it be worth it to just invest in this instead?   

Theoretically, my current 2003 Honda Civic could last another 8+ years, but my biggest fear is that I'll have to do frequent repairs and I don't trust using it for road trips.  I'm also wary that the car is almost 20 years old now.",finance,1660579630

personalfinance,Personal Loan Advice,"Good Morning personal finance. I’m pretty much asking for advice in terms of a personal loan. I keep getting letters in the mail for loan consolidations. I always shrugged them off but lately I feel like the interest rates on all my cards are pretty much eating away at my paycheck and not attacking the actual principles enough. I looked into the loans briefly and seen an example of a loan that in my eyes might benefit me. An example loan was $16,000 at 16.99 APR with a monthly payment of about $416 I believe for a 36 month term. 

As an example, one of my credit cards I have $11,250 in debt and I’m currently paying about $230 a month with $145 going towards interest alone. My thought process would be if I could consolidate about 4-5 cards into one lump sum and just pay that monthly payment of $416 I would be paying less in interest and I will have the benefit of making one payment on a specific date rather than having to pay multiple companies on different dates. I did the math and with that loan or one similar I would be able to make that payment and all other monthly payments or rent and car and still have enough to cover other expenses and put a little away at a time. Currently it’s more of every paycheck goes straight to bills with very little pocket change left over.

A little more info on myself if it helps. 

I make $55,000 in NYC. I have $13,000 left on a 3 year auto finance, I don’t plan on buying a house anytime soon and am not expecting to have to utilize my credit score anytime soon. I just enrolled in school to pursue a degree that will benefit my career move in a major financial way and nearly double my annual salary but that wont happen for at least 2-3 years. I pay $1,200 in rent with a roommate. 

As you can tell I don’t have much knowledge on whether something like this is a good call or not. My main questions are as followed.

1.  I would like to know if there is any specific fine print I should look out for in terms of the loan. Predatory loan warnings or general tips.

2. If this sounds like a good plan are there any specific companies or websites I should checkout to weigh out different options.

3. Does this affect my credit in a major way or is it something that would be minor in the long run. Currently I have a 670 FICO score.

4. Would a better path for me be to take out a student loan of $10,000 and not have to make payments on the principal or accrue interest until 6 months after I graduate (roughly 4 years from now) and chip away at the debt while I’m in school?

stocks,Why BlackRock says the stock market’s big summer rally isn’t worth chasing ....,"&amp;#x200B;

With U.S. stocks briefly sputtering to start the new week, strategists at the research arm of the world’s largest money manager are weighing in with words of caution.

&amp;#x200B;

In a note released on Monday by the BlackRock Investment Institute, they said they expect U.S. company earnings to deteriorate and the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates to a level that will “stall the economic restart,” given persistent inflation that’s likely to settle above pre-COVID levels. They also called the stock market’s rally off the mid-June lows unsustainable.

&amp;#x200B;

Equities were slightly higher at midday Monday, taking back modest loses seen after U.S. data missed forecasts and China’s unexpected signs of slowing growth damped investor sentiment. Financial markets have been shifting back and forth between two narratives — one in which easing inflation and slowing growth give the Fed room to back off aggressive rate hikes, the other in which persistently high price gains coupled with a robust labor market compel policy makers to continue lifting borrowing costs.

&amp;#x200B;

July’s downside surprise in the consumer-price index gave equities a boost and helped send the S&amp;P 500 SPX, 0.40% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, 0.62% to their fourth straight week of gains on Friday. The S&amp;P 500 has surged more than 16% from its June low and retraced more than 50% of its bear-market drop.

&amp;#x200B;

Read: Inflation surge cools in July. Should you still play defense with your portfolio?

&amp;#x200B;

“We don’t think the equity bounce is worth chasing,” said strategists Wei Li, Beata Harasim and Tara Sharma, along with BlackRock Investment Institute’s Deputy Head Alex Brazier. “We believe the Fed will remain susceptible to ‘the politics of inflation,’ a chorus of voices demanding it tame inflation. Our bottom line: The latest inflation reading isn’t enough to spur the Fed pivot we’ve been waiting for to lean back into stocks.”

&amp;#x200B;

What’s more, they said, consumer spending is in the process of shifting toward services and away from goods, the category which benefited from the stay-at-home stage of the pandemic. That shift “could hit stocks,” according to the BlackRock strategists: They note that earnings tied to goods are expected to make up 62% of the S&amp;P 500’s profits this year, versus 38% for services, as shown in the chart below. A boom in services would power the economy more than it would S&amp;P 500 earnings.",finance,1660594293

1: This “recession” is priced in, and it turns out the cost isn’t that large. Unemployment remains low, and people are buying stuff. The line at Chik fil A is still long as ever, and people still can’t get a PS5 at retail.

2: The Ukraine war isn’t that big of a deal. Support is starting to wane, and oil prices are going down anyway. Eventually the conflict will fade into obscurity. As for the European winter, so what if they have to turn on their coal plants? They will still be itching to buy the next iPhone.

3: Chinese housing crisis isn’t a crisis at all. CCP will simply “fix” the balance sheets like they have the last 20 years, and everything will be alright. It’s worked in the past, it will work in the present. The mighty Chinese economic machine will keep churning

4: Inflation is going down, but even if it didn’t, it’s not a big deal. Companies will just raise their prices, and people will continue to buy at those prices. Corporate profits are at ATH in some sectors. Therefore stocks in those remain high. Do you really want to stay in cash with all that action happening?

5: Despite rising interest rates, they are still at historic lows. Fed will probably stop rising them soon with favorable CPI reports. Likely they will top out at very low levels anyway. Volcker days are gone.

Right now we're trying to decide whether to rent both homes out and buy another jointly, rent one and sell one for the down payment on another home, or maybe sell both. I think ideally we'd keep both as rentals but we won't have much to put down on a new jointly purchased home. 

We're struggling with a couple things. From a smart money/investment perspective, does it make sense to try to rent both homes? How would we afford a third without selling one? and do we want to buy a third given our existing homes were purchased when interest rates were at 3.25%.

Second, how to structure our finances so that nobody loses more than the other if things don't end up working out. For instance, if she sells her house and I rent mine and we break up, I still have a house with a 3.25% interest rate and she's left trying to stay in a more expensive home with a higher interest rate.

I went with a loan, I didn't want to ""borrow"" the panels from them.  It's a $41,688 loan at 1.99% with an implied cost per kWh of $0.138. It's a 10.80 kW system with 27 panels.  Estimated to generate 12,862 kWh/year. Panels used will be Hanwha Q-Cell Q. Peak Duo BLK ML-G10+ and the inverter is a SolarEdge SE7600H-USSN.

I generally use less than 1,100 kWh 7 months out of the year.  My average bill year to date (August 2021-August 2022) is $186.74. My bill through them is projected at $133/month as long as I apply the federal tax rebate of $10,000 towards the balance before the 17-month balloon. If I don't (which I would 100% do), my price would be $183/month. With that math, my savings would be minimal when you factor in the charge the electric company would be charging me, except in months when I have a surplus.

I'm questioning this entire process less than an hour after the rep left and even more so after I saw how terrible their reviews are on.  On the plus side, they have a local office which seems to be a complaint with a lot of reviewers.

I don't know too much about the economy, but I have been told it's important to keep an eye on the cost of supply, interest rates, and labor (if there's any others then let me know).

My question is...

1. Where do I find these economic indicators and what are they called?
2. How do I know exactly whether they are doing bad or good?
3. Is labor, interest rates, and labor the only major economic factors I should be looking at while flipping homes?

I don't need answers like ""look at the comps"" or ""Find the AVR"", I'm asking for MAJOR factors that affect this sector, what they are exactly, and getting a brief understanding of it.

Thanks!",finance,1660612600

personalfinance,Help me evaluate my present financial situation,"Hello everyone, I am hoping for some inputs on my present financial situation as well as any criticisms as far as my present savings allocations and budgeting. I posted a few weeks ago regarding Roth vs Pretax contributions, however I was hoping for some insights regarding my broader financial picture.

The basics: I am 30 years old, single with no kids. I currently gross around $110k a year and my present monthly savings rate is as follows:

4% Roth 401k contributions

12% Company matches/profit sharing

4% Stock Purchase Plan

4% ESPP match

$300 Roth IRA Contributions(Can afford to do $500, may adjust in near future)

$500 Cash Savings

Effective current savings rate is approximately 33% of income across these areas, saving approx $3,000/month.

Current approx net worth $365,000. $200k in home equity($500k value, $300k mortgage), $120k 401k, $10k Roth IRA, $10k brokerage, $25k cash. Investments are primarily US Equities with some global exposure and Roth IRA primarily concentrated in tech ETFs. Cash is just in Credit Union Savings Account.

My monthly takehome pay is around $4800, but a large portion of my compensation is an annual bonus which is expected to be around $12k net. Monthly expenditures are as follows:

Mortgage: $1600

Utilities: $250

Phone/internet: $150

Gas: $200

Gym: $30

Subscriptions: $40

Discretionary(to include food): $1200

Roth: $300

Savings: $500

Total: $4270

My cars are paid off, and I do not include auto insurance as I pay this annually from my bonus. The intention of my annual bonus is for the remainder to go toward my savings, which ideally could be an investment property once my local housing market becomes more reasonable. I am aware that my discretionary spending is high, however I do track my monthly spending and consistently keep myself at or below this threshold. This category also includes all groceries, eating out, dining, entertainment, etc. My present financial situation allows for around a $500/month buffer which I use to cover the unexpected: family assistance, vehicle repairs, registrations, pet care, etc. Things that are more difficult to quantify but it may not make sense to consider as part of a monthly budget structure. Any leftovers go to the savings account. I also consider my discretionary spending to be my ""treat yourself"" portion as i do feel pretty good about my present savings and continual savings rate. 

What can I do differently? I feel pretty confident in where I'm presently at, and my goal is to simply work in my present career field for the next 20-25 years with an expectation to pay off my home prior to that(hard pill to swallow, easy to do but 2.5% interest rate is nice). I don't want to have tunnel vision as far as my present situation and I'm hoping for some outside corrective opinions on where I can be better. Thank you!",finance,1660619608
personalfinance,"After receiving emails I thought were spam, I received letters in the mail from two different banks about open accounts in my name.","Last week, I received emails from two different banks (Truist and PenFed) thanking me for opening accounts with them. I thought it was a couple of phishing attempts and forwarded them to the banks to report them. Today, however, I received letters in the mail from each of them. 

From Truist, I got a letter ""Re: Notice of Closure of Truist Accounts""; the letter stated they had to close the accounts and that they were under investigation. I forwarded the email to their fraud department so I'm hoping that's the end of it.

For PenFed, I got what appears to be a welcome package. The documents included my full name, address, birthday, and social security number. I called and was able to speak to a rep who stated the account already was flagged for possible fraud, but helped me file a report to close the account. 

I have been trying to get a mortgage, and my credit was pulled through NACA a couple weeks ago. The rep stated that was most likely what led to this. I froze my credit, changed my banking and email passwords, and checked my current accounts to make sure there have not been any unauthorized transactions. Is there anything else I should be doing? This is my first experience with any sort of identity theft and I'm feeling helpless.",finance,1660619791

**Financials**

*All the calculations are based on a $2,000 mortgage.*

Income:

Gross: $67,800 yearly $5,688 monthly $2,844 bi-weekly

Net: $52,338 yearly $4,362 monthly $2,180 bi-weekly

Projected rental income (found tenant, ready to sign lease): $10,800 yearly $900 monthly

Current debt-to-income ratio (w/ mortgage included): 41%

Current debt-to-income ratio (w/ mortgage &amp; rental income included): 36%

Emergency fund (cash reserves only, not including payment for closing costs &amp; down payment): \~$12,000

% of net income spent on housing: 46

% of gross spent on housing: 35

% of net spent on housing (w/ rental income): 40

% of gross spent on housing (w/rental income): 31

**Rules of Thumb**

*No more than 30% of your gross monthly income should be spent on housing:*

A $2,000 mortgage puts me at 35%, but with the rental income it’s 31%.

*Your mortgage payment shouldn't put you more than 36% DTI:*

A $2,000 mortgage puts me at 41% DTI, but with rental income it’s 36%.

*The 4x rule (if you spend less than 20% of your current take-home income on debt):*

I currently spend less than 5% of my income on existing debts, so the 4x rule gives me a purchase price of \~$270,000 with no HOA dues. This is currently the price target I’m aiming for. So although these calculations are based on a $2,000 mortgage from a \~$300,000 purchase price, it will more likely be a $1,800-$1,900 mortgage.

*Emergency fund for household expenses to last at least 6 months:*

Stashing away $2,500 for 6 months puts me at $15,000, but by the time I officially close and have to start paying the loan I should be around there.

**Factors to consider:**

* My girlfriend will live with me, and her income was left out of the loan approval process purposefully to ensure we do not overextend ourselves. My current thoughts are that we’ll just split the mortgage from what’s left over from the other tenant. We’ll be paying around $550 each with the current calculations.
* I would need to lose my job and BOTH of my roommates in order for me to be truly swamped. In this case, I could sell my \~$20,000 car and live off my current cash reserves to give me time to find another job or sell the house.
* I shouldn't rely on this but my quoted \~5% interest rate leaves room for improvement, so I could refinance down the line and save money.
* The tenant is only signing a lease for a year, so the rental income is not guaranteed for the life of the loan but hopefully my income will increase in 2 or 3 years to a point where I can cover their portion eventually or find another tenant. 

Are there any flaws in this way of thinking? Any other rules of thumb I should use? 

Thanks for all your help in navigating this!",finance,1660624100
personalfinance,Excel Personal Budget Wksht Question,"So I'm trying to create an excel spreadsheet with all of monthly budget information in one place. The issue I'm running into is with creating a formula in Excel to figure out how much interest I'm paying on each loan per month. So when I do the formula, it's (total current loan balance * interest rate). Like if I had a $100k loan with a 2.99 interest rate, the monthly interest charge should be something like $250 maybe? But it's showing up in the cell as almost $3000. If I add in a formula to divide the original formula by 12, would that make it work? Also, is all interest calculated annually, and if not, how can I tweak the formula to make it accurately reflect how much interest I'm paying each month? 

Of course I can check each account monthly, but I'm trying to put everything in one spreadsheet and make it as streamlined and automatic as possible.

Any help would be great!!!!!",finance,1660629247

retirement,I'm 61 and I think I'm ready - I've had enough of the corporate grind,"I'm 61 and my financial advisor has run the monte carlo simulations.  The numbers say we can do it.  I'm a middle manager in a high stress corporate job.  The company I have been working at for 10 years has been in a constant state of turmoil for the last 2 years.  New CEO &amp; entirely new Board of Directors that fired the founders of the company.  The CEO then replaced the entire executive team and I am one of the very few people above the manager level left from the previous regime.  They are now planning to layoff 150 people and replace them with outsourced vendors.  I'm tired, burned-out, fed-up and very unhappy.  If I stay, I believe I will eventually be replaced.  They are already not happy with me - but I'm also a convenient scapegoat to blame for all the things they don't like and/or don't understand.  I don't want to be the ruthless boss they want me to be - I don't believe in that style of management, but it is ALL they do.

Sorry - I started to go on a rant there...

I'm also scared.  My plan was always to work until I was 65 - and even though the numbers say I can do it now, I feel like I'm going to be leaving a lot of money on the table.  I'm also worried about the economy and just how bad it could get.  

However, on the other side of the ledger sheet is the fact that my father had a massive heart attack at 57, and despite a series of subsequent medical issues, lived until he was 91.  I'm relatively healthy, and unlike my father, I have a chance to enjoy my retirement - IF - I don't let the stress of my job do the same thing to me that it did to my father.

If you believe you do have the resources to do it, what are the downsides of retiring at 61?",finance,1660633593

If I should be storing it as a secret to be used in my workflow, should I authenticate my workflow using federated credentials, or using Azure KeyVault simultaneously with federated credentials (store the SP ID's inside the keyvault so that access is still maintained through Azure)

personalfinance,Why interest rate of this mortgage is much higher than what bank saying?,"Suppose I have a 500,000 mortgage, 30 yr fixed 5.966% interest rate and 2,987 monthly payment (Taxes and fees excluded for simplicity).

Now if I add up all of monthly payment, I will pay back total amont of:
30 yr × 12 × 2,987 = 1,075,320 $

That means after 30 year I will pay bank 575,320 plus principal. It's about 100% interest rate!
1,075,320 - 500,000 ÷ 500,000 × 100 = 115%

My question is, why bank saying interest rate is 5.966%? If interest rate of this loan is 5.966% then I think, I have to pay back: 500,000 × 5.966% = 29,830 for interest plus principal. 29,830 + 500,000 = 529,830 $ but in reality I will pay back 1,075,320, why?

My primary goal is to lower my monthly payment ($480).  I may consider selling it but I'm actually more likely to keep the car because its in great condition, I love it, and new cars are too expensive.  

The only way I sell it is if I'm considering to buy a used car in cash with any margin made (very unlikely).

personalfinance,Had a door-to-door salesman pitch me on rooftop solar and I'm trying to find the catch. Seems too good to be true.,"From my understanding if I get solar panels installed on my roof:

* Panels are owned, not leased.
* I get a 51% tax credit (25% SC + 26% Federal)\*. Get reimbursed almost half of the total cost when I file taxes.
* No down payment.
* Monthly solar payment plus utilities is 20% *less* than my average utility bill over the past 3 years.
* 25 year warranty such that if my solar panels dip below 80% of their rated performance they get replaced free of charge.

Surely I'm missing something, right? So I keep living along as usual and I get a $10k - $15k check during tax season, *and* I pay 20% less monthly for power+solar payments?? I've also had an appointment with a 'Solar Advisor' from my utility company, a neutral 3rd party whose job it is to just provide the facts (as I understand it). According to the solar advisor, the utility company buys back the power I generate for the exact price I pay them. Should that rate change in the future, I'll get grandfathered in and maintain our agreed upon 1:1 rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Even more factors in my favor:

* I have natural gas water and house heating. Per the solar advisor, I'll likely build up a credit during winter and spend that credit over summer when air conditioning is needed. Ultimately breaking even.
* No HOA
* No trees nearby
* House faces north-to-south.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple things that aren't adding up/red flags:

* According to the utility company, only 700 out of their 68,000 customers only have solar?? I understand that a large portion of their customer base probably rentals, HOA-restricted, or multi-family building residents. I'm outside of city limits in a relatively rural area so I'm doubtful that 99% of their customer base falls under those categories.
* If this deal is so good, why would I be the ONLY house in my neighborhood with rooftop solar?

&amp;#x200B;

In order to structure the payments such that my average monthly payment is less than what I'm paying currently, the loan payments will last \~20 years. Should I sell my house before the panels are paid off, I imagine it wouldn't be too difficult to add the balance of the loan to the asking price of the house. If I were a buyer it'd certainly be a bonus to buy a house that *doesn't* have a power bill!

&amp;#x200B;

*\*SC pays the tax credit in $3,500 increments each year.*

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: If I get rooftop solar my net monthly payment will be 20% cheaper than my average electric bill, and I get half the total solar cost back when I file taxes. This seems too good to be true, and I'm trying to find the catch.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: The solar advisor from the utility company made a good point in suggesting that it'd be a good idea to make any home appliance updates before getting solar (i.e. replace my 20 year old hvac). That way I can have a better understanding of my monthly power consumption.",finance,1660663452

An economist known for his bearish tendencies is warning Americans that a recession will be ""long"" and ""severe"". Nouriel Roubini, also referred to as ""Dr. Doom,"" said Monday that a recession could bring financial distress ""across the board."" 

Despite a strong jobs report, the U.S. economy has left many Americans seeing higher grocery bills despite a dip in July in overall inflation. The Federal Reserve has attempted to curb inflation by raising interest rates, but some experts say the country is heading for, or may already be in a recession. 

 ""We are in a sharp slowdown, we've had two negative quarters of growth in the first half \[of 2022\],"" Roubini, an Iranian American economist who accurately predicted the housing bubble burst in 2008, told Bloomberg on Monday. ""The recession is going to be long, protracted, severe, and associated with financial distress across the board.""

The Federal Reserve most recently hiked interest rates another 75 basis points in late July to thwart an inflation rate of 8.5 percent, which followed a similar raise in June—marking the largest back-to-back increases seen in decades. Roubini implied the increases aren't enough to combat inflation.

In fact, Roubini expects the Fed will need to hike interest rates further to bring the 8.5 percent inflation rate to the target 2 percent.

""The Fed funds rate should be going well above 4 percent to push inflation towards 2 percent,"" he said to Bloomberg. ""If that doesn't happen, inflation expectations are going to get unhinged, or you'll get a hard landing.""

Yet despite the growing concern regarding a recession, the Fed's interest rates are still relatively low.

According to an article by Bankrate, although the Fed has been raising interest rates, its borrowing rate is still historically low. The federal funds rate has remained below its historic average of 4.61 percent since 2007. From 2008 to 2015, the federal funds rate was zero.

The federal funds rate reached its highest point in the early 1980s, when it soared to 20 percent.

Roubini said he felt although inflation may have peaked, he's unsure of how fast it may fall.

""I don't think the monetary policy is tight enough to push inflation to 2 percent fast enough,"" he said.

During the last week of July, an editing war broke out on the Wikipedia page for ""recession"" after Biden administration officials played down figures showing the United States had entered an unofficial recession following two quarters of negative economic growth. Two consecutive quarters of decreasing GDP is an unofficial definition for a recession.",finance,1660670660

We initially wanted to pay off the mortgage, but our advisor is adamant that because our mortgage rate is lower than historical market returns, it's better in the long run to invest it and keep making payments. Here's some background:

* Current mortgage balance is around $190k
* Interest rate is 3.25% on a 30-year fixed
* Payment is \~$900/month
* We make over $120k/year but property taxes are ridiculous
* We currently make enough to handle the payment, but my wife would like to pursue other career options and be at home more

I understand that the market rate vs. our interest rate means we'll be better off investing if we're going for a higher net worth, but we really like the idea of getting rid of the mortgage to provide more margin in our budget.

personalfinance,What to do with windfall,"Hello everyone,

I bought a townhouse 3 months ago for $419K and I gave $50K as downpayment. My rate is 4.798% for a 30-year conventional loan. I recently got a windfall of $200K (I do need to rebuild my emergency fund so I will  keep $25K in savings). I got a few scenarios thought out but not sure what would be best:

1. Make a big lump sum payment to the mortgage and keep paying the same amount so I'll be done way earlier.

2. Wait a bit to refinance adding this extra amount so payments are lower along with a 15-year loan (or less) for the remaining amount. Hoping interest rates go down a percentage or 2 by then.

3. Pay a portion toward my mortgage and save some to make at least a 20% down payment towards a $300k condo to rent it out and have a source of passive income. Rent for a 2-bed apartment is ~$1,900/month where I live.

4. ??? open to ideas 

I make $113K living in HCOL area and my mortgage payment is $2600/month but my partner pays me $1150/month in rent. My other monthly expenses are ~$800/month. I do save money every month and max out my 401K contribution every year. And the past few years I have been able to make the max roth IRA contribution each year.

Otherwise, I have no other debts. My car is only 6 years old and I plan to drive it until the wheels fall off. I do spend about $2500 on a vacation every year. If I use my credit card is only to take advantage of promotions and I pay it off every month.

I would like to one day be able to have my own single family home and be able to retire before I am 60 y.o. I’m early 30s.

solar,How would you respond?,"I got the text below forwarded from someone I was talking to about solar. This is from an email someone they know, sent to them. They want to know how I would respond to this.

Solar sages of reddit, what say you?

\--------

""I should start by telling you what bonafides I have for writing this.  I am a retired aerospace engineer.  A literal rocket scientist if you will.   I worked on MX (Peacekeeper) Space Shuttle, Hubble, Brilliant Pebbles, PACOSS, Space Station, MMU, B2, the Sultan of Brunei's half billion dollar private 747 with crystal showers, gold sinks and 100 dollar a yard coiffed silk carpets.  I designed a satphone installation on prince Jeffry's 757.  I did all of the design work for the structure of Mark 1V propulsion module currently flying on at least 3 spacecraft that I know of.  Some of the more exciting projects I have worked on are not shareable.  I am also am FAA certified glider pilot and FAI certified gold glider pilot.  I fly both full scale and model sailplanes.  I am Microsoft certified and ComTIA A+ certified.

Solar panels are at best about 20% efficient.   They convert 0% of the UV light that hits them.  None of the visible spectrum and only some of the IR spectrum.  At the same time as they are absorbing light they are absorbing heat from the sun.  This absorbed heat is radiated into the adjacent atmosphere.  It should be obvious what happens next.  When air is warmed it rises.  Even small differences in ordinary land surfaces are capable of creating powerful forces of weather like thunderstorms and tornadoes.  These weather phenomena are initiated and reinforced by land features as they are blown downwind.  It is all too obvious to me what will happen with the heat generated by an entire solar farm.  Solar farms will become thunderstorm and tornado incubators and magnets.

Solar panels are dark and and they emit energy to the space above them when they are not being radiated.  This is known as black-body radiation.  Satellites flying in space use this phenomenon to cool internal components.  If they didn't do this they would fry themselves.

So solar farms not only produce more heat in summer than the original land that they were installed on, but they also produce more cooling in winter, thus exacerbating weather extremes.

So I conclude with this.  There is nothing green about green energy except the dirty money flowing into corrupt pockets.

There is not such thing as green energy.  The science doesn't exist.  The technology doesn't exist.  The engineering doesn't exist.  We are being pushed to save the planet with solutions that are worse than the problems.""

personalfinance,Zera Financial: Too good to be true?,"Has anybody come across this company/app?  It claims to pay 3% per MONTH which can be withdrawn or redeposited and compounded. The structure seems to be like a CD in that there are terms/lengths of time you can choose, however, they all pay the same interest rate.  Early withdrawal penalty is a steep 15% of total funds. 

Theoretically, you would make $3600 minimum on $10k invested for a year if you didn’t redeposit the interest, effectively a 36% APR.

CryptoCurrency,"Is this crypto market we’re in right now and the pump in recent past weeks, the result of a BULL TRAP! 🚩🐂","The low network activity for Btc suggests more pain for the underlying assets.

Despite the recent price increases for both bitcoin and ether, perhaps fueled by the Fed and the US President, it is believed that there are no clear signs of bear market trend reversals.

This is cited because of the low transaction fees and the lack of new active addresses.

Following several consecutive weeks of price slumps, bitcoin finally regained some ground last week and charted a 6-week high above $24,500. This came shortly after the US Federal Reserve increased the interest rates by 75 basis points, and the nation’s president – Joe Biden – refused to admit the country had entered into a recession, despite the negative GDP quarters.

However, the asset failed to continue upwards and retraced to below $23,000 in the past couple weeks. The decline is attributed to relatively low network usage.

This is evident from the network fees, which tend to spike when there’re more users interacting on the largest blockchain (typically in bull markets) and fall back down in bear markets.


If one can make conclusions based on the network congestion and fees in regards to the underlying asset’s short-term price performance, the eth situation seems quite 
similar.

The gas fees paid on the second-largest blockchain have dropped to multi-month lows, with the average price being under $5.

This causes issues for the native cryptocurrency. This is because the EIP-1559, implemented with the London hard fork last year, cannot burn enough ETH due to a lack of network usage. As such, the cryptocurrency has become highly inflationary once again.

Nevertheless, the ETH community hopes this will change soon as the Merge is supposed to take place in mid September.",cryptocurrency,1660690055
personalfinance,Need advice on the best way to sell my mom's house and buy her a new one,"Long story short, my mom is elderly and needs to downsize from her house to a condo or something. I'm now handling her financial affairs for her, but I've never bought a house before and I'm not sure what the best way to go about this is.

According to Zestimate, she has about 270k in equity in the house. It probably has a bunch of major repair issues (no working AC in the South, bad rat and roach infestation, I don't think the natural gas is working, etc). I'm not willing to do repairs, so we'd be selling as is. No idea how much all of that would take off the sale price. I'm planning to get a realtor to give us an estimate but wanted to have a plan first.

My mom's credit is extremely bad, so I assume she won't be getting a mortgage without me. However, she can get a decent condo for 150-200k in her city, so in an ideal world she would just sell the house and use the equity to pay cash for a new one. I'm not sure how the logistics of this would work out, though. Importantly, I live on the other side of the country and can't stay with her long-term, so I can't directly help with a lot of the legwork. Fortunately I am in a very financially secure situation and can help in that area.

I extremely don't want to be involved in the ownership if the new house, but I'm not sure if I can avoid it. I see a few options here:

* Try to sell the house and buy a new one at the same time so we can directly move her into it. This would be ideal but seems logistically difficult. How soon after closing on the sale of her house would the money be available to close on the new one? This also seems like a bad idea in case we don't get enough from the current house to fully pay off the new one.
* Sell the house, have her rent for a while until we find a new place, then move her. This seems safer but challenging. I'd need to stay with her while we're still transitioning to a permanent arrangement, which I can't do for more than a month tops. She's old and needs some amount of care, so I really want to move her in one step and be done with it. If I were reasonably sure I wouldn't have to stay more than a few weeks, though, this could be on the table.
* Cosign a mortgage with her for a new place, then list the house for sale and pay off the mortgage ASAP. I have good credit and can pay the mortgage for a while myself if I have to. I would have to pay the down payment, closing costs, etc. myself, but this isn't a financial hardship for me, and I could get her to pay me back after she sells the house. The main issue with this, aside from just not wanting to be on the loan, is I'm not sure what implications this has for me qualifying for first-time homeowner benefits if I buy property for myself in the future. I live in a very HCOL area but make too much money to qualify for anything income-based, so I'm not sure what I would actually be giving up here.
* Buy the place outright myself and be her landlord. I'm aware that family opportunity mortgages exist, but since she specifically won't be able to get a mortgage because her credit is bad rather than because of her income, I don't think we'll qualify for this. This seems somewhat logistically easier than trying to get her involved, and if we did this, we could put the equity from her house into an investment fund for her future care/health needs, which is appealing because she doesn't have much savings. But interest rates are really high right now (and I think I get a higher one if it's classed as an investment property?) and the stock market is down, so I'm not sure if the math on this actually works out. I also really don't want to own the place after what she did to her current place, but realistically speaking I'm going to have to handle maintenance, etc. for her regardless.
* Liquidate a bunch of my stock portfolio and pay cash for a new condo, then have her pay me back when she sells the house (which I am on the title for, although not the mortgage, so I guess I own half of it?). I guess this would be simpler than getting a mortgage but seems very unappealing.

Anyway, not sure what to do here. Would love some input on what I should do and if I'm missing anything.",finance,1660690340

stocks,3M Co. may face more than $100 billion in losses and potential bankruptcy due to faulty earplugs,"3M Co. faces more than $100 billion in losses and bankruptcy because of lawsuits brought by veterans who blame their hearing problems on faulty earplugs, according to a litigation consultant hired by lawyers suing the industrial conglomerate.

Initial results from a handful of test cases shows 3M would be swamped by losses should the more than 230,000 lawsuits related to the company’s military earplugs business go forward, the plaintiff’s adviser J.B. Heaton testified in bankruptcy court Tuesday.

“It is more and more likely within the next several years we’ll see a 3M bankruptcy, yes,” Heaton told US Bankruptcy Judge Jeffrey J. Graham during a hearing in federal court in Indianapolis.

“We strongly disagree with this unsupported and clearly flawed speculation,” company communications manager Sean Lynch said in an emailed statement. “3M has committed to provide $1 billion to a trust for claimants determined to be entitled to compensation.”

Some advocates for the suing soldiers want Graham to block 3M from paying any shareholder dividends, buying back any of its stock or spinning off any assets, if the judge also decides to halt the lawsuits.

Restricting how 3M spends its cash will protect money and other assets that could be used to compensate soldiers who have had their hearing damaged by the earplugs, the advocates said in court papers.

The company has a paid shareholders a regular dividend for at least a decade. Currently the quarterly payment is $1.49 per share.

Company lawyers disputed Heaton’s findings during the hearing, arguing that the 19 cases in which juries returned verdicts are outliers and cannot be used to extrapolate results for the other cases. Heaton, a former trial lawyer who now studies corporate litigation, acknowledged that the sample is small and that a judge may conclude $100 billion is not realistic.

3M is in federal court trying to convince Graham to halt the lawsuits while the company’s earplugs subsidiary reorganizes in bankruptcy.

Last month, the company put its Aearo Technologies unit into bankruptcy in Indianapolis as a way to resolve the claims. Under Chapter 11 rules, Aearo is automatically entitled to freeze lawsuits it faces, but because 3M itself didn’t file bankruptcy a judge must agree to give the industrial conglomerate the same protection.

The bankruptcy is Aearo Technologies LLC, 22-02890, United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis).

solar,Trying to compare two solar options,"I recently got three quotes for a \~6kW system for our house in Colorado (Xcel Energy is the utility company). Seeing if someone can help me decide between the top two which have the same cost per kW after applying the 30% federal tax credit. 

**#1: Independent Power Systems** (IPS, local SunPower dealer) - $23,113 for a 6.21kW system. Panel details: 19 SunPower E20-327 with IQ 7XS microinverters. 

= **$3.72/kW before tax credit or $2.60/kW after**. 

**#2: ADT Solar** \- $27,613 for a 5.7kW system, but they provide a $4500 kickback after receiving PTO (permission to operate). Apparently they do this ""discount"" afterwards so you can claim the fed tax credit on the upfront cost, which of course sounds a bit shady. They matched prices with #1 (with less kW) so it conveniently also comes out to $23,113. Panel details: 15 Silfam 380 panels with EnPhase IQ 8+ microinverters.

= **$4.05/kW before tax credit or $2.60/kW after**. 

Personally I'm leaning towards #1 because the sales rep I talked to was to the point and much more focused on system details and listening to what I wanted, rather than purely talking sales lingo to hard sell me into signing a contract on the spot. I'm an engineer and despise sales personalities so I liked that. Company #2 was the more traditional smooth-talking sales guy who made me haggle him down nearly $7000 just to match the price that #1 gave right out of the gate. He also managed to talk me into signing a contract yesterday saying I can cancel within 3 days if I change my mind... Right now I'm looking for advice if I should just cancel #2 and go with my gut on #1. Ultimately I just want a quality system that I won't regret buying.

economy,The Evil Field Will Evil Yield,"Afghanistan is now characterized by high levels of terrorism, poverty, unemployment and corruption. De jure, not a single state in the world has recognized as legitimate the government formed by the radical religious and political movement ""Taliban"" and the Islamic Emirate proclaimed by it. But, de facto, a country appeared that decided to establish close cooperation with the Taliban regime, namely, Putin's Russia (although, at the formal level, the Taliban continues to be a banned movement in the Russian Federation).

After a year of religious fundamentalists in power, devastation and famine reign in the country. The economy is on the verge of collapse, and the population is on the verge of a large-scale humanitarian catastrophe. Twenty five million people are constantly malnourished and live in poverty - more than half of the country's population. Detentions, torture and extrajudicial killings of Taliban critics continue throughout the year, all over the country. Religious and ethnic minorities (Shiites, Hazaras) are persecuted. The rights and freedoms of women are based on the ultra-conservative interpretation of Islamic law. In addition to the Taliban, other terrorist organizations operate in the country - the Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, the Haqqani Network and other groups, which contribute to permanent instability.

This impoverished country with a crumbling infrastructure has entered into a barter agreement with Putin's Russia (since the banking systems of both countries are under sanctions) because it is ready to provide the Kremlin with its territory for transit, and also to export rice, potatoes and onions to the Russian Federation, taking it away from their own hungry population. In return, the Taliban are asking Moscow to supply them with oil, gas, fuel and food.

However, as experts suspect, the Taliban will pay the Kremlin for expensive energy sources not with onions, but with ... drugs. In general, it should be recalled that drugs have been an important component of the Afghan economy over the past few decades. Just because in the 1990s, Afghanistan was associated mainly with opiates, in the 2000s - with heroin, and now with crystal methamphetamine (a highly addictive psychostimulant). According to experts, after the seizure of power by the Taliban, the drug trade began to flourish even more.

Thus, we can predict both the rapid growth of drug consumption within the Russian Federation and the transformation of Putin's Russia into the main hub of Afghan drug trafficking on the entire European continent in the near future! In addition, it is highly likely that the Taliban will receive not only fuel and food, but also Russian weapons and military equipment (even if outdated), which, in turn, will contribute to the escalation of tension in the regions of Central and South Asia.

A mutually beneficial partnership between two new allies - totalitarian Russia, led by V. Putin, and the extremist Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, led by the Taliban, is expected to be like this.",finance,1660725877

devops,Prometheus federation on EKS + EFS - backup and restore TSDB,"So I've got an EKS cluster to recreate, and on this cluster there's a Helm-deployed Prometheus Federation with about 78 GiB sized TSDB on EFS (yeah not the right choice but it works for now).

What's the best way to backup and restore that data on a newly deployed identical cluster? I've tried snapshotting via Prometheus API, and it creates the snapshot successfully - problem is moving that amount of data from the old EFS to anywhere (I'm not experienced with these kind of tasks tbh - is there a good way?).

I've also tried kubectl plugin promdump. Dumping all the data OOMs my prometheus, and dumping, say, only the last month is still horribly slow (it downloads the data to local machine). And I need at least 3 months. Then there's a problem of moving that data from local again.

Then there's the problem of restoring. How do I approach the process if Prom federation is deployed by Helm and operational? I probably can't overwrite TSDB directly, right? And uploading the snapshot weighing tens of GiB will take a considerable amount of time anyway. Of course the lesser the gap between old data and new data, the better.

personalfinance,What is the best way to set aside proceeds of car sale to cover portion of new car payment,"I recently purchased a new car and am intending to sell my old one (I would have traded it in but they lowballed me, and even accounting for the tax benefits of a trade I could get a decent bit more just selling my car to carvana, and significantly more if I manage to pull off a private sale).  My new car payment is significant, but I have a large amount of equity in my old car.  

My question is how should I best save the money from the old car sale to have it available to go toward payments for the new car?  That is, just making numbers up for the ease of math, if my new car payment is $1500/mo for 60 mo, I’d like to contribute $500/mo from my old car sale to that payment over the full term of the loan.  

I don’t want to just apply the full amount of the sale to principal right now.  Doing so would cover about 1/3 the cost of the new car, but it wouldn’t lower my monthly payment (unless I refi’d), and I want to take some sting out of that payment each month.  I also don’t want to refinance because I got a loan at 3% interest and won’t get close to that if I refi.

One option I considered is to ladder 1, 2, 3, and 4-year CDs with 20% of the sale proceeds respectively, leaving the remaining 20% in a high-yield savings account.  Bread financial is currently offering 3 to 3.6% on 1 to 4-year CDs, so I would break even or come slightly ahead on interest while the cash is in the CD.  I could also consider waiting a few months to open the CDs as the fed is very likely to continue raising rates.  For the remaining 20%, I’d just put it in a HY saving account.  I’d be losing money on interest but don’t see a better option. 

I’d appreciate any suggestions for other options you all can offer. Thanks!",finance,1660735412

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street rally looks to take a breather after Dow’s 5-day winning streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell on Wednesday as a rally that has propelled equity prices higher since mid-June appeared poised for a respite.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 209 points, or 0.61%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.84% and 0.96%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Dow notched its fifth straight day of gains Tuesday. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is going for its fifth positive week in a row as investors continue to gauge how much strength this rally has. The broad market index is now up 18% from its June lows.
*****
&gt; “This market has been so resilient,” Brynn Talkington, managing partner of Requisite Capital Management, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “As we’re coming to a close on earnings, earnings are going to beat by a median of about 7%.”
*****
&gt; Though giving her “a great deal of pause” in this market is the Federal Reserve and its plans to continue raising rates and shrink the size of its balance sheet. “Earnings have still been strong, but…the Fed balance sheet hasn’t budged,” she said.
*****
&gt; Traders on Wednesday were looking ahead to the release of U.S. retail sales data later in the morning. In the afternoon, the Federal Reserve is slated to release the minutes from its most recent meeting.

I’ve heard advice that for savings like this you shouldn’t have them in the bank, but rather put them into ETFs (which is already what my IRA is in), otherwise your savings will be be depreciating each year with inflation.

Is this sound advice? I prefer the “buy it and leave it” method for investments rather than having to keep a close eye on them, and based on how volatile the market was earlier this year it feels riskier to tie in savings that way.

Edit: Time-wise, I’d be hoping to get a house of my own in the next 5-10 years or so",finance,1660740692

* I am currently learning a lot about sales and CRMs. 
* I am starting to understand that all companies are all about selling something, be it either products or services. We can divide businesses by business model, but all business models always seek to enable companies to generate profits by selling something. 
* Why is this like that? Why can't companies like do something else? I am not saying that capitalism is bad, but I am saying that only selling something is looks kinda limiting. 
* At the same time, I am thinking that both aliens and bees are bound to be doing the same things, right? it's due to the data-driven nature of the universe that we live in. For instance, bee queens know how many male workers there are in the vicinity and ration the pay in the form of the feeding based on the supply and demand situation in that area. 
* I am also reading a book called Homo Deus by Harari, and I kinda understand what communism is all about. So, do you think that communists were also fed up with the fact that the whol civilization was selling something all the time, and they tried to implement something new, but they ended up just using the state to redistribute the goods/services, meanwhile, now the state was selling stuff to the users and the users were selling labor to the state, and since the market was controlled by the olygopolies, the prices were low, but the assosrtment of options was highly defective.",finance,1660742288

The thing is I only need $6k to pay rent through December since I paid partially out of pocket and have $3k left over.

Should I 
1. Pay back $2-3k right away and keep maybe $500 for books, food, supplies? 

2. Invest excess money in an index fund and continue putting any extra money I make during college in there? 

3. Pay back $1k invest $2k in an index fund?

Let's say hypothetically I live in a poor country where the yearly inflation rate is 90% or more. In this case:

If I buy stuff right now and pay them in installments, then put my wage into a very safe investment like bonds, interest or foreign currency like $ or € I think I should be able to save a lot and perhaps make money too.

The wage only declines against inflation and foreign currency. I will pay 0% interest rate to installments that are 3-6 months long. I also won't pass let's say 50% of my salary in monthly payments. Every month 80% of salary goes into savings and I only pay debts when last payment date hits, so if I can compound my money I should actually be able to make money (ofc a minute amount considering inflation) while spending it too.

stocks,"Fed minutes show more rate hikes coming, but pace could slow","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials saw ""little evidence"" late last month that U.S. inflation pressures were easing, and steeled themselves to force the economy to slow down as much as needed to control the surge in prices, according to the minutes of their July 26-27 policy meeting.

While not explicitly hinting at a particular pace of coming rate increases, beginning with the Sept. 20-21 meeting, the minutes released on Wednesday showed policymakers committed to raising rates as high as necessary to bring inflation under control, and acknowledging that they would have to engineer less spending and lower overall growth for that to happen.

As of the July meeting, Fed officials noted that while some parts of the economy, notably housing, had begun to slow under the weight of tighter credit conditions, the labor market remained strong and unemployment was at a near-record low.

On the metric that mattered most, however, Fed officials at least as of late July had registered little progress.

""Participants agreed that there was little evidence to date that inflation pressures were subsiding,"" the minutes said. Though some inflation reduction might come through improving global supply chains or drops in the prices of fuel and other commodities, some of the heavy lifting would also have to come by imposing higher borrowing costs on households and businesses.

""Participants emphasized that a slowing in aggregate demand would play an important role in reducing inflation pressures,"" the minutes said.

The pace of future hikes would depend, the minutes said, on incoming economic data, as well as Fed assessments of how the economy was adapting to the higher rates already approved.

Some participants said they felt rates would have to reach a ""sufficiently restrictive level"" and remain there for ""some time"" in order to control inflation, which is running at a four-decade high.

In a glimpse of the emerging debate at the central bank, ""many"" participants also noted a risk that the Fed ""could tighten the stance of policy by more than necessary to restore price stability,"" a fact that they said made sensitivity to incoming data all the more important. \[nL1N2ZS1FQ\]

After the release of the minutes, traders of futures tied to the Fed's policy rate saw a half-percentage-point rate hike as more likely in September, with fed funds futures prices reflecting just a 40% chance of a 75-basis-point increase.

INCOMING DATA

The Fed has lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate by 225 points this year to a target range of 2.25% to 2.50%. The central bank is widely expected to hike rates next month https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/FED/lgpdwawwzvo/index.html by either 50 or 75 basis points.

For the Fed to scale back its rate hikes, inflation reports due to be released before the next meeting would likely need to confirm that the pace of price increases was declining.

Data since the Fed's July policy meeting showed annual consumer inflation eased that month to 8.5% from 9.1% in June, a fact that would argue for the smaller 50-basis-point rate increase next month.

But other data released on Wednesday showed why that remains an open question.

Core U.S. retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were stronger than expected in July. That data, along with the shock-value headline that inflation had passed the 10% mark in the United Kingdom, seemed to prompt investors in futures tied to the Fed's target policy interest rate to shift bets in favor of a 75-basis-point rate hike next month.

Meanwhile, a Chicago Fed index of credit, leverage and risk metrics showed continued easing. That poses a dilemma for policymakers who feel that tighter financial conditions are needed to curb inflation.

Job and wage growth in July exceeded expectations, and a recent stock market rally may show an economy still too ""hot"" for the Fed's comfort.

solar,JUST DO IT ALREADY (TLDR),"Hello all, 

I lieu of the tax credit increasing to 30%, I felt it was necessary to post this, so:

If you are thinking of going solar or not, trust me when I say this, just do it already. **keep reading**

If it's a good fit for your home, really, the best time to do it is now. Not in a year. Not in a month. Now.

This post isn't a ""long term savings, protection from increasing prices, and better for the planet"" post. If you understand that already, and you're still on the fence, this next part is what really matters:

Because of the tax credit increasing to 30%, banks are now also going to increase their rates. You think the banks are going to let you get the extra 4% from the government? Nope. They want it and will get it. So trust me when I say this, but prices for financing through all solar lenders will be going up, soon, if not tomorrow. Lol. If it's not reflected in interest rates, it will be in their dealer fees, which for those that don't know, you should, but-- dealer fees are the hidden costs built in from lenders that allow for all these ""1-2% interest!!!"" loans. 

Also, in addition to that, the increase in the tax credit will cause the demand for solar to keep rising sharply. This is (possibly) going to in turn create a shortage in supplies, aka an increase in price of supplies -- economics, folks. 

So yeah, thats my 2 cents. 

Full disclosure: I work in the industry. And solar is fkn awesome and changed my life as well as many of my clients! I'm definitely biased towards solar, but this is the direction I predict things to go with the Inflation Reduction Act passing. 

TLDR: If you're on the fence about going solar, do it already. Besides the fact that you're going to be saving money long term by locking in your rates (and many other reasons), by going solar now, today, you will lock in the prices that lenders charge before they increase rates/ dealer fees. You best believe they will try to profit off of the 4% increase to 30% tax credit extension from the government! Also, supply shortage will cause for prices to increase because more people wanting/ getting solar now with increased tax credit. 

Lock it in TODAY because it's the cheapest it will be.",energy,1660766457

A month ago, I moved into a new place and just recently I've been noticing some suspicious incidents. The first one was last week when I received a text message to reset my password for my Instagram account when I never requested it.

I did some digging around and found nothing compromised so I thought it was a glitch in the system and moved on. Then this week, I received in the mail, change of address verification from a bank and financial institution that I use. However, the name it was addressed to was different. I happen to know the names of the previous owners of this current house and it didn't match up.

Again, I thought it was no big deal since the previous owners could have rented our their place or someone mistaken entered the address or it could be the case they they moved to a new address and COA verification was sent to their previous address as well.

However, this morning, a FedEx package arrived with a SIM card for a different carrier than the one that I use. This package was addressed to the same person that was on the change of address verification.

I'm starting to get a little concerned that there is something shady going on but I'm not sure how to proceed. Am I overacting or is this legitimate? Any steps I should take immediately? I have strong passwords and 2FA on all accounts (using authenticator apps where possible).

Bitcoin,"If you could have either sound money but be poor, or be rich but with unsound - fiat - money, but NOT both...which would you choose?","So, let's say God (or whoever you believe in) appears to you in a vision, and says He'll give you a choice.  You can have either:

1. Bitcoin fails, and some other cryptocurrency, which is perfectly sound money, takes it's place and totally becomes the next world reserve currency...and you never got in until so late that you're doomed to be poor and wage slavery...OR
2. Bitcoin totally succeeds and becomes the most valuable currency every created, you become filthy stinking rich and riding your yacht around with hot chicks in the jacuzzi, lambos and your favorite steak dinner nightly...but then the Federal Reserve gets a hold of it and changes the rules so that they can create more out of thin air, rendering it unsound.  Yet you're rich.

Now, before you guys even ask, on #2 you don't need to worry about exactly HOW God will render Bitcoin unsound, just take His word for it that He will.  Trust that He can work any technical task you might imagine.

So, each of us must answer this question for him/herself.  Look, we all want to get wealthy with Bitcoin, but many of us are in this because we believe in sound money and are abhorred by the things we're seeing caused by fiat money.  But - which is stronger inside of you?  I know that for myself, I'd probably be better served with scenario #1 and be happier in such a world...though scenario #2 is so tempting it's probably what I would choose (to my own detriment).

personalfinance,Need some advice on my current financial situation (sell/keep home),"Bought a house at 19 in 2020, new construction for about $200,000 flat, at 5% down with a 2.7% interest rate, credit was 807 at the time. I owe about 183k on the loan and the value of the home based on recent selling values in my neighborhood is around 270-280k. While I don’t regret the purchase I can’t help but think I’m at sort of a stand still as it was a great investment but it seems appreciation has dried out for the time being and I feel as if I could sell the property, and collect around 40-50k after minor fix ups and realtor fees, and transfer this money into my stock portfolio and either go back to live with my parents, or rent a small place for much cheaper as I don’t need a 3 bedroom house on my own, (no children or spouse). My income is around of 86k/year (+ about 12k per year in rent) pre tax however I will be changing jobs soon to a state to state traveling job where I will be gone for months at a time. My bills are split half and half with my brother who rents the other 2 rooms from me.

So basically my options 

1. Sell the home and transfer the money into stock holdings, and stay with my parents or rent a small apartment 

2. Rent the home out and stay with my parents again for the time being/apartment

3. Keep the home and continue living in it and paying the mortgage while I am out of state 

4. Keep the home and rent it out and stay with parents/ rent an apartment. 

Keep in mind most of my time spent during the year will be out of state/the area 9/12 months, and the home cost roughly 2k per month to live in. I would appreciate some feed back, thank you.",finance,1660794512

personalfinance,Help!! I have a fraudulent Sofi Credit Card that is KILLING my FICO score and Sofi company is MIA.,"As the title says.

I was a victim of identity theft and found out about this \~4 months ago when I got an email from Sofi saying that my first payment of a certain amount was due on a certain date. I called the company and let them know that I did not open this account. They tagged it as a fraudulent account and told me ""don't worry about it"".

I was never a victim of such ID theft and thought, oh I guess that's it. Silly me. About a month later, I got another email about 'your balance is..'. I called them again and this time, the representative told me that they're doing an internal investigation and this should be resolved within 2 months. This person told me to contact the major credit bureaus and let them know about ID theft.

Then I realized this was a more serious issue - I called the three credit bureaus and told them about the situation and placed a fraud alert. Then I filed a FTC Identify Theft Report as well. I was working mostly with Experian and also had them remove the hard inquiry made by Sofi when the credit card was opened.

Then I waited. The next month, got another email.. now saying 'your payment is due'. Called Sofi again and they said there's a memo about investigation going on and that until this is over, I would still get these emails and that I should just ignore them.

In the meantime, I had filed a few credit record disputes to get the Sofi account REMOVED from my credit history. The credit bureaus said they are taking action and requesting information from Sofi. To this day, Sofi account remains on my credit record as active with an unpaid balance.

So another month passed and I called Sofi again to check on the status of the investigation. The representative this time was very honest with me. She told me that the investigation *seems* to be ongoing but she has no access to what is being done. She said there is *no way* for me OR for her to contact the fraud department directly. There is no phone number. There is no name. There is just this email address [""creditcardfraud@sofi.org](mailto:""creditcardfraud@sofi.org)"". She told me how to draft the email and gave me a work case/reference number but the frustrating part she said is that she can't even tell me when they would respond or call me. Apparently, she had brought this up to her manager about this issue before (as other people were victims of fraudulent accounts as well) and her manager ""coached me"" to not worry about it. 

Anyway, I've been patient all this time but now my FICO score is dying. I was always in 760-790 range and its gone down 100 points. I'm in the middle of buying a house and going through mortgage process and am afraid that this will result in significant issues such as increasing interest rate or even worse, not qualifying for the loan.

I'm so furious and frustrated but there is nothing I can do besides emailing this Sofi credit card fraud department. *Or is there?* 

What more actions can &amp; should I take? Is there any law enforcement I should contact?? Do I find a lawyer (if so, what type??) to sue Sofi for being unresponsive? 

Open to any thoughts and suggestions. Thank you.",finance,1660801445

personalfinance,Should I buy down mortgage interest rate,"I just entered contract on a house and a very modest fee of $571 was added on the loan estimate to buy points. It lowers the interest rate from 5.375% to 5.125%.  I have the option and ability to pay even more for a more substantial affect. I asked the person I'm working with at the lender if buying points regardless of cost is worth it if there's a good chance that mortgage rates will drop within a year or so, giving me reason to refinance. He said probably not and he believes that rates will indeed drop within that timeframe.

At first, I was blindly believing him, but then realized that he serves his company and the company benefits from me having a higher interest rate. I know that it's impossible to know what rates will do that far ahead, but a couple of top results on Google indicated that rates will continue to trend upwards for several years. One of those sources projected out to 2026.

Then it occurred to me that if the lender really didn't want me to buy points, they probably wouldn't have automatically included the modest fee to begin with. Instead, they would have waited for me to ask if buying points was an option.

So I don't really know what the best approach is. Just looking for some general advice here. Or maybe a source on mortgage rate projections that is so convincing, I would be forced to consider it superior to both my lender's words and the Google results I found.",finance,1660807870
bonds,Egypt plans to tap Chinese debt market to fill funding gap,"**By** [IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com) **Pro** **August 18, 2022**

Egypt is in talks with Chinese officials to issue renminbi-denominated **bonds** in the world’s second-largest bond market after being rebuffed by the IMF for a loan on economic reform conditionality. Western private debt markets are effectively closed to bond issuances from the finance ministry as most western bankers tend to toe the IMF’s line. Increasingly Egypt is looking for alternatives, turning to its rich Gulf Arab friends and Far East countries to fill its $15bn annual funding gap. The finance ministry issued its maiden samurai bond in late March.

Finance Minister Mohamed Maait in effect admitted that a tug of war on a global scale is holding back his ministry’s efforts to access debt markets when he told Enterprise, a news digest service, that the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and heightened geopolitical tensions make it impossible to estimate when his ministry might again tap the international bond market.

Bloomberg Asharq reported earlier this week that the ministry was planning to issue $5-6bn worth of **bonds** this fiscal year that ends in June 2023.",finance,1660811543

 A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

A week of conflicting U.S. economic signals was made little clearer by Wednesday's readout of July's Federal Reserve meeting and leaves markets looking overseas for more clues.

Fed meeting minutes were read with a dovish tint that argues for next month's interest rate rise to be a smaller increment than the previous two. But that failed to shift the financial markets' dial to any great extent

 Last month's policymaker views have already been overtaken to some degree by a fast-changing picture of ebbing inflation and looser financial conditions and markets crave a sharper take from the Fed's annual Jackson Hole symposium next week.

That's left Fed Funds futures pricing in a 60% chance of the next rate hike being 50 basis points and 40% of a 75 bps move, with Wall St stock futures and Treasury bond yields getting little additional impetus. The dollar nudged higher, with some traders pointing to emphasis in the Fed minutes on how its strength aids the inflation battle by subduing import prices.",finance,1660821362
personalfinance,Questions on going back to 4 year university to get a different major,"I graduated in 2016 from a state university about 15 miles from where I live right now with a major in criminal justice. I have worked in that field ever since (corrections) and am just not able to keep working the nonstop overtime. I will be making well over $95k this year with all of the overtime. This year I also have not enjoyed any free time, since I have had none. The future looks bleak and that overtime will get even more insane in the next years to come with most people where I work retiring by 2026. 

I want to go back and get a major in social work from the same university I got my BA in criminal justice. I do not plan on working while in college, not even in the summer, as I have saved up enough money to not have to do this. When I was in college between 2012 and 2016 I got an (almost) free ride because my parent did not have any money/at the time did not work. I graduated with approx. $12k in student loans. If I am a dislocated worker starting in August 2023 I can redo any FAFSA filled out in January 2023. Can I get a full ride of federal student loans? I know PELL grants are off the table because once a person has a bachelor's the PELL grants go away. Is this the same for the federal student loans? 

I do also want to know - I have a pension I will be leaving untouched that has approximately $55k in it. Will that be considered an asset to FAFSA? Likewise, I have money in a deferred compensation program through work, also knowns as a 457 plan, that has approximately $15k in it... Does that have to be reported on the FAFSA? My friend who used to assist with the financial aid department said savings, checking, brokerage accounts, etc count as assets but not 457 or pensions. This seems strange, but then again 457 and pensions are NOT collectable in bankruptcy so maybe this is why? Did about an hour of searching and could not get an answer. 

My last planning question for everyone on here is if there is individual health insurance out there I can purchase? I know United Healthcare has a few plans out there ([https://www.uhc.com/health-insurance-plans](https://www.uhc.com/health-insurance-plans)). The last thing a person would need is to stop working and be on the hook for a large emergency room bill. 

I may be able to get a part time position as a correctional officer at the prison that I worked at before I transferred to my current work site and I could take a few shifts in a month on weekends. My same friend who used to work in the financial aid office at the university said the best thing for me is to just not work while I go back for 2 years to get another bachelor's degree. 

I need someone on here to ground me in reality and give me some direct answers. What should I do financially speaking and what am I able to do to, legally, get as many student loans as possible?",finance,1660821476

# [Stock futures tick higher as Wall Street tries to resume rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock market futures were slightly higher Thursday as investors tried to regain their footing a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a five-day winning streak and a recent market rally appeared to fade.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow were 39 points higher, or 0.11%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.16% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Dow fell roughly 172 points, or 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.7% for its first negative session in four. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.25%. The tech-heavy index and S&amp;P 500 are now both on track to snap a four-week winning streak.
*****
&gt; Those moves came as traders parsed through the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting. The central bank remains committed to fighting inflation, but indicated it could adjust its pace of tightening based on market conditions.
*****
&gt; Investors have been hoping that the Fed might slow the pace of its rate hikes after July’s consumer price index reading showed inflation cooling slightly. But not everyone is convinced.
*****
&gt; “We’re in the camp that the Fed is not going to pivot,” Scott Wren, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “The minutes didn’t make us change our mind at all. We think a 75 basis point hike is likely in September, and we’ll see more hikes at the end of the year ... we think the market is a little lofty right here,” he added.
*****
&gt; The latest batch of earnings report didn’t help traders’ sentiment during Wednesday’s session. Target’s quarter missed estimates, with results from Lowe’s coming in mixed.
*****
&gt; Some key economic data will also be released Thursday, including weekly jobless claims and existing home sales.

CryptoMarkets,Trading or Staking | What to choose for a beginner,"As the popularity and legitimacy of cryptocurrencies grow, more and more people perceive them as a way of earning money. There are several methods of raising capital. Some require knowledge and effort from the user and some only time. This article will look at two popular earning methods, analyze their pros and cons, and help you choose the one that suits you.

https://preview.redd.it/om0uedjm4hi91.png?width=801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=250bbc0b3ab7e4535c9b373edc1e4ae7f7c9845f

### Are You Active or Passive?

Even before you buy a cryptocurrency, you need to decide how you want to increase your portfolio. That is, to go into profit. There are several ways:

* to invest to trade (sell/buy and earn on price fluctuations);
* invest in top coins and hold them until the profit on its sale seems satisfactory;
* invest in coins to earn interest: staking or lending.

It is crucial to decide on a strategy before the first purchase of cryptocurrency: because it will depend, banal, on how much time per week you will devote to tracking the exchange rate. And if you are determined not to lose money, then you understand the importance of such awareness.  


### Choose the Asset Wisely

Evaluate the crypto assets you want to buy. First, you must give the cryptocurrency you want to buy your definition. And obviously, the first thing you need to understand is whether it is a reliable asset. To do this, answer several very simple questions:

* How long has this cryptocurrency been on the market?
* Have there been bright ups and downs during this time? When and against what background did this happen? Media monitoring is needed here. This is important if you don’t want to “point your finger at the sky.” Thus, you will now understand whether something significant influences a particular crypto asset. So that, if you still choose an asset, you can understand for the future what it can “storm” from and what news to track.
* Does any influencer directly affect this asset? For example, Elon Musk, the Winklevoss brothers, Michael J. Saylor, and so on.
* Was the cryptocurrency’s price able to recover or reach new all-time highs after the fall?
* Does the asset have liquidity on the exchange where you trade?
* What are the trading volumes on the coin — the higher, the better. Low trading volumes mean that the asset is not available on many platforms, or traders are not interested in it. 

### Crypto Trading

Trading on the crypto exchange requires knowledge and skills that come from many months of practice. Getting to know trading should start with an overview of the main tools. When opening a trading terminal on any crypto exchange, you will see approximately the same set of tools: a price chart for the selected trading pair, an order book, information on trading volumes, and transaction history. You need to read charts, analyze them, have fundamental and technical analysis skills, analyze crypto market sentiment, and track the news background.

Many exchanges provide a demo account where you can practice and try out new strategies. The principle of operation is similar to real trading, so it is strongly recommended that every beginner first test their strength in this way. This will allow you to understand the terminology and essential tools.

In addition to the usual trading, the essence of which boils down to “buy cheaper and sell more expensive”, other varieties are especially popular during periods of a bearish trend and allow you to make money even during falling markets. For example, futures trading is a kind of betting on whether the rate will go up or down after a particular time. Or margin trading — this opportunity is now provided by almost all well-known crypto exchanges. In this case, the platform provides users with leverage in an amount several times higher than the amount the trader possesses. In this way, you can significantly increase your profit, but keep in mind that the risks are also growing.

### Trading Strategies

If you intend to trade, you need to understand how active: weekly, daily, or every minute. It is mandatory to be able to read an order book. It would also be nice to understand indicators and chart patterns. Analyze whether whales operate and whether market making takes place. Also, analyze market sentiment, that is, who dominates bulls or bears.

Among other things, knowledge of technical and fundamental analysis is required from the trader:

* Technical analysis. A forecasting method based on the study of past asset quotes. It is believed that the dynamics of the cryptocurrency exchange rate are cyclical. The growth and fall in demand for BTC and altcoins occur according to the same patterns. To identify these recurring situations, users look for patterns on the chart of a trading pair, determine the support and resistance levels, and try to predict reversal points using Elliott waves or Fibonacci levels.
* Fundamental analysis. It is based on studying economic, political, and news prerequisites for changing quotes. To trade using this method, users follow the news, and speeches of major investors and politicians, evaluate the prospects of cryptocurrencies, compare their technical characteristics, and analyze the economic situation and sentiment in other markets (stock, commodity, currency).

Trading can be both short-term, medium-term, and long-term. Day traders or scalpers who open a lot of orders within one trading day are more focused on technical analysis. Due to the short time intervals, transactions of day traders and scalpers usually bring a small profit, less than 1%. Medium-term and long-term traders typically focus on fundamental analysis. Technical analysis is used only as an addition that eliminates unnecessary noise in price fluctuations and helps find the optimal market entry points. Trades are carried out less frequently than with scalping. The order can remain open for up to several weeks. At the same time, the user can expect a high income from each trade.  


### How Much Can You Earn?

You can both earn a lot and lose all your funds. Trading requires experience and involves high risks. Trading is much riskier than staking: a trader makes a lot of trades, which is why he incurs more costs for fees. And if the cumulative losses exceed the total profit, the deposit will be reset very quickly.  


### Trading: Pros &amp; Cons

**Pros**

* High potential profit. Cryptocurrencies are very volatile, sometimes allowing traders to earn significant amounts in just one day.
* Low entry threshold. It is enough to make the first trade on the market to have only $10. This is the average size of the minimum order on the crypto exchange. However, it is better to start trading at least $100 so that there is always a reserve of free money in case you need to average a position or buy another crypto asset.
* There is no payback time. You don’t need to buy expensive equipment, as in the case of mining, count interest on loans, or lock your assets for specific time periods.
* Thanks to futures and margin trading, there is an opportunity to earn both on the growth and the fall of cryptocurrencies.

**Cons**

* High risks. Where there is a large profit, there are high risks. Moreover, the risks are always directly proportional to the potential profitability. When trading with leverage, the risks only grow.
* Constant training and discipline. Trading is a full-fledged, extremely resource-intensive work. Traders need to learn and analyze their mistakes constantly.  


### Crypto Staking

Cryptocurrency staking is the voluntary locking of one’s assets for the purpose of passive income. Staking is available in blockchains using Proof of Stake and its varieties, for example, Delegated PoS (Tron, Cosmos, etc.) or Liquid PoS (Tezos). Classic solo staking has a high entry threshold. For example, to become a solo staker on the Ethereum network, you will need at least 32 ETH (about $60,000) and a computer connected to the internet \~24/7. However, users can deposit a smaller amount into the staking pools, thus delegating coins to validators. This way, they do not need to run their own node, but the profit will be less. The disadvantage of the staking pool: if this pool does not sign the block, the user may not receive a reward.  


### Staking Types

The main principle of staking is universal for all its types — a certain amount of cryptocurrency is on the user’s account, for which he receives passive income. The amount of capital determines the level of profit. Also, the operation mechanism can be supplemented by other conditions that depend on the type of staking. For example, some systems provide payments only to validators. Then, stakeholders sometimes combine assets, creating pools and becoming validators, and draw up a common contract. The profit is divided among the pool participants in multiples of the contribution size.

* **Locked Staking**

With this type of staking, the user locks his assets for a specific period. The duration of this period cannot be changed. The main advantage of this type is the high-interest rate. Usually, the APR that the staker will receive at the end of the specified period is indicated in advance, but the reward may vary. Locked staking is characterized by high profitability compared to other types of staking.

* **Flexible Staking**

In this case, the contract does not provide a specific period of holding coins. The user, at will, can terminate it at any time and withdraw the cryptocurrency. The interest is accrued until the staker transfers the funds to another wallet or places an order in exchange for the sale of tokens. Earnings, in this case, are insignificant (from 1% to a maximum of 20% per year). Flexible staking is suitable for users who are not ready for long-term agreements on the retention of cryptocurrencies and want permanent access to their capital.

* **Cold Staking**

The most secure option. The locking of cryptocurrencies occurs on a hardware wallet that does not have a permanent Internet connection. This option is not available for all coins and trading platforms. In addition, the coins must always be located at the same address. In case of relocation, the contract is terminated, and the reward is not paid.

Cold staking is relevant for owners of large volumes of coins that do not want to risk their loss in the event of a crypto exchange being hacked.

* **Liquid Staking**

Liquid staking allows token holders to stake their tokens, forcing them to work in DeFi. This is the best of both worlds: Staking and DeFi, with no cryptocurrency lock-up periods, which can sometimes take up to 28 days. Liquid staking solves the incompatibility crisis between DeFi chains by allowing the use of derivative assets in DeFi protocols to generate income and staking rewards, helping to unlock liquidity locked in PoS networks. One of the most popular liquid staking platforms is the Lido. The protocol allows you to stake ETH, SOL, MATIC, DOT, and KSM. After adding tokens to the staking pool, the user receives a similar number of derivative tokens (for example, if you deposit 1000 ETH, you will receive 1000 stETH). Further, stETH can be used as a regular ETH, for example, to generate income in other DeFi protocols. The crucial point is that the staker receives a staking reward and additional income for using stTokens in DeFi protocols.

* **DeFi Staking**

DeFi staking is not exactly staking in its traditional sense. With the help of DeFi staking, users can stake not only PoS blockchain tokens but also PoW, such as BTC, LTC, USDT, USDC, and others. In the DeFi staking, there are counterparties — platforms that take your coins at interest. At the same time, the security of the transaction is provided by a smart contract and completely depends on the presence or absence of vulnerabilities in it. Many platforms offer DeFi staking services. For example, the well-known crypto exchange Binance allows you to stake 15 assets, including BTC, ETH, USDT, DAI, and other major coins. The exchange acts as a showcase and cooperates with several leading DeFi protocols, such as Venus, Aave, dYdX, and others. Users can deposit tokens for a floating or locked period, after which the Binance redirects the deposited amount to one of the DeFi protocols to generate profit.   


### How Much Can You Earn?

It is impossible to give an exact number: the interest may vary depending on the selected token. Also, note that if you stake tokens using third-party platforms, the profitability varies from platform to platform. It should also be understood that you can not just earn a little but even lose a lot in some cases.

* For example, you bought $1000 worth of the coin and staked it at 100% APR. However, this does not mean that in a year, you will get $2000. The profit will depend on the exchange rate of the coin. If it remains at the same level, your profit will double. If the exchange rate has increased, the earnings will be even more. But if the coin has dropped significantly in price, then, in the end, you may be left with only $100-200, depending on the depth of the fall.

Risks are present, as in any other type of investment. But even here, they can be minimized. Stablecoins will help in this. The most famous are USDT, BUSD, and USDC. There are platforms within which you can earn up to 10-20% APR for the staking stablecoins.

### Staking: Pros &amp; Cons

**Pros**

* Minimal risks of losing funds, especially when it comes to stablecoin staking.
* Passive income. The user earns simply for depositing their tokens into the staking pool. Moreover, the yield is higher than that of any bank deposit.
* Large stakeholders receive voting power and can participate in the project's further development.
* You do not need to have special knowledge and skills.
* Stocking types: locked, flexible, liquid, and DeFi staking.

**Cons**

* Loss in the price of a digital asset. The more the exchange rate of the coin decreases, the smaller the amount of interest specified in the contract will be. This is especially acute when concluding a contract for a locked term. Noticing a sharp price decrease, the user will be unable to sell the asset.
* Relatively low profitability by the standards of the crypto market.

### Closing Thoughts

In this article, we have considered two ways of earning — trading and staking. Trading is an active way of earning money. In other words, a full-fledged job requires the user to have deep technical knowledge, constant involvement, risk management skills, market sentiment analysis, news background, and much more. Trading involves great risks, but this method can bring the biggest profit. On the other hand, staking is a passive type of earnings that does not require much knowledge, time, and effort. At the same time, staking is not so risky and is more regarded as a way to get little extra earnings.

I would be coming from a LCOL to a very high HCOL which is the only thing that worries me. My potential roommate is in a much, much better position than I am financially with their job but of course I will never get to a point where I have to rely on them.

What makes me want to do this is that there is a much better job market for my background. I can easily find listings that pertain to my career path rather than where I am living. I know the job market is fierce in Seattle, but I think there would be a much better opportunity career wise for me.

To most people, I think most would just disregard this and think this would be too much of a risk to do however, I think the potential rewards could outweigh the risks. Worst case scenario if it does not work out, it's not like I can't move back to my original state and be with my parents for a bit. It would be a pain in the ass for sure and costly but, you have to take risks to get rewards at times.

* Only debt is &lt; 35k in federal student loans
* Only paying car insurance, phone bill (needs to be revisited), a few monthly/yearly subs that equal to around $50/month, groceries, gas.

investing,The official recession label will come too late to have a major impact on stocks,"Who calls a recession in the U.S.?

The National Bureau of Economic Research is responsible for defining a recession and it does not use the “2 quarters of negative growth” definition. The NBER definition is more complex, taking into consideration many factors. A group of eight academic economists are saddled with the task of declaring an “official” recession.

The group examines many indicators in their work as the Business Cycle Dating Committee (no, not that kind of dating). That committee, first convened in 1920, is led currently by a 78-year-old Standford University professor and has taken as long as a year after recession onset to decide if a recession occurred. Wall Street nearly always recognizes a recession before the NBER official announcement. The committee doesn’t even hold regular meetings.

The committee is looking for a “substantial decline in activity over a sustained period of time.” The data used include monthly reports on real personal income, nonfarm payrolls, personal consumption spending, manufacturing sales and industrial production.

The committee is highly respected as it has been unaffected by politics in making a recession call. The members are independent of government, although some committee members have advised previous government administrations. It is likely that no recession call will be made before the November elections.

In 2008 Fed chair Ben Bernanke said that people should not get hung up on the technical definition of a recession.

The official declaration of recession is never helpful as a warning signal. Those pronouncements come much too late. Stock market downturns usually anticipate recessions, by as long as nine months. And the NBER can take a year to act after the recession begins.

The U.S. is affected by the world economy. The downturn in China is gaining momentum. The trouble in the property sector, starting with China Evergrande and spreading to other developers guarantees a serious slump there. Germany may already be in recession as natural gas deliveries from Russia have been cut back. The U.S., China and Germany combined make up about one-half of the world’s GDP.

With central banks all over the world hiking interest rates a substantial slowdown in activity is a certainty.

I amassed ~ $9700 in loans, $7,400 of which are subsidized federal, the rest unsubsidized. I got awarded a scholarship which takes a lot of the need for loans away over the next 2 years, as this current year I’ve only taken about $1000.

My concern lies with my car payment &amp; insurance. As an 18 year old kid, my family basically manipulated me into getting my own “newer” car (it was pre-owned, a 2017 model, but was much newer than the late 90s Camry I was driving). 

My payment isn’t bad, only $240/month, with the insurance bearing around $135/month, amounting to about $375/month.

My problem is that I don’t make very much money while at school, I work but I’m limited in hours due to the blocks of time specified as “shifts” at my job typically coinciding with classes I have. What I mean by this is that we can only work within set hour confinements, 7-11,11-2, 2-5, 5-9, 9-12. 

I am scheduled for 3 shifts a week and make only $11.25. If my math is correct, without picking up anymore shifts, I’d be making $175 biweekly, which is $350/month, just short of my car payment. My plan currently is to pickup shifts to cover that additional $25.

Right now I have a little over $9k left on the loan and have total assets of just over $10k.

Should I just pay off my car? My insurance payment would likely go down but I would be pretty much broke if I did that. I would be paying it off almost 4years early though, which would save me money in interest. Curious what people think about this. Or, I could refi. I have great credit, lots of history for a 20 year old. Over a 770 score.

investing,"Is Value Just an Interest Rate Bet? &amp; The Amazon Fallacy - Cliff Asness, John Authers","Cliff's full piece is [here](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Is-Value-Just-an-Interest-Rate-Bet) and the related Bloomberg Opinion piece is [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-08-17/amazon-fallacy-looms-in-the-growth-rebound-as-investors-overlook-value?srnd=opinion). The broad theory posited by these two pieces is that, unless a growth company is a true unicorn, perhaps interest rates don't have as much influence on the growth vs. value performance as we often assume, and has been empirically witnessed over the last decade or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It seems obvious to so many that interest rates drive the value trade. After all, growth stocks have much longer-dated cash flows than value stocks and thus should be a “longer duration” asset and move more with longer-term interest rates, right? “Growth (or often just ‘tech’) stocks soar on plunging interest rates” (or vice versa) has become a common wise-sounding observation in the last few years. In fact, this is all taken as an axiomatic given in countless pundit and press observations. However it’s not nearly that simple, and mostly it’s just not true.

Cliff goes on to examine the oft-cited HML value factor from the Fama French Five Factor model and its rolling 5 year correlation to the 10 year Treasury yield. [Graph here](https://imgur.com/CMy0xZ5) and [scatterplot here](https://imgur.com/KX3aodE)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The average correlation is quite trivial (around 0.10), although (like every time series ever) rolling subperiods vary. In particular the most recent five years has seen quite high correlations between the value factor and interest rates, bouncing around the highest ever observed and economically significant.

In recent years, that correlation between rates and value has become stronger, but does this make sense? 

&gt;Well, in a word, no. A lot of it comes down to growth assumptions. By definition, growth stock investors believe their portfolio (or individual stocks or even stonks, whatever the h\*\*l those are) will outgrow value stocks. And they’re right. On average, using our very diversified global value factor to sort stocks, the expensive ones outgrow the cheap ones by about 4% a year over the next five years. Actually most of that comes in the first two years where the majority of any predictability seems to reside. After five years it’s certainly a push (no steady excess growth in year six onwards).

Why do so many investors still chase growth despite the evidence that reliably predictable growth trends dissipate after two years? Cliff's opinion:

&gt;It seems, particularly if you, like me, think we’re in a bubble, that growth investors are all trying for unicorns.

[This](https://imgur.com/LnaccDX) chart from Cliff's piece is a good visual of how many investors view growth investing - like the stocks they are picking are all unicorns. 

And this is a good transition point to the Bloomberg Opinion piece from John Authers where he relates ""unicorns"" to what he coins the ""Amazon Fallacy"". 

The point is made that yes, investing in Amazon early would've yielded outsized returns, but many companies were trying to follow a similar path at the time. However, most wouldn't succeed to become the near-monopoly that Amazon would. The argument is summed up well in the below quote. 

&gt; It became so profitable and dominant because it eradicated the opposition and became a virtual monopoly in many of the things it did. Of its nature, the success of Amazon cannot be replicated by many at any one time. There can only ever be few startups that go on to build a large and well-defended monopoly. Asness’ point is that growth investors are behaving as though all growth stocks can be Amazon, and they can’t. 

This leads to, in simplified terms, the notion that interest rate sensitivity (duration) of true unicorns may have some merit in having longer durations, but for most growth stocks, duration is not materially different than value stocks - [this](https://imgur.com/LnaccDX) chart again. This is because the near-term growth in growth stocks doesn't affect duration much, but if you knew growth would explode in 5, 10, 15 years, then that would certainly justify a longer duration. So for unicorns, the bulk of cash flows stemming from that extraordinary growth will be in the distant future and supports the sensitivity to interest rate movements because unicorns would have much longer duration than ""normal"" growth stocks and  value stocks. The below quote references [this](https://imgur.com/LnaccDX) chart again

&gt; *A duration of 10 years means that a 100 basis point fall in rates would, to a linear approximation, lead to a 10% increase in market value. If all three investments are assumed to have equal long-term expected returns... the “duration” of the growth portfolio (blue line) is 0.4 years longer than the duration of the value portfolio.  If you think that’s trivial, you are correct.* 

To round out the discussion:

&gt;If investors in 1999 had had an accurate grasp of Amazon’s future cash flows, its share price should have been very sensitive to interest rate changes. But unless the growth stock you hold truly is a unicorn, lower rates really shouldn’t help it much compared to a cheap value stock.   
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, one of the few things we know for sure is that the great majority of growth stocks aren’t unicorns.

I am sure there were useful pieces from Cliff's writing and the Opinion piece I left out, but I think both pieces give good credence to re-examining which securities you choose to purchase and for what reasons and hopefully the dots were connected enough to make sense. 

I own growth stocks and value stocks and everything in between, hold nothing with AQR, and understand Cliff leaves a lot of the commentary unsupported with data. Talking his book or not, food for thought and debate was the aim of this post.",finance,1660833056
CryptoCurrency,How I Screen (and trade) Profitable Altcoins To Buy,"Recently I had a pretty good run on altcoins and want to share how I did it. Some people probably were left on the sidelines (and for good reason, the macro picture is no joke).

A lot of the reason most people get scared off is they place trades on leverage or on coins that have no proven track record OR they are denominating their gains in USDT.

An alternative to this approach is to only trade spot (no leverage) on coins that have been around for a few years and to track your gains against BTC and ETH only.

# The Major Benefits of this Spot-Only Strategy

\^No liquidation risk from using margin.

\^Altcoins are more volatile than BTC and ETH so when you are on the right side of the trend, you will profit more than just holding them against USD.

\^Large cap altcoins will mean revert eventually (if you are in too early or late, chances are you can revert your ALTs back into BTC or ETH without loss of return at some point in the near future).

# Anatomy of a Spot Altcoin Trade

Recently APE had a really nice move to the upside

2022 has been extremely challenging for bullish scenarios. Since the end of March, making money buying crypto has been, ahem, difficult.

BTC hasn’t really been in an UP trend according to [CoinRotator.App](http://coinrotator.app/) until just a few weeks ago. On July 10th an UP trend alert was seen in the channels.

I redeployed USDT into BTC in early and mid-July, partially based on the excessive selling due to the liquidation events mentioned earlier and the less hawkish tone set by the FED. I was looking for some Altcoins which had not only bullish Up trends but also a newsworthy narrative.

***Highly personal charting approach ahead***

Once the signal appears on CoinRotator I never blindly enter any altcoin trade. There are many reasons for this but the most important are as follows:

\&gt;Altcoins are much less liquid and susceptible to price gaps.

\&gt;A very wide range candle often marks the short-term top of a trend.

\&gt;Altcoins are dependent on the movements of BTC 85% of the time.

Once a list of candidates is created from CoinRotator I scale down to the 45minute chart on Tradingview.

I check for coins trending above the 4hr SuperTrend

Then wait for a light pullback but price doesn’t close below the 4hr trend

Once price resumes its uptrend I enter by swapping BTC or ETH for the targeted Alt.

The trade looks something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hqvjyqfqkhi91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c12bc779c9a586a47e21c3912eece1931b73e3b9

I'll hold this trade for more than a day if it suits my time horizon. In the case of this trade, it still seemed mkts were shaky so I took partial profits as soon as I saw some bullish momentum.

An easier setup is simply to track the daily Supertrend and wait for a profitable close against the trend to exit partially with a stop loss moved to break even or simply exit all at this point.

The most conservative play on this is to exit on the first red candle (bearish close) in profit (10% profit is the minimum threshold in our experience as it overcomes slippage, commissions and the USDT spread you are trying to overcome).

The chart would look something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

# When an Altcoin Trade Goes Against You

&gt;*The most liberating aspect of this approach to Altcoin trading is the perceptual shift where you no longer compare your performance to USD. Perhaps this doesn’t suit your long-term goals and that is fine, but for a lot of “crypto maxis”, this is the healthier mindset.*

There is however one major caveat: you can’t go all in on any altcoin. If you want to keep your net worth in crypto you must apply the \[Lindy effect\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy\_effect#:\~:text=The%20Lindy%20effect%20(also%20known,proportional%20to%20their%20current%20age.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect#:~:text=The%20Lindy%20effect%20(also%20known,proportional%20to%20their%20current%20age.)) or you more than likely will suffer tremendous loss at some point.

LUNA maxis will understand this risk all too well.

Trading can be really fun and profitable when you keep your risk at manageable levels. CoinRotator takes a very [stoic approach to crypto trading](https://coinrotator.medium.com/weekly-trend-signals-are-now-live-11c6e936c018). Of course, I suffer losses just like everyone else.

**I was lucky enough to escape the LUNA trade at 80 but still did not protect myself well enough on UST. Effectively we exited the remainder of the UST position at .75 cents taking a 25% haircut on my stablecoin reserves.**

I'll leave the rest of the trades I took recently on my [medium post](https://coinrotator.medium.com/how-to-search-the-most-profitable-altcoins-daily-d8ac02d52e23) and you can decide if it's a viable strategy for you or not.

Always stoked to talk trade setups with others. And if you lost money this year, sorry to hear it, just try to survive until the next EZ mode begins. When that will be in anyone's best guess.",cryptocurrency,1660835094

For the 2021 tax year, not knowing how long the federal loan payment pause will last, we filed married filing separate. The reason being, if my wife uses the income driven repayment program, it will look at her AGI only versus our combined AGI.

My understanding is the 2021 tax return will be used for 2023 student loan payments for my spouse.

investing,Wall Street Bets the Fed Is Bluffing in High-Stakes Inflation Game,"The market rebound reflects a belief that inflation has peaked and rates will go down sometime next year, an outlook Fed officials have tried to dismiss

https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-high-stakes-inflation-game-wall-street-bets-the-fed-is-bluffing-11660830685?mod=hp_lead_pos10

The Federal Reserve says it is going to keep raising interest rates.

Wall Street thinks it’s bluffing.

This could spell trouble for both of them.

Markets pummeled by the Fed’s rate increases in the first half of the year are racing upward. The S&amp;P 500 is up 17% from its mid-June low. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which is used to help set rates on debt such as mortgages and student loans is down more than half a percentage point from its June peak. Even battered cryptocurrencies have jumped.

For many investors, the rebound reflects a belief that inflation has peaked, and expectation that the Fed will shift from raising rates to lowering them sometime next year.

A parade of Fed officials has tried to push back. “There’s a disconnect between me and the markets,” Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said last week.

An expectation the Fed will start cutting interest rates in the next six to nine months isn’t realistic, Mr. Kashkari said. ***It is more likely the Fed will “raise rates to some point, and then we will sit there until we get convinced that inflation is well on its way back down to 2%,”*** he said.

If the Fed follows that path, markets are likely to face a painful reckoning—one that could unwind much of the recent rally and extend what has been a tumultuous stretch for investors from retail traders to hedge funds to pension funds.

“We think the market is getting ahead of itself,” said Wei Li, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc.

Rallying markets also make the Fed’s job tougher. Rising stock and bond prices have loosened financial conditions since the Fed’s June meeting. That works against the central bank’s aim to slow spending and reign in inflation by raising rates enough to tighten the flow of money in the economy.

***“You need to keep financial conditions tight. That’s the whole point of this,”*** said Marc Sumerlin, a senior economic adviser to President George W. Bush who is now managing partner at economic consulting firm EvenFlow Macro.

Any acknowledgment by the Fed that inflation is easing risks spurring further market gains. That could lead to even looser financial conditions, slowing the central bank’s efforts to tame inflation, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.

“Now, you’re sort of undoing a lot of the hard work the Fed has been doing this year to slow the economy,” Mr. Draho said.

**Fed faith**

To understand how the two sides got so far apart, it helps to look back.

For decades, investors have put their faith in the “Fed put,” the belief that when markets fall substantially, the Fed will lower interest rates, purchase bonds or otherwise increase liquidity in the financial system.

The belief dates to the 1980s. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was quick to cut interest rates during such upheavals as the Black Monday crash in 1987, the Russian financial crisis and subsequent meltdown of hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998, as well as the dot-com bust in the early 2000s. By the time Mr. Greenspan left the Fed in 2006, investors had come to expect it would always be there to provide cover.

For much of this year, the Fed put was in doubt. The central bank raised interest rates in March and signaled it would continue at a brisk pace to attack inflation, which had reached multidecade highs. U.S. stocks suffered their worst first half of a year since 1970. Investment-grade bonds posted their worst first half in history.

Then came the unexpected. Investors started to believe the Fed would again come to the rescue, despite much evidence to the contrary.

In June, the Fed voted to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point, marking its biggest rate increase since 1994—presumably bad news for the markets. But traders clung to Mr. Powell’s words at the postmeeting press conference. The Fed chairman acknowledged the rate increase was “an unusually large one” but not something he expected to be the norm.

Stocks jumped, with the S&amp;P 500 rising 1.5%.

Then at a July 27 news conference, Mr. Powell tried to strike a balance between his earlier public remarks revealing concern about the strength of underlying inflation while also suggesting the Fed was eager for signs of improvement that the central bank won’t have to raise rates much above 4% or 5%. Wall Street interpreted him to mean the Fed was open to slowing down its pace of rate increases.

The S&amp;P 500 ended the day 2.6% higher. The Nasdaq Composite surged 4.1% for its biggest one-day gain in more than two years.

Traders have pulled back from bets on inflation. The five-year break-even rate, a proxy for where traders believe inflation will be over the next five years, has fallen to around 2.6% from as high as 3.6% in April. Labor Department data this month showed inflation eased slightly in July but remained near its highest level since November 1981.

Some of Wall Street’s top analysts have cautioned about reading too much into recent stock gains.

Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley, is forecasting the S&amp;P 500 will end the year around 3900, down 8.8% from where the broad index closed Wednesday. At Bank of America Corp., Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, is expecting the S&amp;P 500 to finish 2022 even lower—at 3600, a fall of 16% from Wednesday’s close.

Skeptics of the rebound say that even if inflation turns out to be peaking, it likely won’t fall fast enough for the Fed to pivot as quickly as the markets expect.

The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation—the personal-consumption expenditures price index—rose 6.8% in June from the same month a year earlier. That was far above the central bank’s target and the sharpest rise since January 1982. Investors will see the July reading later this month.

“The market is still pricing more aggressive cuts than we think are warranted,” said Ms. Li, of BlackRock. “We see the Fed eventually pivoting on policy, but not as much as the market is expecting.”

A challenge for both sides is that the Fed doesn’t appear to have confidence in its ability to accurately forecast inflation, which makes it difficult to predict when the central bank will stop raising rates.

***“We now understand better how little we understand about inflation,”*** Mr. Powell said at a forum hosted by the European Central Bank in June.

***Economists outside the Fed are divided over how aggressively the central bank should attack inflation. One camp says even if it falls over the next 12 months, it is likely to settle at 4% or higher, a level most Fed officials would consider unacceptably high. That would make it difficult for the central bank to lower rates to the levels that fueled markets in recent years.***

Some of these economists suspect the Fed isn’t being forthcoming about how high it believes interest rates will need to go for inflation to fall to 2%.

Another camp warns that the Fed, embarrassed about waiting too long to pull back its support of a booming economy last year, will compound the error by tightening too much. These economists believe the current surge in inflation is the result of global shocks rather than an overheated U.S. labor market, which would require a much deeper downturn to bring down inflation.

**‘Unpredictable beast’**

Investor faith in the Fed put has strengthened in recent years. Markets slumped in 2018 as the central bank raised interest rates four times and investors fretted over the seeming end of easy-money central bank policies. As the central bank paused its rate increases and then switched to cutting rates the following year, stocks went back up.

They tumbled again in March 2020 after the Covid-19 pandemic shut down economies around the world. They bottomed out within the month and surged after the Fed cut interest rates and relaunching its bond-buying program.

“The fact that the Fed is very hawkish today doesn’t mean they can’t go dovish in a few months. That’s happened over and over again,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist of The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.

Yet in recent instances when the Fed eased rates, the central bank was having difficulty pushing inflation up to its 2% target. Investors and Fed officials were ultimately reacting to the same growth risk. With inflation running high, that is no longer the case.

If the Fed holds tight to its plans, markets could be in for a tough ride. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. research found the stock market had fallen at least 15% on 17 occasions going back to 1950. In 11 of those instances, the market only hit its trough around the time the Fed started easing monetary policy.

Mr. Paulsen believes the case for further interest-rate increases has weakened. But he acknowledged that trying to predict how the Fed will respond to inflation in the months ahead is almost impossible.

***“The reality is that right now, the market is enjoying the Fed put,”*** he said. “We’re all dealing with a very unpredictable beast.”

[Qualcomm Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/QCOM:US) is taking another run at the market for server processors, according to people familiar with its plans, betting it can tap a fast-growing industry and decrease its reliance on smartphones.

The company is seeking customers for a product stemming from last year’s purchase of chip startup Nuvia, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. [Amazon.com Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMZN:US)’s AWS business, one of the biggest server chip buyers, has agreed to take a look at Qualcomm’s offerings, they said.

Representatives for Qualcomm and Amazon declined to comment. 

Qualcomm gained as much as 2.9% to $152.91 in New York trading after Bloomberg reported the news. The shares had been down 19% this year through Wednesday, part of a broader slide for chip stocks. 

Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon is trying to turn Qualcomm into a broader provider of semiconductors, rather than just the top maker of smartphone chips. But an earlier push into the server market was abandoned four years ago under his predecessor. At the time, the company was trying to cut costs and placate investors after fending off a hostile takeover by [Broadcom Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AVGO:US)

This time around, Qualcomm has Nuvia, staffed with chip designers from companies such as [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US) Amon, who acquired the business for about $1.4 billion in 2021, has said that its work will help revitalize Qualcomm’s high-end offerings for smartphones. But Nuvia was founded as a provider of technology for the server industry.

The market for cloud computing infrastructure -- the kind of equipment that Amazon, Google and Microsoft Corp. use to whisk data around the world -- generated $73.9 billion last year, according to [research firm IDC](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48998722). That was up 8.8% from 2020. 

The owners of giant cloud data centers have long relied on Intel Corp.’s chip technology for their servers. But they’re increasingly embracing processors that use designs from [Arm Ltd.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2243469Z:LN), a key partner in phone chips for San Diego-based Qualcomm.

Arm designs are already dominant in mobile phones, where they’re prized for not draining battery life. Now power consumption has become a more pressing issue in the data center world as well. As server farms spread -- and suck up staggering amounts of electricity -- companies want more efficient chips.

Amazon has addressed this need by building its own chips based on Arm designs. The e-commerce giant has created multiple generations of its Graviton processor line and touts its performance to customers.

But Amazon also still uses chips from [Intel](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/INTC:US), [Advanced Micro Devices Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMD:US) and [Nvidia Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NVDA:US) \-- and Qualcomm sees an opportunity to carve out a niche among those suppliers.

The last time it made such an attempt was 2017, when Qualcomm began selling an Arm-based server chip called the Centriq 2400. It relied on [Samsung Electronics Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/005930:KS) to manufacture the products and said they outperformed Intel’s Xeon processors in energy efficiency and cost. At the public introduction of the server chip line in November of that year, potential customers such as [Microsoft](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US) took to the stage to voice their interest in the offering.

But less than a year later, the company’s leadership began shuttering the project. Former Intel executive Anand Chandrasekher, who had led the effort, left Qualcomm.

For Intel, Qualcomm’s latest move would bring yet more competition to an industry it once dominated. The company has been racing to bolster its technology and manufacturing after losing market share to AMD and homegrown chips like Amazon’s.

For Qualcomm, a successful push into server chips would mean it has a much bigger-ticket item to sell. The company’s phone offerings are typically priced in the tens of dollars. Server processors can cost hundreds of dollars.",finance,1660843343

When it came time to do my taxes the next year I was a little scared to do them due to being tax exempt for the entire previous year. I ended up filing my taxes through Turbo tax as I always do and thankfully didn't get audited.

I am now submitting paperwork to USCIS in regards to my wife immigrating to the States (met her while in that country actually), and there is a specific form that I must fill out containing a section for my taxes. All I need to list is my ""adjusted gross income"" from the past three years according to my tax returns. The problem is my tax return from 2019 says that I made 0$ when you actually look at the ""adjusted gross income"", but if you scroll down on the tax return I can see that I did in fact make money. I'm afraid that it will make it look like I didn't make any money and my form will get kicked back to me.

Did I screw up my taxes? I basically just followed the steps that Turbo Tax has you do, filled in information from my W2 and that's about it. I have my W-2 and my Form 1040 to answer any questions anyone might have in order to help me. Thank you all very much in advance.",finance,1660846362
personalfinance,Refinancing House - First Timer,"Hello PF,

My wife and I bought our home a few years ago in a major US city for 235k. We bought in a neighborhood that we were renting in, and the popularity here has jumped quite a bit along with house prices, our estimated home value has increased about 150% and we've done very little to improve the home value aside from minor renovations and appliance updates.

We purchased via FHA and currently carry PMI because we only put 4% down, and at the time we bought our rate was 3.5%.

I have been considering doing a cash out ReFi and take advantage of the property value, using some of the money to pay off a modest chunk of debt that we have left over from our wedding ($8k) and doing some minor home improvements. This isn't our forever home and would likely be selling within the next few years, so having a lump sum of cash ready to go for whenever we do make the decision to move would be the biggest reason for this.

We haven't talked to our Mortgage company about this yet, I've just been playing with some calculators to get an idea, but would it make sense to ReFi to get the cash out, eliminate our PMI but increase our interest rate (probably somewhere around 4.5%)? Considering that we currently pay PMI on top of our current rates, I figure it would probably break even. I don't really know our numbers in regards to discounts or origination or other closing costs.

I'm always leery of approaching any major financial questions with lenders as a starting point, so I just want to educate myself as much as possible before getting started there.

Thanks",finance,1660846930
solar,"30% federal tax credit now active. How to determine extra 10%-20% for low income community, 10% for brownfield sites?","I understand the new federal tax credit is 30%, effective immediately. I'm reading there are modifiers of 20% on top of this (for a total of 50%) for certain low income areas. How is that determined? Is there a calculator or map somewhere?  Similarly, there's another 10% credit for building in brownfield sites. (total 60% credit). Likewise, is there a map somewhere for this one?

personalfinance,advice for a college student…,"hi all, i’m honestly just looking for some advice on what my best course of action is right now. i am about to start my last semester of college at 22 years old, and i have zero student loan debt. i’ve had a merit-based scholarship every semester, plus financial aid. however my financial aid isn’t extending to my last semester and my school prorated my scholarship to cover 50% of my tuition considering i will be part-time for my last semester. anyway the point is my last semester is going to be the most expensive. my parents have always helped me out by paying for my tuition which has consistently been $2500 a semester. This semester it’s $5k. I know they are struggling a lot with their own debt so i want to help, with at least $2k. Currently I have my dads checking account on file so my school just automatically deducts payments every month. But i am thinking this is a good time for me to open up a credit card and start building my own credit. I pay for my car that i began to finance in 2020 but my mom co-signed, so it’s literally under her name. however i did see that right now isn’t the best time to open a credit card. would it be best to keep my dad’s card on file, and give him cash every month (open my own card in the future) or open my own credit card, put it on file, and have him give me some cash? also, if i were to open a card, what are some questions i should ask, if any? of course other than what the interest rate would be, but anything that might help my me considering i am a student?",finance,1660849367

# The Technicals

2022's first half was the worst half to a stock market year in the last 52 years. This saw the S&amp;P 500 move down from 4,818.62 to 3,636.87. This is a range of 1,181.75. Of this range, an ideal fibonacci retracement (bear market short-term rally) would be 61.8% back up in this range. That takes us 730.32 up from 3,636.87 which gives 4,367.19. Yesterday's high was 4,325.28. This high was within 1% error of the ideal 61.8% Fibonacci retracement.

Thus, the 50 Week Simple Moving Average of the S&amp;P500, as a further catalyst for resistance, will reject the S&amp;P500 down, thereby allowing for the horrible stock market downturn to continue.

That said, the first half of 2022 was the worst in 52 years, the third quarter was one of the best, and the fourth quarter may end up being the worst stock market quarter on record. Here is a visual:

# 1929-crash-like Margin Deleveraging

[FINRA Margin Statistics](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics) has been updated to include July. As expected, we got a slight reprieve in debit balances in customers' margin accounts. Nevertheless, graphing the data and adjusting for the near-record inflation for each data point, we can see that we are still in the worst bubble by value in the history of the stock market.

Fibonacci of this graph shows that Margin has to collapse up to $370 Billion more from August's expected margin value), depending on the strength and speed of the deleveraging.

FINRA Margin Totals, Adjusted for Month-by-Month Inflation. Dotcom crash (left bubble), 2008-2009 crash and great recession (middle bubble) and the current bubble (right). Fibonacci retracement values are listed for 61.8% and 78.6% of each deleveraging period. One can observe that the bottom of margin deleveraging bottoms within that range, depending on the strength and speed of the unwinding. (61.8% seems to correspond to slow and weak, and 78.6% seems to correspond to fast and strong). The data shows that the market will continue to deleverage and crash

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR:

Unfortunately, summer is ending. The short-term rally has expired, as technicals show three problems for the stock market: 1: A perfect rejection off the S&amp;P500's 50 week Simple Moving Average, 2. The 61.8% retracement already happened, and 3. A perfect rejection off the S&amp;P500's 200 day Simple Moving Average. In a 1929-like scenario, total margin (and adjusted for inflation) shows that we are still in the largest margin bubble of all time. Fibonacci levels on the inflation-adjusted FINRA margin data show that the market has to still undergo up to $370 Billion of deleveraging. Therefore, I am hereby predicting that the fall and winter months of 2022 will be some of the worst months in stock market history. Leading market strategists such as Dimon, Zuckerberg, Musk, Novogratz, and even Warren Buffett concur, and some say that 2023 will be a Depression. Will 2022's crash lead us into 'the greatest depression,' and do you think Warren Buffett will die \[either because of or\] during this crash/depression?

personalfinance,Paying back sign on bonuses,"I work in industries that give pretty large sign on bonuses (6 figures), but some of these contracts says you have to pay back X amount if you leave the company within Y time (Y is usually a year but sometimes it can be 2 years in rarer cases). X is usually prorated, but some less generous places say you have to pay back all the sign on bonus if you leave within a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a couple of questions regarding this from a personal finance perspective. 

1) I'm not sure if it's a good idea to invest that money within Y years -- I would be bit concerned about having to pay it back but not having the funds available, so I'm wondering for suggestions on what to do with the money during that time? I was leaning towards signing up for those bank deals that give you welcome bonus cash for leaving money in the accounts for 90 days or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Hypothetically, let's say I am given 100k sign on bonus (after federal tax withholdings and depending on the state, it may only come out to be half of that amount) and I'm fired a week in, so I need to pay the company back $100k. But the $100k I'm paying back is my post tax money and the money I received is pre-tax. Let's say I received $50k post tax, so I need to come up with another 50k....That seems like a really bad situation if I don't have that. 

Ultimately, I think you can deduct the amount you pay back from your taxable income? But in the short term, I feel like I'd be screwed, or is there something I'm missing here?",finance,1660851166
personalfinance,Why do people with low mortgage interest rates take shorter terms or pay them off early?,"I have a jumbo fixed mortgage at a low rate, under 3%, refinanced a couple years ago. When I refi'ed, I went with a 30-year term. My monthly payment is now half what I'd pay to rent a place like this. (I live in a notoriously expensive US metro area.)

A friend of mine also refi'ed around the same time and chose a 15-year term. When I asked why, he said ""so I could be done with it at a younger age.""

My mortgage was recently sold, and the new servicer is also encouraging early paydowns.

But paying more principal seems wrong to me. If you can borrow at under 3%, why wouldn't you want to extend that as long as possible? That seemed the case to me in 2020 when it was clear that both interest rates and inflation were about as low as they could be, and it especially seems the case now that rates AND inflation are a multiple of what they were then. 

Aren't you better off extending the term, minimizing payments, and investing the money in something other than your home equity?

investing,CD vs. 1 yr T-bill. I think I'm doing this wrong.,"Hello, I have a CD with about 50k.  This is hard earned money, set aside as a rainy day emergency fund.  I plan to keep this for many years.  At least until the kids are out of the house (10 years or more)  I don't wish to invest it in the stock market or anything that carries risk.  I did the CD over a year ago when interest rates were low.  I think I'm earning about 1/2%.  Basically it's dead money.

I'm thinking about cashing out the CD, taking the penalty and moving it to treasury direct.  I would then buy 6 month and 1 year T-bills keeping it staggered so all my money isn't tied up at the same time.  I want this money to be liquid.  Meaning, I would want to be able to get the cash within two weeks or so (if I ever need it).  If I have to sell them early that is fine.  So does this sound like a good plan or am I missing something?  Thanks.

personalfinance,"I learned I owe the State of Louisiana $1500 in taxes, but I haven't lived there in 4 years.","So I graduated from college in May 2018, moved to Nevada and started a job. I did have a student job in Louisiana that year, but it was for a state university and totaled only a little more than the amount I am being charged anyway. I had that student job for several years and never had an issue with them failing to withhold state taxes, so I don't think that's the source of these issues.


Fast forward 4 years and a few months ago my parents received a letter from the Louisiana Dept of Revenue saying I owe the state $1500 in taxes. I do not live there and did not receive the letter for a few months.


What makes sense to me is that presumable the state did not realize that I moved away when starting my job and must have charged me taxes on the work I did in Nevada for the rest of that fiscal year (totaling around $32000 in compensation).


What I don't understand is why I am only hearing about this 4 years later (after they have tacked on $500 in late fees and interest). Also, the tax appeals process in Louisiana seems byzantine to put it nicely, and nobody was able to tell me what proof I need to include to prove I did not live there for the second half of the year (when I actually had significant income).


I thought of maybe finding records of my lease agreement, but the management firm I rented from doesnt seem to exist anymore. The gas, water, and internet services I used do not keep records that far back. The company I worked for does not have my paystubs from that far back. Thankfully, the IRS does have a tax transcript from my federal taxes for that year, but I have no idea if that one piece of evidence is enough for Louisiana to appeal the assessment.


Complicating things, in the subsequent 4 years I have relocated twice and changed employers, thus why I'm having so much trouble getting records and information from 2018. Man I wish I had just filed away everything instead of being an excited college kid moving across the country, haha

We currently both have credit scores in the 700s. But that’s only because we have credit cards that we pay off every month and never missed a payment. We’ve never taken out a loan for anything.

So we’re worried about having a thin line of credit, and since a house is such a big investment I’d want the best interest rate possible.

Let me know if this is a good plan:

1: I get a car loan, low interest rate, and pay it off every month. Nothing crazy, 10-15k. I need a vehicle, me and my wife share one currently. 

2: I get the iPhone replacement program (stupid, I know, I don’t need the newest iPhone). But it’s a program where you have the newest iPhone and they check your credit and you pay it every month.

personalfinance,Returning to college - Withdrawing from IRA for tuition and taking out more loans,"Hello.

I've got a fairly specific question that I can't seem to find an answer for, and I'm hoping you folks can help.

I've returned to college to get an engineering degree.  I'll be starting my sophomore year this fall.  I'm in my 30's, and currently work a full time salaried position.  So far I've been able to juggle my work and studies, but soon I believe I will need to switch to something part time, or even a light hour internship so I can focus more on school.  There is also a chance that I may lose my current job this winter.  I have taken out federal student loans for the last two semesters of school, and they seem to be just enough to cover tuition.

I've got a decent savings, and a small 401k.

&amp;#x200B;

My question:

If I do end up out of work and need to live and pay tuition from what I have....

Can I roll my 401k into an IRA, and have that available as a housing/tuition buffer, while still being eligible for and receiving federal student loans for tuition?  

I would only pull from it if the situation became desperate, but I'd like to know if it was an option.  I understand I will have to pay taxes on the money I pull, but as I understand it I would not pay any extra penalty.  Is that correct?

I'm considering rolling my current 401k into an IRA at this point anyways, because I don't particularly like my 401k servicer.

The main question is if I can receive federal student loans and withdraw from an IRA for tuition/housing at the same time.

Any other advice?  I understand I should avoid pulling from retirement if at all possible.  But if it's what it takes to finish school, I'd like to know my options.

I am currently leasing a 2020 Toyota Corolla SE, it's a 3 year 36k mile lease which began June 2020. It has about 12k miles on it, lease payments are $235 per month.

Current buyout as of today is about $15,835, if I buy it out at the end of the lease next June it would be about $13.5k. KBB and a few other sites are showing a trade in value of $24k-$26k. I do like the car a lot, and have decided that I want to buy it out and keep it since I have taken great care of it and it works well for my needs. Well, that and I don't want to battle the car market next year if it does not cool off lol.

My question is, with interest rates on the rise, would it make more sense to buy the car out now? Or would I be better off waiting until the end of the lease next year to see what the market does? I have a downpayment set aside ready to go, and planned to finance the rest of the amount. I just don't know if it would make sense to just buy it now or wait the extra 9-10 months for the lease to end.

CryptoCurrency,Putting in context on why you shouldn’t outsmart any market (let alone crypto)…,"It was an intriguing, yet ironic post made earlier in the week where one of the Redditors were left with a bad taste of their mouth, partly due to a misreading on the previous months’ CPI numbers, which left them rekt from a leveraged position. What’s worse is that given what they learned from both macro- and micro-economics courses is what didn’t prepare them a rude awakening when it comes to how the market responded thereafter. In their post, they shared the lessons of what they thought they learn from (i.e. Dunning-Kruger effect in motion) With that said, this post is not all about revisiting their point.

Here is why you shouldn’t act like you know all you want or need to know about financial and business academia, and expect those lessons to apply in the markets when trading either your stock or crypto positions. Because it comes to learning about the market’s psychology. See, what you come to know about the macro conditions that this year has brought to both stocks and crypto follows though a forward-thinking mindset. Why is that? Because markets are self-aware of data points, which could either point to where inflation is either close to peaking or has already peaked (spoiler alert: We DON’T know if inflation peaked, if all all!), and how the Fed shows the markets that it’s consistent in its language regarding what its next move is going to be on interest rates.

Therefore, it is why you shouldn’t pretend to know anything that the market is thinking where the next direction is next. The biggest takeaway is to consider staying put until you see how the market react afterward, not when there is constant speculation on where CPI or any economic data is in a given time period.",cryptocurrency,1660876686
solar,NEM 3.0 Update and Potential Proposal Date,"Hey there solar people, it's me again!

I have been meaning to post an update after getting a number of questions on old posts and DMs asking what the status of NEM 3 was. And then the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) happened out of the blue, which took up a tremendous amount of time parsing through. 

The long and short of the IRA is the 30% ITC is back for 10 years, starting January 1, 2022. So if you have installed a system this year already, you qualify for an extra 4% you weren't expecting! You may qualify for more, but they must draft rules at the Treasury Department about how those bonus amounts work. There is also an EV credit that will drive more solar adoption and programs for US-based renewable energy manufacturing, but those facilities will not come online until at least 2024/2025. It is not as positive for the climate or renewables as the Build Back Better bill was, but it is still the largest climate action bill to date. Taking this action now will have a larger impact on the climate than passing the BBB in 4-6 years. 

**NOTE: You may have seen articles about how NEM 3 has been delayed by a year. Those are incorrect. It was a procedural thing. The CPUC has 2 years for the NEM consideration process. But it’s not a hard cap. They can’t finish it up by the end of the month so they just gave themselves a 1 year extension.**

Now the scuttlebutt around CALSSA is that the CPUC will release the draft proposal for NEM 3 on September 29th. That will kick off another 30 days (minimum) of public comment. Then they will schedule a vote in November or December to vote on the proposal ([check out the dates voting meetings happen here](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/about-cpuc/transparency-and-reporting/cpuc-voting-meetings/2022-voting-meetings)). Then there are 120 days from the vote until the grandfathering window ends for NEM 2. So you still have until March 2023 to have your solar system installed and your solar company files for PTO/interconnection to be grandfathered into NEM 2.

Now they can actually make changes by vote from the podium, so we still have time once the new proposal comes out to sway the commissioners. And it is more important than ever to make your voice heard. 

The concern is that the utilities will point to the IRA and encourage the commissioners to go with a more draconian NEM 3 because of the additional federal subsidies. The extra 4% ITC helps but is not enough to offset the original NEM 3 proposed changes. We need a more measured approach that gradually transitions to a lower credit value, does not cut off 5 years of grandfathering without customers' consent,  allows California to continue towards its climate goals, and doesn't put renewable energy savings out of reach right before lower-income ratepayers who have been historically shut out of the benefits of solar get to benefit from IRA programs for low-income families, nonprofits, government organizations, and the recent executive order on community solar programs. 

Here is my list of everything you can do to make your voice heard on this issue:

1. Call Governor Newsom. He controls the CPUC and appointed all five board members. You can leave a message at 916-445-2841.

2. Leave a [written public comment to the CPUC regarding NEM 3](https://apps.cpuc.ca.gov/apex/f?p=401:56:0::NO:RP,57,RIR:P5_PROCEEDING_SELECT:R2008020).

3. Go to [https://www.savecaliforniasolar.org](https://www.savecaliforniasolar.org) and sign the petition.

4. Mark the [CPUC public votes](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/events-and-meetings?search=&amp;topicCategoryFilters=&amp;programCategoryFilters=&amp;eventTypeFilters=41a16e14c9d1493fba5e5bb59656e1ff&amp;divisionFilters=&amp;sort=&amp;view=&amp;activeFilters=eventtypes%7C&amp;page=1) in your calendar and be ready to make a comment by phone. This was the best thing you could do until we blew their phones up for 7.5 hours in February, and they made a new rule that they can cut calls off to attend to the meeting agenda. However, we still want to have more anti-NEM 3 voices than utility shills on the calls they do allow. [This page details making a comment in person or by phone](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/about-cpuc/transparency-and-reporting/cpuc-voting-meetings).

5. If you are in the Sacramento area or are willing to drive, CALSSA will be organizing a massive rally in October or November once the proposed decision is released. Stay tuned for more details.

6. And finally, you can donate to the fight against NEM 3. Both the [Solar Rights Alliance](https://solarrights.org/donate) and the [California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA)](https://calssa.app.neoncrm.com/np/clients/calssa/donation.jsp?campaign=59&amp;test=true&amp;constTypeFlag=org) are leading the fight but are currently being outspent 4-to-1 by the utilities with paid advertising. This is something anyone outside of California can do because you can be sure that if NEM 3 passes in California, your state is probably next for a solar tax.

CryptoCurrency,[Hodlnaut] An update on our Interim Judicial Management / Judicial Management process,"Dear Effed User,
 
Thank you for your patience. Following our update on 16 August 2022, we would like to take this opportunity to shed some light on what has happened in the past few months which got us to this point, and the path ahead. 
 
Why have we gone into Interim Judicial Management / Judicial Management?
We have applied to be placed under judicial management in light of the Hodlnaut Group’s financial health. Hodlnaut’s present financial circumstances are a result of losses suffered by Hodlnaut’s Hong Kong subsidiary during the TerraUSD crash, unusually high volumes of withdrawals, the overall decline in cryptocurrency prices from their 2021 highs and issues relating to certain user(s) who have deposited substantial amounts of cryptocurrency with Hodlnaut. 
 
We believe that judicial management is the option which would most benefit our users now and in the long run. First, it would avoid liquidation of Hodlnaut’s holdings of BTC and ETH at today’s depressed prices (which have fallen greatly from their 2021 all-time highs). In the event of a liquidation, all assets of the company are sold first, and then distributed to our users equally in proportion to their holdings. What this would mean is that all users (whether you have deposited BTC, ETH or stablecoins) would likely only get back a fraction of what was initially deposited. 
 
Second, judicial management provides Hodlnaut with the opportunity to execute its recovery plan and rehabilitate the company. The plan is aimed at restoring our asset to debt ratio to at least 1 and eventually allowing users to withdraw the full value of their cryptocurrency deposited with Hodlnaut. If the Interim Judicial Manager, and subsequently the Judicial Manager, is appointed, he will step into the place of Hodlnaut’s management and make decisions on behalf and in the best interest of our users. 
 
We have heard you and understand that some of our users urgently need to access their funds. As such, we are also exploring the option of allowing users to withdraw their initial deposit, with interest accrued in full, at a discounted amount and close their account with Hodlnaut. However, as we are already applying for judicial management, this process will need to be reviewed and approved by the Judicial Manager in the event that he is appointed.
 
We have made a copy of our judicial management application and relevant accompanying affidavit available on our platform via the web app. All users who have an active account with us will be able to request for a copy of these documents on https://app.hodlnaut.com/fileshare. After a request is submitted, the user will receive the relevant document(s) via email. For users who have their residency in Singapore, we have also made a copy of the Notice to All Relevant Parties available at the same link. 
 
What does being under Interim Judicial Management mean for Hodlnaut and its users?
Once the Interim Judicial Manager has been appointed by the Singapore Court, he will step into the place of the Directors of Hodlnaut Pte Ltd. As such, he will review all of Hodlnaut’s accounts and activities, and have the ultimate decision-making power on all aspects of the company moving forward. We believe that he will also present a recovery plan to our creditors. 
 
What is the road ahead and what are the upcoming milestones?
In order to further stabilise our liquidity, we will be taking steps to reduce our burn rates. We will therefore be changing all open term interest rates to 0% APR from 22 August, 5pm (GMT+8). 
 
Since we halted withdrawals, we have also laid off 80% of our employees (being approximately 40 employees), in order to reduce the company’s expenditure. The current team that we have retained are, in our assessment, necessary headcount in order for us to carry out key functions. 
 
Finally, our legal representatives attended the first Case Conference for our Interim Judicial Management application on 18 August 2022. At this Case Conference, the Singapore Court has directed that subject to the Court’s availability, our application to be placed under Interim Judicial Management will tentatively be heard next Monday, 22 August 2022 at 2:30pm (GMT+8).
 
We understand that our users are facing a great deal of stress and uncertainty about the Judicial Management process. As such, we would like to share certain foreseeable milestones in the process for our users. Do note that the sequence of events described below are subject to change and the directions by the Singapore Court:
Hodlnaut Pte Ltd’s Interim Judicial Management application will be heard in the Singapore Courts. As mentioned above, this hearing is tentatively fixed for next Monday, 22 August 2022 at 2:30pm (GMT+8).
Assuming we are successful, an Interim Judicial Manager will be appointed by the Singapore Court. 
Once appointed, the Interim Judicial Manager will step into the place of the Directors of Hodlnaut Pte Ltd and decide how the company should be run. The Interim Judicial Manager may then evaluate and propose a recovery plan to Hodlnaut Pte Ltd’s creditors to be voted on.

personalfinance,Should I increase my existing loan or take another new loan,"Hello! Sorry I’m very bad at finance calculation so here is my situation and I need help or advice!

I took a loan since 2018, with value of $80k, for 5 years with 8% annual interest rate(APR). And my monthly pay is $1623. I only need to pay another 19 months to completely paid back the loan. But now I need $50k more money.

The loan adviser suggest I increase my existing loan and pay the same monthly pay. He said the the bank give some discount to 7.5% APR.

But with my lack of education calculations, I think it more viable to pay back the existing loan and take another $50k loan as a new one. Because even with 7.5% APR I think both loan monthly payment is way way cheaper? Or is it not?

Here my question: should I increase my existing loan, and pay the same monthly amount, or make a new loan with all documentation fees and other fees?",finance,1660880151

personalfinance,Help with allocating proceeds of house sale,"Advice needed. I’m 32 and I’ve just sold my primary residence (closing next week) and will come away with $290k in cash. 

My long-term (10+ years) partner (35) and I had been living in the house I just sold. However, he has recently purchased a better house that we are now living in instead. We are not married. I, with the help of a lawyer, plan to buy into the house he bought so we will co-own and I will have 50% equity in it. This will take about $125k, leaving me with $165k left. I know everyone says not to co-own a house unless you’re married, but this is not the part I’m looking for input on. I need help with the remaining cash. 


Other financial info: I make ~95k per year. My portion of the mortgage &amp; utilities will be $1500 per month. I own a 10 year old car outright. I have $25k in federal student loans with 2.75-4.5% interest rates. I have no other debt. 
I have recently changed careers and went from about $35k salary until 2020 to where I am now. This also means I’ve changed jobs a few times in the past few years, so my retirement savings are all over the place with about $30k in a 401k, $10k in a 403b, and $3k in a Roth IRA. I have about $5k in savings right now as I used up my savings &amp; emergency fund to get this house sold.


Obviously, I am pretty behind on retirement savings so I’m hoping to make the most of this windfall. My plan right now is to:

- Rebuild my emergency fund ($30k, to be generous) - in a HYSA initially but transfer at least half into I bonds over time
- Buy $10k of I bonds 
- Fund the rest of my Roth IRA for the year ($3k) 
- Max out my contributions to my retirement plans by increasing my paycheck withholdings 

….and that’s all I’ve got. Do I just dollar cost average the rest into ETFs? Do I pay back my student loans? I don’t want to be a landlord which is why I’m selling my house, so real estate is not of interest to me. What am I missing?",finance,1660882816

Is there any reason this isn't a financially smart decision?",finance,1660887285
Bitcoin,"Been seeing a lot of ""but but but Bitcoin is crypto!"" comments lately. No, Bitcoin is not ""crypto"".","Bitcoin is not ""crypto"". Bitcoin IS the breakthrough. ""Crypto"" (tokens, alts, all that) are only possible because Bitcoin showed it was possible.

Bitcoin is a network, a protocol, and a system of digital money that made one of the biggest breakthroughs in history - the invention of digital scarcity. It allowed a digital thing to be tied to the real world through quantifiable expenditure of energy (PoW). Bitcoin is a public utility that has no owners, no rulers, no backing of any state or corporation, and a conception that can never again be repeated in history.

""Cryptos"" are ""projects"" that tackle ""use cases"", raise funding, have employees, ceos, board members, foundations, and can easily be censored by a state. 99.99% of crypto is created to enrich the creators, with retail as exit liquidity. All of them will trend to zero against Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is an alternative to central banking/modern monetary policy run by volunteers and can be used by anyone and everyone. It does not discriminate. It is a public good like the internet is for moving and storing information. The Bitcoin network is for moving and storing value.

""Crypto"" is not much different from fintech companies except they use a slow and expensive database and print their own treasuries at the push of a button. Sure there might be some interesting use cases, but literally all of them can be done without a blockchain.

Understanding that Bitcoin is not crypto is just the first step. The deeper you go into that rabbit hole, the more questions you ask, the more you put Bitcoin under a microscope, the more mind-blowing it becomes.

Bitcoin is **not** ""crypto"".

Edit: What happened to this sub. Personal attacks? Pretty sad. But what do you expect with 4.4 Million subscribers. Thanks to all the decent commenters that encouraged healthy discourse. The keyboard warriors that are sending ad hominem messages, go nurse your 4 digit ""crypto"" portfolio that's down 80%. HFSP.",cryptocurrency,1660888651

CryptoCurrency,Current State of Celsius Bankruptcy Case,"Legally, there have been a fair bit that has occurred regarding the Celsius Chapter 11 bankruptcy. These include formation of representative committees, sending of petitions, filings of motions, statements of affairs, first and second day hearings etc. However, \*practically\*, realistically as far as Celsius customers are concerned not a whole lot has happened insofar as to have them compensated. Even so, there are some significant items have that been brought to light by the judicial process. I will share them with you below. Please note - the following information is representative of Celsius' claims and may/may not be valid if it is even verifiable at all.

On March 30th, 2022 Celsius claims to have had assets of 22.1B(illion). These assets had declined to 4.3B on July 14th. Celsius stated the losses to be comprised of as follows:

* User withdrawals: 1.9B
* Decline in market value of holdings: 12.3B
* Crypto liquidated by Tether: 0.9B
* Crypto lost from investments: 0.1B
* Loans: 1.9B(redemption and liquidation)

As consistent with their Terms of Use, Celsius maintains the position customers who used the Earn or Borrow Programs had effectively transferred all rights and title of their funds to Celsius. The Terms of Use describes this agreement as a loan to Celsius. In April 2022, Celsius began their Custody Program that provided custodial services for customers. This program (seemingly) rescinded the previous agreement such that under this program title now remained with the customer, by whom Celsius would be instructed on usage of their coins.

Celsius has business segments consisting of:

* Earn, Borrow and Custody Programs
* Institutional Lending and Borrowing
* Mining(Celsius operates over 43,000 rigs and plans to operate 112,000 rigs by Q2 2023)
* Defi protocols
* Staking Cefi trading.

Celsius **still** has open positions in one or many of these operations.

Celsius has set out the following roadmap:• Preserve value while negotiating a comprehensive restructuring transaction with stakeholders• Use Bitcoin minted by mining operations to help fund mining operations and grow Bitcoin holdings• Consider asset sales and third-party investment opportunities• File and confirm a chapter 11 plan that will (i) provide customers with the option, at the customers’ election, to recover either cash at a discount or remain “long” crypto, (ii) maximize returns for stakeholders, and (iii) reorganize the Celsius business

My own thoughts:

1. a) Many people didn't know that they transferred rights of their crypto funds to Celsius. It was always there in the terms of service and described as a ""loan"" to Celsius. What this means in terms of legal recourse for customers is unclear.b) Celsius still has \~40.6% in crypto assets. Despite last month's slight decrease, inflation is still high and the Fed seems set on fighting it and the *potential* beginning of a bear market with calls of and signs of the beginning of a long recession. I don't know where the value of these assets would be at the end of months of court cases to be able to reimburse customers.
2. Celsius' mining operations are new to me and I'd imagine to everyone. Even after bankruptcy proceedings they seem intent on expanding their mining. They stated intent to use Bitcoin minted to further expand mining  as well as grow Bitcoin holding but ***not*** *(necessarily)* to repay customers. ......okay.
3. Customers will be offered the option to stay long in crypto or cash. This is odd. Just refund customers their assets and they can choose to sell if they like. I have a sneaking suspicion that customers can remain long in crypto *by keeping their funds with Celsius.* So Celsius get to keep your funds to inflate their assets and/or play around with...*again.*
4. Celsius claims that BTC declined 59% from March 30th to July 13th. This number seems a bit high by a number of percentage points., but I *guess* there are a lot of exchanges. Going by Yahoo Finance(prices sourced from Coinmarketcap), it's off by about 4%, which amounts to about 26 million. A nice amount to be ""lost"" to market.

CryptoMarkets,Crypto Lender Hodlnaut Faces Singapore Police ‘Actions’ and Job Cuts,"Singaporean crypto lender Hodlnaut disclosed massive layoffs and pending “police proceedings” in a Friday blog post that underscored the dire financial and legal straits faced by the latest firm to freeze crypto withdrawals.

Hodlnaut said in the blog that it fired 40 people, which was 80% of its staff, and slashed interest rates to a 0% annual percentage rate in an attempt to “stabilize our liquidity” and cut costs. Its founders are “working hard on a recovery plan” and remain in Singapore.

The interest-paying crypto swap shop said it is engaged in “proceedings” with Singaporean authorities. Its blog was mum on the details but characterized the proceedings as in users’ best interest. Hodlnaut froze those users' assets in early August, and it is now seeking protection from its creditors.

Hodlnaut is one of the many crypto firms such as hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and lenders Voyager Digital and Celsius Network to stumble under the cratering market condition. In its blog post, Hodlnaut cited “losses suffered” from the crash of the terraUSD stablecoin in May.

A Singapore court will hear Hodlnaut’s legal protection plea on Monday and may appoint an interim judicial manager to oversee the company’s financials in place of its current directors.

investing,How does the Fed truly get inflation down with limited housing inventory?,"The Fed is focused on getting inflation down. To measure inflation it looks at [CPI and PCE](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/comparing-two-measures-of-core-inflation-20190802.htm). Between these two measures, the [Fed looks most at PCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/29/inflation-figure-that-the-fed-follows-closely-hits-highest-level-since-january-1982.html): "" Fed officials generally focus on core inflation, but have turned their attention recently to the headline numbers as well, as food and fuel prices have soared in 2022. ""

CPI on the other hand, has shelter as a very large component. Due to both heightened pandemic &amp; WFH demand and low inventory, housing surged in 2020-21 and [has been contributing to inflation](https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/publications/housing-insights-housing-poised-become-strong-driver-inflation): ""pressure is building within the largest component of the index – shelter – and it could replace current surging components as the major driver of measured inflation over the coming quarters.""

Even if the Fed ignores CPI and wants to look at core PCE, [housing is still a decent chunk there](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0824):  Rent and owners’ equivalent rent (OER)—the amount of rent equivalent to the cost of ownership—are among the most important components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index (*Chart 1*). *This measures 12.9% in the linked chart.*

The Fed's primary tool is interest rates, acting to reduce demand and lower prices. This is already working as [we are in a housing recession](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/home-sales-fell-nearly-6percent-in-july-as-housing-market-slides-into-a-recession.html) (calm down its not an 08 crash). Now we get to the crux of the problem.

Housing remains ""[savagely unhealthy](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/the-savagely-unhealthy-housing-market-is-now-a-nightmare/)"" due to inventory below  2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019 levels. Because housing is cooling, [builders have slowed or even stopped construction of additional inventory](https://www.kcra.com/article/real-estate-market-cools-home-building-stalls/40657531). Even if the Fed can kill demand, their effects are muted if supply remains constrained.

**TLDR:** The Fed needs inflation to come down -&gt; part of inflation is housing -&gt; housing can't come down with the Fed's action alone because there is not enough supply -&gt; inflation remains elevated for a long time

I would love to hear your thoughts and see what I am missing here? Where are the blind spots? I don't see how the Fed doesn't revise its inflation target &amp; strip housing out of it, or commit political suicide by causing mass unemployment to cause foreclosures.

***Edit 1:*** *Thanks to the gracious data provided by other users, FRED data shows there is no inventory shortage vs what the NAR shows. Rookie mistake for only using one source. Hypothesis is that the run up in housing was interest rate and demand driven. As M2 declines so too has stocks and housing.*

***Edit 2:*** *not all housing markets are created equal. Many posters note that where they live prices are still up and inventory tight, others note things are correcting hard. Comparisons of Detroit to San Diego, or Bend to Baton Rogue will only be true up to a point. People moving during covid could have created some dislocations in this regard.*",finance,1660925831

personalfinance,Best option for refinancing/repaying high interest private student loans I’m the cosigner for?,"Hi all, I made a naïve decision when I was in my early 20s to cosign student loans for my boyfriend at the time. Unsurprisingly, it turned out poorly for me. I’m on the other side of a chapter 13 bankruptcy and in that time was able to improve my earning potential and got married to a different person. 

Here’s the current rundown of my situation:

* Husband and I keep our finances and taxes separate as I’ve just ended my bankruptcy in May and we are still figuring out the best plan here. Been married almost 4 years, not sure if that’s relevant. He has been aware of this situation since we started dating. Since we keep stuff separate, these numbers only reflect my personal debt/income/situation. He is solvent and his only debt is one credit card.

* 3 Sallie Mae loans totaling $78k (42k, 27k, 9k), variable interest rates 11.125-11.375%. Total minimum payments for all 3 loans are about $950/month.

* Pre-tax personal income: going to be about $70k this year

* per creditkarma, my credit score is 641 (transunion)/662 (equifax)

* no other debt aside from these student loans; we rent an apartment, my car is paid off and well maintained.

* $12k emergency fund, piddly $28k employer retirement fund (will improve on this in the future, I’ve been a bit preoccupied with the loans/bankruptcy here)

Since beginning to make payments in June after the bankruptcy ended in May, I’ve done 2x the minimum payments for each month. The loans are only about $2k less than when I started paying on them directly. The interest rates have gone from 9-something% to 11.125/11.375% in the last 3 months.

Because I’m the cosigner and not the borrower, I understand my traditional refinance options are limited. I also have no way of getting released from the loans as cosigner because Sallie Mae is Sallie Mae and my ex is a trash human. Having spoken to lawyers prior to filing for bankruptcy and again near its completion, pursuing him would be like trying to squeeze blood from a stone and only serve to cost me more money/distress.

I haven’t actually talked to a banker in person yet but in looking around at personal loan options, it seems the interest rates for those at local banks and credit unions are in the range of 6-16% APR. I assume with my score and situation I’d probably be looking at maybe 7-9%, but it would be fixed interest rates instead of the variable hell hole I’m stuck in right now. Husband is a bit hesitant about potentially cosigning with me for a loan for refinancing/consolidating (can't say I blame him) and I’m not sure how much I’d be able to borrow on my own. Probably a financial advisor or personal banker visit is in our future to go over options but I thought I'd crowdsource some possibilities here too.

My understanding is that given the circumstances, my ideal solution still in the realm of realism is to be able to refinance the entire $78k with a lower rate at a different financial institution. I am hoping I can at least get the $42k part refinanced, but I expect I might have to settle for a lower rate loan on just the $27k, still have the $42k with Sallie Mae, and possibly just eat the $9k with my emergency fund. 

Am I missing anything or is there a better option? Is there a good way of comparing rates on a personal loan without a bunch of credit inquiries? 

Thanks!",finance,1660926271
personalfinance,W4 Federal Tax withholding adjustment Question.,"I recently adjusted my W4, switching my filing status from HOH to Single, as I am divorced and claim my child every other year. I also decided to have my withholdings adjusted to get more in my paycheck and less of a return. The IRS tax withholding estimator calculated my refund to be $ 2,007, prior to any adjustments. I decided to change that to $600, which stated that I would need to have $ 164 withheld from each paycheck, $156 less than my current withholding. So I entered the information they gave me (Entering $218  for credits and other reductions to annual withholding).  I assumed this would mean I would receive $156 more each paycheck, but once my next paycheck came in, it was only $81 more. Is there something I am missing here? 

I reviewed my information after this recent paycheck and now it says my refund will be $1,200.  Once I adjusted it to $600( the original desired refund), it says I will need $164 withheld from each paycheck, $75 less than my current withholding. This is confusing to me because I have already adjusted my W4 to fit these numbers and my refund should still be 600, yet it is now projected as 1,200. Should I resubmit my W4, or is there something I am missing? My goal is to have 156 more per paycheck.",finance,1660926390

However, I am currently at a -22% rate of return (YTD) for 2022.

I asked my parents (who are very financially literate) if I should shift my money to a more conservative target fund that isn't hemorrhaging as much money.  My thought process is that I could shift the money to that fund until the stock market rebounds, at which point I can shift back to my current target fund.  My parents told me that this was a bad idea bc I would be ""selling low and buying high"" and that ""the investors know what they're doing"", so I should wait it out.  I understand, in theory, why it's bad to sell low/buy high for the real stock market, but does it matter that much for retirement fund blended investments?  I also worry that they, as a Boomer and a Gen-Xer, are too trusting of financial ""experts"".

Another factor is the fact that high-yield savings account APYs keep going up due to fed rate increases.  I'm already in that game and slowly making good money off it.

My credit score is 650 now and I just got in with my local credit union and started a credit builder loan for 1000 so I’ll prob go through them…I know it’s seems like a no brainer but if I’m paying 300 more a month every month am I beating the interest or slowly draining my money?

If yes I need to refinance Should I stop paying extra till I refinance? 

Should I keep paying 1000 and get some equity in the vehicle then trade it in with my higher credit score? I’m kinda lost on what to do becuse I have the money just don’t have the credit.",finance,1660938517
personalfinance,Student Loan vs Saving Opinion,"I’m just looking for opinions to help me decide what to do. I’m 24 and I currently have $4,600 of private student loan debt (rate is now approaching 10%, I pay $150/mo) and $20,700 in federal loans (3.76%) which I plan to start paying on in November and pay off within 5 years. I’m debating on whether to wipe out the $4600 because I think it’s silly to pay 10% interest. My issue is that I have $10k in savings which is not even 6 months of expenses for me and then to have it drop to $5k after paying off the loan makes me nervous. I work in credit at a bank so I have my guard up already for any potential lay off. But at the same time I’d feel good knowing I just have to worry about the federal student loan. I guess the real question is, is having more liquid savings a better option right now?",finance,1660939066
personalfinance,"Adjusting W4s and California DE4s based on bonus and raises, am I doing this correctly?","EDIT: I realize that I left a few other non-taxable income deductions out (health, dental, vision insurance) but these costs are so small that they don't change these numbers much at all.

Hi all, I'm going through my semi-yearly bout of anxiety over calculating federal and state (California) income tax withholding and I'd really appreciate if someone could sanity check my math. Apologies in advance, this will be long.

I'm using the [IRS W4 Estimator for a 2020 W4](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator) and the [California DE4](https://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/de4.pdf).

My income stats:

* 10 more paychecks remain
* W4 has $374 in additional withholding on line 4(c) from a previous calculation
* California DE4 has 2 allowances specified, NO additional withholding
* Was being paid ~$110k from January to June, raised to ~$121k from early July to August 1st, raised to ~$150k on August 1st
* Received a $29,840 bonus this year, which was taxed at a federal rate of 22% and by the state at 6.6% (this was entered into the calculator in the received bonus line)
* Gross pay per pay period: $5,785.00
* Gross pay YTD: $104,371.33 (includes all regular+misc pay plus bonus)
* Gross pay YTD WITHOUT bonus: $74,531.33 (this is what was entered on the salary year-to-date line of the calculator)
* Federal taxes withheld per pay period: $917.53
* Federal taxes withheld YTD: $19,211.26
* State taxes withheld per pay period: $354.78
* State taxes withheld YTD: $6,556.36
* 401k contributions per pay period (recently increased dramatically with the raise): $751.50
* 401k contributions YTD: $4,148.71
* Total expected 401k contributions at EOY: $11,663.71

Partner's income stats:

* 10 more paychecks remain
* W4 has $101 in additional withholding on line 4(c) from a previous calculation
* California DE4 has $60 in additional withholding written in, taking NO allowances
* Was being paid ~$79k from January to August 1st, raised to $95k on August 1st
* Gross pay per pay period: $3,676.93
* Gross pay YTD: $51,773.01
* Federal taxes withheld per pay period: $312.04
* Federal taxes withheld YTD: $5,146.11
* State taxes withheld per pay period: $209.57
* State taxes withheld YTD: $3,432.20
* 401k contributions per pay period (recently increased dramatically with the raise): $767.31
* 401k contributions YTD: $3,630.92
* Total expected 401k contributions at EOY: $11,304.02

**Federal**

Per the IRS W4 Estimator, we will have a ~$512 return this year. We had a $2,788 return last year due to over-withholding and have not made any withholding changes since.

According to the calculator:

* Total pre-tax income: $250,763 (includes bonus)
* Total pre-tax income from me: $162,221 (includes bonus)
* Total pre-tax income from my partner: $88,542
* Non-taxable deductions (401k contributions) will be $22,958
* Standard deduction is $25,900
* Total taxable income is $201,905
* Total tax liability is $36,135
* Total tax paid if nothing changes will be $36,647

I'm inclined to leave our withholding where it is if this is accurate, but for fun, I looked at what the calculator thinks we should do to drop our return to $0:

* I need to withhold $794 per paycheck, $123 **less** than current. It wants me to enter $329 in line 4(c) but this doesn't seem to consider the $374 already entered there currently. Maybe it should be $374 - $123 = $251?
* My partner needs to withhold $378 per paycheck, $66 **more** than current. It wants them to enter $157 in line 4(c) but this doesn't seem to consider the $101 already entered there currently. Maybe it should be $101 + $66 = $167?

Questions:

* Am I correctly calculating what our new line 4(c) entries should be per the above, considering the current values entered on that line?
* Does our total federal tax liability and the other calculations made above by the calculator look correct? I tried to reduce the liability as much as possible by fully funding our 401ks.
* How does the calculator determine how to break up the amount on line 4(c) between both of our W4s? Would it make more sense to move all of line 4(c) to a single W4, meaning that we'd need a NET NEGATIVE of $57 (-$123 + $66) less withheld overall? That means over the next 10 paychecks we’d withhold (10 * $57) = $570 less, which is pretty close to $512. To do this, we’d remove the $101 from line 4(c) on my partner's W4, and my W4 would have ($374 + $101 - $57) = $418 on line 4(c).

**State (California)**

* Total tax withheld thus far: $9,988.56
* Total tax to be withheld: $9,988.56 + (10 * 354.78 = $3,547.8) + (10 * 209.57 = $2,095.70) = $15,632.06
* Tax liability is $18,739.48 per DE4 worksheet (Calculated from total income, minus $9606 standard state deduction, minus $22,958 401k contributions)
* Need to withhold $3,107.42 more ($310.74 more per pay period)

Questions:

* Do these calculations look correct?
* To achieve the $3,107.42 in additional withholding by EOY, would it be fine for us to move the $60 in additional withholding from my partner's DE4 to mine, and then add the $310.74 to that amount to total $370.74 per paycheck? That way the allowances AND additional withholding would all be in the same place. My partner would just submit a DE4 with 0 allowances and 0 additional withholding.

Thanks all for the help and for reading this far.",finance,1660940208

CryptoCurrency,How long do you think it will take Hodlnaut to reopen withdrawals? (latest detailed email from them inside for reference),"I'm not an expert in this stuff so I don't really know what this email means in terms of time frames.

Do you think it'll take two to three months or will it be longer than that? :(

The email:


Thank you for your patience. Following our update on 16 August 2022, we would like to take this opportunity to shed some light on what has happened in the past few months which got us to this point, and the path ahead. 

 

Why have we gone into Interim Judicial Management / Judicial Management?

We have applied to be placed under judicial management in light of the Hodlnaut Group’s financial health. Hodlnaut’s present financial circumstances are a result of losses suffered by Hodlnaut’s Hong Kong subsidiary during the TerraUSD crash, unusually high volumes of withdrawals, the overall decline in cryptocurrency prices from their 2021 highs and issues relating to certain user(s) who have deposited substantial amounts of cryptocurrency with Hodlnaut. 

 

We believe that judicial management is the option which would most benefit our users now and in the long run. First, it would avoid liquidation of Hodlnaut’s holdings of BTC and ETH at today’s depressed prices (which have fallen greatly from their 2021 all-time highs). In the event of a liquidation, all assets of the company are sold first, and then distributed to our users equally in proportion to their holdings. What this would mean is that all users (whether you have deposited BTC, ETH or stablecoins) would likely only get back a fraction of what was initially deposited. 

 

Second, judicial management provides Hodlnaut with the opportunity to execute its recovery plan and rehabilitate the company. The plan is aimed at restoring our asset to debt ratio to at least 1 and eventually allowing users to withdraw the full value of their cryptocurrency deposited with Hodlnaut. If the Interim Judicial Manager, and subsequently the Judicial Manager, is appointed, he will step into the place of Hodlnaut’s management and make decisions on behalf and in the best interest of our users. 

 

We have heard you and understand that some of our users urgently need to access their funds. As such, we are also exploring the option of allowing users to withdraw their initial deposit, with interest accrued in full, at a discounted amount and close their account with Hodlnaut. However, as we are already applying for judicial management, this process will need to be reviewed and approved by the Judicial Manager in the event that he is appointed.

 

We have made a copy of our judicial management application and relevant accompanying affidavit available on our platform via the web app. All users who have an active account with us will be able to request for a copy of these documents on https://app.hodlnaut.com/fileshare. After a request is submitted, the user will receive the relevant document(s) via email. For users who have their residency in Singapore, we have also made a copy of the Notice to All Relevant Parties available at the same link. 

 

What does being under Interim Judicial Management mean for Hodlnaut and its users?

Once the Interim Judicial Manager has been appointed by the Singapore Court, he will step into the place of the Directors of Hodlnaut Pte Ltd. As such, he will review all of Hodlnaut’s accounts and activities, and have the ultimate decision-making power on all aspects of the company moving forward. We believe that he will also present a recovery plan to our creditors. 

 

What is the road ahead and what are the upcoming milestones?

In order to further stabilise our liquidity, we will be taking steps to reduce our burn rates. We will therefore be changing all open term interest rates to 0% APR from 22 August, 5pm (GMT+8). 

 

Since we halted withdrawals, we have also laid off 80% of our employees (being approximately 40 employees), in order to reduce the company’s expenditure. The current team that we have retained are, in our assessment, necessary headcount in order for us to carry out key functions. 

 

Finally, our legal representatives attended the first Case Conference for our Interim Judicial Management application on 18 August 2022. At this Case Conference, the Singapore Court has directed that subject to the Court’s availability, our application to be placed under Interim Judicial Management will tentatively be heard next Monday, 22 August 2022 at 2:30pm (GMT+8).

 

We understand that our users are facing a great deal of stress and uncertainty about the Judicial Management process. As such, we would like to share certain foreseeable milestones in the process for our users. Do note that the sequence of events described below are subject to change and the directions by the Singapore Court:

Hodlnaut Pte Ltd’s Interim Judicial Management application will be heard in the Singapore Courts. As mentioned above, this hearing is tentatively fixed for next Monday, 22 August 2022 at 2:30pm (GMT+8).

Assuming we are successful, an Interim Judicial Manager will be appointed by the Singapore Court. 

Once appointed, the Interim Judicial Manager will step into the place of the Directors of Hodlnaut Pte Ltd and decide how the company should be run. The Interim Judicial Manager may then evaluate and propose a recovery plan to Hodlnaut Pte Ltd’s creditors to be voted on.

In the meantime, Hodlnaut Pte Ltd’s Judicial Management application will also be running in parallel. The next case conference for the Judicial Management application has been fixed for hearing on 30 August 2022 at 10:00am (GMT+8). 

Hodlnaut Pte Ltd’s Judicial Management application will be heard in the Singapore Courts. Assuming we are successful, Hodlnaut Pte Ltd’s Judicial Manager will be appointed by the Singapore Court.

 

Please find our full statement here which includes a useful FAQ: http://www.hodlnaut.com/press/an-update-on-our-ijm-process


Our next update will likely be on 23 August 2022 after our Interim Judicial Management application hearing on 22 August 2022. Our updates will be posted on https://www.hodlnaut.com/blog/news and communications will continue to be via email (support@hodlnaut.com), Twitter and Hodlnaut Telegram.

stocks,"Shorting ""vegan"" stocks longterm is safe and easy money","During 2020 and 2021 many vegan-alternative stocks like beyond meat and oatly increased rapidly. Now with inflation, recession and interest rates growing they have gone down alot.
But how well will they survive this economic situation?

Take oatly for example.
Their p/e is around -7
They have around 1.7$ per share in capital(share price: 3.4$)
Their revenue is growing but they are still very unprofitable meaning 
Increased revenue = increased losses

People are strugeling financially and they just dont care about these alternatives to the real stuff. The real stuff like milk and meat is cheaper so people choose that stuff instead. 
It will take years untill wages catch up with inflation so Oatly for example must continue with low, unprofitable prices or they must increase prices wich will kill their revenue. This will make them have multiple bad quarters with bad results and bad forecasts.

So shorting them should be easy money.


Tldr
Vegan-alternative stocks like oatly and beyond meat are trash. They are unprofitable and they will continue to be for many years. They wont be able to raise capital without crashing their shareprice.

So short them.


Not financial advise. Just pure speculation.

# **Stocks fall Friday to notch weekly loss, S&amp;P 500 snaps 4-week-long rally - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/stock-market-news-live-updates-futures-open-to-close.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled on Friday as Wall Street’s summer rally faltered and rate hike fears resurfaced, leading the major averages to end the week on a sour note.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.29% to close at 4,228.48, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 292.30 points, or 0.86%, to 33,706.74. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.01% to settle at 12,705.22.
*****
&gt; For the week, the S&amp;P edged 1.21% lower, while the Dow slipped 0.16%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed out the week down 2.62%.
*****
&gt; Friday’s halt in Wall Street’s summer rally came as minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting and comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard indicated that the central bank would likely continue hiking rates in the near term, putting a damper on investors’ hopes of a slowdown.
*****
&gt; Despite the week’s moves, many investors and traders are holding out hope for a bounce back.
*****
&gt; “I wouldn’t expect a complete reversal going back to the June lows or something like that, however, the choppiness we’re seeing today and this week does reflect a lot of the bear case that’s out there,” said FBB Capital Partners’ Mike Bailey. “I think seeing the market trade sideways or seeing a bit of a pause in that rally definitely makes sense based on some of the facts that we’re seeing out there.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares cratered more than 40% after Ryan Cohen dumped his entire stake in the retailer. The move seemed to dampen sentiment among meme stock traders who have bet big on the company in recent months.
*****
&gt; In other news, about a $2 trillion notional value worth of options contracts expired on Friday. Options expirations can add volatility to markets as some holders may be forced to move into their positions.

&gt; # September Almanac: Only 4 NASDAQ Wins in Last 12 Midterm Septembers

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ae0526fdc81e4647a92654fd01bafc40/ea931548fa046435-aa/s500x750/edd7a611bfd1e3a45544584d8d198310a4e18b80.jpg))**

&gt; Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. Although September’s overall rank improves modestly in midterm years going back to 1950, average losses widen for DJIA (–0.8%), NASDAQ (–0.8%), Russell 1000 (–1.0%) and Russell 2000 (–0.8%). S&amp;P 500’s average September loss improves slightly from –0.5% to –0.4% in midterm years. Although September 2002 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA has declined in 11 of the last 18 midterm-year Septembers.

&gt; # Total Return vs Price Change Spreads

&gt; As we mentioned in today's Chart of the Day, there can be a wide spread between total returns and price change based on dividend yield. Although it doesn't always make financial sense for a company to pay dividends, they can certainly magnify returns all else equal. Click here to start a two-week trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in real-time.

&gt; The table below outlines twenty S&amp;P 500 stocks that have seen a high percentage of their returns over the last twenty years come from dividends. The average stock on this list has seen over 80% of their gains over the last two decades come from dividends alone. Although the average stock on this list has only seen a price gain of 61.1% since August of 2002, their average total return when factoring in dividends re-invested has been 278%.

&gt; To show you what we mean, below is a chart of price change versus total return over the last 20 years for Altria Group (MO). As you can see, the dividend in this case turns a below average stock into an outperformer.

&gt; # Bulls Set a New High

&gt; Bullish sentiment continued its recent run of increases according to the weekly AAII individual investor sentiment survey. Hitting 33.3% this week, bulls are at the highest level since the last week of 2021. That 2022 is nearly 2/3 complete and we still haven't seen a bullish reading over 33.3% tells you how negative investors have been this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bears also ticked up this week reaching 37.2% versus 36.7% last week. While bearish sentiment has only been below 40% for three weeks in a row, that is the longest stretch of sub-40% readings since the start of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; With more bears than bulls once again this week, the bull-bear spread has now been negative for 20 straight weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; With both bulls and bears higher, neutral sentiment was the only reading to fall this week. Neutral sentiment dropped 1.7 percentage points from 31.2% down to 29.5%. That was only the lowest reading in four weeks as neutral sentiment sits the closest to its historical average of 31.4%.

&gt; # 10-Day A/D Line Overbought for 15 Days

&gt; In an earlier tweet, we pointed out the elevated readings across 10-day advance decline lines in our Sector Snapshot. Not only is the 10-Day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500 approaching one-year highs (as of yesterday's close), but it has been ""overbought"" for the last 15 trading days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-10-day.png))**

&gt; Going back to the start of our data in 1990, there have only been eight other times in which the S&amp;P 500's 10-day A/D line has been overbought for 15 days in a row or more. The last time such a steak was observed was at the start of 2019 which ended at 22 days. That tied for the March 2016 streak for the longest on record back to 1990. We would also note that other than one streak in the first couple of months of 1991, nearly all of these long streaks with an overbought 10-day A/D line occurred since 2010. In other words, consistently impressive breadth by this measure has largely been a recent phenomenon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Streak1.png))**

&gt; This is not the only impressive breadth signal we have covered of late. For example, in yesterday's Chart of the Day we highlighted that more than 90% of S&amp;P 500 stocks were above their 50-DMAs. Prior times when we've seen that reading spike above 90% have been followed by strong returns in the months and year ahead. Looking at the past times in which the 10-day advance decline line has been overbought for 15 days in a row, forward performance of the S&amp;P 500 has not been considerably stronger than the norm. From that 15th day, the S&amp;P has risen half the time one week out. One and three month returns are more consistently positive but weaker than the norm on a median basis. In the year after the long overbought A/D streaks listed below, though, the S&amp;P was higher 7 of 8 times for an average gain of 11.1%.

&gt; Below is a chart of the S&amp;P 500 since its 2009 Financial Crisis low. As shown, most of these overbought A/D line streaks have occurred as the index was recovering from some sort of sell off. Only one of them (in early 2018) came about at the time of a notable peak in the index.

&gt; # Moving Averages Putting Up a Fight

&gt; Just as the S&amp;P 500 ran into some resistance yesterday at its 200-day moving average (DMA), we've seen the same pattern play out in a number of commodities. Two of the more high-profile ones have been copper and crude oil.

&gt; Copper fell out of bed in the late spring and early summer, losing a third of its value. Along with the equity market, copper has seen a late-summer rally, but things came to a screeching halt right at the 50-DMA last Thursday. Copper has been down on two of the last three trading days and hasn't been able to trade back above that elusive 50-DMA since.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Copper.png))**

&gt; Crude oil has been just as weak as copper lately, trading in a well-defined downtrend and breaking below its 200-DMA in early August. There was a little bit of a bounce last week, but resistance came into play at the 200-DMA, and after making another lower high, it has since made another lower low.

&gt; When stock, commodity, bond, or any other asset class is in a well-defined downtrend, the first thing they have to do to break out of their funks is clear resistance at key moving averages like the 50 and/or 200-DMA. In the case of copper and crude, they have both recently come up short. The S&amp;P 500, again, is facing some resistance at its 200-DMA, but at least it has managed to clear its 50-DMA which it did in the second half of July.

&gt; # Summer Rally Top: Almanac Aggregate Cycle

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7e8069b2c2bd4e8de914d770f3d6de87/4c5d67735406068a-67/s500x750/5166d3e30c8566f6c5b3725cdf1409b76e765d5a.jpg))**

&gt; Bear market rally or new bull, the 2022 summer rally looks like its run it’s course. With the summer rally pushing DJIA up 13.5% from the June low with S&amp;P up 17.2% and NASDAQ up 23.3% here’s what we are looking at.

&gt; This impressive comeback rally pushed through technical resistance at the June highs. But our indicators and cycles analysis suggest another leg down that culminates in a lower low or retest of the lows at some point in the weak seasonal period August-October ahead of the midterm election.

&gt; Last week’s inflation numbers were certainly encouraging. But we would like to see further confirmation before moving into the bullish camp. We are bullish for Q4 and 2023 but remain vigilant about the potential for another leg down that either tests the June lows or makes a new low.

&gt; In preparation for the 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac, we developed this brand-new Stock Trader’s Almanac Aggregate Cycle index (STAAC). STA Aggregate Cycle is a combination of the 1-Year Seasonal Pattern for All Years, the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle and the Decennial Cycle. In the chart here STAAC is all years, midterm years and second years of decades post-WWII from 1946-2021.

&gt; # Housing Descending

&gt; Updates on Building Permits and Housing Starts were mixed relative to expectations for July. While Building Permits exceeded forecasts by 34K, Housing Starts missed forecasts by 81K falling to the lowest annualized rate (1.446 million) since February 2021. Housing represents a large share of the US economy on both a direct and indirect basis, so its health says about the state of the overall economy, Below we have updated our chart of Housing Starts on an average 12-month basis overlaid on top of recessions. Every recession since the late 1960s has been preceded by a rollover in the average rate of Housing Starts, and usually, the rollover starts well in advance of the recession.

&gt; For the current period, Housing Starts remain right near their highest levels of the cycle, but if you look real closely, you can see that the level peaked three months ago. Looking out over history, there are plenty of other periods where Starts declined for a few months but didn't roll over. In other words, based on what we've seen so far, Housing Starts have yet to show signals of an imminent recession. Based on this month's reading and the readings from a year ago, barring a major rebound, the 12-month average is likely to keep declining in the months ahead. Another factor to keep in mind about the historical relationship between Housing Starts and recessions is that in most cases, the recession didn't usually begin until months after the peak of Housing Starts.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Housing-Starts-12-M.png))**

&gt; Taking a closer look at recent trends, the chart below shows the 12-month average of Building Permits and Housing Starts since the start of 2010. It's easier here to see the decline in Starts over the last few months. Building Permits, meanwhile, have continued to trend higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits.png))**

&gt; On a single-family basis, though, both Building Permits and Housing Starts have shown signs of rolling over. Single-family Housing Starts have been moving sideways for over a year now and have just recently seen an acceleration in the rate of decline while Building Permits have been trending lower for a full year now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits-Single.png))**

&gt; Finally, the chart below compares the performance of Housing Starts over time to the performance of homebuilder stocks using the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) as a proxy. While the two have tended to track each other over time, over the last couple of months, ITB has rallied while Housing Starts have been dropping. Either the market knows something about future developments in the residential housing market or investors have gotten a little offside in their positioning.

economy,The Chinese Housing Market Collapse Is Great For China,"Many people assume that housing market collapses are terrible for an economy in the short and longterm. 

However, a cost benefit analysis of the longterm effects of housing market collapses would seem to indicate they are extremely beneficial to society in the longterm.

After the 2008 US housing market collapse the US experienced the longest period of growth in it’s history.  Why? 

The primary factor is percentage of income spent on mortgages.  In the US, about 20-40% of income is spent housing, 14% on healthcare, and 25% for taxes/social security.  That is 59-79% of household income that cannot be spent on everything else our society produces.  

How is that helped by a housing crisis?  First, the federal reserve of a country lowers interest rates. Over the course of a standard mortgage 200-500% of the cost of what you pay the bank is interest.  Lower interest rates for everyone reduces the interest burden on households for 10-30 years after refinancing.  Second, for new home owners the lower prices of a home set them up to pay an even lower percentage of their income on housing over the next 30 years. 

The rest of the economy that was running on as little as 21% of some families incomes can get a boost of disposable income of 10-20%.  That’s 50-100% more money families can use on cars, food, vacations, services and all the other sectors of our economy for the next 10-30 years.  

China’s leaders are purposefully engineering this crisis. Party leaders say things like, “Houses are for living in not for investment.”  Something economists in the west should take note of.",finance,1660949286
personalfinance,"With the new 529 rule change, can a parent send money to a family member to contribute to 529 so it won't affect financial aid?","Rule change article: 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-27/grandparents-can-give-more-to-college-529-plans-under-congress-rule-change

From my understanding, a grandparent (or other family member) can contribute to a 529 for a child, and now, the money won't be held against them if/when looking for federal financial aid.

Is there anything stopping a parent to ask a family member to open a 529 account for their child, send them money to to contribute so it is not considered when applying for financial aid in the future?

From my brief research, anything over 10k in an account owned by a parent can reduce a financial aid package by 5.64% of the difference (so if there's 20k, a difference of 10k, there is $564 lost) (https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/yes-your-529-plan-will-affect-financial-aid)

stocks,Doom and gloom of the Chinese economy,"Last week Chinese central bank lowered their interest rate after the news that property sales fell 30% compared to last year .

People have lost trust in the Chinese real estate purchase model. It worked as a Ponzi scheme.  Using your money to build my building first . The developers could also get loans from banks once they bought the land with their client's money. These developers were highly indebted because of this.

Most buildings were being built in towns without a dynamic economy.  These towns relied on the sale of land as their income. 

Lastly there is a whole supply chain of plumbers, appliances, elevators etc that will go broke along with the developers.

The government solution has been to instruct the local governments to finish off construction.  Not a great plan.

This is a much more serious problem than many realize . The real estate sector represents 35% of their economy. It could slow their development for several years . And confidence is very low in the business sector. Covid Zero policy also has resulted in thousands of small businesses that had to shut down.

In the podcast below Andrew Left of Citron comes out as a star . He put out a report TEN years ago warning about the insolvency of Evergrand.

personalfinance,"My employer has been failing to withhold federal taxes, how screwed am I?","As the title suggests, my employer has not been taking out my federal taxes as they are supposed to for roughly 4 months. 

I am a salaried employee with a standard I-9 and W-2 employment.  State, social security and other deductions have been proceeding as usual, however I found out today that they have not been withholding federal taxes (I only found out because my check was ~$100 lower than usual, which prompted me to log into our payroll app to look at the stubbs and compare them).  

I'm assuming the liability is entirely on me, but is there any way to hold my employer to the fire for this? 

Clarifying details:  my employer has 2 locations which operate as entirely different LLCs.  I was hired into both, the first was completely normal and withheld normally.  When I moved to the second location for a quarter, I was eligible for a benefits package, which changed my overall pay and adjusted my rate down by ~75/week for medical for myself and my wife.  I assumed the lower rate was accurate until I was transferred back to the initial location and my first paystub posted with the additional deduction. 

I was required to fill out I-9 and W-2 paperwork for both locations and did so identically.  So on my end, everything should be accurate.  My employer, however has not been accounting appropriately and has been paying us in paper checks as opposed to direct deposit.",finance,1660958602

We’re helping my sister-in-law get on her feet. 3 years ago she was stupid and allowed her then boyfriend to get a loan through motolease for a motorcycle in her name. She’s not made payments for a year since the breakup, and owes nearly $8,000 on it. 

She has $3000 in savings, and I told her she needs to make a principal only payment to work down the principal so the simple interest rate isn’t so much, but she told me Motolease won’t accept the principal payment? According to her, they told her they can only set up a “credit account” and will pull each months payment from that $3,000. 

I’ve never heard of this before but this sounds shady. Are there some loans that won’t allow principal only payments and require you to pay them all the interest regardless of paying early?",finance,1660969202

+ Self Employment taxes = Net earnings * 0.9235 * 15.2% (max deduction is $9114 per year) = $12, 633
++++++++ Medicare taxes above 147,000 would be Net earnings - 147,000 * 2.9% or 1.45% ???
+ Deduction  of 1/2 of SE taxes.
+ Taxable Income = Net earnings - 1/2 SE taxes 
+ Fed Income Tax = from table 
+ Net earnings = Taxable Income - Fed Income Tax 

Example 
Rev = $100,000
Deductions = $10,000
SE Tax = $12,633
1/2 SE Tax = $6316 
Tax Income = $83,684 
Fed Tax = $9644.58
Net earnings = $74,039 ?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
W2 + 1099 Income 

W2 is $250,000 and 1099 is $100,000 

In this scenario, all social security taxes are paid by W2 job.  So self employment would be 

Net earnings = (Revenue - Allowed deductions)
Self employment tax = Net earnings * 0.9235 * 2.9% 
1/2 SE tax deduction = SE / 2. 
AMT would for any income above $250,000 and is 0.9%, so in this case would be Net earnings * 0.9% ?


So using numbers: 
++ Net earnings = $90,000 (Revenue - Allowed deductions) 
++ SE Tax = $2410 
++ 1/2 SE Tax = $1205 
++ AMT = $810 
++ Taxable Income = $90,000 - $1205 - $810 = $87,895

++ Fed Tax would be $87,895 plus W2 Salary into IRS table for total fed income tax 

++ Profit Sharing (for solo 401k) would be Net earnings * 20%. 

Things that would reduce taxable Income would 401k employEE deductions, personal deductions, etc.

gaming,Fan fiction endings for CP 2077....thoughts?,"So I am late to the game. I am highly disappointed in all the endings. None of them brought closure or felt earned or satisfying. The best one is Johnny because it has some type of closure but it still sucks because V is dead. I was so annoyed, I decided to create some fan fiction endings for CP 2077. I tried to stay true to the source material and not change some of the already pre-existing endings. I just wanted to re-work them a little. In this fan fiction, I also added a few new endings. So please take a read and let me know your thoughts. What do you think? Anything you would change? Anything you would add?

**New possibilities**

1. There is now a “standard good/bad” ending always available to you no matter what life path you choose. The good ending finds you teaming up with Voodoo boys. The bad ending finds you teaming up with Araska.
2. There are now unique endings associated with each life path chosen in the game. Must meet specific requirements. If met, then option will be given to you to choose this lifepath ending on rooftop when you decide who will help you break into Arasaka. Creates replayability
3. Bad ending never gets you to Mikoshi
4. Standard good and unique endings always gets you to Mikoshi
5. Everytime you reach Mikoshi, Alt will always give you the option of crossing the bridge/getting into well

a. If you cross bridge, then Johnny ending ALWAYS happens. Note that for unique street kid ending,  
Johnny must get in well for this to happen

b. If you get in well (or cross bridge as Johnny for street kid ending), then various endings happen  
depending on who helped you get into Mikoshi.

6. However, there is another option that becomes available that Alt gives you. This option is only available if you have high affinity with Johnny (60 or higher). If so, then Alt will explain something about how your high affinity make sit possible for you two to merge into one engram. Two distinct personalities in one engram. Just throw in some technical verbiage. LOL. And that this makes it possible for the “new” engram to go into the body. She will say something like the body will not reject it because it will see the new engram as “Johnny-like” or something like that. Or some other explanation of why the body will accept it. In either case, the body accepts the new engram and V can live on! With Johnny of course. She will then tell you both to shake hands or some other physical action that connects the two like a bro hug. IDK. Something. If that happens, then various endings will happen depending on who helped you get into Mikoshi.

7. So, for example, Alt will say (give options)

a. “Cross the Bridge”

b. “Get into the Well”

c. “ Merge with Johnny” or “Merge with V (street kid ending)”

**Endings**

1. Standard “good” ending

a. Option will be given to you to on rooftop to have voodoo boys to help you breach Araska tower.

i. In order for this to happen, specific steps need to happen in order for them to help you.

1. You must not side with Militech netrunner with rescuing voodoo boy leader. If this  
happens, they will be angry with you and refuse to help, locking you into the only  
other standard ending (“bad”)
2. If, however, you do side with the militech netrunner, you can still get their help if  
you made some other prior decisions.

a. Option 1: Save Brick at beginning of game. You can then ask Brick to speak  
with voodoo boys and convince them to help.

b. Option 2: A special quest is given to you to save Placide from the prison in  
NC. He did something truly f-ed up. You rescue him. In the mission, you  
discover what he did. You then are given the choice to kill him, leave him,  
rescue him. You must recuse him for this option to be available. Placide will  
then convince the voodoo boys.

c. Option 3: Do all gigs in Pacifica (add like 6-8 more in the area) with near  
perfection as asked by Mr. Hands. (In this version of the game, each gig has  
specific requirements to meet. You will be graded on the success of those  
completions, which will then translate to low or high affinity with the fixer).  
This creates high affinity with Mr. Hands and he convinces voodoo boys to  
help.

3. FYI: you come to find out in the game that Placide went behind the back of leader  
to kill Parker without permission. In this way, the voodoo boys leader does not  
come across as a complete a-hole and you get the option of either killing him or  
sparing him when you find out about this in another “new” quest.

b. Once you pick voodoo boys to help, they get you into Mikoshi. There you have the choice of  
crossing the bridge or getting into well

i. Bridge: Standard Johnny ending

ii. Well ending 1; Nomad path

1. Low affinity with Johnny (less than 60). You wake up somewhere in Rancho  
Coronado. Panam comes to see you. You do some talking. She takes you to  
cemetery where you made a grave for Johnny and thank him for all he did. You  
say your final goodbyes. Ask her if she brought the gear. She says yes. She asks  
you what you will do. You tell her you do not know but that Nomads have no  
answer to the problem (6 months to live), so you are leaving night city to find a  
cure elsewhere. Final cutscene sees you riding off into sun away from city

iii. Well ending 2; Nomad path

a. High affinity with Johnny (higher than 60). Same exact ending except no mention of  
you dying in 6 months. Instead, you say that you need to leave to figure out who  
the new “you” is now that you have a merged personality/identity with Johnny. You  
say you have “figure some things out.” Also, no trip to cemetery.

iv. Well ending 1; Street kid path

a. Same ending except it is Judy and not Panam. IN this ending, NC has nothing to  
help you find a cure.

v. Well ending 2; Street kid path

a. Same ending except it is Judy and not Panam

vi.. Well ending 1; Corpo path;

a. Same ending, except it is Anders Hellmen who shows up. Some unique dialogue  
happens here. He mentions he is only helping you because of some sort of  
“blackmail” you have on him. Also, you mention how you need to get out because  
Araska is looking for you

vii.. Well ending 2; Corpo path

a. Same ending except with Hellman.

2. Standard “bad” ending

a. Devil ending or suicide

3. Unique endings associated with life path choices

a. Nomad

i. Finish Panam quest and have her help you. This ending is “star” ending. If affinity with  
Johnny is high, then no mention of you of dying. Instead, you ride off into Arizona with  
Nomads to live happily ever after (with either Panam or Judy if you romanced them)

b. Street Kid

i. Finish Rogue quest and have Johnny and Rouge storm Araska. This ending is the “legend”  
ending. If affinity is high, then no mention of you dying or implication of you doing space  
mission to find cure. Instead, you are alive and well, owning afterlife, and doing this  
mission for some other “reason” (yet to be revealed)

c. Corpo

i. Hardest path to get it to click. In order for this to occur, specific decisions need to be  
made. It should be noted that, at the get go, this puts you at a disadvantage because  
Johnny will not warm up to you as easily.

1. You need to, throughout the game, convince Takemru to reform Araska form the  
inside. I would add some cool unique side quest string (like the kinds we had with  
Panam and Judy) associated with him that helps you in convincing him.
2. Convince Hanako with certain dialogue options at the end to reform Araska.
3. Convince Johnny to go along with the reformation idea. Greatly increases affinity but  
still very difficult. Maybe add some unique specific quests with Johnny, like more  
heart to heart convos and rollercoaster riding.
4. If this works, then Takemura and Hanako will be convinced that Mikoshi must be  
destroyed because it is to dangerous and Sabura went too far. Also, Hanako will be  
convinced that only she can lead Araska. Before attack on Araska, she takes you  
somewhere to jack in to talk to Alt to tell her the plan.
5. If this works, then Hanako will have conversation with brother about it, trying to  
convince him. But Yanobi refuses and tries to kill her. Takemura comes in last  
minute and saves her by killing him. Hanako then gives you access to Mikoshi.
6. THEY BOTH NEED TO BE CONVINCED! If Hanako is not convinced, she will not have  
the conversation. Takemura will try to convince her otherwise but she will not listen,  
and due to “honor” Takemura will obey her. If Takemura is not convinced, he  
incapacities Yarinobo after he kills the sister (in new twist!), with intentions to let  
father assimilate him.

a. In this case, the story will automatically lock you into devil ending.

b. Also, the options to convince them to reform is only available in corpo  
path.

7. Adam Smasher will still attack you for killing Yarinobo. Takemura still helps

ii. Once in Mikoshi, if affinity with Johnny is:

1. Low: You wake up in city center apartment. You drink, listen to some news, get  
dressed in some nice digs. Takemura shows up. Takes you to cemetery so you can  
have goodbyes with Johnny. He then takes you to newly built Araska tower. You ride  
elevator to board room, discovering you are both part of the board and also a  
hitman for them. In the board meeting, Haniko mentions there is still no answer for  
cure. She then tells you there is a job for which you are needed. You mention that you  
only have 6 mo. and you will do all you can to make Arasaka the best corp. possible.  
Cutscene ends with slow camera moving away from board table
2. High affinity:

a. Same ending, except no mention of you dying or in need of cure.",technology,1661007499

CryptoCurrency,Do NOT Buy The Dip!,"I know this goes against the feeling in your bones that the dips must be bought. I'm begging please for the love of everything don't buy the dip. The economic signs are looking atrocious.

1. The Fed is still fighting half-century high inflation. Last month saw a slight decline in yearly inflation and this decline was largely due to a decrease in energy/oil prices. Even with this decline I must remind the bulls that prices are **still** **increasing** at over 8% yearly. The core monthly CPI actually **increased** 0.3%.
2. Russia has severely reduced and outright halted gas flows to many  European countries, who are seeing a massive increase in their  electricity bills to the point of grid overloads, energy rationing and  blackouts. In the UK, it is estimated that individuals see an increase  in their bills from around 1300 pounds in 2021 to 4200 pounds in 2022.  The energy bill is projected to cost twice an individual's monthly salary in 2023(per Trades Union Congress, UK). And Boris Johnson lacks any  incentive or will to do anything about the issue, so this will remain unresolved for the moment. Per Bloomberg, Poland faces a 180% energy spike. Germany power prices have  almost tripled this year. Per Enerdata, Italy's prices have closed to doubled. And the list goes on. All this mind you, with just a few months  to prepare before winter. **ALOT** of European money will exit the markets.
3. We can look at the jobs numbers. 528,000 jobs were added to the  economy. and the unemployment rate edged down to 3.5 percent, a historic  low for the past half-century. About 170,000 jobs were added according to the household survey.  Interestingly, we actually lost about 71,000 full-time workers and added  around 380,000 part-time jobs. The amount of **multiple job holders**  increased by 92,000. Why would people suddenly need to work multiple jobs? Things are looking rough.I also mentioned we are at a historic low for unemployment. That may sound good, but take a look at the graph below. Every single time unemployment hit historic lows the economy went into a recession. (Recessions are highlighted in grey).

My substack article here:[https://sierre.substack.com/p/do-not-buy-the-dip?sd=pf](https://sierre.substack.com/p/do-not-buy-the-dip?sd=pf)",cryptocurrency,1661014293
investing,UPDATE: The plausible worst case scenario is not that bad (from where we already are),"This is an update to my January 2022 post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/sae63a/the_plausible_worst_case_scenario_is_not_that_bad/) that I made in rebuttal to a lot of posts at the time raising the possibility of a 50% crash.

The matrix in my previous post used a base case of 2023 S&amp;P Earnings of 250 based on analyst estimates at the time, and a 17.5x forward P/E ratio at year-end. This produced a S&amp;P 500 price target of 4,375 at year-end. I then applied a +/- 5% range to the 2023 estimate, and a FWD P/E multiple range of 16x to 19x to produce a price matrix or sensitivity analysis for a year-end S&amp;P 500 price target.

What's changed:

* Inflation is trending higher than I thought it would have been heading into year end. I expected for the US to be comfortably below 6% by now. We are probably only a quarter behind schedule, and I think it's possible that YoY inflation is below 6% at year end. The surprise was the Ukraine war and subsequent high(er) gas prices delaying the softening of inflation.
* Because of higher than anticipated inflation, risk-free rates have continued their march higher more confidently than I initially expected. I thought the fed would have to pivot and pause rate increases at 2% or 2.5%. As of now, I'm guessing we get one more 50 or 75bp hike to 3%, and then the fed pauses.
* Because of higher rates, an earnings recession is becoming more likely. Because of this, earnings forecasts have been revised lower.
* Also because of higher risk free rates, valuation ratios like p/e have continued to experience compression. Forward P/E ratios are a bit elevated right now, but I think that the market is trying to call the fed's bluff to raise rates to 3%. I think that when the Fed raises rates to 3% or higher, I think that forward P/E and stock market prices will decrease a bit from where they are today (4,228 S&amp;P as of 8/20/2022).

My updated base case is 2023 earnings of 235, and a 17x FWD P/E ratio, which is a year-end price target of 4,080 (a 3% decline from where we are today). The matrix is updated below with +/- 2.5% range on earnings (reduced from a 5% range on my original matrix considering we are closer to 2023 and have better insight). The baseline 2023 earnings has been reduced to 240, based on analyst estimates, considering lower earnings as a result of inflation and higher recession risk. The matrix also excludes the possibility of a high 19x P/E, considering multiple compression as a result of higher than anticipated risk free rates.

The low end of this matrix is only 56 points lower than my original matrix, although the high-end is much lower. I thought that the fed would have to pivot at some point during this year and possibly reduce rates. Due to higher inflation, the market has endured or allowed rates to go higher without dysfunction. As long as markets are functioning and credit markets don't freeze, the Fed will continue to raise rates. It seems that the market ***wants*** the Fed to fight inflation, and so has ***allowed*** them to increase rates higher.

Bitcoin,Governments trying to confiscate Bitcoin would only legitimize Bitcoin,"I've gotten into a couple discussions recently with people concerned about an Order 6102 situation where a government tries to confiscate Bitcoin. I wanted to make a post and get more thoughts from people about this. I have my own thoughts that I will post below and if you think my view is wrong I would like to know why.

For those that don't know, [Order 6102](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) was an executive order in the US made in 1933 that outlawed possession of gold and empowered govt officials to confiscate it. They took people's gold and compensated them at a rate of $20/oz. Then they set the price at $35/oz, effectively stealing that value by devaluing their own currency against gold. It was kind of like a one shot 75% inflation boost to their coffers. It was wrong on so many levels and considered by many to be the govt defaulting on their debt obligations. 

At the time gold was still the reserve that backed up US currency and they were in the middle of the great depression. It was a very different time, and gold is very different from Bitcoin. Economies were much more localized and information was vastly more scarce than it is today. Gold could not be easily transported or hidden from authorities. 

At its current market cap and adoption level, Bitcoin is not considered a threat to dollar hegemony, so they have no reason to confiscate it. What about when Bitcoin has grown much larger, to say a $10T MC? If they did then, it would probably still drive up the value even further as it would signal to everyone that they view it as a legitimate threat. We live in a global economy now and massive amounts of information are available at our fingertips. The news would spread instantly and the entire world would take notice and begin thinking about how they can take advantage of the situation.

Then we have to consider what the govt intends to do with the confiscated coin. Are they trying to take it out of circulation? Well then all the remaining Bitcoin just got more scarce and valuable. Are they going to use it as a reserve to back up their own currency? Wow, what an amazing outcome that would be. They would give up all their power in monetary policy that the central bank currently holds to do so. Isn't that what we want?

On top of all that we have to consider the logistics of the confiscation effort. It would be extremely difficult to get people to comply with the order to surrender their Bitcoin, especially if they were trying to compensate at a rate lower than market value. If they tried to straight up steal it the resistance would be violent. That's not even taking into account how long an order like this would be caught up in a legal battle. 

My main point on this is that if it ever came down to a large govt like the US trying to confiscate Bitcoin it will mean that Bitcoin has won the battle. It is the best form that money has ever taken, and it can't be stopped. It is so much bigger than any one government can handle, even at its current size. If they tried to confiscate it I would be celebrating because it will open so many eyes to the value of Bitcoin across the world.",cryptocurrency,1661018566
retirement,"No federal or state tax withheld on 1099 from pension, why?","We’ve recently moved and all our tax records are in storage so I’m unable to look at them, but if I recall they have always withheld federal and state taxes on the 1099 from our pension.

personalfinance,Roth IRA: can I withdraw AND contribute (I'm 65),"I am 65, and I've never touched my Roth IRA except to contribute to it.

Anyway,  I want to double-check a couple of things before I hit my Roth IRA for some cash. I couldn't find info about my specific situation on the [irs.gov](https://irs.gov) site.

(1) Can I take a distribution for 2022 only? In other words, once I start taking Roth distributions, I'm not required to do so every year, am I?

(2) If I do take a distribution for 2022, and then go back to work for wages at some point, can I continue to contribute to the Roth IRA?  (I'm not currently employed, but may consider part-time work in the future.)

Again, please note that this is a ROTH account, and that I'm over age 59-½.  Thanks for any insights!

**UPDATE**: I bit the bullet and pulled the money from other sources (not the Roth). I do thank everyone for their input. But I mostly came back to say this: I had completely forgotten that I had over $2,500 total in idle cash across two ""**settlement accounts**"". That's only about 15% of the cash I need, but it ain't hay, either! 

So for anyone else who needs cash but doesn't want to sell their equities right now, consider whether you may have ""money you deposited but didn't spend,"" cash dividends, sale proceeds, etc., languishing in a settlement account somewhere. You might get a pleasant surprise. ;)

ethereum,Balajis Concept of anonymity vs privacy.,"In so many words Balajis is basically saying that for various practical reasons in the real world large cash flows cannot be anonymous. This is fairly accurate, it is also impossible to be continuously anonymous without running awry of tax authorities.

Udi was also saying that the main driver of the next cycle will be people \*finding a way to have their shitcoin casino no matter what, regulations be damned\*.

Well we know what that implies. It implies Base Layer privacy with Zk features like aztec, not just to protect civil liberties, and not to money launder, the real reason people want Zk privacy is so that their casino can't be shut down, no KYC, no jurisdictional restriction.

The Feds and Fatf and the EU know this too, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Terrence Duffy and Gary Gensler know it too, they're lying and being sneaky about why they mercilessly use aml/kyc policy and why they did what they did with the Treasury. It is only perhaps 30 or 40 percent about US national security, the other 60% of the reason is because the K street lobbyist and incumbent wealth in america \*don't want to compete with unregulated products and don't want them interfering with US foreign policy by upsetting economic diplomacy\*.

So they know. We know. Everyone knows everyone knows, and everyone is lying. The real reason we had a bull market is because US citizens had access to an unregulated ecosystem that the SEC couldn't shut down, that is literally what happened, and the SEC has had 6 years to allow Binance international to offer products in the US. Instead we see the Canadians, French, and British, and US ban crypto derivatives and enforce heavily, they have no intention of good faith.

We need to get this over with, make a ZK private DeFi ecosystem where KYC and front end censorship with TRM labs is not possible, make it opaque, and force the Treasury to sanction every single smart contract that isn't running a TRM lab front end.

Force them to show their hand and say the quiet part out loud. This is absurd. We know they will use Circle to rugpull stablecoins and liqudity from ever private smart contract, and every single smart contract out of compliance with US regulations, this is clear unilateral behavior by the EU and US against the rest of the world. 

They originally wanted Veriscope and TRUST and layer 2 narcware on wallets to enforce travelrule, but it is very difficult to implement legally and technically, so they've resorted to throwing a tantrum and censoring entire smart contracts with The Treasury. Now they're blacklisting smart contracts they don't like with FTX.

So we know good and well where this leads, of course they want to use the major staking power of US exchanges to censor at the block level, they're signalling very loudly to us that they will sanction, and block, and rugpull, and reverse any smart contract they don't like. Just say the quiet part outloud.",cryptocurrency,1661022730
personalfinance,Dissolving a Business,"My dad recently passed away. He and my mom ran a small convenience store which was most of our income. He was the only owner of the LLC and there were no beneficiaries listed either. 

My mom currently earns disability retirement income from the federal government, and because of this, she is legally not allowed to work. Therefore, the only person on the payroll was my father.

We recently sold the business, by signing on behalf of my father (done through a lawyer), but we also want to dissolve all the money in the LLC and the LLC itself. How exactly can we receive the money without my mom reporting it as income?

Also, my brother and I cant relieve the money because of financial aid through college. I assume we have to go through probate first to legally get the my mom on the LLC, but she’s already on the LLC bank account so we can transfer funds legally. 

We can even avoid probate by simply not paying the LLC renewal fee, but this would require the account to be 0. There is about 100k in all the business accounts, and taking this as wages, plus reporting this to our college, would lose our financial aid and my mom’s disability.

Basically, how can we dissolve the LLC, take the money, not have to report it as wages (assets would be fine), without losing our disability or aid? Preferably, avoiding probate.

Edit: We sold the lease that the LLC was operating on. So, the LLC isn’t making or losing money, but we aren’t planning to buy another business so we want to liquidate it.",finance,1661024044

I can't find anything that specifically includes coordinates of ignition points or any of the attributes mentioned above for those ignition points, much less something already organized into a downloadable csv file or any kind of database I can pull from.

I can't find data ready for me to use for ANY region of the world, except for one Kaggle dataset with only 517 historical fire events from Portugal and very few attributes for those fire events.

Does anyone have any advice other than to learn all the ins and outs of ArcGIS and download terabytes of GIS data to then extract a few megabytes of data from? Thanks very much in advance.

Edit: I'm specifically trying to build several models to compare algorithms using as many of these criteria as I can find for a large set of fire events for the same region, ideally but not necessarily in the USA:

* Forest structure
   * Species composition
   * Development stage
   * Stand crown closure
* Topography

CryptoCurrency,The greatest trick the bear market pulled was to make us believe it does not exist anymore.,"So yeah here we are, $200M Bitcoin long liquidations in a day and a combined $1b liquidations on crypto due to this move down that is barely a 10% move but the biggest move since June 13th. All that after crypto actually started showing signs of life again with the FED not going crazy on a 100bps hike and the US lying their way out of a ""official"" recession.

So it was safe to say that the debate actually started whether this could be the reversal. Obviously the move to 25k is no reversal or so but could have very well been the start of one due to upcoming good news such as the merger and even the Midterm elections coming which historically presented the best quarter of returns.

But seems like the bear market tricked us. Made us hype things up just so that we could go down again as after the one-two punch from 40k to 19k left everyone dry and set nearly all indicators at all time lows we needed some relief to get back up.

personalfinance,Advice on new temporary raise?,"At work I (24M) recently got a temporary raise for volunteering to take on some extra work for the upcoming year. The raise is only good for this year, and was about $6,000 with an opportunity for more once I finish a project that I'm working on. There's a potential that I could easily make 10k more than last year, but just this year. My question is, what would be the most sound financial decision to make with the extra income I will have? My gut is telling me to stash away every extra penny from the raise, but I also have some debt I could pay off. Right now my spouse and I are saving for a house, and my car is getting older and isn't as reliable and safe as I would like. The debt I currently have is a promotional 0% so it's not hurting me, and I am on track to have it paid off before the promotion period ends. I also have mainly federal student loans, but I'm waiting to see what's going to happen with that and a small private loan that I am currently paying on. I also am saving about 10% for retirement right now. Am I right in assuming I should stash it away instead of using it for debt?

personalfinance,Refinance student loans now or later?,"Hello. Ok so I'm trying to refinance my private student loans and I'm doing so through Splash Financial. Credit score is 700+ across the board (FICO) and salary is 70k.

I also have federal student loans with MyGreatLakes, but the company had them switched to another company (Nelnet) and the full balance was removed from my credit report that was being reported by MyGreatLakes. Also, in total, both of my student loans are about 90k (private and federal total). So I'm thinking this is the perfect time to refinance my private loans since a large amount like that was wiped off my credit report (even if it's temporarily).

However, I also have a credit card with PNC that accidentally went over the limit this month (I pay for almost everything with my cards to get the cashback rewards). And even though I paid it back off (I don't carry balances on any of my cards, except for one, and it stays under 3%), they didn't post it before the statement period cut off, so it reported on my credit as one card being over the limit, and my score fell like 30 points. Again, for clarification, I pay ALL of my credit cards off, with no problem, but this was like a one-off mistake. 

Also for clarification, it WAS NOT reported as late, because I don't carry balances on any of my cards, just the balance was reported OVER THE LIMIT, so it'll go back to normal next month. My focus is on the STUDENT LOANS. I have no other outstanding debt on my credit.

Only outstanding loans I have is student loans... which is what I'm trying to refinance. I'm not saddled in debt or loans at all, but just the two student loans... which again, is why I'm trying to refinance the private loans. 

So, I'm trying to play this smart. My question right now is, should I apply now for the refinance since like half of my total student loan balance is off my record (for now), even though one of my credit cards is over the limit? Or should I wait for that credit card to report next month at $0, and risk the federal student loan showing up again on my credit report by Nelnet, and apply then?",finance,1661034860
personalfinance,Will salary affect a mortgage release or waiver of liability?,"I’m seeking to buy out my soon to be ex wife’s equity to keep our home, but the only way for me to afford this is to secure a release or waiver of liability from the mortgage company, effectively removing her from the loan. With much higher interest rates and loan processing fees, I could not afford to refinance. The mortgage company confirmed they offer this kind of release, assuming I meet the requirements, but they wouldn’t tell me what they are (they’re sending documents that may take weeks to arrive). My question is basically what should I expect the requirements to be? How difficult is the process? And would it be a problem that I make a bit less than when we qualified?

Basic details: 

*Salary: 89k a year (about 25k less than when we qualified for the loan as a couple).

*Home purchase price: $415k

*Current value estimate (Redfin Zillow): &gt; $500k

*Amount still owed: $357k

*Monthly payment: $2050, plus ~ $100 HOA

Market surely didn't fight the fed in 2020. Is it fighting the fed now?

I read a message here saying that being **bearish** right now is fighting the fed. 

if Fed is being hawkish, being bearish is going with the fed, no?

Does this also mean the pivot is a pipe dream for the rest of the year, or do I have a comprehension problem? All these hawkish Fed guys speaking this past week- just ignore them and do the opposite?

I read this week that hedge funds have the biggest ever short position right now. Sounds like they've doubled down, after being wrecked in this June july rally.

The rally forced a lot of short covering, which itself contributed to the rally. This suggests that half of the rally was a false rally consisting of previous shorts and momentum riders who probably have weak hands if the trend reverses. 

Assuming shorts are done covering, who else is left to buy up here near the 200 day moving average?

I can see the balance sheet reduction would likely lead to higher long-term interest rates (lower demand for MBS and bonds). This would mean

personalfinance,"In a good spot, want to know how to keep it!","First the Good:

SO and I are young, 22 and 23, with a significant chunk of our living expenses being paid for by our parents despite the fact we live in our own apartment. For instance, we are still on our parents' insurance plans, phone plans, etc. We also have roommates sharing our rent, a BJs membership, and a few more things going for us. As a result, our combined living expenses hover around a staggeringly low $2,300 a month, for rent, utility, groceries, and other vital things. Even luckier, both of us are fresh college graduates with no debt, student or otherwise. I make $65k and they make $48k annually.

Then the Struggle:

Our weak point is our savings. As it is, we have very little saved since we both just graduated. We're looking to start saving aggressively for two discrete goals. Firstly, we'd like to have the ability to retire before 65. But more pressingly, SO is currently applying to Med Schools, and planning to attend within the next 1-3 years. Of course, we *will* need to take out loans for this, but the more we can afford up front, the drastically more we will save in the long run. We estimate a tuition cost of $200,000, paid at $50k per year. We also assume my level of employment will stay steady during their time in Med School, but they will not be working. And of course, our living expenses will increase over the years as we roll off of our parents' various plans

Finally the ask:

What is the most efficient way for us to go about achieving our goals? Should we create two savings accounts? One for tuition and one for simple retirement? We could kick a healthy chunk out of our soon-to-be debt with 15% monthly being set aside for tuition, still leaving us a hefty 20% of our income able to be put towards retirement savings thanks to our great situation. But is it worth it to go even further to the extreme and aggressively save upwards of 25-30% for the tuition? I mean, we don't know what inflation or interest rates will be by the time we take out the loans. But also, even if we don't like thinking about it, we're trying to be aware of the possible future where she can't finish med school for some reason and we get stuck with the debt. Any money we put into IRAs and 401ks can't be flexibly taken out and spent on tuition, so really this is something we need to make some decisions about now.

Truthfully, I have no idea how to go about achieving these two discrete goals at the same time. Any advice would be appreciated, and I can give more information if it's needed. I'm well aware of how lucky our situation is, and I desperately want not to squander it, and to get the most out of it.",finance,1661065320
personalfinance,12k gone and nothing was done,"I was in jail for 10 months, and I received my disability checks all those ten months on a Netspend account I had been using for years.
That’s about 11k and some change worth of money plus a one time payment of 500 that I received also.

So although social security was supposed to hold that money until I got out, because someone had my information, changed my mailing address to a random one, and got a new card on the account, they kept sending the checks because the money was being used.

So this person had all my identity info, a new card, and my check was hitting every month for them to spend.  They spent it until Netspend flagged the account for fraud. This was with 3,000 left in the account and 5k worth of Checks left to be sent until I got out.

All the rest was spent.

When I got out, my card didn’t work. The thief had gotten a new card duh.
I had no money because the account was frozen for fraud. It was a bad situation. Needless to say I was pissed.

I called Netspend everyday, trying to get through to anyone who would believe I was me. I sent countless copies of my social, Id, facePicture etc. the money left was frozen.
The money spent I disputed. I received the held checks from social security.

I filed a police report. Documented everything I found sent or receive. I escalated to the federal level. The office of the bank of the comptroller of the currency eventually sent me a letter saying it was the banks decision that my charged card was not in fact unauthorized but because money was sent to the jail, my pin was not changed, and the charges were all in the same area where I lived, the charges were valid and i was Not to receive any money.

CryptoCurrency,A perspective on this bear market and yesterday's post about 'not to buy this dip': What it means for markets to be forward looking.,"Yesterday I saw a popular post on this subreddit called ""Do NOT Buy The Dip"". This post begged us not to buy this dip and gave us examples of atrocious economic signs. I will explain the concept of forward-looking markets by discussing the economic signs of that post.  


So what exactly does forward-looking mean? The value of almost all investments is based on future prospects. For example, in stocks, the price of a stock is often a multitude of the profits that a company is actually making. Stocks that people think will prosper in the future, take growth stocks like AMD/TESLA, have traded at over 100 times their actual earnings. For crypto, which is especially speculative and based on future evolution of the technology, the price reflects the amount of trust people have in the future of the technology.   


If your goal is to periodically invest and build a long-term portfolio, the perspectives below on the current economic problems could help to clear your mind.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  **Expensive energy in Europe means volume will leave the market.**   
I am European, the high energy bills are definitely a pain in the ass for us. This however does not necessarily mean that a lot of European money will exit the markets. It is known to everyone here that we are facing a costly winter, in fact, we are already paying for it. Energy companies make sure that monthly energy bills are adjusted upfront to prevent people from getting unexpected extreme high energy bills in December. Besides this, the share of retail investors that would actually have to liquidate their investments in order to stay afloat is a minor share of the total volume.  

2. **Fed is still fighting high inflation.**   
The key here is: ""Is it getting worse, or have we seen the worst of it?"". There were signs that we **could** have seen the worst of it, and while you never see an instant effect of inflation, this could change the prospects of let's say, the next year or two, in a positive way. What also helps is that tapering (while also not having an instant effect) is now in effect, and going to help reduce inflation over time, as we print less.  

3. **High unemployment numbers precede a recession.**  
If you are going to take low unemployment numbers as a predictor of a recession (and therefore as a reason to stop investing), you are making quite a few assumptions here:
   1. We are not in a recession yet, and markets will crash even more.
   2. We are at the bottom of the 'low unemployment phase' and we will transition into high unemployment soon.
   3. Low unemployment is an actual predictor of recession.



[Unemployment Rates Graph](https://preview.redd.it/humm11pjx1j91.jpg?width=520&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e23d5c903b560d06f22e69871974e480f216f049)

If you look at the graph above from yesterday's post, we see that it is incredibly difficult to   
locate the exact bottom based on earlier bottoms. We are well below the previous 2008   
bottom for five years now, and the 2008 bottom was higher than the 1999 one.

&amp;#x200B;

The market has fallen a lot in the period December 2021 - July 2022. During this period a lot of companies were still seeing record quarterly numbers, so purely based on these numbers a crash seemed unwarranted. However, bad economic signs were there and this shows we as a whole value these signs accordingly, based on future prospects **and not current profits**. Unless you know something that the rest of the world does not do, I'd suggest not to skip periodically investing during economic down periods. As an example, the chart below shows what happens if you e.g., miss out on the 10 best days during a period of 20 years, trying to time the market.

gaming,Xbox 360 + MW2 was the pinnacle of gaming for me because of chat.,"Hey All,

I wanted to post something about the problem I have with gaming these days. Back in 2009 Modern Warfare 2 came out. I at the time was 2 years out of college and a working professional I did not have the time I had to dedicate to gaming like I did back in 2004-2006 However I still played games frequently and so did all my friend.

I was an avid PC player I played WoW, WC3, Diablo 2, Halo CE on PC. Call of Duty from 1 through Modern Warfare. 

However that all changed with Modern Warfare 2.

I had a bunch of friends Kyle, Matt, Devin, Bobby, Tyler etc. We all had XBOX 360's We all were working adults and in the winter after work we would log on for 3-4 hours a night.

Every game we would party up but stay out of xbox parties because we wanted to shit talk the other team. 

Every week we would find a group of guys like us and we would just absolutley shit talk each other, it would be a close game and then in the post game we would be like 

**""You want to go again?""**

And we would play match after match after match there was no skill based match making, there was no censoring what was said there were no bans for shit talking. And it was so much better than what we have now. We have compartmentalized players that just sit in party chat that don't interact there is no adversarial talk I mean we said some awful shit to each other. But you know what... those guys and girls we played against that kept wanting to match up. We became friends. To this day I still have them on my friends list. These are people who have since then got married had kids, maybe they game still. but we all met on the wild west that was MW2 chat lobbies.

I feel we need to bring that back. 

XBOX 360 was a magical era of gaming and I think we can get that back but its going to take effort on all parties to get it done.

How do we get that magic back?


* True cross platform multiplayer, PC, Xbox, Playstation, Switch: We need true cross platform, communication, social features etc shared.

* This political correctness needs to die, sure don't be racist but people can get heated. allow the players to self regulate and mute them.

* Allow lobbies to continue playing together and quick friend adds.

* No peer to peer communications without encryption between client interfaces that can't be sniffed by the host.

* Removal of SBMM, if people want a ranked mode on games like Halo, Call of Duty it should be a playlist not the default.

* No DLC that splits player bases.

* Allow consoles to use whatever controller they want allow native keyboard and mouse.

* Build the game and make it whole and then prioritize monetization and premium extras (Such as Apex Legends, Fortnite, Destiny 2, Valorant, CSGO,)

Also, when eating dry food, he tilts his head a bit and some dry food drops out of his mouth while chewing. We saw some salivation once or twice a few weeks ago but it has been rare. 

We took him to see the vet, thinking it was something wrong with his teeth or gums (like gingivitis or periodontitis), but they said his teeth look fine and while there was some gingivitis, it wouldn't be the cause of not eating dry food. The only other thing is that we noticed a small lesion on the roof of his mouth about 6 months ago, but it hasn't changed in appearance which leads us (and the vet) to think its probably not the issue, but vet says we could do a biopsy if we really wanted to.

Other than the change in food preference, he is acting normal in terms of the litter box and energy. In terms of environment, nothing significant has changed other than we introduced auto feeders about 2 months ago, but he was eating fine for about a month with the auto feeder before his behavior changed. 

Given that the vet said it doesn't look like anything is wrong, I'm worried about doing nothing and something actually being wrong but we just didn't catch it. I would love any thoughts or second opinions. Thanks so much! 

Edit: Here's a photo of the mouth lesion https://imgur.com/a/WLXgC8h

Species: Domestic shorthair

Age: 6 years old

Neuter status: Male, neutered

Breed: Domestic shorthair

Body weight: 5.3kg (he has not lost weight in the past few months)

History: Vet has flagged dental issues 2 years ago, we've fed him royal canine feline dental dry food since then. No other issues, and vet teeth looked good in recent checkup 2 weeks ago (some gingivitis but minor).

Clinical signs: In short, cat has stopped showing interest in dry food after being food driven for years. He still shows interest in his wet food. He eats his dry food when left out (in other words, when he will eat the dry food when he's hungry enough). This behavior persists even after changing the type of dry food. 

Duration: Behavior has been happening for around 1-1.5 months

investing,Why Warren Buffett Showed His Hand in Pursuit of 50% Stake in OXY - Wall Street Journal,"By Ryan Dezember

Aug 19, 2022 at 4:25 pm ET

&amp;#x200B;

Occidental Petroleum owns a power plant in Taft, La., that feeds an OXY chemical plant next door. Leftover power is sold on the local grid, which Berkshire Hathaway Energy plants also feed.

&amp;#x200B;

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruled that since OXY's plant accounts for just 0.48% of the capacity connected to the region's grid, a combination with Berkshire ""will not have an adverse effect on competition"" in the local electricity market.

&amp;#x200B;

Warren Buffett's Berkshire had to ask, though, before beefing up its 20% stake to as much as half of OXY's shares. Now the market has gotten a rare glimpse of what the famous investor has up his sleeve.",finance,1661106393

All she ate today is her probiotics pill in the pill pocket. 

She would lick my finger when I dip my finger in water and give her for her to get some water. Should I at least continue to do this? Or should we not even give her water? She's not shivering, just looking tired.

So the last few years I have built a sizeable deposit (400k) and have been looking at buying a detached house. A decent detached house cost around 1.4 million in the suburbs which means I have to get around 1 million dollar mortgage. At 1 million dollars and 6% interest rate I have to pay about $6400/month. So with a 25 year term I will be paying $1.92 million. Add my original investment of 400k I will be paying a final price of $2.32 million for the house.

Which means my house has to appreciate 65% for me just to break even.

If i put 400k into an ETF and contribute $6400/month with a paltry sum of 6% rate of return compounded annually by end of 25 years I will have $6 million dollars according to my investment calculator.",finance,1661117693
CryptoCurrency,I fed an AI text generator the titles of some highly visible shitposts of the past day. Here are the results,"Let's be real: this sub is on a serious downward trend. Since Moons going live incentivises quantity over quality, there has been a huge influx of mediocre shitposting disguising itself as advice whilst drowning out actual quality content. 

The worst thing about this is we are the ones enabling it. The high level of engagement with low quality content is only further exagerated by the idea that moons are the endgame of creating and/or interacting with content on r/cc. 

To see just how generic these supposedly authentic shitposts are, I decided to use an AI text generator and feed it the titles of some popular shitposts that we had to endure the past day.

I chose smodin.io, because, well, it was the first result google came up with, and it gave me a couple free tries. I decided to feed it the titles of a pro-DCA post (I won't link them as I don't want to draw further attention to them, but sort by 'Hot posts' and you'll find em). I also threw in some keywords like ""crypto"" and ""dollar cost averaging"" so it wouldn't veer to far off the path I intended. The result is, obviously, rather basic, but not that far off from what we accept as upvoteable content these days:


&gt;DCA is an effective way to reduce risk from investing in the crypto market because it allows you to gradually buy more coins. For example, let's say that you have a total of $100 to invest in the crypto market. You could divide this up however you like, but let's say that you want to invest all of your money in the same coin. The most logical solution would be to buy a large amount of that coin all at once. This is where dollar cost averaging can help you out as it allows you to slowly increase the amount of money you are investing in a single coin. This helps reduce risk because it allows you to invest a large amount of money over time. If you want you can increase the amount of money you are investing over time. This can help you to gradually increase the value of your investment so that it continues to grow over time.
Another great thing about DCA is that it's a good long-term strategy for crypto investors because you can buy low and sell high. This is a great way to make money because you can sell your coins at a profit without having to keep an eye on your investment. It is a great long-term strategy for investing in a volatile market.

Sounds about average for this sub. Next up, I fed it the title of the opposing, anti-DCA post:


&gt;DCA can be a bad short-term strategy for crypto currency trading because it can be difficult to know when to buy and when to sell. For instance, you could find yourself buying at the top of the market, which is dangerous and investors should try to avoid. This is because crypto is volatile and the price of a coin can suddenly change and make your investment worthless unexpectedly and without warning. This can lead to a lot of lost money if you aren't careful.
Another thing to consider is that dollar cost averaging can be a bad long-term strategy because it can lock you into a position that could permanently lose you money. If the coin takes a downturn and loses value, you could lose a lot of money if you hold onto your coins. This can make it difficult to survive a downturn in the crypto currency market and can make it impossible to survive as a crypto currency trader.

Spitting facts. Again, quite basic but all in all not very different from what we see in this sub. 

Is this what Moons have drove us to? I think I liked them better when they were pretend...
Honestly folks, it's time to go back to the basics: DYOR. And by that, I mean actually do it. Don't follow others' ~~advice~~ opinions when you aren't fully grasping what you're investing in, but take time (months or more, if necessary) to learn what it is you're doing and make an informed choice. 

And of course: don't forget to shitpost about it afterwards.



(Bonus round - for shits and giggles I fed the AI both, opposing, titles so I could watch it struggle:)

&gt;DCA is a strategy that works well in volatile markets because it provides stability. Investing in crypto is volatile because prices can fluctuate quickly. Using DCA ensures that your investments are the same amount every week. This prevents you from having a lot of investment capital or losing a lot of money. It also prevents you from having too little capital to invest. If you invest small amounts of money every week, you're always going to have enough to lose.
Overall, dollar cost averaging can be a great strategy to build up your investment capital, but they can also be a bad short-term and long-term strategy. That means that knowing when to use DCA and when to avoid it is the key to success as a crypto currency trader. While DCA isn't the only way to invest, it is the best way to invest if you know how to invest by dollar cost averaging.

stocks,Saudi Arabia Becomes The First Nation To Recognize The Microsoft Acquisition Of Activision Blizzard,"""[Saudi Arabia has now become the first country in the world to recognize and approve the upcoming merger between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard](https://www.thegamer.com/saudi-arabia-first-nation-recognize-microsoft-acquisition-activision-blizzard/). The regulator known as the General Authority for Competition just announced its approval of the acquisition, allowing the deal to go forward, at least in Saudi Arabia.

The news comes from a well known industry watcher going by the name of Klobrille who spotted the announcement from the General Authority for Competition, noting on Twitter that “Saudi Arabia is the first regulatory authority to approve the Xbox/ Activision Blizzard acquisition.” This move on the part of Saudi Arabia may be surprising to some, but the deal is widely expected to complete at some point this month, even in the United States. The merger is currently being reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission.

According to the Saudi Arabian government, “the General Authority for Competition announces that it has no objection to completing the merger process between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard.” The official announcement was made somewhat earlier, but the General Authority for Competition reached out to the world about the matter today on Twitter.""

personalfinance,Paying graduate tuition outright vs student loans and PSLF in 10 years,"My wife is going to graduate school for elementary education with the goal of being a public school teacher. The graduate program will obviously cost some account of USD (omitting for privacy) over the next two years. We have the means to pay this fund outright (in installments). However, considering the eligibility that public teaching affords in regards to the PSLF program, I'm now wondering whether it is financially prudent to take out the unsubsidized student loans (\~6.5% APR) we've been offered through FAFSA and make payments on an income-based repayment plan. She does have outstanding student loans that would be PSLF eligible as well, from her undergraduate program.

Obviously there's a few risks with the PSLF route:

* PSLF program ends without grandfathering
* PSLF is denied (as is often heard of) at end of 10 years
* Unable to maintain eligible employer status

But if we are comfortable with this risk, and potentially offset it with a savings/investment plan to account for this new debt in the event of PSLF denial, then it seems like the loan + PSLF option is the better option? Is there anything I am overlooking?

In my assessment I am considering primarily three things: 1) Cost opportunity of cash in hand now vs cash in hand in a decade (i.e. investing the cash we'd have paid for tuition over the next 10 years) 2) Net reduction in total dollars paid towards student loans on an income-based repayment plan with forgiveness vs cash payment outright today. My rough calculations work out to be \~70% of the initial loan amount based on our household income. 3) Potential federal student loan forgiveness over the next decade (likeliness is debatable but it is a political talking point these days).

economy,Inflation in the Eurozone continues to accelerate: the ECB will raise rates again,"The situation with inflation in the Eurozone continued to worsen in July: further acceleration of inflation was demonstrated by all components of inflation, except for fuel prices, whose contribution to the overall price growth decreased from 1.36 p.p. to 1.07 p.p. The fall in oil prices made it possible to slow down the acceleration of inflation to 0.13 percentage points up to 8.87% against an acceleration of 0.6 p.p. a month earlier.

[Eurozone CPI, &amp;#37;, MoM](https://preview.redd.it/pqvsdn7u16j91.jpg?width=1263&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40c2105ab0890401ad6813b431cc502cca7cd662)

The largest contributors to inflation in the Eurozone are gas and electricity prices, which account for almost a third of total inflation. Taking into account the further growth of exchange prices for gas in Europe against the backdrop of new attempts by Russia to increase pressure on Europe by reducing the supply of natural gas, we should expect further growth in prices for utilities in the region.

At the same time, inflation in the Eurozone, [as in the US](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/wly9kd/inflation_in_the_us_overcame_the_peak_but_there/), is beginning to become more stable and frontal: the contribution of a wide range of goods and services to inflation (see others in the charts) increased in July by 0.18 percentage points to 2.13%, which in itself exceeds the inflation target of the European Central Bank of 2%. Food prices also show a significant acceleration.

Thus, inflation in the Eurozone, unlike in the US, has not yet peaked, and the decline in oil prices and, accordingly, motor fuel prices in August will only slow down its further acceleration. As a result, the ECB at the upcoming meeting on September 8 will be forced to continue to rapidly tighten monetary policy and again raise its rates by 0.5 percentage points.

I'm 31 and just sorta started getting my life together after a lot of financial/life mistakes in my 20s. I've read the FAQ, but have what I consider might be a special scenario.

I recently got a job that pays just under 100K a year, yet my monthly expenses (post-tax) are under $3K a month. I have 12,000 in high interest debt (Upstart loan to pay off my credit cards, Interest rate is like 26%). I also have $3000 in my emergency fund, and $5000 in my 401K (Currently contributing just 6%). My FICO 8 score just got to 700 after years of recovery (I nuked it in my mid 20s because of missed payments and charge-offs) so a refinance *may* be an option now, but it definitely wasn't up until recently. 

Is it a good idea to increase my emergency fund by the same amount each month as I pay down my debt?  I would like to get $20,000 in a Rainy Day Fund, so my current plan is to put at least $1000 in the bank each month, and make at least $1000 in loan payments. I believe this gels with the FAQ' prescribed advice, but am open to other suggestions.

personalfinance,Invalid log in attempts (not from me) at my bank,"First a disclaimer 

I asked in banking subreddit first. I have not gotten a response yet. This is a larger community and still in the same genre basically. Just hoping to get some help and thoughts on this important issue ty.

Friday at at something pm pacific time I got a email from my bank of an invalid login.. it was not me and I asked my wife and it wasn’t her.

In the email it told me to contact them immediately if it wasn’t me.  I figured fraud, theft attempt that it was serious and my bank had people available on the phone after hours and on the weekend for these serious types of issues. I called and just got the automated run around ending with the bank is closed and to call during regular business hours.  I messaged my bank from the app also since what they told me to do didn’t work.  I can’t think of anything else but to wait till business hours which will be here soon enough.  I just want to know if this is normal for a bank? Or if a Better bank would have someone to contact (at least not say they do when they don’t).  This happened Saturday and Sunday night too.  I’d like to know banks that are better when it comes to this because my bank will be losing me as a customer now.  I recently joint navy federal and their app has a 24 hour assistance line. I need a brick and mortar local bank that is more security conscious than my current bank.  Like a chase, boa, Wells Fargo, us bank or a good local credit union in Northern California. I also want a bank that has a good mobile app that I can freeze my account if I want to. Ty",finance,1661159821
economy,The Devil Loves Negotiations,"On August 18, in Lviv, Turkish President R. T. Erdogan gave a certain proposal of the head of Russia V. Putin to the Ukrainian leader V. Zelenskyy. The details of the Kremlin's message are unknown, but the main essence of this proposal is a call for negotiations through the mediation of Turkish politicians. As R. T. Erdogan emphasized, such a format was successfully tested during difficult negotiations on ensuring the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports. The President of Ukraine made it clear that Kyiv has no serious reasons to trust Moscow, and any negotiations is possible only after Russia withdraws its occupying troops from Ukrainian territories.

It is noteworthy that on August 17, the American The Hill published an open letter from 19 former US high-ranking officials, diplomats, military and national security specialists, who formally appealed to the Biden Administration, and in fact to all politicians of the anti-war coalition of the West. According to them, it is very important to correctly understand the situation that has now developed on the fields of Russia's war against Ukraine. Thus, in their assessment, the United States and other allies of Ukraine provided the Ukrainian army with assistance sufficient for Moscow's strategy to reach a dead end, but not enough for Kyiv to confidently return all the occupied territories. Prolonging the conflict through strategic pauses will only allow the Russian army to regroup, recuperate and inflict even more damage on Ukraine and even beyond its borders, the authors of the letter emphasize.

Former American ambassadors and generals believe that even helping Kyiv, most politicians in the West do not fully understand why this is so important! The authors of the letter draw attention to the fact that the Kremlin is implementing a revisionist foreign policy aimed at undermining the overall security system that provided global stability and contributed to the prosperity of Western countries after the end of World War II. They warn that Moscow's aggressive plans do not end in Ukraine. Russian officials have publicly cited the following RF targets as the former Soviet republics (Moldova, Georgia, Kazakhstan) and the Baltic states (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia). Moreover, the latter are part of NATO. Therefore, if the West does not stop the Russian Federation now, helping Ukraine, they will inevitably have to clash a little later - during the next imperial war of the Kremlin.

As American ambassadors and generals sum up, Ukraine, with the necessary weapons and economic assistance, can defeat Russia. If the West is slow to provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs to win, that doesn't mean it is avoiding a confrontation with the Kremlin. On the contrary, it is only makes it more likely that the West would clash with Moscow under less favorable conditions. Therefore, the most reasonable policy in this situation is to stop V. Putin's aggressive plans right now, in Ukraine, and not later and in a radically different situation.

It remains to be hoped that after V. Zelenskyy’s clear answer to the proposal of Turkish President R. T. Erdogan to mediate in negotiations with the Kremlin, as well as after the strong appeal of 19 authoritative Americans to the White House, Western politicians will understand that calling Kyiv to exchange territories for peace is just postponing a new phase of Moscow's revanchist war to restore the empire. The best thing that the countries of the anti-Putin coalition can do now is to increase military assistance to Ukraine!",finance,1661160187

CryptoCurrency,"Heads up: Pace of Fed's QT Doubles starting September. They will offload $95 BN off their balance sheet every month. In between, we will get another rate hike too.","Since last year, it seems few things move markets as much as the Fed's policy tightening. 

And thats going to get a whole lot tighter in September, as outlined [before](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220504b.htm) , the Fed is on course to offload $95 Billion from their balance sheet. $60 Bn in treasuries and $35 Bn in MBS. And they will continue offloading this every month till inflation is below their target of 2%. Right now, inflation is &gt; 8%.  

[Fed's balance sheet](https://preview.redd.it/1djfel9qy8j91.png?width=2622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df2631638ac5c97046187b5c1d059c444db233d7)

In the July's FOMC minutes that came out few days ago, they said that shaving off balance sheet may be just ""picking up steam"".

Also after a whole month without a FOMC meeting where most asset markets had a breather, they meet again on September 20th and the market expects another rate hike, which could be 50bps or 75bps. 

All of this is going to tighten market liquidity conditions drastically. Rolling off Fed's balance sheet is going to compress corporate profits that will directly translate into lower margins, which invariably means lower stonks... and crypto markets are virtually mirroring macro moves in stock, except much more volatile on the downside especially when crypto funds that employ ZERO risk management blow up",cryptocurrency,1661167220

personalfinance,My company is phasing out our pension.,"34/Chicago. ~115k/yr salary. 

The company I work for has begun the process of phasing out their pension plan and we have the option to stay in the pension or switch to a beefed up 401k (I'll call it 401k+ in this post).

The current 401k is a 5% company match on a 2% contribution. I am fully vested in that and our pension. I'm not sure on the specifics of the pension, but the modeler says if I retired now, I would make about 4k/year starting at 65 and if I retire at 65, I would make about 44k/year from the pension. 

My options are to stay with this plan or freeze my pension benefit where it is (about 4k/year after 65) and move to the 401k+ plan. 

The 401k+ plan is a dollar for dollar match up to 6% of our income and a yearly lump sum based on age and years of service, in my case, 3% of my income yearly as a lump sum and then 4% in a couple years. 

I don't plan to stay with the company until retirement and will likely leave within 10 years. 

I'm having a lot of trouble making this choice. I know switching puts more of the risk on me but I would also have more control over my finances. 

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

CryptoCurrency,Jackson Hole Conference's Impact on Markets this Week,"The last few days have been incredibly hard on the crypto market and the next few days do not appear to show any signs of changing. This week the markets and policymakers will have their attention looking at what develops out of Jackson Hole where the Fed is meeting this week. Friday after the latest inflation data is released Fed Chairman Powell will hold a press conference to discuss what the data shows. During this press conference, the markets will get their chance to gain some insight into what the Fed is thinking about the September rate hike. 

With the large impacts of these hikes on the markets and the last inflation rate coming in better-than-expected discussions have occurred about the next hike only being 50 basis points instead of the previously expected 75. Since Congress is also still in recess there is not a legislative distraction that could occur to help benefit the market while we wait. Chairman Powell’s words on Friday should at least show us a little about what we should expect for the next month or so. What do you anticipate we hear?",cryptocurrency,1661184151
CryptoCurrency,Do Your Own Research Checklist,"Here are things that I generally look at when interested in purchasing a token. This applies more to tokens than purchasing a blockchains. Research is even more important when you are in a bear market and you cant just throw a dart and expect to hit a crypto that will succeed.

**Does the coin have a use?** I don’t invest in coins without a use

**Is the coin being used for its use?** There are many coins that have a use that aren’t used. I think a coin that is actually used will be more likely to stay around.

**What chain is the coin on?** Do I think the chain will succeed? If it is multichain are they actually getting users from each chain or just hoping around hoping to get a user base?

**Are there other coins with the same symbol?** This is more common on some exchanges than others.

**Does the coin have liquidity?** Use a site like bogged.finance to check for liquidity, there are other good sites depending on the chain. The amount of liquidity I want depends on the chain and how new the coin is.

**Do the staking returns and ‘promos’ make sense?** I don’t like exchange promos. I don’t like insane interest rates. I look at the marketing budget if these things are high and try to see how many extra coins will be distributed and when it will run out at the current rate.

**What percentage of the coins are distributed?** If there is a low percentage of coins distributed this is a red flag (not 100% a scam, but higher chance). If I cannot find this on my first resource, I search until I find it.

**What are the max number of coins?** (I then calculate what the market cap would be at $0.01/$0.10/$1.00 and see if that is a reasonable market cap for the coin).

**Are the founders and team doxxed?** (Are they really doxxed and do I think that the team members makes sense. If they list 1-3 social media people and they have a minimal social media presence this is a red flag.

**Social Media** How good is the social media? How many sources are they on? Is it pump and dump style (bad) or more established company style? Do they focus on gaining money with their coin (bad) or the actual product?

**Crypto Events Calendar** I try to see if the coin is on an event calendar like CoinsCalendar or CoinMarketCal. This is more overall information, but some red flags can be found.

**Company Legal Structure** This is a little more detailed, but I want to make sure that the crypto is not an abroad shell company. I want to make sure that they have formed a company and it is registered.

**Smart Contract Code** I check the code with code checking websites. I want to make sure it is not a copy paste.

**White Paper** I read the white paper, **the whole damn thing**. So many white papers think that you will skip the middle and the junk they include is amazing.

**Token Distribution** I want to make sure that the token distribution is clear and described well.

**How many coins do the founders and whales have?** I prefer a more even distribution of coins.

personalfinance,Investing 0% rate student loan (80k),"Hello everyone,

I am from The Netherlands and have just finished my studies (Masters in management).
I am a full time employee at a construction company with a momthly income of about 6500 euros pre-tax (including overtime). I've got 25k saved, which is rapidly increasing as I still live at home.

For my studies I borrowed the full monthly amount (1k) for 6 years so I've got about 80k debt, but I still have about 75k of that money as I lived at home and saved it all.

Currently the interest rate on that loan is 0%, however plans have been announced to increase it to 1,5% and it's directly linked to Dutch state bonds, with historically the rate having been at 4% at times. There is a 35 year period over which the loan has to be repayed, with stacking interest (interest over unpaid interest).

My question is, is it wise to use the money I have saved to invest, rather than to pay off the student loan? I know of some of the risks (investment value dropping where I no longer would be able to pay off my loans, losing my job resulting in me needing to cash out the investments, interest rates increasing on the loan), but how dangerous is this plan really?

And if I were to invest, when should I start? To me it looks like we are about to head into a recession (or are already in one), but the markets are still overvalued. It's a fact that timing the market (at all) is basically impossible and best results are usually to invest right away, but I don't want to take that risk tbh.....

Any advice? Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,Am I not cut out for real estate investing?,"I (31M) live in one of the most expensive cost of living areas in the United States. I purchased my first home in 2020 after consulting with my realtor about what I wanted to do long term. We settled on trying to go for the BRRR method and after I purchased my home, I was able to rent out the excess rooms with no issues for comparable rates in the area, although I priced it a bit lower to be more competitive. 

After about a year, I moved out and my home is completely rented out, and it’s been that way ever since. 

I recently spoke to my realtor about the next step (rising interest rates and falling prices etc) when he asked me what I was getting for my rental. I told him I hadn’t increased rent at all since purchasing. I didn’t have the heart to raise rent on these folks that were struggling, and as long as I was paying out of pocket, I could manage. I even stopped charging for utilities and had them pay a flat rate every month, where I would cover the difference (I either break even on this or pay $50-100 a month). 

My realtor was floored. He said that I was exposing myself to too much risk and that I might be too nice to be cut for this kind of investment. He told me to think about purchasing a forever home for myself and investing the rest in the stock market after hearing about my situation. 

I knew I wasn’t going to be taking any type of significant profit and I was looking at the bigger picture of owning a house or two when I’m older, but the way he was shaking his head at me has me second guessing. 

Does he have a point? Is my money better invested in the stocks if I can’t be cut throat?

Also please don’t bash on my realtor, he’s a childhood friend of mine who’s trying to look out for me in terms of risk management",finance,1661192196

A handful of the quotes that came back were for a jumbo split loan. I’ve never heard of this before.  For example, for one of the quotes, the loan would be a blended rate of 4.84%. The first loan would be a primary mortgage for $350k @5.5%. Then there would be a second mortgage for $125k @2.99%. Total estimated monthly payment was $2660.

This just seems like a weird way to do it. Is this route better than paying PMI?

personalfinance,Sell and buy another house or stay till I die?,"Quick background, bought current house 14 years ago on a 30 year fixed, interest rate is 7%. Owe about $140K on a house worth about $500K now. Mortgage is about $1600 + $80 for HOA. There is about 16 years to pay off this house.

Houses around me that I like are in the $580K-$650K range. Yes, I'm in California, so those houses are generally on a slightly larger lot and about 400-500 more sq. ft. inside. So with the sale of this house, I'd get about $300K-$325K to put down on the next house, say 50% down. With that, I'm looking at interest rates around 5%. So an improvement, not much. I'm getting up in age, so I'd prefer a 15 year fixed loan or maybe a 20, which will put me paid off before I (hopefully) retire thus the slightly better interest rate.

So any real estate finance people out there can help out with the decision? I want to get a house with zero HOA (there are plenty here). But there is literally nothing I would consider moving into that is less than $550K as I write this. Most are actually closer to $620K-$650K range. But I either go now or never since I'm about 20 years from (ideally) retirement age and I don't want a mortgage when I retire.

And yes, I either die in this house I'm in or I die in the next house. And no, I don't want to rent this out and get another.

personalfinance,Sanity check: 23yo pulling back on retirement to save for house?,"Hi everyone, I’m making a game plan and want to get some feedback because I’m not sure if I’m making the right moves. I originally was prioritizing retirement savings, but I’ve been thinking about home ownership recently and I want to be financially prepared if there’s a great opportunity to buy a home in my area in the next few years. I’m just worried about pulling back too much on retirement. I am 23 years old, single, no kids yet.

Over the next two years, my plan is to:

1. Decrease my 401K contributions from maxing out to only 6% (to get employer match)

2. Max out Roth IRA ($500/mo)

3. Save aggressively until I have $30k in a HYSA for a home down payment. I want to buy a house sometime in the next few years so it’s not urgent, but I want to save aggressively now so I have the money if a great opportunity pops up in my desired area. This will take me anywhere between 10 and 15 months. Desired home price is between $350k-$450k, I will rent out additional rooms. 

4. Once the money is saved for a house, pay down car debt aggressively (currently $25k at 4.84%).

5. Once car is paid off, max out 401K once again and shovel extra money into a taxable brokerage account.

More info:

I already have a $13k emergency fund saved up (no dependents, this represents about 5-7 months of expenses).

The only other debt I have are two federal student loans, one at $3295 (5%) which I will pay off as soon as the payment pause is lifted with money I already saved for it, and the other $7500 at 2.85% that I will pay off over time by paying only slightly more than the minimum.

personalfinance,I’m 23 and at a crossroad in my life.,"Hi Reddit, 

So I’m not the biggest fan of doing this but I think I need some advice… this coming January, marks 3 full years since I’ve left college, and my life is in a never ending tailspin.

I’m 23, and  I “graduated” ( if you could call it that) into the throws of Covid19 lockdown. I have 3 years of college experience but a 2-year film degree (I know, the arts… gross) since covid, my life has been a revolving door. Job gained, job lost, job gained, job lost etc….

I grew up in America, but went to school and lived in BC (Canada) until Feb. 2022. My goal was to break into the film industry through on-set production work. However the unions I’ve been in contact with leave me with a catch 22. 

To join any union in film in BC, they require applicants to have 30 paid days “on-set” 
I shouldn’t have had to do this in the first place as my film school claimed to have a relationship with the unions where the degree acts as a waiver of the 30-day requirement with the unions (the school lied, grrrr) 
I have about 20 days on record, but couldn’t get the “day call” from any of them. So, I had to switch gears to keep a roof over my head.

I thought i would be relieved to look for something else, seeing as film is project based, (work is inconsistent and you jump around a lot) 

I had a pizza job, but poor training and change of management saw me let go in Dec. 2021. I had a job as a property manager from April to August of 2022 that was good pay until  the CEO let me go to hire his brother-in-law. 

In between these jobs, it’s been a daily struggle; with sending out apps and cover letters, updating and editing all the info to make sure it is as professional sounding and looking as it can be. I have 3 different resumes (non-film jobs, only film-jobs, and best of both) and two different cover letters that I copy and change all the time depending on the job tone. I thought my “immigrant” status in Canada was negatively impacting my chances, but my luck back in The States isn’t so good either.

Im not looking for the job to make my career or anything, I’m just looking to get my foot in the door. But I can’t seem to catch a break: internships I was looking at require a university enrollment. (Even if I finished the two other years at school, it was the height of covid and those internships weren’t running) most entry-level jobs want more education, or more experience. 

I have education, and I do have experience. However I’ve done such a variety of jobs, that my “experience” is hard to define. (Video production, marketing, business, retail, foodservice, and freelancing to sum it up) I’ve looked online, called in favors, called in family friends, a career-coach, and banged on all the doors I can find, I just don’t no what else to do.

Going into September, this is where I’m at: if the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results, then it would be insanity to continue searching for opportunities in this fashion. My passion is film and comedy, and I’ve been working on a TV pilot for 4 years trying to get it made. I have about 5750$ in my savings (this is all my money) me and my writing partner have been talking, and we are both in a position in life and work to be able to make this Pilot episode. 

I know my money is better put in stocks, or back into my life for finding job opportunities. But if I don’t make my passion project now, Im at a total loss. I feel I’ll piss away what little I have while looking for a job that will take months just to earn back 5000$ (I guess 4000$ if I can find a sign-on staffing bonus) 

Am I making the right decision by throwing all my money on a gamble of a TV project? 

I understand it’s my opportunity, and therefore any failure is mine alone to bear. But if commerce follows art, then even if it doesn’t get picked up i at least have something in the portfolio, right? 

Long story short: 23 years old, 5750$ USD. Thinking of spending all my money to go to Vancouver BC and film my passion project. I know it’s a risky move and could use some advice! 

Thanks Reddit!

UPDATE: for clarification, my resume has some light lies (4 year instead of 2 year degree, added job responsibilities, etc…) my main problem is I can’t get an interview, or even close to the interview stage, it’s just silence on their end. so that’s why I’m fed up with applying and want to make my own artistic project",finance,1661207281

This was my first job out of college and I've been here for 5 years, but am now hitting my growth ceiling salary wise.

So, if at the end of June the prices for wheat and corn were 155% and 192% respectively compared to the price level at the end of 2019, then by the end of last week they fell to the levels of 135% and 162%.

[Food prices](https://preview.redd.it/xnz08u2i4dj91.jpg?width=751&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc8bc3a21119a7da68556194ad35185adee3821a)

However, food prices remain very high relative to pre-pandemic levels, and adverse global weather conditions continue to put upward pressure on them. An unprecedented drought in the Northern Hemisphere this summer does not give reason to hope for a high level of yield in the coming growing seasons.

Rising crop prices are likely not yet fully reflected in the final price of food and will continue to put pressure on inflation despite efforts by central banks around the world to tighten monetary policy.

The greatest burden of rising food prices falls on the population of low-income countries, where food costs account for half or more of all household spending. As a result, we are seeing waves of protests due to rising prices that have swept through a number of developing countries this year, such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Panama, and others.

Rising food prices in these countries are fueled not only by rising dollar prices for agricultural crops on world markets, but also by the rapid devaluation of their national currencies. Growing expectations of a global recession will contribute to further devaluation of the currencies of developing countries, which creates favorable conditions for the growth of political tension in many regions of the world and primarily in EM countries, increasing, among other things, the likelihood of military confrontations.

personalfinance,Are Non-Qualified Income Deferral subject to social security tax?,Assume I maxed out my social security payment this year and decide to leverage “non-qualified income deferral” to get paid 10 years from now on additional income to reduce my federal income tax liabilities. When I receive this income 10 years from now do I have to pay social security tax on it? Assuming the tax laws stay roughly the same. Thanks!,finance,1661217223
personalfinance,Should we recast the equity from our home sale toward the new purchase principle?,"Closing on a home next month with a $450k loan at 5.5% interest. Selling current home in October, which we owe $300k, and anticipate to net $200k after the sale. Our new mortgage payment after 5% down will be $1k more than our current (silly interest rate increase and PMI). Gross family income is $165k. 

Should we recast half the equity from the home sale (around $100k) to drop the mortgage by about $600/month and rid of PMI? Yes, we’ve maxed out 401ks, HSAs, etc. PMI is only about $90. We would have about $125k left in the bank after recast. Thoughts anyone?",finance,1661219762

60. Cardano Node 1.35.3, which should be the Vasil hardfork combinator event version if all goes according to plan, was released today (Aug 11). [https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.35.3](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.35.3)
61. There are some people debating whether the Ethereum Merge will result in tax liability. One of the items discussed is whether ETH holders will essentially be receiving a new coin if proof-of-work miners keep the old chain (and the old PoW ETH coins) alive.

62. Lots of people took a quote from Vitalik about centralization of Ethereum out of context today (Aug 11). He was actually talking about the importance of sharding.

63. Wow! The Netherlands arrested the developer of Tornado Cash on Friday (Aug 12). The stakes just got a little higher in crypto. I suspect a lot of crypto platform developers will feel a little less easy about relying on their open source/decentralized credentials as a shield against government action. [https://www.fiod.nl/arrest-of-suspected-developer-of-tornado-cash/](https://www.fiod.nl/arrest-of-suspected-developer-of-tornado-cash/)
64. An interesting point has been made that validating blocks in ETH 2.0 that contain Tornado Cash or other sanctioned transactions would be a violation of the sanctions while not validating those blocks can also lead to financial penalties (“inactivity leaking”) in ETH 2.0. The fear is that this could lead to protocol-level censorship to accommodate sanctions.

79. There is so much political strife in ETH over the censorship issue that the different sides are literally adopting flags at this point. This is how civil wars start. Poloniex is now even hinting at supporting both the proof-of-stake ETH and the proof-of-work ETH Forks. [https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1559284150749765641](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1559284150749765641) [https://twitter.com/Poloniex/status/1555085757450272768](https://twitter.com/Poloniex/status/1555085757450272768)

Forex,Is EUR/USD exposed to a sharper decline after breaking parity?,"EUR/USD closed below parity for the time since in nearly 20 years yesterday, and a bleak fundamental, and technical, backdrop is signalling the possibility of further losses.

Expectations for a hawkish Federal Reserve, combined with geopolitical tensions and economic concerns in the EU, are once again weighing heavily on the pair. While it did manage to find support at parity last month, likely due to a multitude of buy-limit orders getting filled around this major psychological level, EUR/USD broke lower with relative ease this time around. 

The pair has been trading in a bearish channel since February, and the rebound from the mid-July was indicative of a countertrend rally. The move higher saw a strong rejection at the channel’s upper trendline earlier this month, and with growing expectations of another 75bps from the Fed in September, the break below 1.000 could potentially open the door for losses to accelerate. 

The pair does appear to have found some support around 0.9900 at the time of writing. A dovish speech from Chair Powell on Friday relative to market expectations, along with a soft US PCE print could help EUR/USD pare some its losses. 

However, all trading carries risk, especially given the current extreme levels of uncertainty. Either way, it will be interesting to see how this develops over the week.",finance,1661246168

The Empire State typically relies on the Colonial Pipeline to get fuel supplies from the US Gulf Coast, but it is already near full capacity. In addition, supplies from Europe have steadily declined recently. 

So now two ships carrying fuel are expected to arrive in New York by the end of the week from Texas and Louisiana, according to Bloomberg vessel tracking.

The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones act, requires that goods traveling between US ports must be carried by American-made ships and staffed by a US crew.

# [Stock futures inch higher after major averages suffer worst day since June](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/22/stock-futures-inch-higher-after-major-averages-notch-worst-day-since-june.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures inched higher Tuesday as the market tried to recover from its worst day since June.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40 points, or 0.1%, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also gained 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Palo Alto Networks surged in the premarket on the back of strong quarterly results, while Zoom Video shares slumped after the video conferencing company lowered its full-year forecast.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a downbeat session, as a summer rally continued to fade amid mounting rate hike concerns.
*****
&gt; The Dow dropped more than 600 points Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell more than 2% each. Those were the biggest one-day drops for the Dow and S&amp;P 500 since June 16. The Nasdaq suffered its worst session since June 28.
*****
&gt; Monday’s sell-off was broad-based, with all 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closing lower, led by declines in information technology and consumer discretionary stocks. A slide in tech stocks weighed down the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
*****
&gt; “The global growth story is in shambles right now,” said Ed Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda. “That’s what’s really kind of weighing on risk appetite right now because you can’t have the U.S. continue to be attractive while the rest of the world is crumbling.”
*****
&gt; This sentiment will continue to put pressure on big tech and consumer discretionary stocks, he said. Moya, echoing other investors, expects another round of hawkish pushback from Fed chair Jerome Powell when he speaks Friday at the central bank’s annual Jackson Hole economic symposium.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues Tuesday with results from Macy’s, Nordstrom and Dick’s Sporting Goods. July new home sales will also be reported, along with August manufacturing PMI and the August Richmond Fed survey.

Wow. So world's biggest billionaire and second biggest POS (Jeff Bezos is just OP), didn't figured all this time that BTC is not the best chain for transactions? Didn't he realized almost all ""alts"" out there are actually faster than BTC? 
And since when unlimited supply means better store of value? (Okay feds might be doing the same thing but isn't it the whole problem with fiat?)

















Both points Elon made are kinda true. Specially the first one. Which is at ""capitan hindsight"" level of obvious. 
Which begs the question, what is the real reason Elon doesn't like BTC anymore?
I can think of few reasons:













1. He is unstable, almost Bipolar level of unstable in fact. So it might just be a phase.

















2. Tesla kind of forced to sell it's BTCs. So maybe he want to pretend it was by choice and not to prevent a cluster fuck. 


















3.

This article shows how much Elon can influence Doge (and other smaller meme coins) price. But not BTC! 
BTC is much more resilient to his constant tweeter BS. Maybe, just maybe he now hate BTC because it is harder for him to manipulate?

economy,Inflation and growth,"In India the inflation target is two to six percent for the central bank. In an interview with ET, the governor said they are now prioritising inflation above growth. Both GDP growth and inflation are about seven percent. I believe that this is an ideal time to raise interest rates, as both growth and inflation are high. 

In USA, after two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, the economy is expected to return to growth.  If inflation is the priority then they should be raising interest rates as they are doing. 

The mandate of the Federal Reserve is probably different from that of the Reserve Bank of India. But the situation in USA is different and more difficult. They also seem to be giving higher priority to inflation over growth; but when there is no growth.

stocks,"U.S. economy slows again, S&amp;P finds, due to high inflation and rising interest rates","U.S. businesses grew more slowly in August as high inflation and rising interest rates spurred customers to curb spending, a pair of surveys showed on Tuesday. The S&amp;P Global U.S. services sector index dropped to 44.1 from 47.3, based on “flash” survey. It was the fifth decline in a row and weakest reading since May 2020, shortly after the U.S. outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. manufacturing sector index, meanwhile, slipped to 51.3 from 52.2 and registered the lowest reading in just over two years. Readings above 50 signifies expansion; below that, contraction.

A pair of similar surveys by the Institute for Supply Management, however, show the economy is somewhat stronger than the S&amp;P indexes indicate. The ISM surveys have been around a lot longer and arguably have a better track record. 

**Big picture:** There’s no doubt about it though: The U.S. economy has slowed due to rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve tries to stamp out high inflation, but the economy is still growing. The big question is, how much will the economy slow and will it slip into recession? Many economists think a recession is likely by year end or in 2023 if the Fed keeps raising interest rates. Higher rates slow the economy by raising the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, making it harder to buy a house or car or take out a loan. 

**Key details:** Both manufacturers and service-oriented companies such as retailers reported waning sales in August and the lowest demand in more than two years. They’ve scaled back hiring efforts in response. In a bit of good news, the cost of supplies eased for the third month in a row. That’s a sign inflation pressures are relaxing after a big runup earlier in the year. Rising wages, on the other hand, have partly offset the decelerating rise in the cost of supplies.

In any event, with their own costs leveling off, businesses raised the prices they charge customers at the slowest pace in 18 months. They also holding the line on prices to entice customers to spend more. If inflation continues to ease, the Fed might not have to raise interest rates so high that the economy tips into recession. Looking ahead: “Gathering clouds spread across the private sector as services new orders returned to contractionary territory, mirroring the subdued demand conditions seen at their manufacturing counterparts,” said Sian Jones, senior economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. “The historical data for the services index only go back to late 2009, so we would be wary of attaching too much importance to this reading, particularly at a time when the ISM services index, which started in 1997, was at a relatively strong 56.7 in July,” said U.S. economist Paul Ashworth of capital Economics.

Banking,"If You Have Your Nation's Central Bank Buy Some Of Your Government's Bonds at the Auction - Is that still a market rate of interest? Can that economy still be thought of as capitalist? When the price of money is ""picked"" and not discovered? Are there limits to this approach?","Imagine a government wanted to spend $100 billion but collected only $80 billion in taxes... thus needing to borrow $20 billion to finance the difference. Assume the government lived beyond its means like this for many years in a row, such that it never got out of debt and instead only went deeper and deeper into debt (ie. it's borrowing on a net basis over any meaningful time period).

Wouldn't the ""Market Way"" of determining the price of our money (ie. the interest rate) be to simply hold an auction and sell the $20 billion of debt for as much as you can (ie. the lower the interest rate the better)? Starting with something like 1%... getting perhaps $4 billion in orders, then increasing it to 2%... getting perhaps $6 billion in orders... and so on and so forth until you've sold the full $20 billion?

What are we trying to do today when instead of discovering the price of money through market forces, we have a tiny handful of people sit around a boardroom table periodically and ""pick"" an interest rate? Let's say they pick a 2% interest rate... and then find that there *isn't* $20 billion of buyers at that interest rate (because it's too low... lower than what the market rate would be). Such that we only sell perhaps $6 billion and need to task our own central bank with buying the remaining $14 billion to complete the auction at 2%?

Are there any limits on this approach? Conceptually, what would stop a government from repeatedly spending more on a population then what it collects? Is there a consequence from this:

1. A government always spends more than it collect in taxes... fund the difference by borrowing money. In this way, the government the people receive in any one year doesn't actually require them to pay an amount of taxes that would otherwise be appropriate for that much government. In this way, it's a bit like paying for only a *portion* of your government's cost in perpetuity... sort of like if you aimed to keep going to a restaurant that gives you a $100 meal but you only pay $80 for it.
2. The government goes deeper and deeper into debt as a result... and when any debt comes due and it has to repay the principle of that debt, simply re-borrow new money to fund that past principal payment. In this way, so long as you can keep borrowing new money you are essentially pushing off principal repayment of debts forever.
3. Keep rolling over old debts coming due by taking on new debts. In order to avoid the problem of interest rates moving higher, that comes from a deteriorating financial situation and lenders wanting more returns (ie. higher interest rates) to compensate them for more risk, just ignore them and pick your interest rates so they get lower and lower over any meaningful time period. In this way, refinancing older higher interest rate debts with newer lower interest rate debts isn't difficult. Assume that the interest rate each year will be picked to be 90% of whatever last year's rate was.
4. If rates get too low such that people don't buy the bonds and ruin your plan to live beyond your means forever, simply have the central bank create whatever amount of money is required to buy the remaining bonds. Have the central bank buy 100% of the bonds at auction if need be.",finance,1661267663
CryptoCurrency,"My portfolio may look like I'm down 40%, but I see it as being up 60% and paid my ""Crypto tuition"" fees","Obviously, nobody like seeing red in their portfolio, and unfortunately for many in the crypto class of 2021 and 2022, our portfolios are deep in the red.  However, a simple change in perspective can shift the negative feeling you have about your portfolio to a positive feeling. Here's how I do it.

I started buying crypto in March of 2021.  The only coin I have realized gains on is DOGE.  Everything else is a realized or unrealized loss.  I could see this as a total defeat and think crypto is a scam and a money pit and walk away. However, when I think about what I did before crypto, it becomes clear that my return is positive.

You see, I still follow general financial advice. I contribute to a 401k and IRA, have a savings account with 6 months of expenses, and have a whole-life insurance policy.  All of those things are auto-withdrawn from my paycheck.  Before I got interested in crypto, I would spend my extra money on things like micro-transaction for mobile games, designer clothes, and weed. Putting money here resulted in a 100% loss.

Since getting into crypto, I've entirely stopped spending on mobile games.  I no longer smoke weed.  I have not purchased designer-anything. The ""game"" I'm playing now is ""how large can I make my portfolio?""  This game has a few upfront costs.  Learning is probably the biggest cost for this game.  In the 1.5 years, I've begun to understand how to do research into coins, red flags for scams, and buying rumors-selling news strategies.  I've learned how to self custody my coins, use DeFi, and mint NFTs.  I've lost money (thankfully not a lot) learning about all these areas.  

To have learned everything I've learned, and only have lost 40% of my investment, I am thrilled.  Over the last 6 months, I've been able to average down my cost bases and have got my portfolio to a place where I am very confident in it's long term outlook.  I no longer need to the check the charts every 15 minutes to see how it's doing.  

The best part is shifting from gaming, weed, and restaurants to crypto has resulted in a retention of wealth.  Like most people, if I have an excess of money, I'm tempted to spend it.  I know this about myself.  I've come to realize that I can spend the money on things that immediately go to zero, things that retain some value, or things that grow in value.  While right now, crypto has only retained a percentage of it's value, the knowledge I've gained makes up for the unrealized loss I see in my portfolio.  And one day, I am certain I will actually see a gain.

Tl;DR- Even if you're down money, but you would've spend that money on things that don't give any return, you are still ahead. When you add the fact that you gained knowledge and wisdom, the loss may not even be a loss.  If you stick around long enough, you'll have gained knowledge and wealth, which is a powerful combination.

EDIT: So this was cross posted to r/buttcoin, and because I’m banned there, I will post my comment here. 

“Thanks for the terrible reading of the post. My point was the money I put into crypto was have been put into other trivial purchases that had 0 return. 

$100 into a mobile game purchases is a $100 loss. That $100 averaged across all my crypto purchases is $60 right now, and a $40 loss. Add on top the knowledge about how markets work, how a publicly distributed ledger works, the risks and benefits of both a centralized and decentralized system (admittedly neither is perfect), how money works on a federal level, etc, I consider the money well-spent. 

Maybe I’m wrong, but I’m certainly more knowledgeable today than I was 2 years ago, and I have a greater net worth today than I would have if I never began investing.”",cryptocurrency,1661267765

I am debating what to do with a large portion of money my wife and I have been able save up over the last two years. A little background first - I am dentist, wife is a PA. Together we have 650k in federal student loans.  We have been out of training for 2 years now.  Our income is pretty strong, together we will bring in about 450K this year. Due to the low cost of living area that we have chosen, our focus on living within our means, and the student loan pause we have been able to save roughly 350k that we have sitting in a savings account at the moment. Originally our plan was to throw as much money at our loans as fast as posible as the 650k number is really scary to me, however now that I am actually working and we are making a very good income it seems less daunting to me and i believe once refinanced (if student loan pause is not extended) the monthly payment  will be manageable and not change our lives too much. With all that being said, we have strongly been considering investing in income generating assets such as real state or even dividend paying stocks in order to hold on to that 350k cash and aid in monthly repayment of the actual student loans.

datascience,Variational Autoencoder reconstruction loss hyper-parameter,"For a VAE, the total loss computation (usually) is:

    total_loss = (alpha * recon_loss) + (beta * kl_loss)

Here *alpha* and *beta* are hyper-parameters for *recon\_loss* (reconstruction loss) and *kl\_loss* (KL-divergence loss). One common way to make the VAE's synthesis/generation better approximate/produce the original data is by increasing *alpha* hyper-parameter. However, as you keep increasing *alpha*, you are deviating away from a multivariate, standard Gaussian distribution.

After a VAE has been trained, you generate new samples by sampling *z* from a standard Gaussian distribution as-

This *z* is then fed through the VAE's decoder to get the generated samples. But, since the encoded latent space distribution has diverged from a standard Gaussian distribution, sampling *z* as above would lead to worse synthesis.

Global high inflation, almost every significant country is in high single digits or low double digits. 

National debt is close to or much higher than GDP in most developed nations.

Increasing interest rates in every developed nation that may continue to rise, potentially to high single digits if inflation is not curbed.

Stagnating or even decreasing buying power for the working class in almost every developed nation, most people who don’t already have assets seem to be on an earning trajectory that can never buy a home, or certainly never a “good” home.

CryptoCurrency,"We’re fast approaching towards the last months of a brutal, yet consequential 2022. With that said, 2023 could possibly promise the crypto markets to become another volatile year ahead.","Given the ugliest months that all of the crypto markets have seen (i.e. inflationary fears and the war in Ukraine), the macro environment has never been to be continuously hostile to risk-on assets and the cryptocurrencies at-large. In fact, a severe inflationary period not seen in more than 40 years has all but destroyed the narrative that Bitcoin is perceived as an inflation hedge. Yet, looking forward to the last few months of 2022, there are a few questions that I would like to underscore here in this original post:

1.) How far will the Fed go on Inflation from September onward to 2023? - Right now, CPI numbers from both June and July have shown signs that inflation is beginning to peak, ultimately, it is up to how the Federal Reserve is going to base their monetary policy going forward without causing a self-inflicted wound by bringing about a recession. At this point, the Jackson Hole symposium, involving not just the Fed officials but economists and academics alike, will be a watershed moment in regards to how current data will either support his Fed’s hawkish approach to inflation, or support a more neutral stance come September. For certain, the market is expecting more rate hikes to come throughout the rest of 2022. However, next year’s outlook is becoming more opaque in terms of how the market will respond to further restrictive policy moves, given many other factors are in play. Therefore, it is this reality that the crypto markets can’t ignore any longer.

2.) What would the global economic picture look like a year into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? - On the surface, indications are pointing to a more prolonged conflict involving both Ukraine and Russia, further complicating Europe’s ongoing dilemma due to its dependence of Russia’s energy. Combined with the gas supply, it is almost inevitable that a recession can be just as severe and immediate to its economy, which is to be transparent, can bring about a economic slowdown much sooner by early as next year. Although it is going to be a source of pain by next year, it is also important to keep a close eye on the geopolitical dynamics with the U.S., its relationship with Taiwan, and China’s presence on the world stage, both economically and politically.

3.) How will regulation play out for Bitcoin and crypto in the U.S. and beyond throughout 2023? - Perhaps as the most impactful in this space, it was widely expected for either a Spot Bitcoin ETF, or institutional adoption to accelerate through this year. Unfortunately, it is currently impossible to see any one of these things to happen all at once this year. Reasons for this has a lot to do with how SEC and other regulators has yet to be uniformed on crypto markets as a whole. In addition, there is an sense of uncertainty for next year, because the current political consensus is driven by partisan ideas regarding the full adoption of crypto. On the one hand, you have supporters in Capitol Hill who sees crypto as a large contributor of innovation, and that it should coexist in these markets. On the other hand, you have Gary Gensler and his strong emphasis on treating Bitcoin and the crypto markets as similar to traditional finance. While it is fortunate to say that Bitcoin is not going away anytime soon, it remains to be seen how regulation is approached within 2023, if anything at all.

Simply put, a lot of these macro events can play out either by the tail-end of this year, or down the road in the future. One thing is very certain, next year could be gearing up to be one of the most consequential years in the history of crypto.",cryptocurrency,1661286141

personalfinance,Need advice on debt consolidation,"Hi all,

I desperately want to start making smart financial decisions for my family and pay off my debt as aggressively as possible. I have a five-year-old son and a job as a full-time teacher and I hate that finances and my debt are constantly making me feel like I'm a failure. I make $5000 a month after taxes. I am also currently wrapping up my masters degree and have three courses left, at about $1200 each. 

I am looking for advice about whether or not debt consolidation is a good option to help get my finances in order (to eliminate credit cards 1 and 2 below). I would say, overall, I am poor with money. All my credit cards are maxed out and while I never miss any payments, I pay only the minimum and can't seem to get ahead. 

My credit card debts are as follows:

\- Credit card 1 (20.97 %) owing $2,500

\- Credit card 2 (19.99%) owing $4,700

\- Credit card 3 with TD (16.45%) owing $6,800 - TD is who I am considering applying for a personal loan with to consolidate my credit... more info below

I also have the following debts:

\- Furniture store (0%) $600

\- Car payment (3.39%) $25,200

\- Line of Credit through TD (from student years): $3,500

\- OSAP (currently interest free due to Covid): $30,600

TD has suggested I apply for debt consolidation with a fixed interest rate of 7.99%, or a variable interest rate of TD prime rate + 6.99%. They can do anywhere from a 1-7 year loan. The bank advisor suggested I apply for the fixed rate, taking the 7 year loan. He said it has a payment of $125 a month but that I could put a lump sum on that amount (say $500 a month) and pay it off quickly since it is an open loan. The 7 year loan, by contrast, asks for a $769 a month. He said this wouldn't be a good option in case I need flexibility; however, my income is steady as a teacher and I am ready to make a serious commitment to move out of dept. 

As someone who has very limited knowledge about personal finances, I really appreciate your advice.

personalfinance,Options w/Car Lease and Mileage Issues,"In April of 2021, I leased a vehicle which given the market at the time, ended up being a good deal, especially for this particular vehicle. I ended up going with a 30K mile limit/36-month lease. Mileage overage of $0.25 per mile. At the time, I was traveling a modest amount for work, but my territory was compact enough that 10K per year shouldn’t have been too significant of a challenge to manage.

Fast forward 6 months later and I unexpectedly had the opportunity to transfer back to my home state, relocation paid, and continue my same position. However, this would come with a much larger territory in the new state. I took the offer and I have zero regrets on that end. The problem though, is my travel has increased a very significant amount, and much more than I anticipated. Currently I am now only 15-16 months into the 36 month lease and already at 25K miles. I am starting to panic about the implications. The way I see it, I need to quickly weigh my options and possibly act fast on what I do next:

Option A: Hang onto the lease and watch the mileage climb. Where will it stop? Nobody knows. Will I remain in the same role another 1.5 years and travel another 30K miles? 40K miles? Then take it on the chin for thousands of dollars in overage fees at lease-end….yikes.

Option B: Try and sell my lease ASAP for what I owe + the residual (~$45K combined) and find a new vehicle and a traditional auto loan given my increased travel. I have not started shopping around for appraisals yet, but Carmax, whom I have sold two prior non-leases vehicles too with good success, gave me a high end online estimate that comes in at $43K :(

Option C: Ride out the rest of the lease and pursue a lease buyout loan at whatever the hell the interest rates might be at that point. I do love this vehicle, but not exactly enthused about the prospect of paying more a month than my lease for a well-used vehicle 2 years from now. I also view this as shortsighted because while I might be dodging the overage fees at lease end, I’m ultimately going to pay well beyond that in interest on a buyout loan. Plus, can a lender say that it’s not worth the residual value and therefore not even want to lend?

Option D: My employer allows us to use rental cars for work related travel. In doing so, you give up the mileage reimbursement you get for using your own vehicle which traditionally is akin to a second income with my current travel. Also, the thought and inconvenience of trekking with my wife 30 mins to end from the airport each week to rent a car sounds like a massive PITA and also adds mileage to the lease in the process.

Option E: Something I might not be considering or am unaware of. You tell me?

If chad can pay off the borrowed amount over 2.5 years (paying 40,000 a year), he will accumulate interest of:

year 1: 100,000 \* .05 = 5,000

year 2: 60,000 \* .05 = 3,000

year 3: 20,000 \* .025(only the first half of the year is needed) = 500

Total Interest = 8,500

Summary:

\+ 902,796 new value

\- 200,000 original investment

\- 8,500 interest

694296 (590151.6 Assuming 15% Tax)

personalfinance,How do y'all compare two different job opportunities?,"tl;dr: Previously I looked for a different job in Europe a change in pace. After hearing several “No” several times, I stopped looking and covid happened. I came out of covid in a significantly better place and now have a job offer I wanted pre-covid. Having doubts due to lower pay, lower ceiling, and less time off/lack of hybrid. Still wanting to go for the experience and more laid back life. We love the location, and even vacation in this country and the neighboring ones regularly. I’m scared I’ll be blowing up all that we’ve built up at home just to try something new. 

I’m having trouble deciding between two jobs. This is a real first world problem, but for the life of me I can’t make a decision. I currently work/live with my family (wife, 3 kids) in a major city in the American south. Salary puts me in the top 5% of the area, doing a job I find kind of “meh” after being in it for 2 years. In the past (pre-covid) I looked into getting a job in Germany or Austria. My wife is German, and the entire family speaks the language. We wanted to move for better work life balance, a walkable city, and a more relaxed school system. When the job offers never happened + covid, I stopped looking. Since then we have had our third child, built a custom house to fit our family/needs, got the kids good schools, and invested in making a strong social/friend network. I also saw how much the corporate environment created stress and drama at home, so I am trying to minimize my amount of time working. As such I’ve been interested in maximizing my salary and saving significantly for retirement/rainy day funds.


Recently, a new opportunity came up. An interview and a couple months later and I’ve now got a job offer. It’s a good offer (especially for the new country) and one I would have taken previously without a doubt. The new city would be amazing for everyone, the work is what I was previously doing in grad school, and the vacation was what I was looking for.  


Comparing the two compensation packages, I’d be making less than half at almost every step. New job salary would be roughly 50%, bonus is 33%, and retirement contribution is 25%. The cost of living is a little lower, but I would have a couple hundred euros at the end of each month. I knew this part going in, along with the tax rate being roughly double, and was mostly ok with it as there are stronger social services. What is starting to worry me is the ceiling of both jobs. Comparing salary data between the two companies, the salary would continue to grow and the bonus structure works so that in 5-10 years, my bonus could be equal to the new jobs salary. The new position would be a lower level at the new company, so I’ll be starting over. And if things didn’t work out, coming home would be difficult as I would have taken that step back. 


The part that was a shock was how much less time off I would get moving to Europe. My current work schedule is a 9/80, meaning we work 80 hours over 9 days and get every other Friday off. My current job is 20 days vacation, 26 Fridays off, and 11 Federal/company holidays. New job would be 25 days vacation, and 16 Federal/public holidays. The way we gain another week of vacation, I will always have more time off at my current job. I will get to 25 days vacation in 9 years at current job, and 30 days in 19 years. At new job I would hit 30 days in 19 years as well. My new contract explicitly says the current 9/80 scheme is not allowed. Also contributing is the loss of hybrid schedule. I’m currently 40% hybrid, which while I’ve grown to appreciate as I’ve watched my youngest go from newborn to pre-school. I also don’t miss the commute.


So I guess my ask is any advice on: 

How to weigh salary vs quality of life? 

Current salary vs earning potential? 

57 vs 41 days off?

solar,California Trying to Kill Solar Again with AB 2143,"Hey there solar people, it's me again. And this time I'm not here to talk about NEM 3! Nope, the state is looking to kill solar in yet another way.

Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo has introduced yet another anti-solar bill trying to gut solar in California, and it is likely to go up for a vote *THIS WEEK*. AB 2143 has been marketed as a wage bill, the goal is to make commercial and multi-family residential solar over 15 kw be a public works project which means prevailing wages. That alone massively increases red tape and boosts labor costs by 25%, making solar more unaffordable, a big win for utility companies. 

This means that if you want to put solar on your business, benefit from a system installed on your apartment building as a renter, or get solar installed at the nonprofit you volunteer at (that now qualifies for the ITC thanks to the IRA) so they can spend more money on their mission rather than paying high utility bills... in all of those examples the solar project would be considered a public works projects.... without ANY public funding. 

Assemblymember Carrillo would argue that the ITC constitutes public funding. However, if we explore that notion beyond the surface level, that would mean that basically any private company that gets a tax credit would be participating in public works projects. I think companies like Twitter would rebel against the idea that *California* considers Twitter to be a public works project because they take *federal* tax credits. Twitter along with most large tech companies, would likely flee the state so fast you would be able to find real estate bargains in the Bay Area for the first time in decades!

Back to the bill, it would require double the normal public works reporting since companies would have to report wage data to both the Department of Industrial Relations and the CPUC. And here's why that is important and not just a headache for solar installers:

Any errors, omissions, or any other form of non-compliance in all the bureaucratic filings will **cause the entire project to lose its NEM status and grandfathering under a previous NEM version.**

Under this bill, no one in their right mind is going to want to risk going solar if anytime up to 5 years after installation an audit could mean they lose their ability to exchange bill credits with their utility. This gets even worse if they get grandfathered under a previous NEM version and lose that grandfathering due to an error that may not even be their fault, causing the entire project to become a loss rather than a prudent financial and environmental investment. 

And frustratingly, renters get screwed yet again here because just as the state of California and Biden admin are starting to look at community solar programs that can benefit renters, this bill would kill any community solar projects before they even got off the ground. 

Unsurprisingly, the bill is sponsored by a dark money group, the Coalition of Utility Employees which is funded by PG&amp;E. 

So what can you do about this? 

You can look up your state Assemblymember [using this tool](https://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/), go to their contact page, and then call, email, and/or submit a comment telling them to vote no on AB 2143. The vote may happen this week so make sure to contact your Assemblymember soon!",energy,1661306528
personalfinance,"I'm about to get married, what are some things we need to do?","So I'm about to get married and I'm wondering about what my fiance and I need to do before and shortly after we get married?  We are late 20s-early 30s, he has a professional degree. Here's a quick breakdown of our finances:

&amp;#x200B;

Combined income: \~190K, he makes the large majority of that

Mortgage- $1500, interest rate in low 3s. He's paying this biweekly, we have talked about just making minimums and investing the difference. Plan to stay in this house for at least 10 years. 

Utilities- \~$400-500 a month. Includes cable since we enjoy watching it

Car Payment- $330, could pay off entirely but want to wait

Student loan payments- $100 monthly, $5k total not due until late 2023

No credit card debt, we pay them off monthly.

We are having a wedding soon and still have about $10k due this month.

Groceries and food are minimal, we don't eat out too much.

&amp;#x200B;

For now it works that we keep our finances separate, but use a shared credit card. We've discussed opening a joint bank account at my bank after we get married and contributing some money in there. But until we have children (hopefully Spring/Summer 2024) we will each have our own accounts.

After the chaos of wedding planning, we have talked about seriously getting into investing more as another means of income. We each have a brokerage account, he is more long-term causal investing when I just starting investing last year but keep up on stocks more.

What are we missing? We live well below our means, and both have the same general mindset when it comes to spending &amp; saving. We want to get even more secure in our finances as in the future we would like to make some improvements to our house. We can technically afford them right now, but don't want to spend all that much at once.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

Edit: We both participate in a 401k. His is significantly healthier than mine (he maxed out one year while living at home). He contributes at least 10% while I do 7% with 3% match. I will up this to 10% in a few months. Don't know the exact balances right now.

Between both of us, we have about 60k in our personal brokerage accounts.  We want to start investing more so that if I were to stay home or go part-time for a while it could supplement any lost income. 

Combined we also have over a years worth of gross income saved. We know at this point, it's not doing much good just sitting in our accounts.

 He grew up rather poor and is very conservative with his money. We don't need/want super fancy things. We are treating ourselves to a nice honeymoon (our first real vacation together) and want to travel to Europe next year (probably 5-10k). But other than that, we don't do anything extravagant.",finance,1661306603

personalfinance,"First time car financing, salesman said banks won't give me good rates","Alright quick story. I'm entering the market for a new or used car. I went to a dealer today and when I asked what I could expect for financing rates, the salesman said that my rates will likely be very high since this is my first time financing.

I found that hard to believe. Or at least hard to believe that my rates would be higher than the average buyer. I have an 800+ credit score, have owned my home with a mortgage for 5 years, and have a good paying job with enough savings to pay in cash for a car. Never made a late payment and pay off my credit cards every month in full.

They said they would run the numbers for me and email me the rates tonight for a specific car with the different down payments we discussed. I haven't received an email from the salesman yet, and am skeptical that interest rates and loan terms would really be *that* bad given my credit history and ability to pay. They did not run any credit checks and we didn't check loan terms in the dealership. They just said they would get back to me.

Is this salesman just blowing me off/trying to get more money out of me? Or does not having a financed car in the past really have much of an impact on what terms will be offered?",finance,1661311086

economy,Prayer for the International Atomic Energy Agency,"Already after March 4, when strangers with weapons entered the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency had to (according to the IAEA statute) seek to hold the UNSC meeting due to obvious violation by the RF military forces of global nuclear non-proliferation regimes and the nuclear safety regime. Instead, the IAEA leadership began to engage in pointless discussions with Russian and Ukrainian officials, during which the IAEA director general is still embarrassed to this day to publicly call a spade a spade: Russia is an aggressor state, and Russian soldiers are invaders of Europe's largest operating nuclear power plant, where they violated all existing nuclear safety requirements.

Seeing the futility of the indecisive efforts of the IAEA, on August 11, the UN Secretary General personally appealed to Moscow with a request to immediately stop all hostilities in the immediate vicinity of the ZNPP, not to strike at its facilities and environs, withdraw military personnel and equipment from power units, and refrain from further deployment of forces and not to carry out any actions at the NPP that are not provided for by the nuclear industry protocols (although, de jure, the Russian Federation does not have any legal right towards the plant at all). On August 18, the Russian Foreign Ministry refused the UN Secretary General to create a demilitarized zone around the nuclear power plant seized by Russian troops. Today, the representatives of the Russian Federation in the UN and the IAEA are drowning in lies and does not inspire confidence in anyone in the world.

It is necessary the countries of the anti-war coalition of the West and allies once again unite (in helping Ukraine) and recognize the seizure, mining and constant shelling of the ZNPP by Russian troops as an act of nuclear terrorism!

It is also important that the UN, IAEA, EU and OSCE impose sanctions on the Russian nuclear industry (in particular, deprive the Russian Federation of the right to vote in the IAEA and limit the Russian presence in this agency)!

Today, all hope for preventing an accident at the ZNPP comes from the Ukrainian personnel who continue (for the time being) to work at the plant and in whose hands is the nuclear safety of Ukraine and all of Central and Eastern Europe. However, Russian Kalashnikov assault rifles are hold to the backs of Ukrainian personnel! Therefore, it is urgent to allow an IAEA mission to the nuclear power plant, which will be able to help Ukrainian personnel and personally assess all the actions of the Russians, before it is too late.

The military and politicians from different countries are already modeling the consequences of an explosion at the ZNPP. Thus, the Chair of the House of Commons Defense Select Committee of Great Britain, Tobias Ellwood, said that, in case of a radiation leak due to Russia's actions at the station, NATO should invoke Article 5 of its charter. He was strongly supported by Adam Kinzinger, a member of the US House of Representatives.

Naturally, it is better not to let all negative scenarios come true. Thus, on August 22, a coordination meeting was held between representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and the IAEA, who developed various routes and methods of penetration into the ZNPP. Now everything depends on how the Russians behave and whether the IAEA mission will have an iron will.

In turn, Moscow continues its diplomatic super-dangerous games - it convened a new emergency meeting of the UNSC on August 23 on the situation around the ZNPP, ""in connection with the continuous Ukrainian provocations."" At the same time, the ZNPP issue was already scheduled to be discussed on August 24 at a meeting of the UN Security Council, dedicated to a whole range of topics related to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine.

All that remains for ordinary people in Ukraine, Europe and the whole world is to pray for the IAEA to be effective (although, of course, this is only one of many important factors)!",finance,1661321370
Bitcoin,How to download the entire BTC blockchain in 24h,"I recently wanted to set up a Bitcoin Full Node and therefore checked beforehand how big the blockchain actually is: over 420 GB.

Since this is a considerable size, I researched the fastest way to get the blockchain on my PC and in fact I didn't find a single piece of information that was relatively new. Even the official Bitcoin documentation still mentions around 200 GB and that it could take several weeks **depending on the device.**

Then I found another website that offers full node dumps to speed up the process:  
[https://blockchair.com/dumps#nodes](https://blockchair.com/dumps#nodes)  
The problem: The download is limited to 100 kbit/s, so the download takes more than a month.

I imagine there are enough other people asking the same question, which is why I'm writing this post.

Since I couldn't find any useful NEW info on the internet, and the blockchain dumps I found take too long to download, I took it into my own hands and played around with bitcoind's parameters.

My setup:  
OS: Fedora Linux 36  
CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X  
Memory: 32GB  
External Disk: Samsung Portable SSD T7 (1 TB)  
Bandwidth: max. 50 MBit/s (mobile internet)

My goal:  
To download the entire blockchain to the external SSD including creation of all available **indices** for development purposes **(you don't need them to just run a full node).**

With this command I was able to download the entire blockchain and create all indices in almost exactly 24 hours:

`bitcoind --datadir=&lt;path-to-external-ssd&gt; -blockfilterindex=1 -txindex=1 -coinstatsindex=1 -dbcache=16384 -daemon`

Of course, the command and the resulting performance only refers to my setup. You'll definitely need to adjust the -dbcache parameter if you don't have 32GB of RAM available. The -dbcache parameter is set in MB and can be between 4 and 16384.  
After downloading the blockchain, you can set the parameter back to the default value by simply removing the parameter.  
Furthermore, you will definitely **get even better performance** if you **remove** the **index parameters** \- if you don't need them for any development purposes, feel free to remove the parameters from the command.

Finally, an explanation of my used parameters for completeness:  
**-datadir=**&lt;dir&gt;  
*Specify data directory. This specifies the whole "".bitcoin"" data directory, so if you e.g just want to have the ""blocks"" subdir on a different location, you have to use -blocksdir. There are a few more dirs to set if you want, just look in the --help of bitcoind.*

**-blockfilterindex=**&lt;type&gt;  
*Maintain an index of compact filters by block (default: 0, values: basic). If &lt;type&gt; is not supplied or if &lt;type&gt; = 1, indexes for all known types are enabled. Only set this for development purposes - it's not needed if you just want to run a full node.*

**-txindex**  
*Maintain a full transaction index, used by the getrawtransaction rpc call (default: 0). Only set this for development purposes - it's not needed if you just want to run a full node.*

**-coinstatsindex**  
*Maintain coinstats index used by the gettxoutsetinfo RPC (default: 0). Only set this for development purposes - it's not needed if you just want to run a full node.*

**-dbcache=**&lt;n&gt;  
*Maximum database cache size &lt;n&gt; MiB (4 to 16384, default: 450). In addition, unused mempool memory is shared for this cache (see* ***-maxmempool***).

**-daemon**  
*Run in the background as a daemon and accept commands (default: 0). If you run it as a daemon, you can check the progress in the debug.log in the .bitcoind dir.*

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I can help some searchers with this post. If you managed to get even more performance with further tweaks, please write in the comments, I would be very interested to know!

UPDATE:  
u/igadjeed said he have read that 16GB isn't the limit on the dbcache size and that 24GB is the best option because that's enough RAM to store the entire uncompressed UTXO set (see the comment here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/wwdrmu/comment/ill3m3n/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/wwdrmu/comment/ill3m3n/?context=3)).

I tried this out and it actually can be set to 24GB without bitcoind complaining about it being above the limit mentioned in the man page. I can't tell the performance difference in terms of downloading time because my blockchain was already synced at this time. But eventually someone has to setup a full node and has enough RAM available to try this out and post the experience in the comments.

UPDATE #2:  
Because this blows up a bit, I want to clarify that my approach of downloading the blockchain is for development purposes only, so if you're looking for a how-to that helps you setup a full node that is contributing to the network, this is not the guide you're looking for. I didn't point that out clear enough in my OP. However, for a fast initialization this can be used.",cryptocurrency,1661329128

business,Is it even possible to start investing with a low income?,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

Like many people, sometimes, I face some financial difficulties. To be honest, I've got sick of it! I've got sick of all these uncertainties in the future, and sometimes I urgently need cash.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I've tried to do my best and followed different rules. For instance, 10% of my pay cheque each month went to my savings account. But inflation ate all my savings. Keeping a deposit in the bank doesn't guarantee you financial stability. Besides, the interest rate on savings accounts in the UK is not enough. You can't wake up a billionaire in one day.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, my car broke down, and I needed to fix it ASAP. Because I live too far away from my work and the nearest train station to get to work. I need my car just to feed my family. I had to withdraw almost all my money from my savings account, and now they are empty. I'm not even talking about the current price rise. We are again in this situation where we can barely make ends meet.

&amp;#x200B;

I googled some info on how to start making more money and ran into this website — [https://www.moneyunder30.com/start-investing-with-little-money](https://www.moneyunder30.com/start-investing-with-little-money). I actually liked the idea of investing. But has anyone ever tried investing with small amounts in the UK? Does this thing really work in this country?

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard that in the US, investing is a big thing. Many people now try not only to put some money into a savings account but also buy different shares, corporate and governmental bonds, and invest in different projects. It helps make a decent income and save some money on retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

I also wanna try something like this. But, as you can guess, I have only one source of income. So, I'm looking for investment opportunities with a low entry level. I can't afford to buy thousands of Apple shares and live a carefree life. Currently, my aim is to make enough money to feel confident the next day and stand on both feet. While now, as I said before, I can barely make ends meet.",finance,1661332580

personalfinance,Is this a good move?,"I drive a trucks, locally.

At my current job, I can make anywhere from $1100 to $1380 max gross weekly, and to get that, I'd have to work 5 to 6 FULL 8 to 12hr days a week (most of them 12hrs - port is always a cluster). Before certain changes (the job wants to make, so they could save money), it was possible to get 13 loads to gross $1520. Loads pay $110 for the first 10 loads, anything after that is an additional $30. With those aforementioned changes, it's pretty much impossible to do more than 12 loads, limiting my pay to just $1380. With this, I'm still able to save around $1300/m. My fiancee works too, and we split our bills. With me paying the major bills. But if push came to shove, and I had to foot the entire bill, I could still save about 500 to 600 a month. Also note, I dont currently have a car. She and I share one at the moment because it just makes more sense for our current siituation. So by no means are we struggling. But we do want to get a house soon...preferably in 2 years - or at least have the money put up for a nice down payment. 

So anyway, another job an hour away, more specifically 70 miles away, pays 27.50/hr + overtime after 40hrs. They work a minimum of 60 hours a week up to 70 hours weekly. Those extra 20 -30 hours are all overtime grossing us between $1800 to somewhere around $2300 weekly. These will be 12 hour work days (which I'm pretty much already accustomed to working). The only thing to get used to is the 2 hour commute back and forth to work. But I could do it, I've done it for much less money back in the day. I could do it at least for the next 2 years. They've already hired me, I just have to give them a start date. 

If I take this job, obviously I'm gonna have to get a car. Which I'm willing to do for a much better paying job which brings me to the next part:

I've never financed a car. Every car I've bought has been cash, so I don't have any car credit. So I understand why I may not get the *best* interest rate. But I do have good credit at least. 

I've been shopping around for a new Corolla. And I've talked to various dealerships. Some trying to sell it for $30k (MSRP is around 21k - other fees like doc fees, GAVAVT fees, tag and all that bringing it to 26k, but dealership fees being damn near $3k), others trying to sell it for a 28k (with much lower dealership fees). 

But the best I've found so far is a one for 26k. There are no extra dealership fees. And I've been approved for a 6.8 interest rate for it, but according to them, there's a promotion with Toyota that nets the customer a 3.9 interest rate if their credit is above 700. Mine is 720 - 730. So the projected payments are $374/m for 72 months, if it's actually a 3.9 rate. And probably around the $400/m range if it's 6.8 rate (which I'm expecting it to be). Either way, I came in prepared to pay $500/m. So anything lower is better, IMO. Also, there are no prepayment penalties, so that's a plus if I decide to pay it off early. 

So with all that, a new job with better pay (up to 120k gross yearly) plus a new car payment (and the expenses that come with the car), I could still make and save a great deal more money than where I currently am.

In your opinion, is this a move I should make? I know I might've left some info out, but if it's important, let me know and I'll add it in. But if you read all of this I appreciate your time.",finance,1661337219

UniSwap,What you should know about Alpha Homora Protocol,"In the world of DeFi, there are certain tactics that enable users to put their cryptocurrencies at work and generate income. One such strategy is yield farming, which is the process of lending or borrowing crypto on a DeFi platform in exchange for cryptocurrencies.

While yield farming alone can be quite lucrative, users can earn even more by leveraging their yield farming positions. This is where Alpha Homora comes in handy.

**What is Alpha Homora?**

In a nutshell, Alpha Homora is a DeFi protocol that allows those participating in DeFi yield farming to “amplify” their positions. Developed by Alpha Finance Lab and built on the Ethereum blockchain, Alpha Homora is the first DeFi project to bring leverage into the picture for DeFi yield farmers.

Aside from yield farming, Alpha Homora is also a leveraged liquidity-providing protocol. The project supports lending and allows users to earn high interest on their crypto loans. It also allows users to become liquidators and bounty hunters.

Overall, Alpha Homora aims to capture two market gaps. First, many crypto holders are lending their assets at low rates. And second, many yield farmers are searching for higher-yield farming APY.

**Alpha Homora v2**

The initial version of Alpha Homora, called Alpha Homora v1, launched in October 2021. Following the success of the first version, the team started the development of Alpha Homora v2. Characterized by strong partnerships, the second version of the protocol allows yield farmers to take advantage of significantly more leverage than its predecessor. 

Moreover, Alpha Homora v2 uses CREAM V2’s liquidity to take on leverage for its users. This allows Alpha Homora v2 to take out loans with fewer collateral requirements, resulting in more leverage for the protocol’s yield farmers and higher interest rates for CREAM V2 users.

The second version of the protocol also allows leveraged yield farmers to take leverage on a basket of assets including ETH, AAVE, CRV, LINK, MKR, WBTC, stablecoins, and other assets. Users can open up to 9x positions when leveraging on stablecoins. There is also a flexible leveraged yield farming option, which enables users to borrow multiple assets, re-leverage, and deleverage their positions easily.

**Yield Farming**

Alpha Homora is best known for its leveraged yield farming option. To start farming, all users need to do is connect their wallet, deposit funds, and determine their leverage.

It is worth noting that users have the option to choose between Alpha Homora v1 and v2. In the first version, there are currently 42 pools in total. ETH/USDT (Sushi), ETH/USDC (Sushi), ETH/DAI (Sushi), ETH/WBTC (Sushi), and ETH/SUSD (Sushi) pools currently offer the highest leverage in the v1, allowing users to leverage yield farming positions up to 2.5x.

On the other hand, Alpha Homora v2 enables leveraged yield farming of liquidity pools on several prominent DEXes, including Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap. Currently, DAI/ETH (Uniswap V2), USDC/ETH (Sushiswap), and DAI/ETH (Sushiswap) pools offer the highest leverage in the v2, allowing users to leverage yield farming positions up to 3.1x.

One distinct difference between yield farming in Alpha Homora v1 and v2 is that the first version automatically reinvests farmed ALPHA tokens to yield higher profit while the second version does not do this.

**Earn High Interest Rates by Lending Crypto Assets**

Alpha Homora enables users to earn interest on crypto loans. In Alpha Homora v1, there is an interest-bearing Ethereum vault, which allows users to deposit ETH to the Alpha Homora Bank and receive ibETH tokens in return. IbETH tokens are tradable and continually earn interest for the users.

Through Alpha Homora v2, users have the option to lend a total of 12 crypto assets, which include ETH, DAI, USDT, USDC, YFI, SNX, and more. The lending interest rate comes from the borrowing interest rate that leveraged yield farmers pay for borrowing the assets.

**Role in Investment Products**

Alpha Homora plays a key role in a number of CeDeFi investment products developed by [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) (custodial “CeDeFi” investment platform that uses strategies that combine working with digital assets and various protocols to create profitable intuitive investment tools). For instance, it is used in “Soft Long on ETH” and “Soft Short on ETH” strategies to create 2x and 1x leveraged positions on a basket of ETH-Stable liquidity pools.

*The “Soft Long on ETH” strategy aims to generate yield (target 45% ROI) through ETH-USDC liquidity pool and price appreciation of ETH as borrowed USDC is converted to ETH. The “Soft Short on ETH” strategy seeks to generate yield (target 25% ROI) through ETH-USDC liquidity pool and price depreciation of ETH due to ETH being borrowed while half of the position is converted to USDC.*",cryptocurrency,1661340484
solar,Having a hard time justifying the cost.,"I've gotten a few quotes for a residential 8000-9000kW system all of which quote a ""4-6 year return"" of investment but according to my own math I'm seeing at least 14 years. I don't even know if I'll be in this house that long.

We don't use that much electricity annually, about 4400kWh. I do see an EV in the future which is why I went down this path of solar initially. If I double our annual usage to account for an EV there's still a 10+ year break even.

I've included SRECs, 30% Fed tax deduction, and energy buy back and I still can't achieve the quoted break even times even with being pretty liberal on the expected annual PV production of about 10,000kWh.

Is there something I'm missing? Is labor just that much? Even DIY I'm still looking at 9 year break even points. I guess if we expect to be here another 15 years that would make sense but I'm almost convinced it's not worth the cost. Is that safe to believe?",energy,1661342070
personalfinance,Federal Student Loan Monthly Payment Increased?,"I was looking at my student loans (through Great Lakes) to see how much I owed before this hypothetical 10k cancellation and I noticed that my minimum monthly payment went from $166 pre-pandemic to $220ish now. I only made a few payments over the past couple of years.

It's manageable for me but I'm wondering why it jumped up. It's not income-based, as far as I can tell. Is it just because I didn't knock down the balance significantly while the end of the loan term was still approaching?",finance,1661344536

# [Stock futures flat following the S&amp;P 500′s third straight losing day](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/23/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors await more guidance from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on the central bank’s tightening path.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were all roughly flat.
*****
&gt; Both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 declined for a third straight session Tuesday amid relatively thin trading volumes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished Tuesday little changed. The S&amp;P 500 is about flat on the month after rallying more than 9% in July.
*****
&gt; The three-day Jackson Hole economic symposium starts Thursday with Powell slated to speak Friday morning. Fed watchers expect him to reinforce the central bank’s goal of squashing inflation and keeping expectations about future prices gains in check.
*****
&gt; “Financial markets will remain in choppy waters until Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on Friday,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “He may struggle to convince markets that he is comfortable with tightening policy and triggering a recession. The economy is clearly slowing but it is still too early for the Fed to signal that they will be less aggressive with tightening policy.”
*****
&gt; Investors will also monitor incoming data to gauge the health of the economy. Durable goods and pending home sales are on deck for Wednesday.

personalfinance,Best place to store my savings as a placement student?,"I (21F) am on my placement year. I just finished second year of university and after I complete this year, I will have one more year of university left. I'm on an annual salary of £18,750 and take home around £1600 a month after tax and NI. I live at home with my parents and just travel to work if needs be although I'm working from home a lot so I'm not out a lot of expenses. I have £12K in a savings account at the minute with AIB although the interest rate is not great at all. I've been building this up over the last 4 years from summer jobs, a part time job I had during university and some money that was left over from my student loans.
I was thinking of investing some of the money but am not sure if I'm willing to risk losing anything just yet. Instead, a relative told me to put some of the money that I've already saved into a cash ISA and find a better regular savers account. I found that the close brothers are doing the best interest rate at the minute for the Cash ISA but it's a minimum of £10K and I don't know if it's a good idea for me to putting that much of my savings into a Cash ISA that I can't touch for at least a year. 
I've never really thought about my finances before so I don't really have a clue, but now that I am earning more money on my placement year I definitely want to build up my savings for after I graduate. 
My long term saving goals are to buy a nicer car and have a good deposit for a mortgage eventually. 
Long, long term goal is to retire early (as I'm sure is everyone's goal 😂) 
Anyway, would anyone have any advice on what I should do (invest or save) or what the best banks would be at the minute?",finance,1661364409
personalfinance,How does this scam work?,"I bought something from an amazon 3rd party seller a few weeks ago with free shipping and they sent it via FedEx but it was sent to a completely wrong address nearly 200 miles away.  I informed the seller and later that day they apologized and sent me a refund, so I didn't lose any money.

However looking more closely at the weight and dimensions, it was impossible that they even sent the correct item. Also many other customers left 1-star reviews stating that similar things happened to them. And it appears that Amazon has shut down this store.

This may seem like a weird question but I feel like it shouldn't be possible so I will ask if it is.

I live in Turkey and I have around 200.000 dollars. If I put that money into a bank account, I earn around 5.000 dollars per month since our interest rates are very high. I'm planning to move another country, so let's say I leave my money in Turkey, then every month I send that money to the bank account in the country I live in. I would be able to live there without any issue with 5.000 dollars.

So it makes sense but I feel like, if that was possible, foreigners would put their money into banks in Turkey and they would get lots of interest. Because in western countries (or the one I will be moving) you have very little interest rate.

personalfinance,401k loan to get around contribution limit?,"I dont know if this is feasible or crazy or what.  But, here's what I was thinking:

I have a Roth 401k that I know I'll hit the max contribution amount for.  So, what I was thinking of doing, is taking a loan out for 12,000 in January, immediately depositing it into mine and my spouse's IRAs, with a 12 month repayment term.

Basically, assuming my current contribution amount is $50,000 at the beginning of the year, I'm thinking the math would look like this:
401k contributions at end of year: 50000 - 12000 + (12000 * 1.0575) + 20500 = 71,190
IRA contributions: +12000

It looks like with the interest rate I'd be able to beat the max contribution amount by $690 doing that. And since the money is immediately going into another retirement account, it wouldn't be off the market.  Is there a downside I'm not seeing?

economy,Northwestern university and the City of Evanston launch guaranteed income program to address economic insecurity locally.,"This Guaranteed Income Pilot Program will provide 150 individuals with a $500 monthly stipend for one year to use as they see fit. An innovative joint project by the City of Evanston and Northwestern University

An innovative joint project by the City of Evanston and Northwestern University is part of a growing movement to study the impact of guaranteed income. 

The Guaranteed Income Pilot Program will provide 150 individuals with a $500 monthly stipend for one year to use as they see fit.

Northwestern has provided $400,000 in funding for the pilot program, while additional funds come from the American Rescue Plan, the City of Evanston and the Evanston Community Foundation.

Northwestern’s Jonathan Guryan, a professor in the School of Education and Social Policy and a faculty fellow in the Institute for Policy Research, is leading a team of graduate students — Phoebe Lin, Claire Mackevicius and Sheridan Fuller — in a study that measures the pilot program’s impact and provides data to inform future poverty reduction efforts.

“Northwestern is thrilled to partner with the City of Evanston to launch its first Guaranteed Income Pilot Program,” said Dave Davis, senior executive director of Neighborhood and Community Relations at Northwestern. “Northwestern is committed to fostering innovative solutions to our city’s most pressing challenges, namely inequality and economic insecurity. Guaranteed Income programs treat recipients with dignity in determining how best to spend the money.”

The project currently seeks applicants from three demographic categories: 18-to-24-year-old adults, seniors age 62+ and undocumented residents -- whose current incomes fall below the poverty level.

Applications are open now through Aug. 29.

“This exciting partnership will allow us to put cash in the hands of residents who need it most — and it puts Evanston where it belongs, at the forefront of innovation in progressive policy,” said Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss.  

Cicely Fleming, former 9th Ward alderperson and an early proponent of the project, believes the program is important both for what it does and what it does not do.

The program will enable recipients to use the stipend toward things they don’t have cash for. For example, an individual may receive a childcare subsidy but be unable to cover a medical co-pay. 

“People don’t go to the doctor because they’re afraid of bills,” Fleming said. “There are so many costs that federal and local support programs don’t cover.”

At the same time, because Illinois law does not consider payments from such programs to be income, they will not jeopardize most other government benefits.

vet,"Is it time, or is it too soon?","Hello...

I need some guidance and advice as I'm very torn on what to do. 

I have a 15 and half year out french bulldog/rat terrier mix.  She's still eating mostly normally (she has days she won't eat, or that I need to wet her food for her to eat), gets up the stairs (a little slower, but still makes it) and is happy and excited to see me when I come home.

But she's declining...  She started having small focal seizures about 4 years ago.  They were just on the left side of her face at first, and I kept note of them, but they didn't progress until about 2 years ago.  July of 2020 she had 2 grand mal seizures that needed a trip to the ER vet and she was started on phenobarbital.  The running theory is that she has a brain tumor, but I don't see the point in paying for $3000 MRI when I'm not going to treat a brain tumor.  Since 2020 she has had 2 more big seizures.  At a point last year her focal seizures were getting worse, I took her to the vet and her phenobarbital levels were on the low side of normal so we increased her dose.  She's had one more big seizure since then (that I've seen).  

She's not holding her urine as well as she use to.  I have a reusable pee pad down all the time by the back door and then I put disposable ones on top of that.  When I'm gone for work, she uses it a few times.  Sometimes she'll go all day and be fine, other times there are multiple spots on it.  Sometimes when I'm home she uses it, even though she's just been out 20 mins prior.  She started peeing in the bed with me a few months ago.  I've resorted to using a king size waterproof blanket for the whole bed, and then on her side there is an additional reusable pad and smaller waterproof blanket.  I'm not sure if her peeing in the bed at night are seizures or if she's just incontinent.

Starting at about 4pm every day she gets restless.  She just paces back and forth between the kitchen and the living room.  It doesn't matter how many times I let her outside or if she's been fed or not.  I have taken to going to bed at 8pm because she will lay down to sleep in bed and be down for the night.  

I've noticed lately that she is much thinner than she has been. I just looked at pics from a year ago compared to today, and it's very noticeable.  She's still eating, but seems to be losing weight. 

I have spoken to my vet, the last time being in June when she was being treated for yet another UTI.  At that time he said that he didn't think it was time for me to have to put her down yet.  Looking at my quality of life:  I'm always worried that she's going into status and I'm going to have to put her down suddenly and traumatically, I'm tired of having to go to bed so early every night to get her to settle down,  I'm tired of cleaning up pee in my house and my bed and I just want this to end on my terms.  However, I want it to be time as well.  So, is it time or is it too soon?

personalfinance,Erroneously filed an amended (1040-X) return due to a mistake on my original return -- it's been 6 mos and I still haven't gotten my return,"Excuse my throwaway, thank you for reading.

I'm just going to type this chronologically to avoid a long post or confusion:

**3/3/22** - I filed my state and federal return electronically through TaxAct.com. State return was a couple hundred, and federal return was $12,211 -- I thought that was a little high, but I'd already gone over everything three times, so I submitted it.

**3/8/22** - State refund hits my checking account.

**3/22/22** - Still no federal refund, so I'm thinking I screwed something up. I go back and look and sure enough, I accidentally claimed $0 for economic impact payments, when in reality we received $5600. So, I filed an amended return that reflects this, and my refund is corrected to $9,411.

**4/25/22** - Still nothing. Where's My Refund? tool on IRS site says we can't find your return.

**5/12/22** - I find the Where's My Amended Refund? tool and use it -- but it hasn't been 16 weeks since I filed, so it tells me to wait.

**6/23/22** - It's been 16 weeks, I use the Where's My Amended Refund? tool again -- it says ""Your amended return was received on March 22, 2022. However, it has not been processed. We apologize for any inconvenience. Please call 800-829-0582, extension 623, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. You will need a copy of your amended return.""

**6/24/22** - I call the above number with the above extension. It says call wait times have exceeded the limit and hangs up on me. So, I contact TaxAct -- great customer service btw, highly recommend -- and the person I speak with says I shouldn't have filed an amended return for that issue, but now that I already have, there's not a lot I can do because my refund is already being held. She gives me a fax number to send a note to, which basically described this situation briefly and asks for my refund to be released. I get no response at all.

**7/23/22** - I call for probably the 6th time since March, and finally get a Real Live Person Oh My God A Human with the IRS, and she says she'll ""send a note to the processor"" and that I have to wait 30 days before calling back again.

**8/23/22** - It's been 30 days, I call again. Eight separate times, different times of day, different days of the week every time. Every time, I get a message that the wait time has exceeded the limit and the line disconnects.

I'm a full time student and I cannot overemphasize how much $9,411 means to me, my spouse, and my children.

Going by the recently sold they are trying to flip the avatars for 40-600% profit or higher *in this bear market*. It hasn't been working out so well as many aiming to the high end of the scale have been forced to cut their aspirational prices by easily over 100% after re-listing and the vast majority still haven't any offers. Sales have been pretty weak with between 2-6 sales per day across the four collections. Just days ago most avatars would go for between 0.03 - 0.07 roughly on average and prices are to be on the downtrend.

In two or three days I've seen the price floor generally across the board lose -0.1 ETH. Meme Team is particular price floor fell by about 0.3ETH. The recently sold prices are falling by around 0.1--0.2ETH per day over the last few days as well. 

To me it seems like you'd need another Fed put or some stimmy checks to pump up this market. I guess it's also still early as people are yet to receive their avatars. If you are still waiting in expectation to receive one, you probably won't rush to buy another one. But that might also just mean more avatars to flood the market and push down prices even more.

investing,Why would you use FCASH instead of SPAXX or FZFXX for Fidelity core position?,"I'm sitting on more cash than normal right now.  I sold about 400k worth of my investments in December so I'd have enough money for a house down payment (still looking for one).  I just realized that my Fidelity core position is ""FCASH"" which is described as a ""free credit balance"" and shows a current interest rate of 1.19% as of August 1st.  It gives options to change to two different Money Market accounts SPAXX (shows a 7 day yield of 1.42%) or FZFXX (shows a 7 day yield of 1.49%).

vet,cat with bronchopneumonia,"My cat has been breathing heavily for about a week now and the vet diagnosed bronchopneumonia, gave us antibiotic injections and told us to do aerosol three times a day. We have an old machine that makes a lot of noise but can't afford anything else. For the first three days everything went well and the cat was recovering, slowly, but recovering. Yesterday nobody could find him during the afternoon (it's impossible to keep him inside the house) and we had to skip one aerosol out of the three he had to do. In the evening we found him and did it to him but as he got out he refused the food treat and ran under one of the beds, he kept breathing heavily all night long and in the morning he refused to get out, I noticed the box we put him for the aerosol was wet. He pissed himself. I cleaned it up and forced the cat back into it to do the aerosol as planned but he wet it again and as it finished he ran under the bad again, on the edge of panting with his mouth open, which worries me.
I think he's stressed out by the sound of the aerosol machine but I can't afford anything else and if I stop the treatment he's lilely to die. I hope I'll be able to consult the vet soon but at the moment Idk what to do. I think his nose is stuffed but I don't know how to clean it because he refuses any help. He barely eats and drinks water and I think it's because he can't smell the food and he's stressed. What can I do?",cryptocurrency,1661418530

Is anyone aware of a good product that allows us to manage our releases. It should support stuff like RPM repos, Docker, ..., Raw assets.

* Interaction via API to be able to push
* Packages  
(To provide native integration at the customer site)
   * Maven, Gradle, ... (all things Java)
   * Docker Images
   * Python Packages, Go, npm
   * RPM

* Customer entitlements  
We want to be able to give credentials/token to our customers so they can access things from their end

economy,Cui prodest?,"On August 20, 2022, a car explosion near Moscow killed Daria Dugina, de jure, a journalist and right-wing activist, and, de facto, an ardent neo-fascist, advocating a swift Russia’s military onslaught on Ukraine and the ruthless extermination of all Ukrainians. Representatives of the Russian political circles and the pro-government beau monde, who came to the funeral, unanimously repeated exactly what D. Dugin had called for in recent months - it is necessary to revive the empire under the slogan “One country. One president. One victory!” (reminds me of something, doesn't it?). With this aim it would be necessary to intensify terror, reject any tolerance and recognize as an “enemy of the people” everyone who does not share the values of the “Russian world”. At the funeral of a 29-year-old girl, the word “terror” was most often heard, which, despite the situation, was pronounced by those present in cheerful, sonorous voices. This whole situation involuntarily brings us back to the comparatively recent past of the other two totalitarian empires.

So, in February 1933, the German National Socialists set fire to the parliament building, but they blamed the Communists for setting the Reichstag on fire and used this event to obtain emergency powers and crack down on their political opponents. In turn, J. Stalin, although he began a “general purge” in the ranks of the Communist Party in 1933, skillfully exploited the assassination of S. Kirov (most likely, he himself ordered the liquidation of an influential ally) in December 1934 to justify the aggravation of political repressions and spreading them to all segments of the population of the USSR. So, as the ancient Romans taught us, in unclear situations you should always ask yourself: Cui prodest, that is, for whose benefit is this being done?

The circumstances of the explosion of D. Dugina's car are not fully understood. On the day of her death, she took part in the Tradition festival in the Moscow region, which promotes patriarchal-family (that is, anti-LGBT) and right-wing conservative values, along with her father, Alexander Dugin, and their friend, Konstantin Malofeev. They returned to Moscow together, but in different cars. The target of the assassination attempt could be both all three of them at once, or only one.

A. Dugin never had that serious influence that is often attributed to him, however, he managed to earn a lot of symbolic capital as a right-wing conservative thinker. Since 2002, he was well received in the Kremlin's inner circle and has always had funding for his projects, the main one being the Eurasian Youth Union social movement. Criticizing the Kremlin for the lack of a state ideology in the 2000s, instead of communism he proposed the idea of the “Russian world”, and instead of the theory of class struggle, he proposed the opposition of some special spirituality that lives in Russia to the complete lack of spirituality of the Western world. At the geopolitical level, he advocated the unification of all former Soviet republics within the framework of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).

K. Malofeev is a Kremlin-controlled oligarch and one of the most active sponsors of Orthodox fundamentalists and of any activity related to the construction of the “Russian World”. In particular, he financially and organizationally helped to implement the so-called “Russian Spring” in the Crimea and Donbas in 2014. By the way, A. Dugin worked for two years as the editor-in-chief on K. Malofeev’s personal TV channel “Tsargrad TV”.

Naturally, the murder of any of the three mentioned persons should have caused a huge public and political outcry. And, of course, those emotions that should have automatically arisen after the explosion of a car among the Russians - and they actually arose, demanded revenge and terror towards all opponents of the “Russian world”, and the war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Perhaps the young neo-fascist died by accident, as a result of close contact with the true target of the assassination attempt. But, it is possible that she was not so pity to kill as the court ideologist or the puppet billionaire. In any case, it was decided to make one of them (or all three) a “sacred sacrifice” at the altar of the empire under construction in order to “tighten the screws”, rally the population around the leader, increase hatred towards Ukrainians and encourage general mobilization.

The version of the RF FSB that the murder of D. Dugina was organized by the Ukrainian special services will seem absolutely senseless to anyone who carefully study it. For whose benefit was this done?

As you know, the leadership of the Russian Federation is not unified in the matter of confrontation with the anti-Putin coalition of Western countries. One “Kremlin tower” stands for a ruthless war to a victorious end, including the accession of Moldova and Georgia to the EAEU (Secretary of the Security Council N. Patrushev, oligarch Y. Kovalchuk). Another “tower” (Prime Minister M. Mishustin, Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration D. Kozak) proposes to end the war with Ukraine and restore dialogue with the West. Probably, the “tower of the Kremlin hawks” decided to strengthen its position and radicalize public sentiments by carrying out such a “dirty” operation as a demonstration of eliminating a well-known person and blaming the Ukrainians with the hands of the Russian special services. 

Well, the presence of various groups of influence around the Russian president gives some hope that the group that seeks to return Russia to the framework of civilized humanity will be able to turn the tide of events in their favor and defeat the crazy “Kremlin hawks”.",finance,1661425784

stocks,DCA or Lump Sum? How long a DCA horizon?,"Following several mistakes that shrinked my portfolio by 20%, I have decided to sell everything apart from a few positions that I believe are worth the risk (BABA, MVST). 

I am now holding 60k in Cash and I’m already in a 89%/11% allocation of a global developed markets ETF (IWDA) and Emerging Markets ETF (EMIM) for around 14k. I want to throw the remaining 60k in this allocation. On top of that, I have around 2.5k savings per month to add on. 

Research has shown that investing lump sum is a better strategy 75% of the time for an 100% equity portfolio. But when I ask myself “does this feel like we are living somewhere in the top 75percentile of the time with double digit inflation, rising interest rates, ongoing war, threat of another war, insane energy prices”, the answer is no. I might be wrong, but I strongly feel that if anything, we are easily at the bottom 25th percentile of times. 

So, unless someone has a strong case against it, I want to slowly DCA the extra 60k. But how long a time horizon should I set to do so?",finance,1661429199

 ""You can't just print money and grow an economy past its fundamentals,"" the market historian and newsletter writer said. ""They just bubbled up financial assets,"" he continued, referring to the Federal Reserve.

Dent accused the Fed of artificially shoring up the US economy since the onset of the financial crisis nearly 15 years ago. He asserted the US government's aid packages during the COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated the problem.

""We had this first crash, a tepid bounce, and now we'll have another one of the same magnitude,"" he said, adding that he expected the Nasdaq to tank by over 40% to 7,350 points by the end of this year or early 2023.

solar,Solar Costs and PPW,"I've been looking at solar for my house in a southern state. I don't want to give up info, so I'll keep it pretty generic.

How are people calculating PPW? Specifically, is that after or before the tax credit? 

My leading quote right now is $21,312 for 6.7 KW. this is about 100% offset. This is the cash price, before any tax credits.

The loan price is $25,575, at 0.99% interest for 20 years. I know that this is basically 4k difference for them to buy down the interest rate of the loan, but considering I can't pay for this outright (even after the tax credit), the loan is really my only option. The monthly would be about $83, which my averaged (across 12 months) on electric is $98. then I have meter fees of around $15. There are no SRECs in my state.

Currently, the math works out this way:  


Cash Price: $3.18/W, before Tax Credit. $2.22/W after tax credit

Loan Price: $3.81/W before Tax Credit, $2.67/W after tax credit

I understand the loan is the expensive part of this bit, but my other similar options were like a 4-5% loan with no buy-down rates, but a considerably higher monthly rate. If you knock the 30% from the tax credit off of the loan as well, it comes to $2984 for the price of them to buy down the loan, so the tax credit is saving me some there as well, but it seems steep either way.    


My bill looks like it will be about the same if I take this avenue, but if I plan to move in the next 5-7 years, I may not get the same amount out of house value. However, in my state, the local utility plans to rate hike pretty aggressively soon (due to their lack of planning for the 2021 winter storms), so I feel like I'm at a stand-still here. I know there's no ""right"" option here, but this has been the lowest I've been quoted so far. Should I continue to shop around?",energy,1661438641

stocks,Brookfield investing 15 Billion into the new INTC foundry is the equivalent of them purchasing 11% of all intel shares.,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-brookfield-invest-up-30-bln-arizona-chip-factories-2022-08-23/

Intel, Brookfield to invest up to $30 bln in Arizona chip factories

Aug 23 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Canada's Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO) on Tuesday agreed to jointly fund up to $30 billion for the U.S. chipmaker's leading-edge chip factories in Arizona, fueling Intel's ambition to bring more chip production onshore without weighing on its balance sheet.

Brookfield's infrastructure affiliate will invest up to $15 billion for a 49% stake in the expansion project, while Intel will retain majority ownership and operating control of the two chip factories meant to make advanced chips in Chandler, Arizona.

The investment is an expansion of an agreement signed by Intel and Brookfield in February to explore finance options to help fund new Intel manufacturing sites.

The two companies didn't disclose specific terms. David Zinsner, Intel's finance chief, told analysts the interest rate was between 4.4% and 8.5%, which is more expensive than debt financing but cheaper than equity financing.

For private capital providers like Brookfield, foundries represent a cash-flow generating investment opportunity resembling private equity investments in infrastructure, such as data centers and fiber, signaling investors' long-term confidence in semiconductor demand.

Through the deal, Intel could preserve debt capacity for other priorities with financing commitment for a multi-year project, while maintaining operational control.

Zinsner expects this could be the first of many similar financing structures the semiconductor industry explores.

The deal also comes after U.S. President Joe Biden this month signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, which included provision of $52.7 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research.

Zinsner said the arrangement between the companies ""builds on the momentum from the recent passage of the CHIPS Act in the U.S.""

After Pat Gelsinger took over the reins of Intel in early 2021, the company announced multibillion-dollar investments across Europe and in the United States.

They were aimed at increasing Intel's chip production after the industry went through an over two-year long supply crunch that derailed production of cars to computers.

Last month, Intel slashed its annual forecasts due to falling PC demand. read more

personalfinance,Sell my new car for a used car?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

My wife and I are notoriously indecisive people and I’d like to get some opinions on our predicament. 

I just got a remote job and my wife works about a mile from our house. We have a used Honda that is probably close to being on its last leg and a new Subaru (2021) that we’ve had about a year. 

We are considering selling the Subaru (we received a fair offer) and the Honda, and just buying a moderately priced used car (for example we found a Toyota with about 100,000 miles for ~$8,000 [in CA]). 

My logic is that if we don’t really drive much why would we pay 1) a car payment with a 4% interest rate, and 2) higher car  insurance premiums. 

But the other half of me is telling me we should have a car that we know is reliable just in case.

personalfinance,"Should I keep driving my shabby but mostly reliable 2004 Honda Pilot with tons of miles, or worth incurring debt for an upgrade?","Looking for some outside perspective. I've gotten a bit emotionally invested, so it's a bit hard for me to see the issues clearly.

**TL;DR** \-- is it worth taking on debt during a tough-ish financial time to upgrade to a safer and nicer family vehicle, even though my old shabby one is working mostly fine (for now)?

I am married with two young children. My wife and I are both young professionals, both making low six figure salaries. We both commute \~25 mins for work. We both have good job security.

I'm currently driving a 2004 Honda Pilot with just under 200,000 miles on it. It mostly serves me just fine. My wife recently bought a 2018 minivan that is our family vehicle and what we use for longer trips. My Pilot is mostly just a commuter vehicle, although I do tote the kids around a good bit since my wife and I are often juggling schedules. While I don't put a ton of miles on my vehicle, I do value having the space for two car-seats plus some cargo.

About six weeks ago, my Pilot gave me a scare. My alternator crapped out on me with my toddler in the car, and we started stalling out and eventually broke down. We stayed safe, but it gave me a scare, and it could have ended poorly if it happened on the interstate. That day, I committed to buying a new car -- I was terrified of my car breaking down again with my kids in the car, possibly in a much less safe context. I ordered a new Subaru Forester (trim is one step up from the base) which is slated to arrive in September. I didn't have to put down a deposit and I can back out at any time. I have a hookup with the Subaru VIP program and expect to pay ""invoice price,"" so it should be a fairly good deal (as in, somewhere like $30,000 --still a major financial commitment, obviously).

Fast forward 6 weeks from the alternator breakdown, and now I'm having second thoughts about ditching the 2004 Pilot. I replaced the alternator, and everything has been running fine. I have driven the Pilot since 2007 and I mostly enjoy it. It has been mostly reliable. Of course, it's old, and various things have started to break down -- the power seats don't work anymore, one of my door's power locks doesn't work, the CD player and AUX port don't work, there is some minor tearing in the leather seats, dealership inspections have revealed various minor hose leaks, etc. Things that are not worth the money to repair given the age of the car. All things I am used to and don't bother me terribly, but perhaps a sign that my car will continue to deteriorate as time goes on. The exterior is in average shape -- no rust or anything like that, but several small dents and scratches. I replaced the timing belt about a year ago, so I don't have any scheduled major maintenance costs (but of course you never know with a car this age).

My finances: we have been fairly aggressive in saving for retirement (maxing out 401ks and self-employed ""profit sharing"" plans for the past few years), which gives me comfort. But this past year has been tougher than usual on our finances. For the first time in several years, I've had to pay very close attention to our cash flow. My son was recently diagnosed with autism, and his therapies have stressed us financially. I'm currently using my HELOC like a credit card, and would likely have to use it to pay for the down payment on the new Subaru. That's not totally disastrous -- the interest rate is not horrible (5.5%), and I *should* be getting an end-of-year bonus that will allow me to pay off all/most of the HELOC balance (but not guaranteed). Our student loans are paid off. Not including our mortgage (which is not cheap but manageable), our debt right now is about $40,000, mostly from the HELOC and the car note on the new-ish minivan. In a financial emergency, we'd be able to borrow from our retirement savings or from our parents (neither is desirable, but gives a certain amount of comfort).

As for alternatives to the $30,000 new Subaru, I'm not really interested in ""upgrading"" to a cheaper vehicle like a sedan or a 5-10 year old vehicle. In those scenarios I'd rather just keep my Pilot. Plus, although I usually only buy used, the prices for used cars are ridiculous right now. If I'm going to move on from the Pilot, a modestly-trimmed new Forester seems like the right balance of price and features. 

I guess the major motivator to buying a new vehicle is the inevitability that I will eventually need an upgrade (although it could theoretically be years from now), and the fear that if I put this off, I might land in a situation where the Pilot totally craps out on me / can't be cheaply fixed, and I need to hastily buy a new vehicle rather than the prudent, methodical approach I have tried to follow with ordering the Subaru Forester. I also recognize that, while I don't personally mind driving a shabby car, other people take notice -- I am an attorney, and while I don't often drive clients around, it does happen sometimes. 

I recognize there is not an objectively right or wrong answer -- it mostly comes down to balancing an individual's personal attitude on comfort with debt and borrowing against future self versus risk tolerance and lifestyle of driving an older vehicle. But I am curious if others have gone through similar experiences, or want to share pro/cons or other factors that I haven't already mentioned. 

**TL;DR** \-- is it worth taking on debt during a tough-ish financial time to upgrade to a safer and nicer family vehicle, even though my old shabby one is working mostly fine (for now)?

personalfinance,Why I regret buying instead of renting,"9 months ago I bought my first house on 3 acres using a VA loan with no money down and secured a 2.65% interest rate. I am now realizing this is not what I want; I find myself fantasizing about living in a small apartment and having the freedom to move if I please. I am a single guy, no kids. There is nothing too major wrong with the house, but I somehow spent 5 months doing minor repairs and there are still a ton of things that need to be done -- upgrade &amp; preventative maintenance wise. It's a really beautiful place and I realize that I am lucky and I am probably going to be told I am stupid for not wanting to stay here, but hear me out:

* I am in the middle of nowhere and feel isolated/bored
* I drive an hour each way to work 5 days a week
* I want to find a new job but I am limited by staying here
* I am anxious as hell because I know eventually some big ticket item is going to break and I am going to have to spend hours and hours figuring out what to do about it and thousand to have it fixed
* My driveway is extremely long, I am in the Northeast, and my only vehicle is a car. I have no desire to buy and maintain a truck/plow or atv/plow. It's too long for a snowblower to be practical. I got by last winter by paying my neighbor to do it, but I can't always rely on him and I hate having to worry about it. 
* The amount of time it takes to do even minor repairs is bewildering. I get anxiety because at the end of the day my time is my most valuable asset and I spend so much time fixing and maintaining stupid little things. 
* I have three acres and about an acre of that is grass that I have to mow. I got lucky and bought a $500 riding mower from my neighbor which I have no desire to maintain or fix when it eventually stops functioning or needs an oil change.
* It's a 4 bedroom 2 bathroom house and I live here alone. The entire upstairs is empty and I dont own a lot of stuff. I don't want the headache of renting it out. Why am I paying $1750 a month to live in an empty house when I would be just as happy living in the basement apartment in a more desirable area. 

Ultimately it comes down to my time and freedom. I don't feel like I have any these days. People on here will shout ""Buy as soon as you can"", but if you are someone like me who values your time and does not get satisfaction out of maintaining a pile of sticks, then don't make the same mistake I did. I honestly feel like I would be happier living in my car and showering at the YMCA. I thought living here was going to bring me peace, but all I feel is nervous and tense because I tied myself to this thing that WILL break and eat up all of my time. 

To anyone who is debating buying vs renting.. seriously do not underestimate how much of your time/energy/money will be drained by owning a home, especially if you'll be living by yourself. I really thought people were just lazy exaggerators when they said how draining, stressful, &amp; time consuming it is -- how unexpected repairs pop up out of nowhere and cost more than you expected.. every.. single.. time. 

Everyone on here is so caught up with saving money and penny pinching; the focus is always on money itself. Your time and mental health is far more valuable than money.

I am now trying to find someone to assume my mortgage rather than outright sell the place, since I don't have much equity after 9 months and the closing costs would outweigh my home value increase. I am hoping that the 2.65% interest rate on my mortgage will be attractive enough to convince potential buyers to go outside the normal 'get a realtor and your own loan' model.

personalfinance,Bankruptcy Vs Settling Debt,"Long story short, my home (which I owned with my business partner and also was where our business was located) burned down, and I discovered that he had lied to me and the bank and never got property insurance. I kind of stopped functioning for a few years but now I'm going back to nursing school and trying to put my life back together. I contacted the company that purchased the defaulted mortgage and apparently there was a settlement against both of us, which includes a very high interest rate, so the debt has increased by almost 30% in three years. They also told me they will garnish my wages if I get a job (I haven't been working) and that the settlement will be active until at least 2031.

My question is if filing for bankruptcy even makes sense. I have essentially no assets (a small amount of musical equipment but everything else burned in the fire). Will they be able to garnish my wages when I get a job if I file for bankruptcy? If so, is it even worth filing for it? Thank you for your assistance; I'm feeling very overwhelmed by all of this and appreciate any guidance.

Edit: Sorry, I should've mentioned, my other possibility would be asking family to give me some money so I can try to settle the debt.

**Please keep in mind that political discussions and  soapboxing are still not allowed here. This thread is for questions from people with student loans and how these changes may affect their finances.**

# Student Loan Repayment Pause Extended 

The CARES Act in 2020 suspended federally-held student loan payments and interest charges until September 30, 2020. This was extended through several executive orders in 2020-2022. Repayments were supposed to resume September 1, 2022. With this announcement the pause has been extended until January 1, 2023.

# Student Loan Forgiveness

Federally-held student loans through the Dept of Education (DoEd) are eligible for a forgiveness amount dependent on your income. **Student loans had to have been disbursed prior to July 1, 2022**, noted in [this NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/business/biden-student-loan-forgiveness.html).

For single and MFS filers, the income limit is $125,000. For HoH and MFJ filers, the income limit is $250,000. This income limit is based on your [adjusted gross income](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/business/biden-student-loan-forgiveness.html) (AGI) which can be found on line 11 of your tax return (Form 1040). If you are below the AGI limit for either 2020 or 2021 you will be eligible. 

If you are under the income limits you are eligible for up to $10,000 in forgiveness. If you had a Pell Grant you are eligible for an additional $10,000 in forgiveness, for a total of $20,000. If you're not sure if you ever received a Pell Grant, you can check your account on studentaid.gov. Forgiveness is applied on an individual basis (parent and student are treated separately in relation to Parent Plus loans, if one has a Pell Grant the other does not get the benefit, though this is not 100% confirmed).

Eligible loans are all loans held by the DoEd. This includes all direct loans such as direct Stafford loans, direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans, and Parent Plus loans. Privately held FFEL loans are currently not eligible, though it sounds like the DoEd is looking into options for getting these loans eligible for forgiveness and suggests that if you do no wish to consolidate then to await further info on this ([NYT](https://archive.ph/heoCM)).

## Expected Timeline and How Forgiveness Will Apply to Your Loans

  If the DoEd has your income information from the last two years from FAFSA or IDR applications then forgiveness should be automatic. Otherwise, a simple application will be available through the DoEd website in early October. We will update this post with a link when it is available. Once you've applied, your application should be processed within 4-6 weeks. The DoEd recommends applying before Nov 15, 2022 to ensure your application is processed by Jan 1, 2022 when payments resume. [The DoEd](https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement/) will continue to process applications after this date though as they come in.

This forgiveness will be directly applied to your debt balance, it will not be given to you via a check or deposit to your bank account. Nor will you receive a refund if you owe less than what you’re fully eligible for.

After the forgiveness is applied, if you still have a balance it will be re-amortized which should result in a lower monthly payment.

**Sept 5 Update**: The studentaid.gov [website FAQs](https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement/one-time-cancellation) have been updated with guidance on how forgiveness will be applied to a borrower with multiple types of loans and interest rates. In order of priority: 

 - **Loan type priority**: 
  - Defaulted DoEd loans
  - Defaulted DoEd FFEL loans
  - Direct and DoEd FFEL loans
  - DoEd Perkins loans

 - **Interest rate/program type priority:** 
  - Highest interest rate first
  - If same rate, then applied to unsubsidized before subsidized
  - If interest rate and subsidy are the same, then apply to most recent loans
  - If interest rate, subsidy, and timing are all the same then apply it to loans with the lowest balances 

**Beware of scam texts, emails, and calls from people claiming you need to “act now” to get your student loans forgiven.**

##FAQs

* **I just finished paying off my student loans. Is there anything I can do to get some sort of forgiveness?** 

  Any student loan payments made during the payment pause that started in March 2020 for loans held by the DoEd can be refunded, this was established with the CARES Act. The refunded amount is added back to your loan balance. [The DoEd application](https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement/) to provide income information for forgiveness will be open until Dec 31, 2023, so if your refund is delayed in processing you could wait to fill out the application. 

  We're not sure how it will work for people that the DoEd already has income info for and applies the forgiveness prior to your refund finishing processing. 

  You'll also need to keep in mind any tax implications of doing this if you're requesting a refund for an amount paid in 2021 that you took the student loan interest deduction for on your 2021 tax return. We're still looking for information on how this is handled.

* **I refinanced my loans and they’re now held privately. Am I eligible for forgiveness?** 

  No, private student loans are not eligible for this forgiveness. 

* **Will there be tax consequences for this forgiveness?** 

  No, this forgiveness will not be taxable income for federal income tax. State income taxes may apply. 

* **Do I need to do anything to receive this forgiveness if I’m eligible?**

  If the DoEd has your income information from the last two years from FAFSA or IDR applications then it should be automatic. Otherwise, a simple application will be available through the DoEd website in early October. We will update this post with a link when it is available. Once you've applied your application should be processed within 4-6 weeks. The DoEd recommends applying before Nov 15, 2022 to ensure your application is processed by Jan 1, 2022 when payments resume. [The DoEd](https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement/) will continue to process applications after this date though as they come in.

* **If my parents took out Parent Plus loans for me but I also have my own student loans, do we each qualify for $10,000 in forgiveness or only one of us?**

  Yes, both the Parent Plus loan and your own federal student loan are each eligible for $10,000 in forgiveness. The parent is a separate borrower from the child. Regardless of the number of children the parent has or if the child had Pell grants, only the parent's information is considered for their forgiveness amount.

* **If I am still in school or was a tax dependent for 2020 and 2021, who's income is considered for determining eligibility, mine or my parent's?**

  [This NYT article](https://archive.ph/heoCM) suggests it's based on the definition of dependent from the DoEd, rather than tax dependent. Visit [this page from the DoEd](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency) for guidance on determining if you're considered a dependent or not. We do not believe this info has been confirmed from an official source yet though.

* **If I received only $5,000 in Pell Grants, do I still quality for the full additional $10,000 (for a total of $20,000) in forgiveness?** 

  Yes It doesn’t matter how much in Pell Grants you had, you get the additional $10,000 in forgiveness if you received any amount of Pell Grant, and it can apply to any federal loans (undergraduate or graduate), regardless of when you received the Pell Grant.

* **How will this forgiveness affect my credit score?** 

  If it completely pays off your student loans and that account closes, you will likely see a small decrease in your credit score due to your average age of accounts decreasing. Over time this will rise to have a positive effect on your score. See the wiki page on [credit scores](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico) for more info. 

# Public Service Loan Forgiveness

In October 2021, a PSLF waiver was announced by the DoEd with temporary changes to the PSLF program that are set to expire Oct 31, 2022. This waiver provided people with more eligible payments to reach the 120 payment requirement for 10 years such as including periods of forbearances like COVID or if you were in active military status.

**The deadline to apply for PSLF with the waiver in effect is Oct 31, 2022. So if you are considering this then visit [this link](https://www.whitehouse.gov/publicserviceloanforgiveness/) for more info and to apply.**

# Income-Driven Repayment

The White House has proposed new rules for the IDR program. This is still just a proposal and has not yet been confirmed by the DoEd.

* Currently repayments are based on 10% of income. This would be halved to 5%. **This only applies to undergraduate loans, not graduate loans.**

  * If you have both undergraduate and graduate loans, the IDR percent will be a weighted average of the balances.

* Non-discretionary income is currently dependent on the current federal poverty line (FPL) for your state and family size multiplied by 1.5. This is being proposed to change to 225% of the federal poverty line. 

* The DoEd is proposing to cover the interest payment for loan repayments on IDR so that the loan balance does not grow over time, even in months when your repayment amount is $0.

* If your loan balance is less than $12,000, you’re eligible for forgiveness after 10 years, rather than waiting for the full 20 years.",finance,1661453895

personalfinance,Best way I should pay off debt?,"I’m 26, I just finished my Masters and I have deferment on payments until 12/28/2027 but interest will accrue once the pause ends on 12/31/2022. I have a a total of $46,658.64 of student loan debt that I need to pay off before taking into account the potential $10k of relief. Only $160.32 of that total is interest currently. On top of that I have a bill due of $7200 for the last two semesters I took but it has no late fees so I haven’t paid it yet. The loans and interest rates are:

$20,500       5.280%
$5,735.21     4.660%
$7,383.56    4.450%

I live at home so the only bills I have are car insurance twice a year and expenses such as gas, food, and entertainment. My mom took loans out for me to go to school as well and I need to help her pay those but I want to have debt in my name cleared first. I obviously don’t want to wait to start making payments until 2027 and the income driven option was so low that it would take forever to pay off so I’d owe even more. Should I pay the full balance now, once the pause ends, or I should pay this off in monthly payments? Thanks!",finance,1661456785
personalfinance,Strategy for CDs v Savings Accounts,"I have a good bit of money in a combination of high-yield savings accounts and CDs with Synchrony.  Although the CDs were opened up this year, we're already at the point where my savings account's yield exceeds the yields for the CDs, and in calculating the withdrawal penalty it makes more sense for me to terminate and reinvest the CDs than to keep them to term. 

My question: how are people allocating their cash between savings accounts and CDs?  My thinking is that it may actually make more sense to hold that money in a HYS for now (I have 1.8%, versys 2.6% for a 12-month CD), since pretty much all sources indicate that the fed is going to continue raising rates. 

I am also considering doing a 2-year ""step up"" CD, where you can request that the rates increase one time.  However, Synchrony says that the ""step up"" is if the rates rise **for that product** (i.e., the step-up CD), so they plausibly could choose to stop offering it or provide worse rates in the foreseeable future.",finance,1661457633

devops,how to scale Infrastructure Consulting business,"Hi All,

I'm trying to get some ideas on the situation me and 2 of my friends in.

Some pre-story, I'm working as a DevOps consultant and we have a small firm with 2 other guys. We all have our own clients and each of us focuses on a different cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure).

We've been doing this only for 1.5 years now (only consulting part, we are in this area for much longer) however when we started the idea was to scale the business since the money is good. We tried to outsource one of the less demanding clients and oversee it, but first you still have to attend meetings, secondly not all clients will be cool about this, and lastly still this wouldn't scale well as every new joiner will have to be trained and it just take months .. been there.

Another idea would be to sell Infrastructure Code say terraform of the modules that companies want. Lets say if some company want to move to the Cloud they can select their apps platform lets say (serverless, java, or whatever) and we give them everything necessary, ci/cd with all what they might need, monitoring, backup, api gateway, federations etc. I've seen that many Front end guys end up setting up this kind of outsourced model but again, Infrastructure might not be something that company want to outsource.

What do you think guys, any scalable ideas that can be build around DevOps consulting ?

TL;DR We have a DevOps firm, but we can't scale it to take many clients, looking for ideas",technology,1661461836

#[Stock futures slip ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were lower on Friday, dimming hopes that the S&amp;P 500 could grind out another positive week.
*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped Friday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 87 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures traded 0.4% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The moves followed an up day for the major averages in which the Dow jumped about 300 points, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite was the outperformer, advancing 1.7% as a pullback in yields helped tech shares.
*****
&gt; “Overall, it remains a really attractive moment to invest in equities. Underlying company performance is strong for the highest quality companies, and multiples are down because of macro fears. That’s the setup every long-term investor looks for,” Robert Cantwell, a portfolio manager at Upholdings, told CNBC.
*****
&gt; Nevertheless, all the major averages are on pace for their second straight down week. The Dow is on track for a 1.2% decline. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are heading to slightly smaller declines of 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All eyes are on Powell’s widely anticipated 10 a.m. ET speech at the central bank’s annual symposium in Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Investors are hoping for new guidance about how the Fed will act this autumn, but expectations are lower, with many expecting Powell to reiterate the Fed’s promise to slow inflation by raising interest rates. Opinion’s divided on whether the Fed will bump rates by half a percentage point or three quarters of a point at its next policy meeting in September.
*****
&gt; The personal consumption expenditures, one of the Fed’s favorite inflation measures, will also be watched ahead of Powell’s speech Friday morning.
*****
&gt; “We’re likely to see a relief tomorrow unless we get a big shock from what Powell says,” Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “One thing I would keep an eye out on if we look to next week and into the fall… implied bond volatility is still very, very high for where it normally is in late August, suggesting that actually we’re likely to continue seeing a lot of action in the yield curve, which could affect stock markets in the fall.”

politics,Discussion Thread: Redacted Mar-a-Lago Search Warrant Affadavit to be Unsealed by 12 p.m. Eastern,"Yesterday, a federal judge from the Southern District of Florida ordered that the Mar-a-Lago search warrant affadavit be unsealed by noon ET today, August 26th.

**Background reading:**

- The New York Times (metered paywall): [""Judge Orders Redacted Affidavit Used in Trump Search Warrant to Be Unsealed | The document will be unsealed by noon Friday. In its most complete form, it would disclose important details about the government’s justification for searching Mar-a-Lago this month.""](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/us/politics/trump-justice-dept-affidavit.html)

- NBC (no paywall): [""Judge orders a redacted version of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant affidavit be made public Friday | The document lays out the justification for DOJ's search of former President Donald Trump's Florida estate.

The order to unseal the search warrant affadavit [can be read here](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854.94.0_8.pdf) in its entirety (PDF warning).

The most relevant portions are excerpted here:

&gt;ORDER TO UNSEAL

&gt;I have reviewed the Government’s memorandum of law and proposed redactions to the search warrant Affidavit. ECF No. 89. I am fully advised in the entire record, including the contents of the Affidavit.

&gt;1. I find that the Government has met its burden of showing a compelling reason/good cause to seal portions of the Affidavit because disclosure would reveal (1) the identities of witnesses, law enforcement agents, and uncharged parties, (2) the investigation’s strategy, direction, scope, sources, and methods, and (3) grand jury information protected by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). As further explanation for this finding, I incorporate by reference my Order on Motions to Unseal. ECF No. 80; see also United States v. Kooistra, 796 F.2d 1390, 1391 (11th Cir. 1986) (findings must be “sufficient for a reviewing court to be able to determine, in conjunction with a review of the sealed documents themselves, what important interest or interests the district court found sufficiently compelling to justify the denial of public access.”).

&gt;2. Based on my independent review of the Affidavit, I further find that the Government has met its burden of showing that its proposed redactions are narrowly Case 9:22-mj-08332-BER Document 94 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2022 Page 1 of 2 2 tailored to serve the Government’s legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire Affidavit.

&gt;WHEREFORE, it is ORDERED that: 1. The Intervenors’ Motion to Unseal [ECF No. 4] is GRANTED IN PART. 2. On or before noon Eastern time on Friday, August 26, 2022, the Government shall file in the public docket a version of the Affidavit containing the redactions proposed in ECF No. 89-1. DONE and ORDERED in Chambers this 25th day of August, 2022, at West Palm Beach in the Southern District of Florida.

devops,K8s deployment and replicaset question,"Does anyone have links to the documentation on how a pod name is generated?  It feels like a hash to me, but the official docs only talk about \_that\_ the random-looking strings are added to the pod name, not about how they're created.

I suspect a hash because I was switching back and forth between two different images for the same deployment while testing something unrelated and I noticed that the first of the two strings stayed the same for the respective image tags.

Like so:

1. Apply manifest for \`image:taga\` -&gt; get pod named \`deployment-12345678-abcde\`.
2. Apply manifed for \`image:tagb\` -&gt; get pod named \`deployment-09876543-ghijk\`.
3. Re-apply manifest for \`image:taga\` -&gt; get pod named \`deployment-12345678-jklmn\`.
4. Re-apply manifest for \`image:tagb\` -&gt; get pod named \`deployment-09876543-opqrs\`.

So unless the apply command triggered a rollback to the original deployment of tag a, it would appear that the string isn't random but is computed from at least the image name and tag.  There may or may not be other data involved.

Anyway, I'm curious and would appreciate any info or docs about exactly how those strings are derived.

personalfinance,(Michigan) Unsure if we should drop our private health insurance plan now that both my spouse and I have VA healthcare and our kids are eligible for ChampVA.,"Hello! 


As the title states, I am having difficulties in determining the best health insurance for my family now that my dependents are newly eligible for ChampVA (enrollment is processing now) and I am newly eligible for VA care. Unfortunately, I have cognitive impairments resulting from my disabilities so not only do I get overwhelmed by this stuff easily, I don't trust myself to make the correct decision. Sorry if the answer if obvious. 


I have reached out to resources provided by both the VA and non-profits in my community and although they have been helpful with explaining what falls in their wheelhouse, I have been unsuccessful finding someone who can help compare private insurance vs. ChampVA and the pros and cons of carrying both. 


As I understood it, ChampVA was more supplemental insurance than primary and would essentially pick up what our private insurance doesn't. I've read from others that ChampVA shouldn't be the sole ""insurance"" and should strictly be used to supplement. However, after speaking to the VA, they felt confident that we could drop our private health insurance once enrolled with ChampVA. 


After looking into it, I am leaning towards dropping private insurance and having the kids on ChampVA while my husband and I use the VA. However, I am posting here first because I am terrified that I'm overlooking something and making a costly mistake. 


I've tried to include as much information as possible but if I'm missing something important, I am happy to provide the details. 


Thanks in advance to anyone who can help provide guidance!

--------------------------------------------


**Family/Health Info**

* 2 adults, 2 children (preschooler and toddler.) 

* Both kids are healthy and have only been to urgent care a handful of times. Both have their dental covered through our private (separate) dental insurance. Neither need glasses.

* Both adults have complex health issues but all medical and prescription costs are 100% covered through the VA. We are happy with our provider and our care at the outpatient clinic. We can have ER visits at local hospital covered if we call within a certain amount of time. Urgent care is a bit more difficult and requires authorization. Neither one of us need glasses.

* 1 adult has full dental coverage through the VA, and the other adult does not. The VA offers private dental plans for purchase and are comparable to the private plan we have now. 

* Since my husband is eligible for VA care, he is not eligible for ChampVA. 

* We live in a rural area with 1 urgent care, 1 ER, and 1 VA outpatient clinic. We get approved for Community Care (seeing a private provider) for everything outside of primary care which are the same providers we have seen with our private insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

Assets could fall another 20% to 25% as the Federal Reserve's drive to tame inflation with tightening hasn't been fully priced in yet, Bridgewater co-Chief Investment Officer Greg Jensen told Bloomberg TV. 

Market conditions still reflect assumptions that inflation will slow dramatically toward the Fed's 2% target in the next 18-24 months amid a stable economy and earnings landscape, he said. 

 But reality will eventually set it, with inflation being more stubborn, the Fed tightening for longer.  

Markets still have significant ground to cover to bring the real economy closer to the financial economy, which could mean a steeper downturn in the future, Jensen said. 

""We're still something like 25% \[to\] 30% above the normal relationship between cash flows and asset prices, which means there's a significant decline to come to kind of align the real economy with the financial economy,"" he said. 

Markets are seemingly in a secular wave of ""de-financialization"" and ""de-globalization"", Jensen added. Meanwhile, labor is growing as a share of the economy, meaning corporate profits will then need to fall as the economy slows.

Here the most important remarks Powell just made at Jackson Hole. Hope this helps.

In his speech Powell mentioned **that 75 basis points remains an option for the FOMC september meeting. This is higher than the anticipated 50 bps.**

Overall Fed will keep raising untill inflation is under control and referred to historic times where this failed.

Powell also indicated **Fed will keep rates high in the longterm** to counter speculation Fed would start cutting in 2023.

He also indicated raising rates will hurt economy and households ""to some extend"".

stocks,"Fed’s Powell, in blunt remarks at Jackson Hole, says bringing down inflation will cause pain to households and businesses","Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell used the spotlight on the central bank’s Jackson Hole retreat to deliver a blunt message that the Fed will keep at the job of bringing inflation down until it is done and that the fight will be costly in terms of jobs and economic growth. “Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,” Powell said in his speech to the central bankers and economists gathered at the base of the Grand Tetons.

“Moreover, there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” he added. Fed Chairmen often give the opening address to the Fed’s Jackson Hole retreat in late August. While many of the speeches have been consequential for markets, they have also tended to be long and wide-ranging. Powell broke the mold with his speech Friday with a short six-page speech.

In it, Powell drove home the point that the Fed has an “overarching focus right now to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal.” “We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply, and to keep inflation expectations anchored. We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done,” Powell said.

On worries about a possible recession, Powell said that he sees “strong underlying momentum” in the economy. Powell said he was pleased with the lower July inflation readings but quickly added “a single month’s improvement falls far short of what the Committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down.” At the moment, “high inflation has continued to spread through the economy,”

Powell kept the door open for a 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike in September, saying that “another unusually large increase could be appropriate” next month. But he said the debate over whether to hike by 0.75 percentage point for the third straight meeting or slow to a half percentage point increase would depend on the “totality” of the economic data between now and the Fed’s Sept. 20 meeting. At some point, the Fed won’t be able to keep raising by 0.75 percentage point moves, he added. Wall Street had viewed Powell’s last press conference in July as dovish. Analysts said that this view came when Powell described the Fed’s benchmark interest rate setting – in a range of 2.25%-2.5% – as “neutral.” Perhaps in a nod to the markets view, Powell said in his speech Friday that neutral “was not a place to stop or pause” rate hikes.

**Encrypted ZIP files can have two correct passwords**  
Password-protected ZIP archives are common means of compressing and sharing sets of files, but Arseniy Sharoglazov, a cybersecurity researcher at Positive Technologies has demonstrated that it is possible for an encrypted ZIP file to have two correct passwords. This vulnerability comes about when passwords are set at more than 64 characters, in which case ZIP uses an algorithm to hash the password. Sharoglazov showed that by trying a different password of more than 64 characters results in ZIP creating the same hash and therefore accepting the second password as legitimate. A full report on this issue is available at Bleeping Computer, who, incidentally were able to replicate this procedure.

**White hat hackers broadcast through decommissioned satellite**  
A group of white hat hackers demonstrated at DEF CON how to take control of a satellite in geostationary orbit. The group used a satellite called Anik F1R, which had been decommissioned in 2020. The group was authorized to perform the hack and had also been given permission and access to an unused uplink facility which included the hardware to connect to a satellite. The group sought to demonstrate how easy it could be to physically take control of decommissioned satellites using software that costs just $300.

**State-backed attacks excluded from cyber insurance**  
The insurance marketplace Lloyd’s of London will introduce exclusions for cyber insurance policies to not cover “catastrophic” state-backed attacks. These exclusions will begin in new policies in March 31, 2023. Lloyd’s warns that all insurance underwriters need to make it extremely clear in policies that state-sponsored attacks fall outside of coverage. This applies regardless of any declared war between two countries. This reflects that state-sponsored attacks often aren’t directly after financial gain, but often are the result of geopolitical consideration.  This also comes as insurance providers shy away from ransomware coverage as costs increase.

**Ex-security chief accuses Twitter of cybersecurity negligence**  
Peiter Zatko,Twitter’s ex-security chief who was fired back in January 2022, has blown the whistle on Twitter’s cybersecurity practices. Zatko filed a complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 6, alleging that thousands of employee laptops contained full copies of Twitter’s source code. He claims that one-third of those devices blocked automatic security fixes, had firewalls turned off and had non-approved remote access enabled. He also alleges Twitter failed to reliably delete user data after account cancellation. The complaint further states that employees repeatedly installed spyware on their work computers at the request of external organizations. Zatko said Twitter experienced roughly one security incident per week during his two-year tenure and indicated that he “reasonably feared Twitter could suffer an Equifax-level hack.”

**Hackers use Binance exec deepfake in crypto exchange scam**  
A group of hackers have managed to use an AI hologram to impersonate Binance chief communications officer (CCO) Patrick Hillmann. Using the deepfake over Zoom calls, the hackers fooled several cryptocurrency project representatives into thinking Hillmann was helping them get listed on the Binance crypto exchange. The listing scheme was discovered when some of the reps contacted Hillmann to thank him for the listing opportunities. Hillmann did not disclose which cryptocurrency projects were targeted, or the funds invested for the sham services.

**Microsoft reveals Nobelium’s MagicWeb**  
Security researchers at the company discovered a technique used by the Russian-linked threat group to maintain persistent access to compromised networks. Dubbed MagicWeb, this uses a malicious DLL to manipulate claims passed in tokens generated by an Active Directory Federated Services server. This ultimately manipulates existing user authentication certificates. This required Nobelium to first have highly privileged credentials, gain access to a network, and gain admin privileges in Active Directory. Given these conditions, MagicWeb appears highly targeted.

**Leaky NIC lights defeat air-gaps**  
Dr. Mordechai Guri, the head of R&amp;D in the Cyber Security Research Center at Ben Gurion University, published a new way to exfiltrate data from air-gapped systems called ETHERLED. This uses the LEDs on NICs to send data out of the system up to hundreds of meters away. Data can be sent through simple Morse code or modulated over optical signals. This requires an attacker to breach the system and plant malicious code. In this case, the attack uses undocumented firmware commands to trigger the NIC lights. Suggested countermeasures for the attack include black tape to block the lights.

**North Korean malware present at Black Hat**  
IronNet, a security firm hired to assist at Black Hat’s Network Operations Center discovered several active malware infections on the network including SHARPEXT, which has been attributed as having direct connections to North Korea’s top leadership. The threat hunters stated that during the conference, they observed numerous callouts from four unique hosts to three domains associated with the North Korean malware."" This might have been from someone who had SHARPEXT on their machine, bringing it into the conference, or picking it up while there. The SHARPEXT browser extension is typically installed on a victim's Windows PC once it's been compromised via some other vulnerability or infection route.

**The Pentagon may require vendors to certify their software as free of known flaws**  
The House of Representative’s software vulnerability provision from within the massive 2023 National Defense Authorization Bill — passed July 14 — continues to divide the cybersecurity community. The debate boils down to whether the requirement is unnecessary and impossible to achieve or is a game-changing move that will begin holding software vendors accountable for selling faulty technology. The Biden Administration’s position is that the software industry should emulate the automotive industry, where “manufacturers retain ownership and responsibility” through the life of the vehicle, said Anne Neuberger, Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology. But cybersecurity executive Dan Lorenc argues there’s no such thing as vulnerability-free software.

What I would argue is with bitcoin these historical constraints are not constraints anymore. And if that is the case, can the new equilibrium for the number of currencies in the world be 1?

Psychologically, cash is harder to part with - but am I right in thinking that strictly rationally, it's the better option vs stocks, since the market could hit an upswing any time, and cash is just sitting getting 1% at best? (Stocks are mostly very generalized index funds.)

Also - for the ~20k debt sitting at 6-8% interest rates... is it adviseable to try to move it to a balance transfer credit card with some initial 0% interest period, assuming he will NOT rack the cards up again and there is a workable plan to get the balance paid off within the 0% period? Are there any big hidden pitfalls/downsides to watch out for there, and if it's a generally good idea, any recommendations for cards?

CryptoMarkets,Bitcoin Tumbles Below $21K After Powell’s Hawkish Remarks,"Bitcoin (BTC) dropped almost 5% in value in the two hours following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s long-awaited keynote address at the Fed's Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic conference Friday morning. Equity markets slid with crypto, with the S&amp;P 500 index down more than 2%.

“The stock market had not priced this in except the last couple of days and it’s because the risk was that they would be hawkish, not the belief,” Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank, told CoinDesk.

“\[The market\] is pricing it in now at least as much as it believes the Fed, but it's about Powell’s legacy and his credibility at this point,” he added. Iaccino further noted that markets had rallied ahead of the speech – perhaps anticipating more dovish remarks – thus likely exacerbating today’s decline.

From Powell’s address: “Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth … While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses.”

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bitcoin initially showed little reaction to Powell’s remarks, but has now turned sharply lower – to the current $20,700 from just shy of $22,000 ahead of the speech.

In addition to the S&amp;P 500’s 2.15% decline, the Nasdaq is lower by 2.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 1.8%.",cryptocurrency,1661533222

may earn no interest at all they

describe themselves as banking with

can earn an average return of 4.45 if

investing in stocks directly it will not

affect the value of the capital that you

have deposited into the account it only

affects the apy and if the stock market

does well you could earn more than 4.45

percent also the longer you leave the

money in there the higher the expected

return will be for a two-year term it is

5.84 and for a five-year term the

estimated annual return is nine point

four four percent per year so this is a

great option at a time when although

bank interest rates have gone up it's

still only around two percent so it's

nowhere near even beating inflation let

alone earning some money but with save

you do have the possibility of earning a

lot more with the very small possibility

that you might earn less or nothing but

when the competition is only two percent

you're not really losing much if the

stock market does go down and you lose

all your interest in your save account

percent anyway how much is that even

\- But like is our principal really guaranteed? If they could just do this scheme, then why aren't other companies or banks doing it?

\- There are alternatives like 5 year TIPS which don't participate in the market but should do well if there is unexpected inflation

\- it seems too good to be true, why would they give us like 4% APY with no risk on our principal? There must be some kind of risk to our principal that they aren't saying

Comments on the last post were a real ride and a mixed bag. Thanks for those who read it and gave responses to the actual content and didn't react solely on their own feelings and sentiment. To the rest, well here we go again I guess. Many people are right in their responses that you shouldn't take a random post's advice as gold. I'm just laying out facts and the mostly likely possibility based on economic conventions, to my knowledge/POV anyway I suppose. Anyways here we go.

Europe

* In July, the Euro fell to parity with the US dollar. As of recently the Euro has fallen below the value of the US dollars. For reference, the 1 Euro = 1.2 USD in July 2021. If you know anything about forex you'd know a change in value of over 15% is absolutely MASSIVE, and fairly rare if we're speaking of developed nations economies. This is in addition to the 1% change in a month or so since July 2022. The Euro is at it's lowest value in 20 years.
* The Bank of England has officially predicted a recession. Citibank predicts UK inflation at 18% next year, a near half-century high, with inflation currently at 10%, a four decade high. This morning, OFGEM, the UK energy regulator, increase energy price cap by an unbelievable 80% with further room for revisions that may imply further increases.
* Germany has lost between 30-40% of their energy supply since the war's start due to cut-off from Russia. A complete cut-off could have Germany lose 225 billion dollars over the next two years. Further, droughts and high temperatures  have resulted in water levels on the Rhine, a key transport route, dropping below the critical 40cm mark, limiting capacity, and causing delays and cancellations. Germany is expected to impose a gas levy on households.
* Italy has seen inflation \~8% a 36 year high. Prices surged for processed food (from 8.1% to 9.5%) and transportation services (from 7.2% to 8.9%). It sees growth forecasts slashed by almost 3%.
* Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania see inflation at 23.2%, 21.3% and 20.9% respectively.
* The trend continues across Europe. The euro-zone in general sees annual inflation is expected to be 8.9% in July 2022, up from 8.6% in June. Energy prices increase a whopping 39.7% since last year, the highest on record. The EU accounts for about 15% of world GDP. Hard times in Europe means no funds left to trade.

&amp;#x200B;

US Job Cuts

* It is actually simpler for me to link [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2022/08/22/ford-reportedly-laying-off-3000-employees-here-are-the-major-us-job-cuts-amid-growing-recession-fears/?sh=5fbb68ee6181). It gives a LONG list of just some of the largest US companies laying-off tens of thousands of workers over the past few months. The list of company lay-offs grows by the day. That's a lot less income to spare to trade for a lot off people. More importantly, it's just a sign that company profits are drying up so there's no little money or appetite for risky crypto plays.
* Unemployment rising (and it's persistence) is a hallmark of a recession.

Car Repossessions

* Car repossessions are surging and Lisa Beilfuss Popeo, who covers the economy for Barron's, have reported a doubling of repossessions among prime borrowers. To be clear, prime borrowers are individuals/firms who the banks are generally certain would repay their loans and the first approved for loans. They are the last people you would ever want to hear not being able to replay loans because if they can't repay their loans, it's likely that very few others can either.

US Individuals and Households

* The last reading of US Household Net Worth is actually negative meaning households owe money(or assets) more than they own.
* The Graph below shows the Household Net Worth vs S&amp;P 500 with a visual correlation. For those not convinced, the correlation value from 2013- 2022 is 0.414, a moderate correlation for economic data. However, if we use the post-Covid values to determine the lasting effects of the COVID economic fallout and response to date we get a correlation value of 0.643, a **strong** correlation value for economic data.
* From the graph, the most recent Household Net Worth Reading is from Q1 2022, while the most recent S&amp;P value is from Q2 2022(hence the cut-off). This implies that we expect the already negative household net worth to fall quite a bit further, likely pushing us into a recession.
* I have already highlighted the 60% rise in consumer debt from May to June in my last post.
* With further regard to the falling S&amp;P, crypto as of recent(July-Aug) has a 0.8-0.9 correlation with the S&amp;P, an extremely high correlation.

China

* China accounts for about 18% of global GDP and is the world's largest exporter. It is fair to say that, as the world's largest export, any slowdown economic activity in China would mean an slowdown in the global economy.
* China continues their zero-Covid strategy as many millions have endured lockdowns to varying degrees in large such as Beijing, Xinjiang and Shanghai. While lockdowns have been officially lifted in many cities, even more like parts of Tibet and Hainan see fresh lockdowns. This is along with restrictions and controls across the entire state.
* Real estate drives about 25-30% of China’s economic activity, and housing represents 70% of household wealth. Almost 30% of all bank loans are property-related. 21 major developers have defaulted on their debts in the last year.
* China's real estate market stand at 2.4 trillion dollars. Housing sales volume fell between 30-40% year-on-year since the beginning of 2022 across 100 major Chinese cities. Consultancy firm Capital Economics estimates that about 30 million newly  developed properties remained unsold last year, while about 100 million  more were likely to have been bought but not occupied. Home prices  dropped for the 11th straight month in July. Many Chinese have chosen to not to pay their mortgages which ANZ Research estimates to affect about $222 billion of loans.
* Some property developers have gone so far as to accept watermelons, wheat and onions as payment for property. The government has been encouraging citizens to purchase more property. One government official has gone as far as to tell citizens to two purchase as much as four homes. The panic is obvious.
* 6 billion dollars have been stolen from the customer's deposit due to fraud by Henan Xincaifu Group Investment Holding Co. and citizens are in uproar amid chaos in the banking system.
* China is in a terrible position that feeds upon itself. Property developers are see falling sales and are going bankrupt/defaulting, so banks see less profit and/or take losses on non-performing loans, while lockdowns further limit appetite for healthy business loan while increasing distressed/risky loans, all the while everyone's value fall as real estate crashes.
* China has actually cut interest rates, twice in two weeks, in an effort to stimulate growth while most other countries raise rates to fight inflation. The Chinese remninbi or yuan has declined, falling as much as 7% in 3 months earlier this year. It recently fell to a 2 year low.
* China is also facing climate change problems as their rivers dry up such as the Yangtze, the world’s third largest river, seeing water levels in it's main trunk fall below the average of the last 5 years with entire sections and dozens of tributaries disappearing. This has then further created shortages of energy from hydropower. Companies such as Toyota, Foxconn and Tesla are among companies who have been forced to temporarily suspend plant operations.

Food Prices

* Per national geographic, the world diet is 45% comprised of grains. Of this, 19% is rice, 18% is wheat and 5% corn(3% other cereals). Between Ukraine and Russia, the amount of percentage of world grain supply is 14% of corn, 30% of barley and 27% of wheat(Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty 2022).
* Now by various studies, lack of fertilizer can reduce crop yields by 30-60%. Corn in particular is sensitive to nitrogen(fertilizer) levels.
* Per CNBC, again, Russia and Ukraine together make up 28% of the fertilizer exports. Further, Russia accounts for 11% of the world’s urea, and 48% of the ammonium nitrate, key ingredients in making fertilizer.
* We have seen effective prices for fertilizers climb \~3X - 5X times(\~300-500%) where they were before the pandemic. They are up \~1.4- \~3X(140%-\~300%) since the start of 2022.

[Prices of inputs to fertilizer](https://preview.redd.it/7odnewd4m3k91.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7190b2857ccc71392007296ee7ff7f5d593537f6)

* You may have notice the prices of at least two of the inputs fall and seem to be leveling off. This *might* be a good thing, kinda except for the fact that these prices are still sky high and have simply just stopped increasing.  But keep this in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

[Grain Prices](https://preview.redd.it/fy127j4qq3k91.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ef3da455e69c2ec83cb3a9afefab10c23fe88f6)

* (I found out how to make the graph less ugly)
* These three commodities largely account for around 50% of the world's diet. They have increased 30-40% pre-pandemic. They increased a few percentage points since the beginning of 2022. But the point is the prices are still high.
* Again we see prices decrease after a massive surge earlier this year. This *should* be good.
* The problem is that food prices(among almost everything else) falls during a true economic recession. It's either we have sky high prices with inflation or low(er) prices but the value of all your possessions and net worth fall. Same difference. That by the way is the ""secret"" to the Fed fighting inflation. They can't. We either have high and rising prices and struggle to keep up or stable prices but we fall into a recession and our asset value falls amid mass lay-offs.
* EDIT: Just a few minutes ago, Fed chain Powell warned that inflation fight will ""bring some pain"". How ironic life is sometimes. Expect high rates, and you know what that means for markets.

Russia accounted for around 3% of global GDP. Sanctions have written off much of that value from global trade. I'm not sure I need to speak at length about the collapse of Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Bangladesh has now approached the IMF for a bailout. Cuba has been suffering daily blackouts and fuel shortages and has devalued the Cuban peso by 500%. Chile also is on the brink of a recession. I could go on. I have highlighted a number of countries in this article but of course, we also know that high inflation is a issue in virtually every country worldwide while also having to struggling with huge floods, high temperatures and droughts. These are global issues.

\[Warning - the following paragraph is for economic nerds\]

We are also seeing the beginning of what is called contango in oil futures(WTI) which basically implies a falling demand for oil immediate oil access which typically precipitates recession in addition to treasury bill shortages as the Fed reduces its purchases, and eurodollar and treasury curves being heavily inverted. I may do a deep-dive on bond and futures curves another another time as it's a pretty complex topic.

Believe me when I say I left out quite a lot of data that could be seen as questionable even if they were particularly damning. I made sure to include statements like ""at a three decade high"" to indicate that citizens are not accustomed to coping with such high prices and likely that wages would not be able to keep pace with inflation. I realised only near the end of writing this I maybe should have added sources but, c'mon this in Reddit. But seriously, pretty much all this data is very easily verifiable within a single google search. So sure, you should take some random dude-on-Reddit's advice but the fact is the economic fundamentals look pretty terrible. I don't wanna be that doom and gloom guy but simply believing markets will pump won't make them pump.

About two weeks ago I was planning on transferring $2,000.00 from my checking account to my savings account after getting paid. The part where I messed up is that I accidentally transferred it to an external Bank of America account that’s been closed for 1+ year (but the account info is still saved in my transfer section of my current bank account). So long story short I instantly alerted my bank to cancel the transfer but they informed me there was nothing they could do since BOA was going to take the money out of my account regardless. My bank said I should get it sent back within a few business days, but it’s been over a week now, and $2k is a lot to just have disappear from my bank account.

That will be just enough to cover my car and rent, but have other expenses like food and want to go on vacations, eat out, etc. this year so need an extra 5k for that.

datascience,Data Analyst Engineering,"I somewhat recently started working for a large company and of course the data access is messy. We recently switched database platforms. The team I’m on apparently promoted two of its data analysts into data scientist positions shortly before I joined to fill roles left open when the previous two data scientists left.

They have these two new data scientists doing almost exclusively data engineering work. One is consistently excellent. The other… well they’re not what I would have expected from a data scientist or engineer. When the second puts together data sources for the analysts to use they tend to break… a lot. I’ve spent a ton of time on a project that depends on one of these commonly broken data sources. Way more times than necessary because my data sources are constantly broken.

Today I got fed up when I ran into an error code that had to do with the way the main data source was built and I have zero access to edit that source directly. So, I just made my own more optimized copy of the data source from basically scratch.

After a couple months of frustrating delays I could finally finish the project and send it off up the chain. 

I made sure to explain to my boss (in both a short and long version) what I did and why since I know it’s out of my job scope. Hopefully this doesn’t cause any drama on the team.

There is game theory in markets, if you think other rich people wont buy this , you'll not buy too. Because of this factor alone bear markets and bull markets get so extreme.

personalfinance,I know... it's been asked 100x: Tapping into 401k for a first time home purchase,"Hey all,

I'm 35 years old, single guy, make a little over 130k a year, and live in one of , not THE, but one of, the most expensive places possible. Long Island, NY.

I've rented my entire life, from 22 onward - I was always a renter. My current apartment situation (been here 8 years) has taken a turn for the worse, I always said to myself - no matter what, once I'm out of this apartment - I'm buying something and establishing some real equity.

So I figured, ok - the housing market seems a little crazy right now... Let me just rent for another year somewhere and figure this out. Boy was I mistaken, rental prices look like monthly mortgage payments now (and having a dog has really limited my options).

I've never been good at saving (coulda woulda shoulda), and will have a *little bit* of help from my mom. However am still coming up short to avoid PMI and make sure I put myself in a reasonably-comfortable situation. Houses are 600k here, and unless I want to live in a really shi\*ty neighborhood - that seems to be the going rate. I'm almost positive I can't go any higher than that.

I have about $112,000 **vested** in my current 401k (From job to job I've always just contributed the bare minimum match). To contribute more to a down payment and cover closing cost fee's I'm now looking at my 401k.

All you see is ""HORRIBLE IDEA"", ""NEVER TOUCH THAT"", etc etc. I'm sure for good reason - but do know some who have and haven't looked back since. I'd really like to take all the advice I can here as I'm a graphic designer and know next to nothing about personal finance!

I called fidelity to see what options are available:

**A straight withdrawal:** Taxed 20%, 10% IRS, and whatever NY State Tax is (which is probably insane). However, I can go as high as removing $90,000. Cash in hand, no monthly payments, no worry, just a extremely depleted 401k.

**A home loan:** Not taxed, 5 year loan, 6.5% interest rate, (about -$450 taken out of my paycheck monthly), MAX available $50,000... What actually scares me the most - If I were to change jobs, get fired, what have you -- I am on the line to pay that loan back in full in (I think she said) 60 days. I hate the idea of this. While I don't hate my job or fear being fired anytime soon, I do not like the idea of feeling ""stuck"". I am always keeping my eyes open to further my career - whether it be money or title driven.

\---

While I obviously don't plan on retiring anytime soon (I'm 35), I'm sure it's easy to say this now... but I never really plan on retiring. I'm not one looking ahead to some sort of ""finish line"". To me, this 401k is something I never check, can't access, and especially this year has preformed horribly.

Looking for advice on both sides of the coin, awesome to hear from anyone who has done this. I'm not sold on either option per se. But at this stage in my life, it seems to make the most sense, and hell... I could be hit by a bus tomorrow.

Would love to hear reddit's input here -- I tend to trust reddit more than my immediate family lol.

Thanks in advance,

*Greg*

personalfinance,Remain Contractor or go Govie,"So the long short is should I go Federal Gov at $89,947 + the upcoming COLA so we will say $93,544 or remain contractor and go from $88000 to $110,000. I would go in as NT4 which is around GS13 Step 4. It would take me 4 to 6 years govie to make 110k getting an NT5 position would bring that closer to 4 years. As I contractor I work on a strong program that has been around 20+ years at this point we are the typical incumbent on the project and we often win other contracts for the same project so stability is really great for a contract position we are currently on option year 1 of a 5 year contract so 3 more years left on it, we will very likely get work on it when that ends as well.

personalfinance,Bask Bank has disabled my account without explanation,"I opened a high-yield online savings account with Bask Bank about 3 months ago to take advantage of their competitive interest rates. Up to now I  have only made deposits.

Yesterday I attempted to transfer a five figure sum from my account to a linked bank account at Fidelity and noticed it was put on hold. I called customer support and was told that the fraud prevention team was reviewing my account for suspicious activity. When I pressed for more information the support team said they didn't have any details. Today, I am blocked from accessing my account entirely. An error message displays when I try to log in, saying my account is disabled.

I  call customer support again, asking for an explanation for this draconian action and am again told they don't know the reason. Asking for a supervisor to provide a specific reason for my account being blocked, I'm told they're not available and will need to call me back. 

This is an FDIC insured bank. I'm at a loss to understand how an account owner can be cut off from their funds without explanation or recourse. I've verified my identity and voice each time I speak with the company by providing personal data.

Anyone else seen anything like this? At least the credit card companies inform you when they observe suspected fraudulent activity and advise you on the necessary steps to take.

Forex,Can someone be unlucky?,"I realize that there are trending vs channel days. Clearly today was a trending day with the Jackson Hole news. I missed my chance to short US500 this morning because I didn't want to get stopped out during a possible morning pump before Powell's speech. I saw the price dip and then came back up to the open. I had another chance to short US500 but got nervouse because of how fast the price was going up from people covering. I thought that we could have seen an index squeeze on US500 because I have lost on trades like that in the past such as FOMC or CPI data. I was then hesitant to open a short position all day because of how fast the price was declining and didn't want to get stopped out on a reversal. I realize that I should have just bought during pre-market and kept the stop loss above the highest price of the day but I literally went to the bathroom for 5 mins and when I came back the price had dropped so much that it seemed to risky to short at that time. In hindsight, I could have opened the short position at any time today but it just seems to go against instinct and past trading rules because of how rare it is for a price to go straight down all day. I realize this is due to news which I guess is something that I am still learning to hold onto my trades longer and not worry about my stop loss getting hit. Do any of you place trades and walk away for a couple of hours?

For some reason I have trouble with putting my stop loss too close or too far away. I saw 3 great trades this week and tried to get in on them but for some reason I had terrible timing. For example, I had to go to the bathroom instead of placing a trade, got stuck in traffic and missed a trade (I don't think my forex funds allows trading on phones), and another was mismanaged stop loss by not hedging during a breakout against one of my trades.

I have been working a 9am-5pm job for the past 7 years while learning how to trade and invest. I learned how to invest before learning how to trade which was a bit problematic because I learned about indicators about 2 years after learning how to invest primarily because I thought that chart patterns were not real. As I progressed over the years I learned that chart patterns are real because of trading psychology, supply and demand, algorithms, and many other factors.

Any advice for being afraid to hedge when a position is going against me? I don't like to buy at the top or sell at the bottom but hedging can provide an extra cushion to the original trade. For example, if I open up a ""buy"" position and ""short"" the breakouts when it goes against me while moving the stop loss of the buy order down to provide an extra cushion to the original trade. I realize this can be risky as it can lead to having open positions at either extremes of either selling at the bottom or buying at the top. However, I have found it to be a useful strategy to prolong and manage trades that would have otherwise been stopped out. I realize that indicators and chart patterns can help with this.

I realize that the trades are my own fault. Maybe it is as simple as keep trying, not give up, and not get emotional while learning from past mistakes. I guess it just helps to hear any type of feedback from other successful traders.

How should I feel about missing out on big trades when I try different techniques on various days? For example, I am learning that consistency is best. I have found that I miss out on big trades because I will utilize one technique for 4 days and on the 5th day I will change my technique to something different only to realize that the original technique would have worked on the 5th day.",finance,1661550499

# **Powell comments fuel 1,000-point market rout Friday as stocks slide for a second week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks plummeted Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in his Jackson Hole speech the central bank won’t back off in its fight against rapid inflation.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,008.38 points, or 3.03%, to 32,283.40, with losses accelerating into the close. The S&amp;P 500 fell 3.37% to 4,057.66, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 3.94% to 12,141.71.
*****
&gt; The major averages declined for a second week. The Dow tumbled 4.2%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost roughly 4% and 4.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Powell reiterated a tough stance against inflation, spurring investors to weigh the implications of higher interest rates kept in place for a longer time.
*****
&gt; “Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” Powell said.
*****
&gt; “We do believe the Fed,” said Zach Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments. “We believe what they say that rates are going to be higher for longer and we’ve seen some repricing of the cuts in 2023. We think there’s more to go on that front and it’s likely to continue to fuel equity volatility from here.”
*****
&gt; The sell-off on Wall Street was broad-based, with just five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 posting gains on Friday.

&gt; # 2022 Slams Stocks and Bonds

&gt; It is no secret that 2022 has not exactly been the year of the 60/40 portfolio. This year has left nothing safe with both stocks and bonds hit hard. Both are in the red by 10%+ on a year to date basis headed into the final week of August. In the charts below, we show the year to date total returns of the S&amp;P 500 (y-axis) and the year to date total returns of various ICE Bank of America bond indices (x-axis) through August for each year going back to their respective inceptions (each index began in 1973 except for high yield which began in 1987). No matter which way you cut it, 2022 has been the worst year of the past half century for stocks and bonds combined.

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 down a little over 12% YTD, aggregate bonds (government and corporate bonds combined) are only around one percentage point better. For the comparable time of the year, the only years that also have seen both bonds and stocks sitting on a loss through August were 1973, 1974, and 1981. The same applies for government bonds. The corporate investment grade bond index has a bit more variety of years with stocks and bonds falling in 1974, 1981, 2008, and 2015. Again though, none of those other years have seen as sharp of a decline as 2022, and the S&amp;P 500's drop in the same time also ranks as one of the worst. 2022 is the only year that the high yield bond index has fallen simultaneously with stocks, however as we noted earlier, it does not have as long of a history as those other categories.

&gt; # Democrats Expected to Keep Senate Control

&gt; President Joe Biden currently has the worst pre-mid-term approval rating since President Truman in 1950. A multitude of factors, including inflation, the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, weakening economic data, age, and a lack of definitive action on campaign promises have all contributed to the President's unpopularity. Although Americans are generally dissatisfied with the President, betting markets still project a nearly two-thirds chance that Democrats retain control of the Senate (chart below from electionbettingodds.com). The only two previous Presidents that saw approval ratings lower than Biden's heading into mid-terms (since the start of WWII), Roosevelt in 1942 (third term) and Truman (first term) in 1946, ended up in the mid-terms losing twelve and five senate seats, respectively. In fact, only five Presidents have seen their party's position in the Senate improve or remain flat since the start of WWII in a mid-term election cycle. In these five cycles, the sitting President averaged an approval rating of 57.2%, which is 19.2 percentage points higher than that of Biden.

&gt; Although only 20% of Presidential terms since the start of WWII have seen their party gain Senate seats during mid-terms, subsequent sessions of congress following these election cycles passed some significant legislation. The 88th Congress (under the Kennedy/Johnson administration) passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, ethnicity, or national origin. In addition, that session of congress banned the discrimination of pay in regards to sex, and the 24th amendment was passed (which banned states from making the right to vote in federal elections conditional). The 92nd Congress (under Nixon) removed the dollar from the gold standard and established Title IX. The 116th Congress under Trump passed the CARES act, which helped the country recover from the pandemic and funded vaccination initiatives.

&gt; Regarding equity market returns, in the five mid-terms where the sitting President's party gained Senate seats in a mid-term election year, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 3.1% between the election date and year-end, posting gains three out of five times.

&gt; The table below summarizes every mid-term election year since the US entered WWII, For each cycle, we show the number of seats gained or lost by the President's party, the S&amp;P 500's YTD performance as well as the YTD change in the 10-year US Treasury yield. In terms of economic data, we also included a look at the y/y change in CPI and the Unemployment Rate (through September), and then finally Gallup's Presidential Approval Rating. Although one might assume that a strong stock market boosts the President's party in the Senate for the mid-terms, the equity market was down on a YTD basis heading into mid-terms in three of the five years highlighted above. However, the average y/y change in CPI was just 2.7% and only above 5% once. For the sake of comparison, y/y headline CPI as of the end of July currently stands at 8.5%. In terms of approval ratings, every other President who saw a gain in Senate seats in a mid-term election year had the approval of a majority of Americans, whereas nearly two-thirds of Americans currently disapprove of the President. Given this backdrop, the possibility of Democrats keeping their effective majority in the Senate would seem unlikely, but with less than three months until Election Day, the betting markets say otherwise.

&gt; # Dividend Breakout Despite Declines

&gt; In last Thursday's Chart of the Day, we highlighted how important dividends are for long-term investment performance. While dividends do help to boost investment returns over the long term, in the short term there is often an ebb and flow of dividend-focused ETFs under and outperforming in terms of price moves. For example, up until June, the S&amp;P 500's highest yielders measured by the SPDR S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Yield ETF (SPYD) had mostly been trading in the green whereas the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) was deep in the red.

&gt; With equities broadly taking a turn lower over the past week, SPYD has held up relatively well when compared to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY). Even though SPYD has not avoided declines (as we also showed in our decile analysis, the highest dividend payers have only slightly better performance than non-dividend payers), the relative strength line of SPYD versus SPY has broken out of the past couple of months' downtrend. That being said, it has not been a sharp move higher like what was observed in the first half of the year, particularly in the second quarter. In other words, the highest yielders are back to outperforming the broader market but not to the same extent as earlier in the year.

&gt; # Two Month Rally Rotation

&gt; Using the Russell 3,000 as a benchmark, US equities peaked exactly a week ago and have traded lower in all but one session since. In all, the Russell 3000 has fallen 4.33% in that time on weak breadth, albeit certain stocks have been hit far harder than others. Breaking the index down into deciles ranked by a variety of factors, performance has generally been the reverse of what we highlighted earlier this month in regards to the rally off of the June 16th low.

&gt; Over the past week, stocks with higher multiples and smaller market caps have fallen the most. Those are also the ones that had become the most elevated above their moving averages after outperforming during the two-month rally from mid-June to mid-August. Conversely, those stocks with more attractive valuations have tended to perform better, although, here too there have been low single-digit percentage declines across deciles. One other interesting point worth noting is how the highest dividend payers have been hit just as hard as other deciles for that category which is a big difference when compared to the spring when the highest dividend payers were the only pocket of positive performance.

&gt; # One Big Clue The Lows For The Year Could Be In

&gt; Are we having fun yet? The rollercoaster ride of 2022 continues, as the furious rally off the June 16 lows has taken a breather, with the S&amp;P 500 Index finding resistance right at its 200-day moving average, a logical place for a break after a big bounce. Worries over a hawkish turn from the Fed at the Jackson Hole Symposium later this week, housing suggesting the economy is falling quicker than expected, the war in Eastern Europe, and stubborn inflation have all been listed as reasons for the recent weakness. But after a 17.4% rally off the lows, maybe it was just time for a break.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-1-082522.png))**

&gt; We aren’t surprised stocks have to take a breather after the bounce since mid-June, but we continue to think that stocks have likely made their low for the year, and higher prices before year-end are quite possible. In fact, we discussed two reasons we feel this way in Two Reasons the Bulls Should Be Smiling.

&gt; Will it be easy? Probably not (It never is). One of the bigger near-term worries is simply the calendar. Historically, August and September are two of the weakest months of the year. Buckle up, as we could see some usual seasonal volatility once again, but the good news is later in the year stocks tend to do well, something we anticipate to play out again.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-2-082522.png))**

&gt; Now for some good news! The S&amp;P 500 made up more than half of the bear market losses, something that indeed should have bulls smiling. As we show below, since 1950, stocks have never gone on to make new lows after this happened. Now, this doesn’t mean they will go straight up from here, but the past 15 bear markets never moved back to new lows once this feat took place. Even more incredible is the S&amp;P 500 was never lower a year later either, up 19.3% on average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-3-082522.png))**

&gt; So there you have it, yet another clue that June 16 was likely the lows, and stocks potentially could be a good deal higher this time next year. The Carson Investment Research team continues to overweight stocks here, anticipating continued strength.

&gt; # Sentiment Slide*

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 pivoting lower in the past week, sentiment has reflected the move as the AAII sentiment survey showed bullish sentiment drop from 33.3% last week down to 27.7%. That marked the first time bullish sentiment fell in three weeks, and it was the largest single-week decline since an eleven percentage point drop the week of June 9th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082522-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment picked up the bulk of that decline as the reading topped 40% for the first time since the last week of July. At 42.4%, it is at the highest level since July 14th. Although that marks a shift toward more pessimistic sentiment, reversing a trend of improvement from the past few weeks, the current reading on bearish sentiment is well below the highs from throughout the spring and early summer.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082522-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Nonetheless, after coming within only a few points of a positive reading in the past month, the bull-bear spread took a sharp turn lower as a result of this week's results. The spread fell to -14.7 which is the lowest reading since July 14th. That was also the first double-digit week-over-week drop in the reading since June. Additionally, with a move deeper into negative territory, the spread is a week away from becoming tied for the second-longest streak of negative readings on record.

personalfinance,Help with choosing a health plan: PPO vs HDHP/HSA,"Hello!

I'm currently in Open Enrollment and having trouble picking the best health plan for me. I'm currently single no kids, 30yo F, located in California, generally healthy except for chronic lower back pain which I'm working on with a physical therapist. My current plan is the PPO, I'm considering switching to HDHP/HSA.

Current average medical expenses other than preventive:

* Physical Therapy 3x a month at $65 a visit: \~$195 a month (This is the negotiated rate so should be very similar to what I would pay on HDHP)
* Therapy once a month at $30 copay (Negotiated rate is $91 a visit so that's what I would pay on HDHP)
* Occasional primary care visit at $30 each (about 3 per year). Negotiated rate appears to be $150 according to my insurance claims
* A few prescriptions (hydroxyzine, propanolol, cyclobenzaprine, valcyclovir) - honestly considering getting these from Mark Cuban's site costplusdrugs especially if I switch to HDHP/HSA
* The occasional STD panel (Would this be considered preventive?)
* I plan on getting SMILE (similar to lasik) some time in the next 1-2 years which is about $7k and obviously not covered by insurance.
* So far have not needed any imaging such as x-rays or ultrasound- but who knows what could happens.
* Not planning to have children- eventually want to get sterilized (within the next 5 ish years)

CryptoCurrency,The silence here shows that many are in it for the fiat,"The activity on this sub has dropped off a cliff. While it would be simple to say that it’s the “bear market” the truth is that it’s lack of utility 

Even if price was volatile the majority of Alt-coin projects aren’t based 100% on financials. E.g Storage, Social Media,Gaming, Art etc... shouldn’t be as affected by a outside forces. Especially traditional market volatility. This is because: 

1. Crypto should an alternative cheaper solution to traditional markets
2. Cheaper prices, should actually increase demand of the base product thus increasing utilization 

E.g If individuals purchasing power is reduced and they can’t afford traditional online storage rates. They should adopt anybody “web3” storage as it is cheaper and marketed as better

However in reality this isn’t happening because in plain English “shit don’t work” 

Nearly a year ago I tried several storage and crypto-gaming projects and came to the conclusion that if it wasn’t for the financial element. Most if not all uses would not adopt them  because: 

1. The UI was terrible 
2. Traditional solutions have free alternatives that are better and open 
3.  The base product doesn’t need a crypto layer 

If we are going by Coffeezilla’s latest video and user data from Crypto-gaming. At least less than ~1% of most Alt-coin HODLers are actually using the projects. Meaning that without the free flow of Federal funds and cheap credit the market is effectively bankrupt

personalfinance,Math about renting vs buying - please check if I’m missing something,"I’d appreciate someone checking my reasoning and my math about buying primary residence vs renting. The numbers I have below are not the ones I’m considering but I’m using the same math and reasoning for my financial planning. 


Edit: after many comments and some more realizations, I’m editing this again. I realize that the rent I’m assuming below is too low. I’m adjusting after a brief search but keep in mind I’m doing this to understand the costs comparison but when applying it to my personal case I’ll try to find an estimate. 

Edit2: I realized one thing I had not considered, the mortgage interest deduction that applies to the interest on the first $750k of the loan and allows deducting an extra $22k the first 12 months and goes down afterwards. It changes things quite a lot I think but I won’t fix my calculations here since I don’t have time but wanted to leave this as an FYI because __as a result my calculations below are incorrect.__

With the current interest rates (~5%), seems like a $1M home would cost $1.8M (principal + interest, assuming 20% down). That’s $60k/year fixed. Additionally assume 1% of $1M in property taxes (1% increase per year) and 1% of the $1M in yearly maintenance cost (with 4% inflation) and $2k a year in insurance (4% inflation). That’s $12k/year at 4% inflation and $10k at 1%. To simplify the explanation let’s say the $10k are fixed so I’m total it’s: $60k/ year fixed for 30 years, and $10k/ year fixed + $12k/year with inflation for as long as I have the home. 

Meanwhile renting an equivalent place right now costs $45k a year, assuming 4% inflation per year that would be $2.7M over 30 years. No extra cost assumed here. 

Now onto opportunity cost: toward the end of the 30 years, renting becomes more expensive than the mortgage plus maintenance so one needs to also account for the opportunity cost the other way around. So in a spreadsheet I calculated the opportunity cost as the compounded return of investing surplus money to 9% return rate and applied to renting for the first 20 years and to buying for the remaining 10 years. The compounded gains of invested extra cash comes down to $3.2M for the surplus from renting over the first 20 years (assuming I leave the money in stock for 30 years which is a critical assumption) whereas the correction for the remaining 10 years created $200k. So net difference is $3M in favor of renting. 

After 30 years, the situation is:
- in case of buying, I spent a total of $2.7M, I own the home so the mortgage is over. I am just left with maintenance, insurance, and property tax which should be around $50k/year (~12k accrues with 1% and the remaining $38k accrue with inflation). I made $200k in investment with the money I didn’t spend in rent for the last 10 years. 
- in case of renting, I spent a total of $2.4M in rents, and I made $3.2M while investing the surplus rent money for the first 20 years and leaving them in stock account for 30 years. My rent is now $135k/year which accrue with inflation. 

Here there are several options: 
1) Let’s say I want to know how much I need to sell the home for to be in the same financial state as with renting. 
After renting, selling all stock (minus $200k) from rent (long term capital gains tax), will get $2.6M. So the net after renting is +$200k. Meanwhile after buying the net is -$2.7M. If I sell, I’ll pay 20% property tax on any gain over $500k. In order to match renting, I need my net profit to be $200k. Without tax that would mean I need to sell for $2.9M but with tax that comes up to $3.4M. In other words the home would have needed to appreciate by 4.1% annually. 

2) Instead of selling, let’s see how long it takes for the saved stock to be used up if entirely used to pay rent. Selling the $3.2M with 15% long term gain tax yields $2.7M. With rent at $135k and increasing with inflation that gives 14 years of rent.",finance,1661583536

It’s obvious but I’ve never thought of this and it makes me really uncomfortable. After diving into the world of blockchain, decentralized, consensus, it’s hard to really tolerate the idea that a single point can make a decision that impact the entire system so much.

I start to think, how do we end up like this? When there was no Fed, how did the financial system work in the world? Is it deterministic that there will be one dominant currency, if it was not US, it would be another country to take this role? Or actually a multi-dominant-currency system is also a possible stable state?

A few factors that affect Central Bank interest rates are -

* the demand of money in terms of borrowing within the economy and the borrowing done by local companies in the international markets
* the supply of money in terms of how much money is printed by the Central Bank with regards to the goods available in the market (if more money supply but goods are less then inflation can kick in and vice versa)
* the deficit or surplus the country generates in fiscal year for its budgets
* INFLATION
* the interest rates of other Central Banks and the exchange rate of your currency (if rates move higher or lower in a relatively stronger economy then money can move out or into your economy)
* the use of a Central Banks currency Worldwide (the US Dollar is used in more than 75% of the World's transactions)

CryptoCurrency,"Here's why crypto is down and why stocks dropped when JPow hasn't revealed anything new, and confirmed he's sticking to the same plan...","Keep in mind markets can be emotional, and also seemingly irrational.

# Why did stock drop when JPow revealed nothing new, and repeated what he had already said?

If you compare the bond and stock market, you can see that stocks may have gotten a little too optimistic.

They may have gotten a little too exited about some of the macro economic data showing improvements, and that maybe a bottom was behind us. And in the last few weeks, the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq went on a nice rally.

There's several reasons people on Wall Street got suddenly a little too confident about the future, and may have gotten premature optimism about Fed rates:

\-The big one was probably the CPI data for July, which was lower than expected, and showed a reversal of the inflation trend. However, it still showed high inflation, which JPow has already said was aiming to reduce.

\-Oil prices took a dive. In June, oil prices peaked at $123/barrel. In July, they dropped below $100, and even touched the 80s for the first time since January. Oil is entangled in many of the root causes of the recession, from the supply chain, to the cost of food/goods, to the biggest culprit in the high CPI numbers. So that was a huge positive signs for the upcoming months. Especially since historically, winter has by far the lowest demand for oil for the year.

\-Unemployment is still historically low. Even after the 2 consecutive quarters with negative GDP.

\-GDP numbers in the last quarter were still negative, but maybe not as low as some expected. And with the trade deficit continuing to improve, the GDP is likely to improve.

Stocks got a little too enthusiastic about all this. It may all be improving, but it's still not great.

But keep in mind, almost every time JPow speaks, the market goes initially in one direction, then in the opposite direction.

So we may still potentially have a Monday where markets will return in the opposite direction. We don't know yet if this will just be a brief emotional overreaction or not.

# Why is crypto dropping?

The crypto market is only partially following the narrative of the stock market. It still has a lot of its own supply and demand dynamics, its own volatility, and its own speculative market.

We had several weeks of uptrend. It started to feel like Bitcoin was on a non-stop escalator.

The market started to correct, then longs started to get liquidated. Longs, greed, and optimism had really piled up over the weeks, so it was gonna be a big correction.

Despite the diminishing correlation, there is still some correlation left to the stock market. We did drop to a 0.53-0.61 correlation for most of August, but the most recent JPow reaction has put us back on a 0.63 correlation.

The crypto market also had that same reaction to the JPow speech.

Still mild, but still relevant. But it's not so much that Bitcoin is necessarily following stocks, but it's reacting to the same root causes. In this case, the reaction to monetary policies.

If you look at many of these events, you can even see crypto sometimes reacting half an hour before stocks.

More importantly, crypto is not in a bull market yet.

While we may have hit the bottom, and we may be exiting the bear market, it doesn't mean we go directly into bull run mode, rampaging through resistance. We likely have a limbo market ahead of us, with a mix of some bullish trends and still some bearish trends, going back and forth.

The market is still not ready for big spikes in prices, and will correct.

&amp;#x200B;

# But what about the rest of the world?

Sorry if I'm talking mostly about the US.

But that's just how the crypto market reacts. It's reacting much more to the US trends, and it's still a very US-centric market. Adoption is still growing in other countries like India, Nigeria, Vietnam, Pakistan, Germany, Korea, Brazil etc...

But it's still gonna take a while to catch up to the US domination of the crypto market. Especially now that a lot of the massive Chinese mining has moved to the US.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr:**

Crypto doing its usual volatile thing, markets being emotional, stocks were getting a little overconfident with all the recent positive macro economic data, and built too high expectations from Feds, crypto isn't fully in a bull market yet and started to get too greedy. The break to $24K then $25K was a bit much, and was the catalyst for a correction. Longs got liquidated. JPow's speech added a little more fuel.",cryptocurrency,1661613743

stocks,"Fear not, Economy about to look better by year end. Cyclical factors that help.","TLDR at end.  
While  everything looks like doom and gloom out there, there are cyclical  factors at play RIGHT NOW that will continue to  improve the economy by  December:

  
\#1) School is back in session :  there will be an innate  boost in job growth as teachers, TA's and student asst's get back to  college and grade schools.  School back  has built in growth of consumer  staples like school supplies, lunches, books   etc.  The college  economy boosts bars and restaurants as kids eat out and party in college  towns.  And the biggest factor for schools is , FOOTBALL IS BACK,  the  NCAA college football season is one of the biggest boosters of the US  economy on a cyclical basis, stadiums take hundreds of people to run on a  weekly basis in every state, this will also boost jobs and sales of  said stadiums.

\#2)  NFL Football  is back, for the same reasons stated above, the NFL employs a lot of  people and boosts all types of consumer staples  on a cyclical basis.    Beer, meat, campers and related accessories are gonna be boosted at this  time of year.

SO While daddy Jpow  has promised to crash the economy fear not, as job numbers continue to  improve and year end earnings continue to rise  a sense of normalcy will  soon take hold by thanksgiving the FEAR will die after sept. and the  'soft landing' he seeks may be in sight.  I believe this is planned, the  fed knows this is the best time of year for the country and they expect  things to improve through end of year which will allow them to  'tighten' less by Dec.

Inflation  will continue to drop Month Over month as oil stays lower for longer,  the 'current thing' in europe will continue to drag on but seems to  already be 'baked into' the cake at this point.

A  bear is just a bull that wants to buy lower, i will be loading the boat  once we break below 4k S&amp;P. Full disclosure i am only holding  S&amp;P puts at this time that printed well friday. i will close puts  and be going full bore bull  into calls below 4K

&amp;#x200B;

Hello! Just to give you some context, me and my spouse are not the most financially savvy people on earth. We are doing well, own a house, decent jobs, but we're not experts at making long-term strategic financial moves based on numbers. We're just not wired that way.

We had to renew our electricity contract recently -we're in fort bend county, Texas- and with the increase in rates we've been looking into solar. I've met with three different companies and I liked Freedom Solar the most. However, we're still undecided on whether we should take the plunge or not.

Here are the numbers and facts:

**-Our usage:**

[This is our energy data consumption since we moved into our home according to smartmetertexas.com](https://preview.redd.it/9e2g9h4bxak91.png?width=3152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5241e6dde4a142c53bf7c25fbabac12e69764db3)

The spike since June is because of a split a/c we installed in our studio that was on 24/7. It will now be on *only* when the room is occupied by more than one-two people, so our usage should stay pretty close to what it was before.

So the average is about **1,050 kW per month**

**-Our current provider/contract:** Since we are considering solar, I decided to get into a 12 month contract with a decent rate and low termination fee. Once we decide wether we're doing solar or not we'll change providers and contract accordingly.

**Payless Power -** Average Price per kWh between 500-1000-2000 kWh is **16.8¢-16.4¢-16.2¢**

So, the *average* is about **$172 per month**, without including any fees that are added to the energy bill

&amp;#x200B;

\-**The solar proposal:** this is what they offered us

**Equipment**

\-25 SunPower M-Series 435 Watt Panels

\-25 SunPower Microinverters

\-SunPower Monitoring

\-SunPower Invisimount Racking

The system is rated at 10.875 kW and said to produce **15,147 kWh annually**

**Total Solar Investment$63,359**

**Teachers Discount$2,000**

**Federal Tax Credit$18,408**

**Heat Wave Promotion$350**

**Bottom Line$42,601**

&amp;#x200B;

**Warranty:** Hassle-free 25-year power, product, and service warranty on the entire system from one company.

&amp;#x200B;

**PAYMENT SCHEDULE (25 Year 1.49% APR Loan)**

\-Financed Amount - $61,359

\-Months (1-18) Payments - $175

\-Months (19-300) Payments (FTC Applied to Loan) - $175

\-Months (19-300) Payments (FTC Pocketed) - $252

&amp;#x200B;

After everything is said and done we'll be paying a total of **$52,500 if we apply the tax credit towards the balance.**

If we pocket the tax credit, we're looking at **$74,214**

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think will be the best decision, considering that:

\-Electricity rates will continue to go up

\-However, the cost of going solar most likely will lower in the long-term

\-Texas is sort of unpredictable, I think so?, in regards to its energy policies

\-If we go solar, this is the only way for us to do it. We can't pay it in cash upfront nor go the DIY route.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day we're trying to save money. You advice is greatly appreciated.

Thank you!",energy,1661627320

I'm looking to put some money into some i-bonds but I wanted to clear up some confusion I had about them: 

I know that ""for bonds issued from May 2022 through October 2022, the combined rate is 9.62%"" but does that mean the interest rate will change in October no matter when you buy in that period?

For e.g, which of these actually happens: 

* Option A: I buy an I-bond in September and the 9.62% rate is only applied for one more month (until October) and then the interest rate changes 

OR 

* Option B: I buy an I-bond in September and the 9.62% rate is applied for 6 months (until March 2023) and the interest rate changes for me starting in March to whatever the rate is at that time

And I get it, the complex is 40 years old and needs repairs but man that's a lot of money

Here is the terms of the loan

    LOAN MATURITY: Term Loan: Up to 25 years;
    AMORTIZATION: Term Loan: Principal and interest payments monthly with an amortization of up
    
    to 25 years (the amortization period will match the term of the loan);
    
    INTEREST RATE: Term Loan: Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB index) 10‐year bullet rate + 2.50% (as
    of 8/8/2022 the rate would be 6.02%) with a floor of 6.02%. The rate will reset
    after 10 years at the FHLB 5‐year bullet rate + 2.25%, with a floor of 6.02%;
    At the current rates noted above, the payment would amount to
    approximately $35,801.21 per month, $322 per month per unit on average
    (assuming all 111 units are equally paying the assessment);

This just seems crazy. Lets say I had no choice but to pay this. I have a 2.8% interest rate on my mortgage. Could I somehow add $50,000 to my existing load without changing the terms and just pay off the special assessment? That way I am essentially paying it back with my much lower interest rate from my mortgage?

Retirement situation is otherwise generally on track and emergency funds healthy, plus money is set aside to make a down payment.

Is that a good idea?

On the other hand, it’s not a tremendous amount of money in the grand scheme of things, and I suppose if the rate is super high I could prepay on the mortgage and reduce retirement contribs.

It used to be that the average car loan was 36 months. Now, with cars so expensive, they've had to kick financing options out to *96 months*. Even at a low interest rate, carrying an auto loan for *8 years* is pretty ridiculous.

As far as buying it out goes, the lowest interest rate I got with 800+ score is 4.9% over 60 months. I could just pay for it cash but I would take my savings down under the 6 months emergency threshold (would take probably 4-6 months to recover). 

Another option I have is to take a loan from my dad interest free, but he told me to pay him back at $400 a month because he is planning on retiring within a year or so.

MachineLearning,[D] Can neural networks perceive time ?,"The recent debate about neural networks being conscious made me curious about different attributes of consciousness and to what extent neural networks exhibit them.   


I came across this interesting paper ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08194-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08194-7)) which seems to claim that activity in visual classification networks (like AlexNet) can be used as a proxy for subjective time ! 

&amp;#x200B;

The machine learning relevant section from the paper is the following:

At each time-step, a video frame was fed into the input layer of the network and the subsequent higher layers were activated. For each frame, we extracted the activations of all neurons from layers conv2, pool5, fc7 and the output probabilities. For each layer, we calculated the Euclidean distance between successive states. If the activations were similar, the Euclidean distance would be low, while the distance between neural activations corresponding to frames that include different objects would be high. Each network layer had an initial threshold value for the distance in neural space. This threshold decayed with some stochasticity over time. When the measured Euclidean distance in a layer exceeded the threshold, the counter in that layer’s accumulator was incremented by one and the threshold for that layer was reset to its maximum value. 

&amp;#x200B;

I highly recommend reading the paper for more details.

&amp;#x200B;

I am personally skeptical about the paper's claim for the following reasons:

\- Authors claim that the CNN classification network is functionally similar to human visual processing.

&amp;#x200B;

The authors use AlexNet pretrained on ImageNet. Alexnet top 5 error is 15.3 %  ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet)) whereas human top-5 classification error  is 5.1 %. ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575)).  Alexnet's accuracy is far lower than human performance. Due to this performance difference, I don't think that it is appropriate to claim that ""human visual processing and AlexNet are functionally similar"". 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Euclidean distance in high dimensional spaces mayn't be appropriate

&amp;#x200B;

The paper uses Euclidean distance between network activations to successive inputs for a given network layer and applies the dynamic threshold in the change detection stage. When this distance exceeds the threshold level, a unit of subjective time is supposed to have elapsed.

The neural network activations are in a high dimensional space and it is known that euclidean distance is usually NOT a good metric in high-dimensions. [https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/99191](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/99191)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Their threshold calculation (equation 1 of the paper) seems to incorporate temporal priors (pacemaker criticism) . The choice of adding stochastic Gaussian noise also seemed arbitrary to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The authors address the pacemaker criticism i.e. regular updates taking the role of a clock in the supplementary discussion.

In Supplementary Fig. 2 it is shown that random frame order leads to wrong estimates. When the input rate was kept at 30 Hz, but with a random presentation order of frames, thereby disrupting the flow of content in the video, the time estimate was very different.

The authors don't comment upon the choice of T\_min &amp; T\_max used in these experiments. Was it the same as the original experiment ? If so, did they try tuning the threshold values, tau and alpha when random frames were shown to the network ?

Such tuning is not mentioned nor implied. I wonder if the results would have been different if they tuned these parameters like they did for the 30Hz rate case.

&amp;#x200B;

I am curious about what you guys think ? Can neural networks perceive time ?  
I am curious if transformer based classification models which don't share visual inductive priors like CNNs can perceive time.  Please share if you know about any such work.

It's at a federal contracting company and the work's gotten really repetitive, and half the days, it doesn't even feel like I'm doing cybersecurity work. I'm trying to move to a different area in cybersecurity, maybe pentesting or something, but I don't have the current skillset for that so I'm not able to apply for pentesting roles, as my current role isn't that super technical as is.

Apart from just Linux, I have no idea what else to do and I don't really know any other cybersecurity professionals to get some guidance from.

stocks,A New era in economic policy,"At Jackson hole, Wallstreet has finally got the clarity it’s been looking for after Jerome Powell’s speech. The message is loud and clear. The fed will do whatever it takes to stop inflation even if that means breaking the economy. 

This is bad news for investors. And a significant moment in economics as a whole.

      “The 12 year party is finally over”

The federal reserve will no longer be bailing out wall-street (they where actually subsidizing) interest rates will now normalize to pre 2008 levels.

wallstreet has now become an adversary to the federal reserve.

You see, the federal reserve’s bailouts and low interest rate policies have created a social crisis. 

Asset bubbles, and a rapid rise in stock prices. Have made corporations more powerful. And left a vast majority of all wealth to the 1%. 

There is very little economic mobility in America and income inequality is causing class warfare within the masses. 

Political polarization has become dangerous and very extreme. (On both sides.)

Billionaires are becoming more powerful than governments themselves, and creating their own agendas for how they see the world should function. (Playing god)


                            A NEW ERA.

After Bidens inauguration, he made a bold statement that everyone missed. He said “AMERICAS BACK” and back indeed it is, 
Federal agencies along with the federal reserve have had enough. The government must get back in control. 

There is a new financial revolution going on behind the scenes. Which will make finance more equitable and fair. The federal reserve is in the research and development stage of creating a new type of money. That will allow the government more control over the economy. (Note I will not go into detail due to controversial nature of this topic)
 
Wallstreet is now on its own. Investors in the equities market must rely on fundamentals and companies will have to generate profits and innovate to stay in business and see higher returns on their stock price. 

Cheap credit will also be a thing of the past. Consumers and business will have to be more conservative with credit purchases. And that whole “get rich off debt” will hopefully be a thing of the past. 

The power will be restored back to the citizens of America. Not billionaires, not corporations, not wallstreet firms and institutions. 

REMEMBER!

personalfinance,Car Loan Interest Rate Refinancing,"So we are trying to trim the fat off of some of our debts.  We are already in a debt repayment program that has negotiated our credit card interest rates wayyyy down from what they were. It has helped a lot! But now we are looking to refinance our auto loan.

Our current balance is right at $10,000, and our monthly payment is $287. Our APR is 8.99%.  We have pretty good credit--mine isn't too hot right now around 640, but my husband's is at 740. We both work full time at salaried positions, but we both just started these jobs in August after relocating to a new state. I'm worried no one will approve us for a refinance, even though we were literally just pre-approved for a mortgage (that we won't be acting on because things are just too tight right now), because we're too new to our jobs and our rotating balance is always super precarious.

But I also know that even if our APR dropped to 5% we'd save almost $1,000 in interest and pay it off a year faster making the same payments. (According to this online calculator I'm using anyways).

Any advice? Should we even be tackling this right now? I just feel like we have an unusually high interest rate on this car and could pay it off faster with a lower rate.  Should we just sell the car? I hesitate to do that because we've been scammed three times in the last month by supposed professionals and I don't want to go through that with buying another car.

economy,The conditions for a deep global recession are finally in place,"Last week, two events have taken place that will predetermine a deep global recession in the coming year. This is the annual world conference of representatives of central banks in Jackson Hole, which in recent years has become an important platform for the Fed to announce future monetary policy; and a statement by Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman that OPEC+ may cut oil production quotas.

World markets expected the Fed to soften its rhetoric against the backdrop of slowing inflation, which over the past few weeks has contributed to the recovery of commodity and stock markets. Markets also expected the Fed to begin a cycle of rate cuts shortly after the end of the rate hike cycle. The inflation slowdown that had begun filled the financial markets with extraordinary optimism, spiced with a lack of desire on the part of market players to study the structure of the inflationary process in the United States, as [despite the slowdown, inflation in the US is becoming more and more sustained](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/wly9kd/inflation_in_the_us_overcame_the_peak_but_there/).

However, members of the Fed, so far, do not suffer from the blindness of financial markets and, as part of the conference in Jackson Hole, made a number of tough monetary statements that became a cold shower for the US stock market: the S&amp;P 500 index fell by 3.5% on Friday. Thus, the head of the Fed, J. Powell, said that the regulator will continue to raise rates, and at the next meeting, an “unusually large” rate increase is again possible, which means a rate increase of 0.75 percentage points a third time in a row. He also said that after the end of the cycle of raising rates, it would be necessary to keep them high ""for some time"" ([which, however, is not news to my regular readers](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/wk9lyk/landing_wont_be_soft/)), thereby dispelling market expectations for a quick move by the Fed to ease monetary policy next year.

Thus, we are likely to increase rates to around 3.5% or even slightly higher and keep them there for a long time. Considering that the previous time the global economy began to rapidly slow down already at the level of the Fed rate of 2.5%, then at a rate of 3.5% or more, we are definitely in for a deep recession.

In anticipation of a recession, as we remember, the oil market showed a downward trend in prices, which, apparently, did not please Saudi Arabia, which decided to carry out verbal interventions. According to the Saudis, oil futures are too volatile and do not reflect the situation on the market, namely the lack of free oil production capacity, which in Arabic means ""we want to keep prices high."" Also, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which supported it, announced the possibility of reducing OPEC + quotas for oil production if a “nuclear” agreement is reached between the United States and Iran and Iranian oil enters world markets.

A decline in commodity prices during a rate hike or recession cycle has always acted as a softening economic factor and has done much to kick-start a new cycle of economic growth. However, this time, the actions of central banks, Russia and Saudi Arabia are leading us into a global recession with continued high commodity prices. At the same time, Russia and Saudi Arabia are helping to kick-start a self-sustaining process: high oil and gas prices will keep inflation high, encouraging the Fed and ECB to further tighten monetary policy and keep interest rates high for longer.

The global economy will obviously not be able to cope with such high pressure from both sides and will go into decline mode. It's hard to imagine a more perfect cocktail to trigger a deep and prolonged global recession that will hit Russia's and Saudi Arabia's friends in authoritarian developing countries the hardest.

The recession will thus continue until the global economy moves to a new energy supply/demand equilibrium, which is likely to be well below current levels. This means that the decline in energy demand will not end until it leads to a fall in oil and gas prices. At the same time, the recovery of the world economy after such a crisis may take many years, and by that time the demand for oil will already begin to be affected by the energy transition being carried out by developed countries.

Thus, we are probably witnessing the swan song of authoritarian oil and gas regimes, which for the last time enjoy their imaginary power over the world, not noticing how they are leading themselves into the abyss.

economy,"the west at a turning point, market crash and more","As a species we are at a typing point and the economic strength of the west at the greatest threat since the second world War.
Decades of prosperity and lavish life's have been possible for a majority of the people within the western hemisphere. Sure there have been poverty, malnutrition and poor access to education for millions, even within developed western nations, but the larger population has been enjoying a good life. From car ownership to mobile phones, large tvs to regular vacationing and travel the world. A flourishing middle class and good salaries. At least so it seemed at the surface. The slowly enlarging social divide, our fundamental economics weakens and other demographic issues where well covered by strong consumer sentiment and full stomachs (for the most part). The onset of the pandemic however painted a horrible picture for all those smart enough to see:

1. Our politicians are incompetent and our systems incapable of rapid coordinated responds in a true emergency. Even worse we as a community unwilling to follow the simplest of instructions or able to utilize our common sense
2. Scarcity kicks in faster than we thought. Wrong consumer behavior and poor supply chains lead to quick disruptions
3. Solidarity was a scars thought concept

We didn't fully recover from the economic and social disruption and putin started a war further crippling our supply chains, and pointing out our next issue, hyper dependency of energy supply from corrupt and unpredictable governments.

As if that is not bad enough climate change is kicking in and droughts are hitting countries across the globe.

Markets rely on consumers and consumers rely on income. Corporations in return need consumers and skilled works to thrive, otherwise their capex dries up.
Today we are having a unique situation that can lead to a global economic collapse.
Yes we are in the age of quantum computation, AI and biotech, at the same time our supply chains are bust, energy costs will drive manufacturers and opex spend in the worlds 4th largest economy (Germany), which is Europes economic motor, through the roof. Many businesses are close to defaulting from the blows they suffered during lockdown, tax buckets are depleting fast, and a huge refuge wave from Ukraine is getting white washed and over simplified. Ontop of the refugees from the middle east and Africa and the soon to be coming climate refugees... And most Western countries have no glorious integration history... See ghettos on France, Italy and so on.
Furthermore given the energy and supply chain prices am already expensive housing market is killing the dream of 25-45 year old to own their own home. For the first time in generations housing for the middle class is fading. The situation is even more extreme, the inflation is way higher than the interest rate you get on your money, as the interest rates are climbing your money is still losing in value as the raise in interest rates is not out performing the speed with which food, housing and travel are getting expensive. Despite increasing interest rates housing in metropolitan areas is not decreasing it is just more expensive to get loans, however due to heavily increased construction costs no one is willing to reduce cost of new housing. A spiral that is a result of the Marco economy and not as some politions are painting it due to good income. We are reaching a stage in which some cities are still unaffordable even at 100k USD income per year.
In the mean time a few are getting very rich and we have more rich people than ever before but we have over proportionally more poor and a dying middle class who is the net tax payer as the really rich don't pay and the really poor don't either.
Accumulating wealth has become almost impossible, the markets to unstable, no interest rates in cash and unaffordable housing, all while salaries are pretty much at a level that has grown with 1-3% per year in the last 20 years while real inflation has been 3-10% per year on avarage given the recent acceleration.
Given all these circumstances, how should markets keep growing given the Marco, natural and demographic challenges we have. The next slightest disruption in the current volatile global situation will send markets to the same level as in 2010 wiping out trillions of dollars, with bailouts being much more difficult to stem than in 2008.

vet,FIPV Kitten Concerns,"Hi guys. Sad story time. 

I rescued a 6 week old kitten back in April. It’s mother was a barn cat and died after it gave birth. My kitten was bottle fed until it was 6 weeks old and then was transferred to a rescue shelter. I picked him up from the shelter the day after he arrived (so he spent 1 day there).  

At the shelter he was in a walk in closet sized gated space with 2 other kittens not from his litter (with a shared litter box). And there were like 20-30 cats free roaming the rescue center but it didn’t look like they bothered the kitten pen or got inside it at all.

Anyway, I took my kitten home at the end of April and after 3 months things got really bad. The month of July he began developing FIPV. Fluid samples confirmed the diagnosis.  It was really bad, and he was so lethargic and weak. About the middle of August his belly was nearly the size of a cantelope… I opted to have him euthanized. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. 

My question regarding FIPV: my biggest concern is that this might happen again? What are the chances of this? I have a dog in the house but I’ve been told they can’t carry or transfer FIPV.  Could there be anything in my household that gave my kitten FIPV?  Not sure if worth noting but my roommate has a bearded dragon.

Specifically, it says ""You can get a refund for any payment (including auto-debit payments) you make during the payment pause (beginning March 13, 2020). Contact your loan servicer to request that your payment be refunded.""

Let's say you had an $8,000 balance prior to the pandemic, and paid $3,000 off since Mar. 13, 2020, leaving you with a current balance of $5,000. If you ask for a refund from your servicer, your payments will be issued to you back in cash. So in this, you will receive $3,000. However, your overall student loan balance will go back up to $8,000.

After that, you would apply for student loan forgiveness. Assuming you're under the income restriction and a non-Pell grant borrower, you will have $8,000 forgiven, leaving you with no student loan debt. From there, you can decide what to do with the $3,000 that was returned to you.

However, while some people have moved forward with requesting their refunds from their servicers, some experts are advising to wait until more details are released from the Department of Education to understand how pandemic-era student loan payments will affect overall balances and eligibility for student loan forgiveness.”

stocks,Margin account and line of credit hybrid,"Are there any brokers/banks which offer such product?

For example, you buy $1000 of AAPL with your own cash.
Then you borrow $500 on margin and take $500 out of this account as cash. You pay low interest rate on $500(slightly higher than treasury rate)

Then AAPL drops by 60% and your account is now worth $400.

Interest on high beta stocks will be lower than interest on low beta stocks. Since all users are selecting stocks more or less randomly, in total they will approximate SPX.

Most brokers would have issued a margin call, but hybrid loan would provide $400(fully collateralized at low interest) + $100(unsecured at relatively high interest but still much lower than credit cards because broker will be able to buy SPX puts against multiple portfolios at the same time to limit their own risk). With interest calculated daily depending on price of the portfolio.

They can also give an option to combine HELOC into the same portfolio to automate pulling/pushing from it as price changes to decrease interest even more.

And your account will be able to go into negative up to approved limit of your ""personal line of credit"" before getting margin called, or whatever it is called. 

Once you get into negative territory, you have to start mandatory monthly payments to cover interest + some of the principal. Default may lead to margin call.

personalfinance,Financial advice for travel outside the US?,"I’m not sure where to post this and I apologize if it shouldn’t be here. I’m kind of an amateur “churner” but not really. 

I’m wondering what the best way is to have funding when traveling? 

I’ll be in Curacao for a week in January. I have a number of credit cards, which I opened for the sign on bonuses as well as higher rewards for certain purchases. 

Some cards I’ve had for a while, and some have been opened between January and now, either in my name or my spouses. We’ve already accumulated enough $ to pay for our plane tickets, and have another $2k in a separate savings set aside for our trip.

We never use cash or debit cards unless we absolutely have to. 

We have a travel credit card that has no international transaction fees. I’m not sure if any others do too. 

Should we solely use the travel card? Should we bring cash? Should we get cash there? Should we use other credit cards with no transaction fees and try to maximize rewards based on spending categories? 

Should I bring all of our credit cards and allow cash advances on them in case of a medical emergency? (I once had a boss whose wife needed an ER in Mexico and they wouldn’t help her until they gave $20k cash or something outrageous. I realize Curacao and Mexico are very different, but I would rather be safe than sorry, for any emergency. 

Our primary savings and emergency fund are with an online financial institution and it would take a couple days to get it transferred and have access to it. 

I also have a credit card with a local credit union with a $15k limit with the lowest interest rate I could find - 8.9%

Any help is appreciated, and please be kind if you think this is a stupid question.",finance,1661732819

personalfinance,College student with $3000 depreciating in a savings account. What should I do?,"I have about $3000 in a savings account, and I’m wondering if it is sensible to invest it so that I can essentially forget about it for ~5 years.

I will be coming out of my program with about $30,000 in student loan debt. Interest will accrue over the period I hold the loans, but repayment begins 6 months after I get my degree. Assuming interest rates remain stable ish, I’ll accrue roughly $4000 in interest. 

Rather than paying down my student loans now, I’m wondering if I should invest the money in some ETFs, bonds, or a fund of some sort where I hope it will grow at a faster rate than my interest accrues. 

Is it dumb of me to try and invest the money I have currently? I’m wondering if I invest now and forget about it for 5 years if I will actually owe more money than if I paid off as much of the loans as I could. 

My ultimate goal with this money is to have as little debt as possible after my program, and I am struggling to figure out if investing, or paying off the debt I currently have in a lump some is the better option. 

Thank you!

Also, I know people will likely mention to have an emergency fund before doing anything else. I have a small emergency fund (I could buy a plane ticket costa rica lol), and I have all living costs (food, housing, and transportation) covered through loans and a small university stipend.

Warren sure sounds like a shill for big business. Also, people keep acting surprised that rate hikes are still continuing, just like clearly outlined for months.

stocks,$SHYF - The Shift Group - A first look,"*cross-posted to* r/ValueInvesting

The Shift Group ($SHYF) is a company that manufacturers chassis for specialty vehicles and assemblies for the commercial vehicle (including last-mile delivery, specialty service and vocation-specific upfit segments) and recreational vehicle industries.  They've been in business since 1975.  They split their business into two reportable segments: Fleet Vehicles and Services (‘‘FVS’’) and Specialty Vehicles (‘‘SV’’), and they own: Utilimaster, Royal Truck Body, DuraMag, Blue Arc, Magnum, Strobes-R-Us, Spartan RV Chassis, and Builtmore Contract Manufacturing.  Commercial vehicles are sold under the Aeromaster®, Velocity, Trademaster®, and Utilivan® product brand names.  The industry sector is cyclical, but they report that their diversification across several sub-sectors reduces the overall risk becuase of the various markets served tend to have different cyclicality.

They've recently introduced Blue Arc, a division that is building is a complete battery-electric, Class 3 truck.  As of this writing and with production planned to start on 2023, they are the only company specifically in the Class 3 EV Chassis environment.   Class 3 vans weigh 10,001 to 14,000 pounds and have additional licensing requirements over Class 2 vehicles.  In general, they are designed to last 15 years or more and meet warehouse dock heights for loading and unloading.

The FVS segment accounts for 66% of the sales, while the SV segement makes up the other 34%.  Over the past five years sales have increased by $587.6 million, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.2%, while income from continuing operations has grown by $52.5 million, a CAGR of 41.4%, and Adjusted EBITDA has grown by $76.4 million, a CAGR of 35.9%.

On February 1, 2020, they completed the sale of their Emergency Response Vehicle (ERV) business.  In September 2020, that deal was finalized with a recognized loss on sale of $3.3m for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The ERV business included operations in Charlotte, Michigan, and operations in Brandon, South Dakota; Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska; and Ephrata, Pennsylvania.  This segment had been a losing proposition for a number of years.

**Specific Risk Factors to the business**:

* **Concentrated customer base/sales**: In 2021, Amazon accounted for 25.1 percent of consolidated sales. Their top 10 customers accounted for 60.6 percent of sales.  I believe they are diversifying their customer base, but as I'm writing this I am struggling to find the numbers to support my memory.

* **Implementing a New Information Technology System**: short-term issue.  Multiple locations are being upgrade to a new system.  It could affect production if something goes catastrophically wrong.  Having been through bad ERP software changes, I think this a low risk to the long-term.

* **Supply Chain Disruption**: This is simply a problem for everyone right now.  If they somehow fall behind as things improve in the future, then this could be a serious issue.

* **Rising Interest Rates and Material Costs**: Aluminum and energy costs are increasing.  At this time analysts are projecting decreased EPS in 2023.  It could be a rough 12-24 months in the market as a result.  This is not really a problem for a long-term investor.  Could be more of an opporuntity if it comes to that.

**Some of the numbers**:

* Market Cap:	873.23M (current)

* PE Ratio:	20.92 (current)

* PS Ratio:	0.88 (current)

* P/FCF:  34.03 (as of 12/2021)

   * Free cash flow in the first two quarters of 2022 have declined, however, this seems to be an annual trend.  I believe they front load some of their annual cash outflows.  I'm still working on this hypothesis.

* Current Ratio:	1.74 (current)

* Quick Ratio:	0.56 (current)

* Debt / Equity:	0.58 (current)

* ROE:	17.60%

* ROA:	9.30%

* ROIC:	17.20%

**Thesis**

This company has very little debt and nearly $1billion in sales backlog.  This is a 100% increase since the prior year with a 46.7% increase in Revenue YoY.  I believe it is well positioned in the inflationary environment we find ourselves in.  I believe they have brand recognition in their sector, and  a first mover advantage in the subset of Class 3 EV vehicles.  They have a tremendous capital allocator in CEO Daryl Adams.  He has laid out a sold plan for this company since coming on board (this is also a weakness to the thesis, if he leaves).


A Value Investors Club write up by a long-time member states, *""Growth in the size of major fleet cariers from 250,000 units in 2020 to 450,000 in 2025.(12% CAGR). The growth is from a 100k retiring/replacement cycle and 200k market growth. This is all per a comissioned 'third party study'. The growth is expected to come from a 7-10% CAGR in parcel delivery volume via growth in e-commerce through 2025. The company estimates that Covid had pulled e-commerce adoption curve forward by 2-3 years.""*  In the past 6 years, Revenue had grown at a 16% CAGR.  This leads me to believe they are positioned to take advantage of this projected growth.  Optimistically, they'll increase their market share.

**Valuation**

I have two simplified valuations that put the current intrinsic value between $32-$40 per share.  Due to my inexperience I apply a \~40% margin of safety, which puts it at a buy between around $20.00 to $24.00 per share.

personalfinance,Seller accepted offer to buy condo but not sure,I live in San Diego and I recently put an offer in on a condo near where I currently live and work but I feel that looking at the figures the numbers are scaring me. If I were to go into this my monthly payments given my 75K downpayment (P+I+tax+homeowners insurance) including HOAs would be close to $3400 a month which would leave me with little breathing room on my income ($97k) especially after closing costs and things like that. My agent is claiming that the seller might be willing to buy the points down and that would bring me to a payment of closer to the $3000 to 3200 area but I'm still very nervous about going in right now. Housing is insanely competitive in my area (rents there vary from 2600 to 2800 on the same type of unit) and the offer the seller accepted is about $50k less than other units in the complex but I'm not sure that even matters given how quickly the market is changing. I also do have the ability to wait since I live with family at a way lower cost and I get along with them. I also won't lose earnest money deposit if I were to back out since the seller does have other offers and I haven't even made it to escrow yet.

personalfinance,I-Bonds or 529 to fund grad school? (Under 24 yrs old),"Hi! I am saving up to put myself through grad school in around 3 years and i recently found out that i-bonds are locked in at a 9.82% interest rate through Oct 2022. This means that any bond purchased before Nov 1 will have this high interest rate for the next 6 months. 

You can avoid federal income tax on i-bonds for education expenses - but you must be at least 24 years old at the time of deposit to qualify. I turn 24 in Jan 2023. 

Because I am not yet qualified for the i-bond educational tax break, should I wait to buy in until I’m 24? I still feel as if I should buy i-bonds because those guaranteed returns far outpace anything I could hope for from my 529, especially in this market. For context, the fund in my 529 has a 10 yr return of 1.34%.

personalfinance,What are your thoughts on Real Estate Private Lending?,"I've invested about 20% of my retirement savings in private real estate notes through a bridge lender and earned about 10%pa with this method for the past three years without incident.

Combined loan-to-value ratios do not exceed 70% and the properties and borrowers are well vetted to limit the chance of defaults and to lose money if a foreclosure happens.

3. Max out Roth 401k
4. Other? What else should I consider doing instead?

**Goals**

1. Retirement by 40-50 (is this even possible lol? what changes would I need to make such as cutting down dining out expenses?)

# SimCLR: a framework for unsupervised learning by Google Research

***Original article:*** [A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709)

The method is based on *the contrastive loss function,*

https://preview.redd.it/4mjsb17q8mk91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d67343e145a5f79c68fa681896a5fda3c83087b

where *z* is the output of the network (linear layer), and *sim* is the similarity function between the two vectors. Ipso facto, the cosine distance is used

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/edixra9r8mk91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb6261e20d77d3431541e68f4e9336749285e02d

The loss function is calculated for a positive pair of examples (i, j) representing the same object, but with different properties. The curly 1 in the denominator can take two values (0 and 1) and serves to indicate that k is not equal to i. Thus, the sum at the bottom consists only of different vectors (the distance to itself is not added, always being equal to 1). τ is an additional adjusting parameter, called temperature.

Two augmented representations are created for each object, and the loss function, as described above, is calculated for them. Therefore, information on the pairwise distance to other objects is contained only in the sum of the denominators in the loss function.

A large batch size (from 256 to 8,192) was used for training; augmentation doubled the number of objects per training step. The authors claim that regular SGD optimizers may be unstable in this situation, so they opted for[ LARS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03888.pdf). They also used global batching normalization with the same mean and variance for all the devices used in training.

I would also like to note that the authors use the metric to compare vectors coming not from the encoder but from a fully connected linear network that follows it (two fully connected linear layers). They claim this works better than directly comparing embedding by a convolutional network.

The gif below explains the learning process. The same network is fed first a batch of images and then their augmented copies. The resulting vectors are compared, and the network places the embeddings from one source as close as possible in the feature space while spreading them between the vectors of different source images.

&amp;#x200B;

[ SimCLR learning process ](https://i.redd.it/7gkzwort8mk91.gif)

The authors tested numerous augmentations, as shown below. A maximum of two transformations combined was used.

[The result of the augmentation application](https://preview.redd.it/nfwqa5cv8mk91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9769db226ee6714daae489ccc229ae2c052a6dcd)

Out of all augmentation combinations, the ones that brought the best result were studied closely.

# SimCLRv2: an updated version with a teacher network

Original article: [Big Self-Supervised Models are Strong Semi-Supervised Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029)

In the fall of 2020, the authors published an article describing the updated approach version. Here are the three main points that set it apart from the initial one:

* More profound, wider networks are used as encoders.
* The output contains more internal layers of a fully connected neural network.
* A memory mechanism for buffering negative examples is added.

Unlike the first version, the first MLP layer was used to fine-tune the network for specific classes. Previously, this part of the network was discarded, and embeddings received from the encoder were used instead.

Also, the new version contained three training stages (as compared to two in the initial one):

1. Training an extensive network without a teacher. The network was trained without any specific task, with the main features highlighted.
2. Fine-tuning with a teacher on a small batch of marked-up data for a specific task.
3. Training a second, more compact network (student) using the markup provided by the first extensive network.

# A study of SimCLR properties

***Original article:*** [Intriguing Properties of Contrastive Losses](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/628f16b29939d1b060af49f66ae0f7f8-Abstract.html)

The Brain Team at Google Research published an article covering the general properties of this approach to training. In it, they generalized the loss function used when comparing objects. The authors also conducted a study with images featuring a considerable number of objects. They created an artificial dataset for this purpose; see examples below. This dataset was used in unsupervised learning using the SimCLR methodology. After unsupervised learning, the network was trained on pre-marked-up examples, where each image featured only one object (a digit).

[MultiDigit dataset example](https://preview.redd.it/nq6djh9f9mk91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e185af50b77b4d882bc22ebc39886388c48e0259)

The final model quality was assessed using images with a single object. The results of comparing the resulting solution with the classical supervised learning approach are shown below.

[Comparison of SimCLR and Supervised approaches depending on the number of digits in the image](https://preview.redd.it/t4znx1xg9mk91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21b4f021de35ff294da9c4a7b362667fa5f1ea0b)

Another interesting study covered in the article involves SimCLR’s ability to teach the network to highlight local features. K-means clustering was used for this purpose, based on the features highlighted by different layers of the trained network. The results are shown below.

[Highlighting of local features by the network. Colors are used to highlight areas of the image that are close to each other in the feature space](https://preview.redd.it/2txpxfwi9mk91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e31f8a5d8138767198a1ff3d96b25401ece7bdf)

The last experiment, involving feature suppression, consists of three parts.

For the first network, an artificial dataset (DigitOnImageNet) was created, wherein numbers from the MNIST dataset were overlaid on each picture from the ImageNet dataset, as shown below. The question here was whether the network would record the simpler features inherent in the digits from MNIST, or the complex ImageNet patterns. Each unique image from ImageNet was matched with a unique image from MNIST. The number of digits used was a hyperparameter; its effect on the model quality was studied separately.

[DigitOnImageNet. The dataset uses images from ImageNet with superimposed white digits from the MNIST dataset](https://preview.redd.it/1b0mciil9mk91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb823f71b9595790f9935e93e3b415d7aadc2563)

The second dataset contained 112x112 px images with two digits of different sizes. The first digit was always 20x20 px, and the second one ranged from 20x20 to 80x80. This was done to test the hypothesis that the geometric size of the feature affects learning.

[MultiDigits. A set of 2 random digits from the MNIST dataset on a single image, same scale \(top\) and different scale \(bottom\)](https://preview.redd.it/2lt3h79n9mk91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6095f2ed16aaa377c333f42a1680dc896946a2f)

The third data set was created by adding an extra channel to the normal images, containing a random digit from a predetermined range. To simplify the training, the digit was evenly distributed throughout the image and presented in binary. Unlike the other channels of the original image, this layer was not augmented in any way during SimCLR training.

[RandBit. A dataset of images with an added channel featuring a random digit, bearing no informative value.](https://preview.redd.it/8hd5d1dp9mk91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d196459b8ccddfd4f5e1f396c2a8db8343f24ed9)

**Results**

As per the results of the first experiment, as the number of digits in the ImageNet image increased, the classification of the digits improved, while the classification of the other images worsened. Additionally, several values of the temperature parameter used in the loss function were tested, which influenced the decreasing rate. A comparison was also made with the supervised learning method; it was found to be almost unaffected by the digits added to the images.

[DigitOnImageNet. Graphs of quality dependence on the number of unique digit images and the temperature parameter](https://preview.redd.it/h46w7zlv9mk91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcd2182cd83657b7587dbf536ae5b72dccceb3fc)

The second experiment tested the classification quality of a digit of a certain size by a model trained using the dataset described above. The results showed that the effect became noticeable starting with a size of 50x50 px; the classification quality of the smaller digit fell.

&amp;#x200B;

[MultiDigits. The classification quality of the digit depends on its size in the image, as well as the temperature parameter](https://preview.redd.it/tzcqy0ax9mk91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6e7298717ce249a3382e97f3c502edffe4ec9a0)

The results of the experiment using the third dataset also showed a drop in quality as the range of random digit selection increased. All of the results described can be seen in the figures below.

stocks,U.S. stock futures sink following Friday’s Wall Street rout,"U.S. stock-index futures plunged Sunday, after Wall Street sank Friday following hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that the fight against stubborn inflation would continue, and be painful. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00, -0.71% fell more than 250 points, or 0.8%, Sunday night, while S&amp;P 500 futures ES00, -0.83% and Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00, -1.14% dove around 1% each.

Speaking Friday at Jackson Hole, Wyo., Powell said the Fed is committed to taming inflation, which is at 40-year-highs. “While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” he said. He added that the Fed has an “overarching focus right now to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal.” 

Powell also kept the door open for a 75-basis-point interest-rate hike in September, even if the next inflation report is softer than feared. That disappointed Wall Street, which had been holding out hope for a dovish “Fed pivot.”

On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -3.03%  plunged 1,008.38 points, or 3%, to close at 32,283.40, in its largest percentage drop since May 18. The S&amp;P 500  SPX, -3.37%  dropped 141.46 points, or 3.4%, to finish at 4,057.66, in its biggest percentage decline since June 13, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -3.94%  tumbled 497.56 points, or 3.9%, to end at 12,141.71, in its largest percentage drop since June 16.

personalfinance,Delinquent Account Reversal,"Hey all,

Hoping I can get some advice here. My credit card account was transferred from Barclay to Commenity in March/April 2022 and I had no idea until I saw a ""delinquent account"" reported a couple months later. Here's the thing, before the transfer, I've had autopay setup with my balance to be automatically paid off at the end of the month and I assumed that my balance would have been paid off. I've always been good about paying my bills and never had an issue before this.

After seeing the delinquent account posted, I've tried to reach both Barclays and Commenity. I was told by Barclays that they didn't have my account info anymore, including statements and notified via physical mail of the transfer (which I did NOT receive) and I should reach out to Commenity. Well, I've tried reaching out to Commenity, multiple times over the last couple of months and have been told multiple things, ie I'll receive an email from them on how to set up my account and dispute the delinquency (never did), how they can't access my account because their system is down, that they'll be looking into it, keeping me on hold for hours and then disconnecting, etc. 

Finally fed up with the situation and after multiple transfer I recently spoke to a guy who seemed to want to help me fix it. At first, he was telling me how they mailed me my statements and I kept saying how the balance should have been paid off. Apparently autopay/email/phone number didn't transfer over.

After promising me that they can't do anything until I pay the balance off and that they'll put in a request to get the delinquent account removed, I went ahead and provided my banking details. Right after that, the guy said he had to speak to their accounts department and then came back with a completely different tune, saying how I'd have to dispute it with the credit reporting agencies myself and show them that I did not receive the notification from Barclays.

This doesn't make sense to me since it was Commenity and not Barclays that put the delinquency on my account. I tried to fight him on this but the guy was insistent that they couldn't do anything else on their end.

So I guess what I'm trying to figure out is did this guy take me for a ride and trick me into paying off the balance to let me deal with this on my own? Since they filed the delinquency, shouldn't they also have the power to request it get taken off? And should I attempt to reverse the payment since now I have no leverage to get them to fix the problem?

Would appreciate any advice on this. Thanks!",finance,1661765444
CryptoCurrency,The Six People You Meet In Daily Discussion,"The announcer - declares his intention to the whole sub in regards to buying his BTC/ETH/alts/shitcoins. Sometimes, he exhibits his rah-rah style, saying things like “We pump, we celebrate. We dump, we accumulate.”

The information-seeker - posts statistics about latest prices of his favourite crypto and asks the sub about what they intend to do, even though redditors’ sharing should be taken as “Not Financial Advice”. Or he asks a question about when the Fed will announce their next interest rate revision. He gathers inputs but doesn’t let on about what he thinks. 

The trader - tells the sub when he has shorted one crypto or another. LUNC is a perfect example as he has reaped profits from his trading skills.

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Monday as worries over rising rates and tighter monetary policy added fuel to a rout that began in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 264 points, or about 0.8%. Those for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 dropped 1% and 1.2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was suffered a sharp sell-off on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s short and blunt remarks in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, appeared to extinguish hopes of the central bank changing its aggressive course of rate hikes in the months ahead.
*****
&gt; The Dow fell 1,008 points, or just over 3%, for its worst day since May. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, for their worst days since June. The drop erased the August gains for all three averages.
*****
&gt; “Investors again cut back on their recent Risk-On positioning, supporting our view that it is way too soon to call their recent risk appetite a more permanent stance, and now one more likely to have cost them badly,” Rick Bensignor of Bensignor Investment Strategies said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile in Europe over the weekend, European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel warned that central banks must continue to fight inflation — even if it tips economies into recession.
*****
&gt; The coming week brings more Fed speeches, including Vice Chair Lael Brainard on Tuesday, before August’s nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

I received three quotes on similar panel coverage. Two were about $16k after incentives and the most recent one is $11.3k. It's a local company that is busy, puts in geothermal and solar, and uses the exact same equipment as one of the $16k quotes.

Specifically they are quoting 30 SIL-370 HC panels for an 11.1 kW system with DS3-S microinverters.

Gross cost of $27.7k, then after $4400 NYSERDA direct to them I'm out of pocket $23k. State credit of $5k and the new federal 30% has me out just over $11k after I file taxes.

Allstate quoted me $116 increase to annual coverage because they are increasing coverage by $100k (I told them it's only 1/4 of that but...insurance companies...).

They are estimating 12.7k kWh/year, which is similar to one of the other quotes, and both lower than one of the others which was a lot higher, so I think this estimate is not overly optimistic, though they do not have any guarantee on this.

Other than the fact some of these panels are directly over a deck and we could get avalanching onto it I can't think of any great reason not to do it. My kWh cost is presently about $.13 but it is rising up and I could see $.15 fairly soon, so ROI will be &lt;7 years.",energy,1661780927

#Roth In-Plan Conversion

You may elect to convert all or any portion of
your fully vested amounts in eligible non-Roth
plan accounts to Roth 401(k) amounts. The
amount you convert will be subject to federal
income tax for the year of the conversion
(except for any non-taxable basis you have in
the amount converted), but qualified distributions
of such Roth amounts in the future will be
income-tax free.


# Roth 401(k) Contributions

Roth 401(k) contributions are made on an aftertax basis and are included in current taxable
income. Earnings on Roth 401(k) contributions
are tax free if they are distributed as part of a
“qualified distribution.” A qualified distribution is
one taken after the five-year period measured
from the beginning of the year in which your
first Roth 401(k) contribution is made and after
you have attained age 59 1/2, become disabled,
or die.

# Voluntary After-Tax Contributions

Voluntary after-tax contributions are made on
an after-tax basis and are included in current
taxable income. They are in addition to pretax 401(k) and Roth 401(k) contributions.
Employees may contribute 2% to 10% of their
compensation (excluding bonuses) as voluntary
after-tax contributions, subject to certain IRS
contribution limits.

Based on my reading of [this article on the Mega Backdoor Roth IRA](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/17561/understanding-the-mega-backdoor-roth-ira/), my plan seems to allow it, because of the ability to (a) convert, and (b) make voluntary after-tax contributions (up to 10% of base).

investing,"Leveraging Money Flow: Cyclicals, Computer Software, and Retail","Let momentum inform strategy to ride the coat tails of ""smart money"".

**Money flow indicates staying power.** That is, when money is flowing into a sector, related stocks will often experiences bounces after pull backs and develop sustained uptrends. And when money is flowing out of a sector, you might see pops get successfully shorted and bearish trends establish themselves.

**How to use this study:**

Day traders can use subsector momentum studies like this one to identify momentum stocks and develop greater conviction in a predicted move.

**The magic sauce:**

I use the Growth 250 list created by Investor's Business Daily (of which I am unaffiliated) to understand the depth and breadth of the market any given week. This is their best estimation of the top 250 growth stocks in the market. I keep a running study of this list, tracking money flows between subsectors.

Keeping an eye on this flow has proven to be a *huge boon* to my edge. I have found that when I trade in subsectors that are seeing changes in money flow that there is an increased level of continuation that correlates to the flow, whether positive or negative. And to put it simply, this translates into bigger moves with reduced chop.

# This Week's Money Flow Report

**TL;DR**

More rotation into other areas of Specialty Chemicals as the entire Chemical Sector flattens out with another industry group breaking out. Even more flow into Oil &amp; Gas and Utilities as commodities see continuation. Meanwhile Computer Software and Retail are looking like a sell.

**Buy Side**

* *Chemicals-Agricultural*
   * Cyclicals continue to lead as growth stocks sell on economic uncertainty. With the war in Ukraine continuing to wreak havoc on the Agri-chemical supply and the market seeking opportunity in essential commodities right, these names broke out last week. They look really extended and not actionable this week as more consolidation is needed. Still worth watching them action for more signals on how the market is reacting.
   * Favorite name in this industry group is: CF with NTR and MOS looking worthy too.
* *Oil &amp; Gas*
   * More of the same here. It will be interesting to watch big cap leaders XOM CVX MRO this week — would love to see them build a handle now. In addition, with any more uncertainty in the strength economy, these stock are could just as easily sell or at best need more consolidation.
   * One I like here from a technical perspective is RRC —  it has yet to really breakout. I also like the relative strength of APA MUR CRK. If I trade these names I may look to close out the position by day’s end to avoid any sensitivity to news catalysts versus trying to swing trade these oil &amp; gas names where they are now.
* *Utilities*
   * As stated last week, these are extended. Still, the inflow continues in these names. Similar to oil &amp; gas, I’d like to see them pull in here and make a handle. Utilities seem to have a head start on this as they were very extended going into last week and closed around the place I’d like to see as support for the handle.
   * AES has yet to break out of its base. NEE looks strong testing handle support to close Friday as well. AMPS is a very aggressive mover to watch — if it breaks out of the handle, could really run.

**Sell Side**

* *Computer Software*
   * With growth companies getting slapped by the Fed last week this is no surprise. Many have insane valuations with some worthy set up for short selling. These are strictly growth companies with high P/E ratios + book values that are going to suffer under tighter monetary policy.
   * Some worth watching include: FTNT DDOG NET SPLK $U OKTA
* *Retail*
   * With most of the big retailers reporting last week, we were able to build more of a picture of how consumers are behaving in today’s economy. Even the most defensive retailers struggled on their reports for many reasons we talked about in an earlier report. There are specific areas of retail to target based on last week’s reports and some additional technical analysis:

1. Wholesale Building Products — FAST FND LOW 2. Discount &amp; Variety — OLLI BIG FIVE 3. Leisure Products — DKS BFV ASO 4. Restaurants — SBUX YUM

# Review: Last Week

**TL;DR**

Last week added up to a very satisfying week to be long commodities, taking profit in solar/alternative energy and going short semiconductors.

**Fossil Fuels**

Last week’s *buy side* focused on coal names to respond to gains from alternative energy as of late. BTU made for a nice trade up nearly 12% for the week but was drug down by Chairman Powell’s comments to a final gain of 6.64% to close the week. Same story with the oil and gas names we identified, although they were also drug down into close Friday with everything else.

**Retail**

Value retail names did not pan out as hoped DLTR earnings report was highly disappointing. That said, we did not trade any of these but did notice that KR had more relative strength versus COST — which confirms an earlier concern that COST is probably a bit overpriced here by fair-value comparison.

**Utilities**

Utilities took a pause here as well. The SPDR Select - Utilities (XLU) did show some relative strength though, down only -1.53% and perhaps building a handle for more upside on a tough week for stocks.

**Semiconductors**

Last week’s sell side took focus on semiconductors with Nvidia’s lowered guidance going into earnings and most of those names looking very extended, that rotation was self-evident last week. Still the market’s response to Chairman Powell’s comments, from this mostly growth-focused area of the market, was SELL. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) finished the week -5.56% making for some powerful down moves.

stocks,"Leveraging Money Flow: Cyclicals, Computer Software, and Retail","Let momentum inform strategy to ride the coat tails of ""smart money"".

**Money flow indicates staying power.** That is, when money is flowing into a sector, related stocks will often experiences bounces after pull backs and develop sustained uptrends. And when money is flowing out of a sector, you might see pops get successfully shorted and bearish trends establish themselves.

**How to use this study:**

Day traders can use subsector momentum studies like this one to identify momentum stocks and develop greater conviction in a predicted move.

**The magic sauce:**

I use the Growth 250 list created by Investor's Business Daily (of which I am unaffiliated) to understand the depth and breadth of the market any given week. This is their best estimation of the top 250 growth stocks in the market. I keep a running study of this list, tracking money flows between subsectors.

Keeping an eye on this flow has proven to be a *huge boon* to my edge. I have found that when I trade in subsectors that are seeing changes in money flow that there is an increased level of continuation that correlates to the flow, whether positive or negative. And to put it simply, this translates into bigger moves with reduced chop.

# This Week's Money Flow Report

**TL;DR**

More rotation into other areas of Specialty Chemicals as the entire Chemical Sector flattens out with another industry group breaking out. Even more flow into Oil &amp; Gas and Utilities as commodities see continuation. Meanwhile Computer Software and Retail are looking like a sell.

**Buy Side**

* *Chemicals-Agricultural*
   * Cyclicals continue to lead as growth stocks sell on economic uncertainty. With the war in Ukraine continuing to wreak havoc on the Agri-chemical supply and the market seeking opportunity in essential commodities right, these names broke out last week. They look really extended and not actionable this week as more consolidation is needed. Still worth watching them action for more signals on how the market is reacting.
   * Favorite name in this industry group is: CF with NTR and MOS looking worthy too.
* *Oil &amp; Gas*
   * More of the same here. It will be interesting to watch big cap leaders XOM CVX MRO this week — would love to see them build a handle now. In addition, with any more uncertainty in the strength economy, these stock are could just as easily sell or at best need more consolidation.
   * One I like here from a technical perspective is RRC —  it has yet to really breakout. I also like the relative strength of APA MUR CRK. If I trade these names I may look to close out the position by day’s end to avoid any sensitivity to news catalysts versus trying to swing trade these oil &amp; gas names where they are now.
* *Utilities*
   * As stated last week, these are extended. Still, the inflow continues in these names. Similar to oil &amp; gas, I’d like to see them pull in here and make a handle. Utilities seem to have a head start on this as they were very extended going into last week and closed around the place I’d like to see as support for the handle.
   * AES has yet to break out of its base. NEE looks strong testing handle support to close Friday as well. AMPS is a very aggressive mover to watch — if it breaks out of the handle, could really run.

**Sell Side**

* *Computer Software*
   * With growth companies getting slapped by the Fed last week this is no surprise. Many have insane valuations with some worthy set up for short selling. These are strictly growth companies with high P/E ratios + book values that are going to suffer under tighter monetary policy.
   * Some worth watching include: FTNT DDOG NET SPLK $U OKTA
* *Retail*
   * With most of the big retailers reporting last week, we were able to build more of a picture of how consumers are behaving in today’s economy. Even the most defensive retailers struggled on their reports for many reasons we talked about in an earlier report. There are specific areas of retail to target based on last week’s reports and some additional technical analysis:

1. Wholesale Building Products — FAST FND LOW 2. Discount &amp; Variety — OLLI BIG FIVE 3. Leisure Products — DKS BFV ASO 4. Restaurants — SBUX YUM

# Review: Last Week

**TL;DR**

Last week added up to a very satisfying week to be long commodities, taking profit in solar/alternative energy and going short semiconductors.

**Fossil Fuels**

Last week’s *buy side* focused on coal names to respond to gains from alternative energy as of late. BTU made for a nice trade up nearly 12% for the week but was drug down by Chairman Powell’s comments to a final gain of 6.64% to close the week. Same story with the oil and gas names we identified, although they were also drug down into close Friday with everything else.

**Retail**

Value retail names did not pan out as hoped DLTR earnings report was highly disappointing. That said, we did not trade any of these but did notice that KR had more relative strength versus COST — which confirms an earlier concern that COST is probably a bit overpriced here by fair-value comparison.

**Utilities**

Utilities took a pause here as well. The SPDR Select - Utilities (XLU) did show some relative strength though, down only -1.53% and perhaps building a handle for more upside on a tough week for stocks.

**Semiconductors**

Last week’s sell side took focus on semiconductors with Nvidia’s lowered guidance going into earnings and most of those names looking very extended, that rotation was self-evident last week. Still the market’s response to Chairman Powell’s comments, from this mostly growth-focused area of the market, was SELL. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) finished the week -5.56% making for some powerful down moves.

**Alternative and Solar Energy**

We also looked to rotate out of alternative energy and solar positions as they take a pause. Enphase Energy (ENPH) still looks like it could hold this breakout range down only -3.74% on the week but will need some time to consolidate and produce enough earnings/sales momentum to decompresses the valuation before another leg up is rational.

Obviously small cap companies are probably not in a great spot given where interest rates are (and are headed) because they usually benefit the most from cheap financing.

What kind of growth can we expect from the top 50 S&amp;P companies, given that:

1. it's more expensive to finance through debt

2. employees want/demand higher wages

3. everything costs more due to inflation

personalfinance,Second home strategy question,"Hi all! Happy Monday!

I have a home I purchased when I was young and have been steadily paying it off. I moved out of it in 2008 but rented it. Rent is not much, and comes in around 600/month. I pay 700 on the mortgage (that is just a touch over the minimum) plus I've been tossing more to that as I can, so I'm way ahead. The loan matures way out in 2031 or something similar, but at this point I only owe 25k on the house. The interest rate is 6.5% fixed. 

My question, should I pay this off or hold just like I am? Personally, being debt free is something I look forward to (I'm not a fan of borrowing low interest to invest towards high return), but I'm ok with holding on to my current set up if needed. 

If I paid it off, I'd be out the 25k instantly, (that cash is just in the bank right now) and then I'd have about 450/month in income from the house, after expenses. If I held it, I'd just keep paying the minimum, of course, and then extra. Does it make sense to pay extra? Does it make sense to do something different with the cash as an alternative to paying the house off? I have considered just keeping the loan as is and investing the money in index funds. I should mention here that I'd love to get a boat, a bit of a dream for my family and me, and that's gonna be around 45k where I live for what I want.

investing,What would be the consequence for inflation of the Fed not having credibility and if the markets kept assuming a pivot in policy?,"Prior to last week, and resulting from Powell's previous speech, a lot of commentators were saying that markets were ""fighting the fed"", and behaving as if the Fed were going to take their foot off the pedal and slow down on the extent of future rate hikes. 

After Powell's speech on Friday, he made it clear that they will not be making any pivot and that they won't be stopping hikes at the longer-run neutral rate. 

My question however is: why does it matter for inflation if the markets don't take the Fed seriously? 

As long as the fed keeps hiking rates and this cascades down into mortgage rates and cools down the housing market and slows down overall spending demand, isn't this all that is important for inflation to be brought under control? 

Even if the markets were to disregard the Fed, and if the S&amp;P500 rallied, how would this be of any concern to them meeting their mandate of controlling inflation? 

I appreciate that it wouldn't be ideal for the Fed to lack credibility, but could someone explain the mechanism of why it would be bad for inflation control? 

The only explanation i can think of concerns inflation expectations impacting real inflation, and a Fed lacking credibility couldn't use forward guidance as a tool. So is a stock market rally troublesome because it's an indicator of a Fed not having credibility? or is there a more direct link in how a rally would affect inflation?

personalfinance,Health insurance and moving American retirement accounts to Japan,"My brother, an American citizen, died recently and I'm trying to help my sister-in-law, a permanent resident and Japanese citizen, with some of the administrative concerns; namely my brother's health insurance death benefit and retirement savings. The curveball in this situation is that my SIL is moving back to Japan and will lose her residency status. While I understand insurance, taxes, and investing in the States, I'm unsure of what to do--or even how to educate myself--for these things in Japan. Here are the concerns (in no particular order)

1. Insurance
My brother was a federal employee and my SIL has the option to continue using his insurance. Apparently, she can stop and start coverage as she needs (I'm unsure of the details). My SIL has a daughter who will be staying with me to go to community college. 

My SIL wants to maintain coverage for my niece and for herself when she travels. Japan, of course, has universal healthcare and my niece might get insurance from her school (she and I have some research to do on her school). Additionally, I'm not familiar with insurance available via the ACA. I should also mention that my brother's insurance will cost about $350 a month. All things considered, I believe she should not maintain this insurance. 

I'm sure I'm missing a lot here and that there are a lot of ""unknown unknowns."" What issues should I consider?

2. Thrift Savings Plan (i. e., the ""government 401k"")
How does one move tax advantaged money from a US account to a Japanese equivalent? Is there a way to minimize the tax liability (I'm assuming there will be one)? I've found some general information on retirement investing in Japan, but no particularly actionable information. I imagine something like a target-date find would be the best for her, but where could I find information on reputable broker?

personalfinance,"MIL has credit cards open in my husband's name, we don't want to press charges, but how do we fix his credit?","**TLDR**: my (27F) mother-in-law (57F) has a credit card open in my husband's (27M) name. We don't want to go to the police, but how do we get his name off the card/prevent this from happening again?

My husband and I have been together for seven years, married for almost one year. When we got engaged we got pre-qualified for a mortgage with a lender and noticed a credit card popped up on my husband's credit report that he didn't open. His mother opened the card (not sure how long ago or why), it current has about $7k on it, and she missed a payment in Nov 2020 so it negatively impacted his credit score. I don't think she is actively using this card, just making minimum payments on it (so I doubt it'll get paid off).

She also has 2-3 cards open in his older sister's name. Husband and I are debt free (besides this card and our mortgage). MIL filed for bankruptcy in winter of 2019, so I don't think having her transfer the balance on these cards to new cards in her name is an option. We were unable to put my husband on the mortgage application bc the interest rate was so terrible with his credit score (we got a much better rate with just me on the app, and Texas is a community property state).

How do we go about closing these cards without reporting her to the police? We are well aware this is credit card fraud, MIL is mentally ill and I am not surprised this has happened. Yes I did know about it before we got married. We could pay off the card ourselves, but we don't feel that's fair, and I want her to be held responsible.

**Edit to add:** MIL recently went back to school and got her master's in family counseling (don't even start). She is working as a substitute teacher in the local school district, and working with PTSD patients through the VA, so she doesn't make very much money. Her home is paid for and owned by her parents (my husband's grandparents), so we thought about talking to them about selling the house and paying off her debt that way. It seems the only good course of action we have available-- she is not good at taking care of herself and should probably be in a home with full time care, but that's expensive and not really an option. Her parents have tried to get her to move in with them but she is resistant (also they're in their late 70s/early 80s and that would be asking a lot of them).

**Edit with more info:** We gained access to the account, everything is in his name he is not just an authorized user. I was incorrect-- the card is being actively used, we have closed the account &amp; changed the password so no more charges can be accepted and frozen his account with Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. I'm very upset as MIL repeatedly told my husband the account was closed and she was just paying it off. Went through a year of transaction history and it's all Netflix, Amazon, Instacart, GrubHub, bs no actual bills. Not sure what else we can do besides pay the card off ourselves, or hope she pays it and doesn't miss a payment. If we dispute with the cc company/one of the credit agencies will that automatically be reported as a criminal activity?",finance,1661791850
personalfinance,Why paying down your mortgage is fine too,"I see here frequently that you shouldn't pay down your mortgage when you could be earning a higher return on the market, and I'm here to offer a rebuttal. Please feel free to poke holes in this.

So let's say you got a sweet deal on your house, back in the unicorn times before these 5-6% rackets. $250k loan at 3%, making the interest payments for the first couple of years in the high-$500s to mid-$600s per month.

If you take the extra payments and do the market strategy, you can make a liberal 7%. Maybe you can spare an extra $1k every month to put toward either investing or principal payments. You'd end up with $12k invested by the end of the year, and ignoring inflation, you'd be sitting at a balance of $12,465

On the flip side, every dollar you throw into extra principal in the early years of your mortgage give 100%+ return in interest savings on the loan, and it's guaranteed unlike investments.

This is because the market approach operates on the assumption that you have the amount of your mortgage in cash just waiting to be used. Sure, if you have $250k sitting around and a $250k loan that has a lower interest rate than you can expect from the market, absolutely go for it. For the vast majority of people with mortgages, that money isn't just lying around.

That being said, I invest in the market _and_ pay my house down. It's important to diversify

TL;DR Paying down your mortgage instead of/in addition to investing in the market is still a viable strategy.",finance,1661792151
CryptoCurrency,Get Ready For a Big Move,"I could start with the fact that Fed chair Powell said ""fight against inflation expected to bring to pain"" likely alluding to continued rate hikes. I could speak about Wall Street increased adoption of and pivot toward cryptocurrency. Or I could go no at length about the uncertain regulatory atmosphere. But increased of talking about what *might* happen based on what individuals say, we will dive into what the market and investors are actually doing.

Firstly, the market cap of crypto in general has fallen to about 50% of what it was at the beginning of 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

[CMC Market Cap Data](https://preview.redd.it/oxsptch4onk91.png?width=1496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bb157f5bd400b05ce6c8be3af4c94e7ffb983ee)

Further, the volume of trades has managed to remain fairly consistent with a slight increase in the past few weeks. This trend is consistent across both major exchanges as well as Paxful and Localbitcoins as a proxy for developing countries interest in cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

[Local Bitcoins Volume](https://preview.redd.it/w1y7vk58vnk91.png?width=907&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4051236a5b513292a71e22511d0857241d87dd9)

However, we continue you see the value of the currencies of virtually all developing countries fall against the US dollar. This is in addition to the vast majority of major(developed countries) currencies fall as well. This is with the exception of the Mexican Peso, of whose Central Bank took pre-emptive steps to secure its own currency ahead of the Fed own rate hikes. The Mexican Central Bank voted to deliver the largest rate raise ever back in June with further rates increased expected(Per Bloomberg). Most other countries' rate increases are after the Fed's. if done at all, which tends to have their values fall against the dollar. The Russian Ruble is another exception for...fairly obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

The rise in the USD is also indicative of economic fears as seen by the [mass lay-offs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2022/08/26/datarobot-us-express-announce-layoffs-here-are-the-major-us-job-cuts-amid-growing-recession-fears/?sh=39326cb32f05) that I had highlighted in a earlier post, massive falls in stock prices and the rise in US treasury yields. I will explain how treasury yields work, lay-offs and stock valuation decreases due to economic fears are fairly obvious I think.

Treasuries(class of bonds) are seen as a safety trade and are the foremost part of easily one of the largest class of assets that attract the wealthiest and most sophisticated investors which includes both your large Wall Street-like firms as well as virtually every country on earth. For reference, the size of the US bond market is comparable in size to the entirety of the US stock market, if not actually larger. If you want any sort of solid grasp of the economy treasury yields should be quite literally your first choice or second in the worst case.

The price of a treasury travels inversely to its yield. So when demand for treasuries is high, treasury prices rise (and yields fall) and when demand is low the prices fall(and yields rise). Now in the face of an weak economy we would expect yields to fall as demand increases. **However,** we are in a place where treasury yields are lower than inflation thus making treasuries a losing trade by default. Also people believe inflation to continue to the for at least a couple months as hinted by the Fed. So we are actually see a huge sell-off in bond yields since the start of 2022 and again very recently.

&amp;#x200B;

We could say that all this large amounts of capital is moving from treasuries to cash(USD). This would make sense as as stock/equity prices fall  to sell them. However, there is also the added problem of inflation. Keeping your money in cash means losing \~8% of it to inflation. I mean to say that investors have very few choices. The treasury sell-off also implies that investors expected the Fed to reverse their course and start cutting interest rates, which certainly seems unlikely based of the most recent speech by the Fed chair a few days ago. And so, as expected, we see a sharp rise in the price of gold, which is a trade for uncertainty, that is, the between the rock of a weakening economy and the hard place of inflation.

*Note: the price spike took until this(Monday) morning to occur as most markets are closed over the weekend and open around 9-ish on Monday.*

Now the question is, can crypto benefit from the major sell-offs in assets. I expect at least some investors to consider it a good time as any to buy the dip since they have free capital from their sales and crypto is probably an amazing investment in the long term. To say that these investors would amount to enough to significantly affect the price of crypto is another big question of its own. We are certainly seeing increased interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum through the Open Interest indicators.

&amp;#x200B;

[Eth Open Interest](https://preview.redd.it/hebio29s6ok91.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77647303c3cd20cc278738b3e0b136118676d58f)

Open interest broadly refers to investors who have bought some derivative contract of the token, which are usually put or call options and futures as well. Put or call options refers to the option fo an investor to sell or buy a token(or stock) at a particular price by some particular date. Now the open interest in ETH,at least, is likely speculation on the price after the merge, and it seems the BTC open interest is speculation *on the ETH speculation.* We can infer this as the correlation of the charts is pretty high. And between the two, they account for around 57% of the entire crypto market capitalization.

What I mean to say by all this is big things are coming. It would be fair to caution that even with seemingly increased crypto interest, it is quite possible that these traders are looking to snag a quick buck and sell as soon as the price spikes.

personalfinance,[US College Student] Do I have to file my own taxes if I'm a dependent?,"[RESOLVED!] Hi! I called the IRS hotline for help earlier, but they were backlogged and I'm the child of immigrant parents who are also unfamiliar with anything beyond the basics of filing taxes. I'm an out-of-state college student working in a state different from my family's filing state. I noticed that a portion of my income has been withheld for CT state taxes (again, not my state of residence) and Medicare. Right now, about 20% of my weekly paycheck is withheld and I'm not sure if this a tax-related effect. I file with my parents as a dependent given that I make less than 2k a year, but a friend told me that in addition to filing with them, that I need to file my own taxes. Is this true? If so, do I file for CT or my home state in addition to federal taxes? If so, how do I go about filing past income from the 2021-22 fiscal year?

personalfinance,Is a debt consolidation loan my best option?,"I have accrued quite a bit of credit card debt due to poor spending habits, schooling, and covid. With a total being around $28k which is quite hard to admit and look at. Fortunately I haven't missed a payment and have been able to make the minimum payments to keep myself going. 


Recently I have gotten a new fulltime job that is paying me about $55k a year pre-tax which is allowing me a bit more breathing room in my budget and I have been making plans to get the cards paid down with that extra amount. However looking at the raw numbers between the cards and the exceptionally high interest rates (avg of 16% with some being as high as 22%), at my current income I won't have them paid off for probably a decade at best. 


Now I have been approved for a debt consolidation loan that will pay off my debt in 45 months, with a payment amount of $505.13, less than the around $650-700 I pay in minimum payments. However reading further into the agreement, I will also be charged a retainer fee totaling in $995 paid in $100 monthly payments. In addition to this retainer fee, I will also be expected to pay a Legal Admin fee for $59 a month. Finally they also have a service cost of 18% which is about $5,149 or $234 monthly. This all in total will be around $898 a month for 10 months, than $798 for the 35 months of the consolidation term. This is more than I am paying monthly now, but that's only when I consider minimum payments and not more to make a dent into debt. It is also stated that in the case of a Early Program Completion that I am still responsible for the service and retainer fees for the length of the term (45 months). Which means over the course of 45 months I will pay a total of $36,910. When I look at a payoff calculator taking in the average interest rate, at the same monthly payments, it looks nearly identical. However reality will be different as they are spread across multiple cards that have minimum payments not allowing me to focus down the highest rates as efficiently as the calculator shows. 


Overall this deal sounds fine. A little scary upfront as their is plenty of legal language and additional fees outlined that I am unsure of when they may apply: 
[
Payment Plan Change Fees ($19.95),
Adding/Removing Debts ($25.00), Renegotiation Fee ($299.00), Reactivation Fee ($299.00), Non-Sufficient Funds Fee
($25.00), Settlement Payment Fees (up to $10.00 per payment transaction), and Banking Changes ($25.00)
]

I am torn if this deal is worth it or if I am being taken advantage of due to my high debt status. Does anyone have any insight or expertise on if I am getting the best deal someone in position can expect or if I should wait a little longer and work towards other options like a balance transfer? 

tl;dr: I have a high amount of CC debt (28k) at an absurd interest rate (12-22%, ~16% avg). Offered debt consolidation loan that seems decent but with plenty of stipulations. Would it be best to take the loan and worry about credit score later or perhaps explore different options?

Edit: I asked the financial consultant that is offering this loan, and he clarified that $505 monthly payment actually includes all the fees I mentioned above and the only payment I will make is the $505 a month. This seems a bit different than what the agreement contract is saying but it's in legal speak so perhaps I an misreading it? I understand the contract I sign is what is binding, but if it turns out the financial consultant misled me is it possible to get it cancelled if it turns out additional fees are in fact charged on top of the monthly payment?

Edit 2:After further reading I think I understand what they are offering a bit better. I think they misled me that it was debt consolidation loan, when in fact its a debt settlement service. It appears that they will take those monthly payments $505, place them into an escrow, then have me default on all my debts so that they go to collections and a reduced amount can be settled for them. Then the escrow money is used to pay the collections companies the fee. While this already sounds bad enough, they front load the payments so that their service, retainer fees, etc are covered first before any real savings are put into the escrow. This means that even if they fail to get the collection agencies to reduce the amount paid back, the law firm still gets it's fees paid for and I am stuck paying for whatever the collection agency is willing to settle for which may be the full amount owed anyway. All in all looking at it now, it seems that they will burn my credit to help me settle for a percentage less of the debt, while taking over 20% cut of my current debt as payment. Seems this deal was to good to be true. Leaving this up for now so that others offered the same thing are aware don't sign anything they don't understand. I am going to look into a snowball debt payment strategy at this time to help consolidate down my debt until I am approved for a 0% balance transfer.",finance,1661796666
personalfinance,"In a hole from College, advice please?","Hi everyone, 

New person here, figured asking would be worth a shot. 

To get right down to it  

I borrowed about 100k at like 10% from a private loan Corp bc my fafsa was screwed up and my college told me tough. (This happened back in 2012/2013, I'd have to go dogging for loan specifics and the fafsa. ) I did so to leave a very bad living situation. My options were sign or stay in a environment that was awful. (Not going into details, just wasn't good)

I graduated with a B.S and around 180k in student debt in 2019. Only 25k was federal  

Since then I've payed a shit load and refinanced and were down to 100k private, 20k is federal. 

I had some emergencies that resulted in about 7 k of credit card debt. Which also put my credit score back in the toilet.

I'm always on time with my payments, and currently make about 60K.

Now this was great for the last five years as I was renting very very cheap from my SOs family but the situation turned toxic so we moved out with a friend of ours into the cheapest place we could find for the area (which is still about 900 a month per person all things included) 

We want to get a house but my debt to income ratio is making our rates crap and neither can swing it on our own. 

So this all boils down to what should I do to get this debt paid off faster and get my credit up? Just stay the course? I'm looking for a better paying job but it's a tough industry. I need to get my score up to refinance. I'm looking for a side hustle. I live relatively frugally except for my car, which I use in the summer time and brings me a lot of happiness. In the winter I drive a corrolla. Any help is appreciated.",finance,1661797127

personalfinance,Buying back to back homes - what should I know to make the right decision,"Hi all,

My wife and I live in Salt Lake County, UT and booked a house to be newly built back in February, 2022. The house is scheduled to be completed and handed over by end of September. We recently came to know that, due to an unavoidable life event, we will have to move to Norfolk, VA by end of November, 2022. Which means, after we close our new home, we’ll be able to stay there for only 2 months and we will also need to buy a new place in Norfolk by end of October.

We sold our current home back in July and are currently leasing back the place until end of September. Both my wife and I have 750+ credit score and have full time jobs and a combined annual gross income in the range of $180k-220k (pretty evenly split).

Since my wife and I have no other debt (except car loan), we are thinking about keeping the new place (renting it out once we move) since it will be a good investment considering UT’s market is growing pretty strong. We are putting in 20% for our down payment and will have sufficient amount (around 5-6%) for down payment on a new place in Norfolk. 

Under the circumstances, I want to know what are some things I should be aware of and thinking about before making this decision. Some of the questions I thought of are following:
* Will my second mortgage rate take a hit since I would’ve only taken out another mortgage 2 months ago? If so, what would be the best way to mitigate that?
* When I’m closing the house in UT, it will be considered personal and not an investment property. However, once I move, do I have to do something (i.e. am I legally obligated to) in order to convert this to an investment property? What should I be thinking about if I make this a rental? 

Anything else that I might be missing? What are some of the biggest catches in situations like these? We would like to make this process as hassle free as we possibly can (even if it means not buying the UT or VA home). What would be the best way to minimize my interest rates and monthly payments?

Thanks in advance.",finance,1661799605
personalfinance,Looking for advice regarding how I am doing and what I should maybe change,"Hey all, I am 31, no kids here (not planning on having any/currently do not want any). Significant other is in agreement with this. I currently make $100K annual and should be at $120K roughly within next three years. 

I work for the government and am in NYS tier 6 which means I must do 30 years/be 63 years old to  get full retirement which if I make it I would have 40 years of service by the time I am 63 and would get somewhere around 73%-75% of final average salary as a pension.

I currently own a multi family home (duplex). I live on one side and rent the other out. I have a 30 year mortgage with 3.9% interest rate and two years currently done on the mortgage. Because I can write a lot off (including mortgage interest) I have not paid anything extra towards the mortgage and do not plan too (unless someone can explain to me otherwise). 

I have a 457 (b) plan through my government job, which I currently put around $261 in a check (paid bi weekly). (EDIT: Which is currently around 7% contribution). No employer match. Currently has $31K in it, down 20% since January  (as I assume many are). 

I paid off my car and student loans, so no debt there. 

My question is, between Social Security and my pension, plus what I currently am putting into my 457 (b) should I change anything? Should I raise how much I am putting in there or just leave it be? Should I open a Roth or would that be dumb compared to just raising the 457 (b)?

Also, what I am currently invested in through my 457 (b) is below, the advisor through the company helped pick them out a few years ago but I would love to know what you all think. Thank you all for any help!!

Or if I take a leave of absence at my current job and then do this job and then go back to my regular job in a few months well that negatively affect my ability to get a refinance or loan?
The reason I need to refinance or get a loan is because I owe my friend money by August of 2023 for the money she helped put down for my condo.
I was going to do a refinance now in order to get my dental work done and pay her back now but the interest rates are too high and my payment would go up too much.

My current rate is 3.5%
And no matter what the rate is next year I'm going to have to do it because I have to pay her back by next August

This is a system purchase; you own it outright as the savings are higher for the customer than with a lease. We have 20-year solar leasing available if desired, it’s no down payment with 240 monthly lease payments and a buyout option.  


Our process is automated which allows us to conduct the solar resource check, measure the roof and work up a quote on a recommended system right from the office. No need to send a salesperson out to take up hours of your time! (If interested we do have to inspect your electrical system and other items prior to accepting an order.) In addition to being convenient our process saves money which when added to direct purchasing power saves the typical customer several thousand dollars.

personalfinance,"Credit counselor? Financial advisor? Trying to get my financial life together in New Jersey, USA.","Hi all, first time poster to this sub, little bit of a lurker. 

I've been searching the FCAA (https://fcaa.org) and NFCC (https://www.nfcc.org ) sites all day and I'm at a loss! Then I came to Reddit and still can't find what I'm looking for in previous posts! 

I'm 28(F) with Poor credit in the 500s living in New Jersey, USA.

I have $46,000 in federal student loans and will qualify for the $20,000 in forgiveness. For the fed loans, I have a new job and can apply for the public service forgiveness and the income based payments. I also have about $15,000 in private student loans. 

I contribute a very small amount to a Roth IRA monthly and to a pension through my employer. 

I have a dog that I spend ""normal"" expenses on and try to live ""normally"". Vague, I know. But I don't know how else to say: I'll buy Starbucks or lunch at work twice a week when I don't have leftovers from dinner but I've never taken a vacation or bought myself a designer anything. 

Anyway, my salary seems like pennies and I live paycheck to paycheck. I also come from a fiscally irresponsible family and have lots of anxiety, shame, and avoidance habits when it comes to money. I'm looking for a credit counselor or financial advisor, but don't really know how or where to find one.

I'm looking for someone that:

- Can go over my credit report, line by line, and help me understand each line. (I cleaned up a lot in the last 3 years but still it's so low).

- Can help me develop a budget. And come up with a plan to manage my student loan debt (I shouldn't have any other debt on my credit report).

- Will discuss poor financial habits I have, identify some I might not know I have, and develop new healthy habits. 

- Can listen to my financial goals and come up with a plan on how to make them happen. (Nothing too crazy: buy a house, buy a car that isn't a junker, save for retirement, and be able to buy groceries without checking my bank account before going to the store). 

- Meet with me IRL. I do so much better in person and would love to have an office or agency to visit locally!! But someone that prefers Zoom would be acceptable too. 

- Meets with clients more than once. Like check ins? Or follow ups? Not weekly, but ya know to help keep you on track or accountable?

- Is reasonably priced. (NFCC website says counseling should be free but I'm not finding anything like I'm describing for free 🙃) https://www.nfcc.org/blog/what-is-credit-counseling-and-how-can-it-help-me/

personalfinance,Money Market vs. Bonds,"Scenario:
- insecure job
- saving every month
- large mortgage to pay down, interest rate 2.75%

Currently, I'm putting the cash I save in a money market account, which after the next FOMC meeting will be making more money than I would save from paying principal on the mortgage (at least until rates go down again, at which point I can just slosh as much of the money market as I feel comfortable into the mortgage). I don't want to pay down all the principal right now so that I can double the savings as an emergency fund.

tl;dr for below: is there any way I can get a better risk-free yield?

Looking at the yield on my retirement account's bond fund, which is composed mostly of US treasuries, it seems like I could be making a lot more money in interest without much loss in liquidity by switching into bonds. This makes sense, since money market is earning roughly the federal funds rate (2.5%ish now?) compared to the 10-year Tbill at 3%ish).

In theory, the bond fund invites a little risk, since the interest rate might go down, and observationally, the fund's payments track interest rates a little bit, but then the price of the bonds should go up, right? (It certainly went down when rates were going up.)",finance,1661805194

CryptoCurrency,Crypto protects you against quantitative easing,"tl;dr: do not confuse quantitative easing and inflation. They are similar and connected, but they are not the same thing.

Lately, as the USD behaves more strongly than nearly everything else and inflation gets dangerously close to double digits, we see comments from some people asking: ""how does crypto protect you from inflation exactly?"" and ""where is your god now?""

I have never seen this kind of question addressed. At this point, it seems to be a usual misconception and a common cause of confusion.

Crypto does not protect you from inflation; fixed supply protects you from quantitative easing and the resulting inflation. To understand this, you have to understand that quantitative easing has been going on for a really long time. The solution to the 2008 crisis was quantitative easing, and it continued with few interruptions (""buy the dip moments"") until the pandemic, when it got out of control. To better understand quantitative easing and its effect on inflation:

* [ELI5: What exactly is quantitative easing?](https://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/8e6ceh/eli5_what_exactly_is_quantitative_easing/)
* [What has been the effect of quantitative easing (QE) on inflation and value of currency](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/iann57/what_has_been_the_effect_of_quantitative_easing/)
* [ELI5: What is Quantitative Easing(QE)? What is so bad about it?](https://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ahwz1z/eli5_what_is_quantitative_easingqe_what_is_so_bad/)
* [How is quantitative easing fundamentally different from inflation?](https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1o4s1n/how_is_quantitative_easing_fundamentally/)

During that time, after coming into existence, the strong cryptocurrencies of today (survivorship bias) have increased their purchasing power through quantitative easing times. Even today, BTC is 400% up from its values during 2019, so that is how cryptocurrencies (not shitcoins) protect you from quantitative easing.

Today, the US dollar is strong due to the quantitative tighteing from the FED. Prices should go down, and so they go, unless other problems cause them to go up, like supply chain issues, wars, droughts, and even inflation itself. That is, if you live in the US.

If you are not in the US, the quantitative tightening of the FED will not help your currency. In fact, you may see the prices of crypto and other assets going up when measured with your currency. If you are European and you are seeing the euro getting under the USD, one reason is that the FED is applying quantitative tightening more relentlessly than the ECB, and then of course there is war, Brexit, etc. Crypto may help with that, e.g. donations to Ukraine, but not with the corresponding inflation. Much like gold.

Two side notes:

First: crypto protects you from quantitative tightening too, if it is really tight (not yet). If quantitative tightening is too strong, and fiat money is too hard to get and nowhere to be seen, crypto may work as blockchain-backed tradeable IOUs. I can imagine many people in this sub would prefer giving their clothes to a pawn shop for their weekly cup of noodles rather than failing at their crypto diamond hands, but perhaps not everybody. Hopefully we will not get to that point of dystopian crypto-adoption, but it is good to remember that crypto makes transactions without fiat possible.

Second: just like we have collateralized stablecoins like DAI pegged to the USD, it is possible to peg them to the USD of 2019 (or 1929) and correct for inflation.  Tokenizing inflation with leverage is also possible, after tokenizing the drivers of inflation (e.g. oil), or with other possible approaches (that's a hard topic). The point being: that would be a crypto that allows for profiting from inflation. Food for thought.

CryptoMarkets,How do I track payout (dividend) vs price performance?,"It wasn't until I got into crypto that I realized how bad my financial education really was. I feel like I'm getting an education almost everyday. Wish I had learned this stuff in school. So anyway, please help me out with my next self-education lesson, guys. 

How do I track the payout/price performance of a crypto coin? This is when we have a coin that pays a percentage back for staking it. 

For example, let's say coin X pays out .2% per day, which would work out to something like 73% per year. On the surface this seems a pretty good way to track if a coin is decent or not. 

But, this doesn't take into account the price of the coin. Maybe coin X was $5 per coin, but it's been falling a dime per day for the past month. Looking at the percentage of daily payouts, it might still look great, but when we take the falling price into account, it doesn't look so great anymore. 

Is there a common way brokers or other financial guys track this performance? Some kind of ratio maybe?",cryptocurrency,1661815947

solar,Wanting to get solar but need a new roof. The cost difference between solar+new roof+powerwall is only ~$5k less than getting Tesla Solar Roof,"I used Energysage to get local Bay Area quotes on solar systems and they ranged from $2.50/kWh to $2.80/kWh. I think Im settling with the installer that's around $2.70/watt since it uses near-top-of-the-line hardware (11.84 kW system, 32 panels of the Panasonic Evervolt PK, IQ8M-72-2-US microinverters, and a 25 year workmanship/50 year material warranty for the roof). This all comes to about $62k installed.

Breakdown:

* System Price (11.84 kW Panasonic Panels + microinverters): $32k
* Tesla Powerwall: $15.75k
* Full Re-roof: $13.76k

Comparing that with just Tesla solar, where they don't use microinverters and install mid-range panels at about $2.69/watt, its not terrible.

However, I looked at the estimated price for Tesla Solar Roof (11.81 kW system), which shows around $67k installed with one Powerwall.

I've heard a lot of horror stories with Tesla Solar customer care, but is the extra $5k worth getting the Solar Roof? Will they perform on-par or better than the Panasonic panels with microinverters or are the looks the main benefit?

Timeline also matters as I want to beat any potential NEM changes in California. I also assume that I can get the 30% federal rebate on the full Tesla Solar Roof cost whereas I cant include the $13.76k for the reroof for the regular panels.

30% fed rebate on just panels and powerwall: $14,325, net cost of \~$47,185 with re-roof

30% fed rebate on the full cost of Solar roof + powerwall: \~$47,500

So after all rebates, the solar roof is pretty much the same cost?",energy,1661818824
solar,Cash price?,"Are people paying the actual cash price or getting a separate loan with better fees and then using that to pay for the equipment? I am considering solar but am curious how people actually go about paying for it.

personalfinance,Low-risk investment or paying down mortgage?,"Folks,

Assume the following: mortgage debt of about $500K, 3% interest rate, upper end of tax bracket. Living in the US.. In about 6 months a windfall profit of about $500K, and two options:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pay down the mortgage (and improve cash flow), or

2. Invest in a low-risk investment, preferably with guaranteed interest rate, and use the interest earned (plus a portion of the investment) to pay down the mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

I’d have to run the numbers to quantify exactly, but I would think that any investment earning, say, 5+% would essentially result in a net gain (certainly after factoring in the tax deductions). 

&amp;#x200B;

Question: what investments would you recommend in the current environment that you be low-risk with quasi-guaranteed interest rates of 5% or more? Risk tolerance for this particular investment is low.

I have no debt (aside from student loans which are getting erased soon).

# [Dow futures pop 200 points after back-to-back losing sessions on Wall Street](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street sought stability after another down day for stocks.
*****
&gt; Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 231 points higher, or 0.7%. S&amp;P 500 futures advanced 0.9%, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 1.1%.
*****
&gt; The moves in futures comes as energy prices eased. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, fell more than 1%. Natural gas futures also dipped.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a second-straight decline, with the Dow losing 184 points Monday. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.67% and the Nasdaq Composite sank 1.02%.
*****
&gt; The market has given back some of its summer gains after recent comments by Federal Reserve officials made clear that the central bank aims to continue its rate hikes, even if they cause economic pain.
*****
&gt; “Investors are coming to terms with the idea that the Fed is serious about curbing inflation, even as recent data suggests inflation is starting to decline,” said Rod von Lipsey, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; “We believe the market’s summer rally was ephemeral and continue to recommend that investors remain selective and focus on defensive stock sectors like health care and dividend-paying stocks,” von Lipsey added.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, investors will get several updates on the state of the economy, including the FHFA home price index for June, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence survey for August, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ job openings release for July.

&gt; **Twitter (TWTR)** – Twitter fell 1% in premarket trading after Elon Musk sent a second deal termination notice. Musk first announced he was pulling out of his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter in early July. The second notice – detailed in an SEC filing – gives additional reasons for pulling out, including the contention that allegations detailed in the recent whistleblower complaint could have severe consequences for Twitter’s business.

investing,Funny thought experiment that should never ever be applied,"I was checking some numbers and came across a pretty funny concept, I thought you might appreciate it.

In some places in the world, you can currently get a financing loan at a 1.1 interest rate, so I built this thought experiment.

[Using the principles of FIRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BScK-QyWIo), there is empirical evidence that one could safely withdraw an averaged 3.75% of their portfolio adjusted for inflation (2.5% in bad years, 5% in good years, I averaged it out, but the average might be higher as the good years are more common).

Now let's merge these two concepts. Say you go to a bank and using your infinite charm you manage to get a very unrealistic 5M dollars to be paid back at a 1.1% rate over 60 years (Yes I know, if you ask for this you'll get kicked out, but stick with me, this is funny). All you have to do now is place your money in an index and... let's run the numbers.

Your monthly loan payment:  **9.489,45$**

FIRE safe withdrawal (3.75%) of 5M: **15.625$** (Assuming you live in a place with no capital growth tax, ex. Indonesia)

Money generated out of thin air: **6.136$** **Per Month**

Now, obviously, you would have to be absolutely insane to do this, and no bank will ever comply with this, I just thought it was a very funny thought experiment.

I'll preface this with i know absolutely nothing about money, kinds of accounts, etc. I read on reddit that there's ones you can put money in that you can't touch for 1 year, 5 years etc and the money grows. What's the best option for this? With this crazy inflation I feel like that 10k is just de valuing if that makes sense.  I thought about using it to pay down my car but not having that makes me nervous.  Being able to put it somewhere for a year and make substantial money or interest off of it sounds nice but I'd like to do it safely. Or is it better to just put that towards my car?

gaming,Oh shit! Deliver Us the Moon was a shockingly good game!,"Found this in the PS+ library and the video looked interesting. I was skeptical because, let's face it, indie games don't have a solid track record. Since it was part of the library, I figured I had nothing to lose but some time.

At first play, I started to get a bit miffed. Very limited movement and interaction within the game world as it's on rails, and the ""give us a story through sound/video files"" game mechanic isn't typically my favorite.

But, I was curious and kept at it. The trip to the rocket headed to space was a pleasant surprise I won't spoil. It's been done before, but it's been a while since I've this mechanic used in a game. Welcome back, old friend. I'm also impressed it wasn't overly done, making the balance very nicely done.

Once docked at the space station, the game really takes off. The zero-gravity movement, while frustrating at first when dealing with a countdown timer, ends up being a nice surprising element to really help with the immersion. Better still: it's only used at this part of the game, so if you're thinking you're in zero gravity all the time, you can breathe some relief.

The on-rails formula actually becomes an asset to the game given some of the puzzles, challenges, and mechanics needed to complete each section. The puzzles aren't too difficult, but a couple did trip me up to find what I needed to do in order to move on. Don't you just hate that ""Well, duh!"" moment when you figure it out? Get ready for a couple of them in this game.

The story given in audio and video isn't anything special, and it's my firm belief it was added to the game only to break up the silence of the task at hand, which is to restore operation of a system that malfunctioned.

There are a few small issues with the game, but nothing outstanding to be concerned with except for one area in which you must navigate while avoiding sentries. When failed, the character is reset at the entry, but the sentry units are not, and will continue to attack once spawned. Thankfully, just backing away and allowing a bit of time to heal corrects for this, but it's something to be aware of. 

The other issue to note is having to line up directly for an interaction icon to appear. I'm glad the developers didn't hand hold us to find these elements using stand out lighting, but at the same time, some controls were small enough the focus box was small, making it easy to miss it. A little patience fixed this issue.

The best part: the game is very short and can be easily completed in less than 20 hours. Why do I praise this? Because it balances out the puzzles and tasks perfectly, without feeling like any of it overstays its welcome.

You have one task to do and the game ensures you stay on track to do it. No mundane side quests. I can't tell you how refreshing this is. The on-rails style means you get to do a few things such as drive a 6 wheeled ATV or take a monorail to the next section, but strict enough to keep you focused. If you drive too far, you'll get an out-of-bounds warning, or a reset if you failed to turn around.

I checked Steam quickly to get a price tag, and it's $25. This may seem a bit much for some when the game is short, but do consider the trade-off in replay value, making it easy to collect trophies/achievements missed or going for a no-death run (which I'm tempted to myself!).

The site also has a Very Positive score, which I'm using as reviews on consoles are limited (though mostly positive as well).

This is why I posted this (and hope it's not against the rules as I saw nothing against personal reviews), hoping others may find it enjoyable.

If you're in GamePass or PS+, you have nothing to lose but an hour or two. Maybe 10+.

Oh, and thanks to Steam, I just saw there was another game released. Guess what I'll be playing soon.

Thanks for reading, and have a great day!",technology,1661872508
CryptoMarkets,Staking VS Trading: Pros and Cons,"As the popularity and legitimacy of cryptocurrencies grow, more and more people perceive them as a way of earning money. There are several methods of raising capital. Some require knowledge and effort from the user and some only time. This article will look at two popular earning methods, analyze their pros and cons, and help you choose the one that suits you.  


### Are You Active or Passive?

Even before you buy a cryptocurrency, you need to decide how you want to increase your portfolio. That is, to go into profit. There are several ways:

* to invest to trade (sell/buy and earn on price fluctuations);
* invest in top coins and hold them until the profit on its sale seems satisfactory;
* invest in coins to earn interest: staking or lending.

It is crucial to decide on a strategy before the first purchase of cryptocurrency: because it will depend, banal, on how much time per week you will devote to tracking the exchange rate. And if you are determined not to lose money, then you understand the importance of such awareness.  


### Choose the Asset Wisely

Evaluate the crypto assets you want to buy. First, you must give the cryptocurrency you want to buy your definition. And obviously, the first thing you need to understand is whether it is a reliable asset. To do this, answer several very simple questions:

* How long has this cryptocurrency been on the market?
* Have there been bright ups and downs during this time? When and against what background did this happen? Media monitoring is needed here. This is important if you don’t want to “point your finger at the sky.” Thus, you will now understand whether something significant influences a particular crypto asset. So that, if you still choose an asset, you can understand for the future what it can “storm” from and what news to track.
* Does any influencer directly affect this asset? For example, Elon Musk, the Winklevoss brothers, Michael J. Saylor, and so on.
* Was the cryptocurrency’s price able to recover or reach new all-time highs after the fall?
* Does the asset have liquidity on the exchange where you trade?
* What are the trading volumes on the coin — the higher, the better. Low trading volumes mean that the asset is not available on many platforms, or traders are not interested in it. 

### Crypto Trading  Explained

Trading on the crypto exchange requires knowledge and skills that come from many months of practice. Getting to know trading should start with an overview of the main tools. When opening a trading terminal on any crypto exchange, you will see approximately the same set of tools: a price chart for the selected trading pair, an order book, information on trading volumes, and transaction history. You need to read charts, analyze them, have fundamental and technical analysis skills, analyze crypto market sentiment, and track the news background.

Many exchanges provide a demo account where you can practice and try out new strategies. The principle of operation is similar to real trading, so it is strongly recommended that every beginner first test their strength in this way. This will allow you to understand the terminology and essential tools.

In addition to the usual trading, the essence of which boils down to “buy cheaper and sell more expensive”, other varieties are especially popular during periods of a bearish trend and allow you to make money even during falling markets. For example, futures trading is a kind of betting on whether the rate will go up or down after a particular time. Or margin trading — this opportunity is now provided by almost all well-known crypto exchanges. In this case, the platform provides users with leverage in an amount several times higher than the amount the trader possesses. In this way, you can significantly increase your profit, but keep in mind that the risks are also growing.

### Trading Strategies

If you intend to trade, you need to understand how active: weekly, daily, or every minute. It is mandatory to be able to read an order book. It would also be nice to understand indicators and chart patterns. Analyze whether whales operate and whether market making takes place. Also, analyze market sentiment, that is, who dominates bulls or bears.

Among other things, knowledge of technical and fundamental analysis is required from the trader:

* Technical analysis. A forecasting method based on the study of past asset quotes. It is believed that the dynamics of the cryptocurrency exchange rate are cyclical. The growth and fall in demand for BTC and altcoins occur according to the same patterns. To identify these recurring situations, users look for patterns on the chart of a trading pair, determine the support and resistance levels, and try to predict reversal points using Elliott waves or Fibonacci levels.
* Fundamental analysis. It is based on studying economic, political, and news prerequisites for changing quotes. To trade using this method, users follow the news, and speeches of major investors and politicians, evaluate the prospects of cryptocurrencies, compare their technical characteristics, and analyze the economic situation and sentiment in other markets (stock, commodity, currency).

Trading can be both short-term, medium-term, and long-term. Day traders or scalpers who open a lot of orders within one trading day are more focused on technical analysis. Due to the short time intervals, transactions of day traders and scalpers usually bring a small profit, less than 1%. Medium-term and long-term traders typically focus on fundamental analysis. Technical analysis is used only as an addition that eliminates unnecessary noise in price fluctuations and helps find the optimal market entry points. Trades are carried out less frequently than with scalping. The order can remain open for up to several weeks. At the same time, the user can expect a high income from each trade.  


### How Much Can You Earn?

You can both earn a lot and lose all your funds. Trading requires experience and involves high risks. Trading is much riskier than staking: a trader makes a lot of trades, which is why he incurs more costs for fees. And if the cumulative losses exceed the total profit, the deposit will be reset very quickly.  


### Trading: Pros &amp; Cons

**Pros**

* High potential profit. Cryptocurrencies are very volatile, sometimes allowing traders to earn significant amounts in just one day.
* Low entry threshold. It is enough to make the first trade on the market to have only $10. This is the average size of the minimum order on the crypto exchange. However, it is better to start trading at least $100 so that there is always a reserve of free money in case you need to average a position or buy another crypto asset.
* There is no payback time. You don’t need to buy expensive equipment, as in the case of mining, count interest on loans, or lock your assets for specific time periods.
* Thanks to futures and margin trading, there is an opportunity to earn both on the growth and the fall of cryptocurrencies.

**Cons**

* High risks. Where there is a large profit, there are high risks. Moreover, the risks are always directly proportional to the potential profitability. When trading with leverage, the risks only grow.
* Constant training and discipline. Trading is a full-fledged, extremely resource-intensive work. Traders need to learn and analyze their mistakes constantly.  


### Crypto Staking Explained

Cryptocurrency staking is the voluntary locking of one’s assets for the purpose of passive income. Staking is available in blockchains using Proof of Stake and its varieties, for example, Delegated PoS (Tron, Cosmos, etc.) or Liquid PoS (Tezos). Classic solo staking has a high entry threshold. For example, to become a solo staker on the Ethereum network, you will need at least 32 ETH (about $60,000) and a computer connected to the internet \~24/7. However, users can deposit a smaller amount into the staking pools, thus delegating coins to validators. This way, they do not need to run their own node, but the profit will be less. The disadvantage of the staking pool: if this pool does not sign the block, the user may not receive a reward.  


### Staking Types

The main principle of staking is universal for all its types — a certain amount of cryptocurrency is on the user’s account, for which he receives passive income. The amount of capital determines the level of profit. Also, the operation mechanism can be supplemented by other conditions that depend on the type of staking. For example, some systems provide payments only to validators. Then, stakeholders sometimes combine assets, creating pools and becoming validators, and draw up a common contract. The profit is divided among the pool participants in multiples of the contribution size.

* **Locked Staking**

With this type of staking, the user locks his assets for a specific period. The duration of this period cannot be changed. The main advantage of this type is the high-interest rate. Usually, the APR that the staker will receive at the end of the specified period is indicated in advance, but the reward may vary. Locked staking is characterized by high profitability compared to other types of staking.

* **Flexible Staking**

In this case, the contract does not provide a specific period of holding coins. The user, at will, can terminate it at any time and withdraw the cryptocurrency. The interest is accrued until the staker transfers the funds to another wallet or places an order in exchange for the sale of tokens. Earnings, in this case, are insignificant (from 1% to a maximum of 20% per year). Flexible staking is suitable for users who are not ready for long-term agreements on the retention of cryptocurrencies and want permanent access to their capital.

* **Cold Staking**

The most secure option. The locking of cryptocurrencies occurs on a hardware wallet that does not have a permanent Internet connection. This option is not available for all coins and trading platforms. In addition, the coins must always be located at the same address. In case of relocation, the contract is terminated, and the reward is not paid.

Cold staking is relevant for owners of large volumes of coins that do not want to risk their loss in the event of a crypto exchange being hacked.

* **Liquid Staking**

Liquid staking allows token holders to stake their tokens, forcing them to work in DeFi. This is the best of both worlds: Staking and DeFi, with no cryptocurrency lock-up periods, which can sometimes take up to 28 days. Liquid staking solves the incompatibility crisis between DeFi chains by allowing the use of derivative assets in DeFi protocols to generate income and staking rewards, helping to unlock liquidity locked in PoS networks. One of the most popular liquid staking platforms is the Lido. The protocol allows you to stake ETH, SOL, MATIC, DOT, and KSM. After adding tokens to the staking pool, the user receives a similar number of derivative tokens (for example, if you deposit 1000 ETH, you will receive 1000 stETH). Further, stETH can be used as a regular ETH, for example, to generate income in other DeFi protocols. The crucial point is that the staker receives a staking reward and additional income for using stTokens in DeFi protocols.

* **DeFi Staking**

DeFi staking is not exactly staking in its traditional sense. With the help of DeFi staking, users can stake not only PoS blockchain tokens but also PoW, such as BTC, LTC, USDT, USDC, and others. In the DeFi staking, there are counterparties — platforms that take your coins at interest. At the same time, the security of the transaction is provided by a smart contract and completely depends on the presence or absence of vulnerabilities in it. Many platforms offer DeFi staking services. For example, the well-known crypto exchange Binance allows you to stake 15 assets, including BTC, ETH, USDT, DAI, and other major coins. The exchange acts as a showcase and cooperates with several leading DeFi protocols, such as Venus, Aave, dYdX, and others. Users can deposit tokens for a floating or locked period, after which the Binance redirects the deposited amount to one of the DeFi protocols to generate profit.   


### How Much Can You Earn?

It is impossible to give an exact number: the interest may vary depending on the selected token. Also, note that if you stake tokens using third-party platforms, the profitability varies from platform to platform. It should also be understood that you can not just earn a little but even lose a lot in some cases.

For example, you bought $1000 worth of the coin and staked it at 100% APR. However, this does not mean that in a year, you will get $2000. The profit will depend on the exchange rate of the coin. If it remains at the same level, your profit will double. If the exchange rate has increased, the earnings will be even more. But if the coin has dropped significantly in price, then, in the end, you may be left with only $100-200, depending on the depth of the fall.

Risks are present, as in any other type of investment. But even here, they can be minimized. Stablecoins will help in this. The most famous are USDT, BUSD, and USDC. There are platforms within which you can earn up to 10-20% APR for the staking stablecoins.

### Staking: Pros &amp; Cons

**Pros**

* Minimal risks of losing funds, especially when it comes to stablecoin staking.
* Passive income. The user earns simply for depositing their tokens into the staking pool. Moreover, the yield is higher than that of any bank deposit.
* Large stakeholders receive voting power and can participate in the project's further development.
* You do not need to have special knowledge and skills.
* Stocking types: locked, flexible, liquid, and DeFi staking.

**Cons**

* Loss in the price of a digital asset. The more the exchange rate of the coin decreases, the smaller the amount of interest specified in the contract will be. This is especially acute when concluding a contract for a locked term. Noticing a sharp price decrease, the user will be unable to sell the asset.
* Relatively low profitability by the standards of the crypto market.

### Closing Thoughts

In this article, we have considered two ways of earning — trading and staking. Trading is an active way of earning money. In other words, a full-fledged job requires the user to have deep technical knowledge, constant involvement, risk management skills, market sentiment analysis, news background, and much more. Trading involves great risks, but this method can bring the biggest profit. On the other hand, staking is a passive type of earnings that does not require much knowledge, time, and effort. At the same time, staking is not so risky and is more regarded as a way to get little extra earnings.

With that being said, my ""C"" drive is only for my OS on a M.2. I specifically go out of my way to install any other software on my other drive.   


Even when I choose the file path for apple to install itunes on that drive, it is automatically installing and running on my C drive which does not have enough disk space to wipe the ipad, because its only my OS on it.   


How the hell do I get itunes to stay in the file location I want, everytime I close and open iTunes it is automatically changing its location back to my C drive, I am getting fed-up.

Banking,I need to get out of retail banking,"I've been working at a credit union in the branches for 12 years. I feel like I'm trapped, I know I've stayed at my job for way too long. I started as a teller and I'm now doing sales as a personal banker. Like most financial institutions, we've been extremely short staffed so I frequently fill in other roles (acting branch manager when my manager was on maternity leave for 5 months, teller trainer at new hire orientation, picking up phones for call center, assisting with consumer loan underwriting). Because I've been with the company so long, upper management also asks me to test system upgrades to give feedback before they role it out live. I was part of the merger and acquisition team for the 2 most recent merges. I travelled to the new credit union branches for an entire quarter, only coming home on the weekend, to train and support the branch staff to transition to our systems and policies and to help with data conversion and switching over marketing materials. 

I feel like I have so much relevant experience but every time I interview, the hiring manager puts me in a ""sales/ retail box"". I was on an interview last week for product support at a fintech company and the hiring manager referred me to check their openings in their retail department because of my background in sales. I don't have a degree, unfortunately. I've been in banking since I graduated high school. I enrolled at community college last year to work towards my associates in business admin and plan to eventually work towards a bachelors. 

I make good money for not having a degree but I am miserable. I hate sales. I hate dealing with the general public. I hate how I am the most experienced at my branch so most of the daily operations and training new staff and dealing with irate members falls on me. I've applied for some back office positions at my company (operations, loan servicing, payment services) but any of these positions would be a significant pay cut (like $30k less). I'm willing to take a small pay cut if I could get out and work my way up in a new career. I'm not sure what else to do. I've been searching on zip recruiter, indeed and linkedin and I apply for anything that I feel I may be qualified for. I don't interview well and I know my resume is lacking. I'm not sure how to explain all that I do at my job so I mostly just list the duties in my job description, which is sales and customer service. I am really over retail banking. I'd love to have a remote job in the FinTech industry or really just anything in financial services that isn't retail or sales.",finance,1661877968

economy,The inflation/interest rate paradox.,"So, I understand that raising I rates stops borrowing and incentivises saving.

The issue is the current inflation is based off energy, fuel, and food. Three mandatory expenses to...Hang on...it will come to me. Oh yeah - not die.

The prices will continue to inflate because people need energy, fuel and food. Usually it's for a heated economy where people are spending too much on luxuries and they want to slow it down.

Raising interest rates won't slow this inflation down because having your house simply connected now has a standing charge pricier than the bills were just a year ago. Getting to work now requires £50 of fuel, and just eating bread and water now costs a family restaurant day out for 10.

I may be exaggerating (we'll see how prices rise in another year) but the point still stands that I rates are doing nothing but adding pain as many in UK are seeking to take out loans to pay for heating - the opposite of what banks want - more borrowing.

I get that this is termed ""stagflation"" but the reality is prices are rising for a reason. We're told it's supply/demand, and while that was true mid 2021, the reality is we've had a year to realise lockdowns are over and fire up the base resource production again. And we're now at 90-95% pre pandemic production - so not sure why gas has risen 1700%.

Unless of course, this is all currency based, and interest rates are to shore up the currencies being invested in, considering most M1 money supply was printed in the last 2 years, and all this supply/demand/stagflation is just nonsense.

And what do you know, EU and UK threaten to cap wholesale prices on the market and they tank 30%.",finance,1661878522

My parents can’t pay for it nor can they help me cosign loans or put federal loans on their name because they’re currently in the market for a house.

I was wondering if I waited until I turn 24 (2 years from now) and become an independent student, could I be in a better position than I am now? Or would I just be delaying my life and taking out those private loans right now would still be financially viable in the future?

UPDATE:

Thanks everyone for commenting and offering advice. I think I have made my decision:

I am going to stay home and go back to CCC. That means I will be taking courses in the major I was flirting with for a while but felt like it was too late to change it to. These are all transferable courses, and since I already took all my GE courses, I get to finish them all in as little as 3 semesters. Meanwhile, I will also be working as close to full time as possible and saving for college.

At the end of it all, I will be transferring to SF state (I can commute and save even more), this time around as a CS major instead of Comms. 

My life turned upside down within a week. But it has brought me comfort to learn many of your stories and how, like a few of you, I will too be able to graduate one day with little to no loans on my name. 

To all the people that told me to be diligent and be sure I finish my degree: Thank you. It will take me longer than my peers but I will. I won't disappoint you.",finance,1661879226

investing,The common stock market sayings and what they (actually) mean,"Stock market is insanely complex and sometimes to make sense of it, we use quotes/sayings/adages - the issue that I have with them is that they're often misused and other times don't make sense to begin with. I'll write some that tick me off the most, and would love to see if there are any other contributions 

&amp;#x200B;

""Don't time the market"" - or some such variation of it. One of the most common sayings, and has a lot of truth to it, however often misused in a way that ""you can never know anything"". That's not true. The quote is a lesson for chartists/technical traders, If you have a bullish outlook on the sp500, you shouldn't trade it on the daily basis and try to time every dip and peak - that's not a good strategy, buy and hold. However, **REFUSING TO BUY SP500 WHEN YOU HAVE HIGH VALUATIONS IS NOT** timing the market. And yet I see this so much, someone will mention that they don't want to buy SPY yet and want to wait longer only to get bombarded with replies ""don't time the market"". Relationship between the price you pay and your expected returns has nothing to do with market timing, sometimes it's just common sense

""Past performance is not indicative of future results"" - of course it is. Things are not totally random, at the end of the day irrationality is mostly temporary. If you have a company with sky high valuations that are nonsensical, while I wouldn't recommend shorting it (which would be timing the market) - it's sky high valuations very much do indicate that the price is highly likely to down. Same applies to whole markets/indexes. A decade of lackluster equity returns is very likely to very succeeded by a decade of high equity returns and vice versa 

""Stock market is not the economy"" - what is it then? The economy is made up of the same companies that make up the stock market. I think this one arises by the fact that people don't always grasp how pricing works. When you see economic data, it's backwards looking, market prices future outlook. If the interest rate rises or the gdp data comes out negative it does not mean the market will fall down, it will fall down if it comes out *worse than expected.* Similarly, you can see rallies during harsh economic times because the data came out *better than expected*

""It's not a loss until you sell"" - This is an actively harmful saying that should be very discouraged. Sure, it makes sense in terms of taxes, but it doesn't make sure in the stock market. I see it so many times, posts like ""I invested into X (shit) company, I don't know what to do. Please help"" with top replies being some combination of ""It's not a loss until you sell"" ""You already lost so much, might as well wait and sell covered calls"". If you don’t have no plan, and it's a shit company, **cut your losses.**  Sunken cost fallacy is a bitch. Don't sell your index funds, but if you bought into an EV startup (a mistake I admit ive done as well) in 2020, getting out while you still can is not a terrible idea, even it means ""realizing"" your losses (although they're just as real when they're M2M)",finance,1661881990

personalfinance,"Moving across the country, significant life changes coming and seeking advice on finances, moving and housing","My wife and I live in central Texas. We don't particularly like Texas but we had planned on staying here until our daughter was a toddler (she's currently about 9 months old) and we'd been in our current house for a few years, because we bought it last year in preparation for having a baby this year. We found a house we absolutely love, and it's really painful to think about selling it so soon. 

Due to discrimination by her employer, my wife went from working 20 days a month before going on maternity leave, to now barely getting 8 days a month, which has been financially devastating to us. We also could not find any good opportunities for her locally for her specialty. We found an opportunity to buy into a practice in an area we both love that removes a lot of her anxieties about her current job (commute, scheduling, equipment). After having an accountant review the financials and a lawyer review the purchase contract we decided to move forward with the opportunity. 

Our financial situation:

We're both 35, with a 9 month old.

2021 Income:

* myself - $300k
* wife - $400k

Properties:

* Rental home in central Austin
   * Worth: about $700k
   * Mortgage: $1100
   * Monthly tax: $800
   * Insurance: $400 quarterly
   * Rent received from tenant: $2550 a month
   * Lease: 4 years, due to increase $100 the first year, $200 the second and third, and $300 the fourth
* Homestead home in Austin Suburb
   * Worth: somewhere between $800k - $900k
   * Mortgage: about $2270
   * Monthly tax: about $950
   * Insurance: $1700 / year
   * Note: We paid 20% down on this home, and I'd say with appreciation we're at about 35% equity

Other assets:

* We have about $250k in securities in our brokerage account
* We keep about $30k of cash in our savings account in case we need it quickly
* 401k accounts - about $400k total
* Car that we own outright, worth around $50k I'd estimate

Debts:

* Mortgage 1 (rental): about $290k
* Mortgage 2 (home): about $530k

&amp;#x200B;

As far as finances we aggressively do the following: 

* Pay mortgage 1, and mortgage 2
* Put about $2000 a month into savings to cover the insurance and taxes on both homes
* All purchases on points generating card - pay balance each month
* Max out I-bond for $10k apiece / year
* Max out 401k's
* Invest excess in VOO

We expect that my wife has to take out a loan of around $500k at 5% over 15 years to buy the practice, which will cost around $4.5k a month at the minimum, and afford us a tax write off on the principal and interest. Based on their income we expect to net between $30k and $50k a month (this was the range of net income over the past few years, based on tax returns, pay checks, and financial statements) from the new practice.

Onto the questions I have:

* We are really attached to this house we live in now. It has an amazing rate, and is in general an amazing house. Is there any situation where renting out a 5 bedroom, 3500 SQFT family home makes sense? How would I go about looking into the viability of this option? I saw that houses in the 2800 SQFT range in the same neighborhood are listed for around $3,200. So I'm thinking we could at the least break even here.
* We hate moving, and part of us wants to just suck it up with the higher interest rates and look into buying in the new city. Does anyone have experience with something that worked well for them on a cross-country move as far as to reduce the amount of moving, packing, and unpacking they had to do, but still managed to get a house?
* Should we pay down the business loan as quickly as possible?
* I have a nagging feeling that I should pay down the rental's mortgage to reduce our overall debt and increase ability to borrow strategically in the future. Both mortgages are in my name only, so my wife is essentially debt free, and I show over $700k in debt. Is there any situation it makes sense to pay down he mortgage on the rental home faster? 
* Any general moving advice?",finance,1661882301

stocks,Did the economy actually shrink in the first half of 2022?,"The answer is probably not.

Everyone knows that we’ve had two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth but could the GDP numbers be wrong. It sounds like a silly conspiratorial question but it’s actually an entirely necessary one because there’s more than one way to take measure of economic output.

Enter Gross Domestic Income: GDI is measured as of all the income an economy produces for each quarter. This number should produce the exact same results as GDP and any difference is just a statistical discrepancy/data collection error. Since all money that is spent ends up somewhere GDP, a measure of what is spent should equal GDI a measure of all income but that has not been the case for the first two quarters of 2022.

Q1 GDP growth: -1.6%
Q2 GDP growth: -0.6%

Q1 GDI growth: 1.8%
Q2 GDI growth: 1.4%

This is one of the largest divergences ever recorded.

These results paint very different pictures of the same economy. GDI says the economy continues to grow albeit slowly and that the Fed can continue to hike rates aggressively whereas GDP says we’re already in a technical recession.

I’m more inclined to believe that GDI is closer to the truth given that corporate profits hit all time highs and unemployment is back at its lowest in 50 years. Q2 corporate profits exceeded 3 trillion for the first time and were more than 11% higher than in Q4 of 2021. The economy also added 3.3 million jobs for an average of 470k per month so far this year.

But even if you reasonably believed the answer was somewhere in the middle, an average of the two numbers would produce a positive growth rate in each of the first two quarters.

Averaged growth rate: Q1 0.1%, Q2 0.6%

Some Fed economists have even argued that GDI may be a better measure as this was clearly the case during the Great Recession where initial GDP estimates ended up being far off later estimates.

https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/march/better-measurement-output-gdp-gdi


All this to mean that if the National Bureau of Economic Research does declare a recession at some point in the next year or so I’d bet that the start date would not be in the first 7 months of 2022 and that the Fed can still hike rates a lot more.

I have some textbook easy numbers, but double check my math. I make $100k, I'm looking at a house that is $200k. If I finance it at 30 years @ 6% (actual mortgage offer) my monthly payments are $1,700 ($1,200 principal/interest, $100.00 Hazard insurance, $389 Real Estate Taxes,  $46 Mortgage Insurance) I will pay about $183k in interest over $30 years.

My monthly take home is $4k after taxes and retirement. I'm putting $1,600 a month in to retirement taking advantage of my companies 3% matching. I normally would not leave that match on the table, but looking at my retirement  portfolio, I have lost 20% of its value this year. I understand that value may come back with time as per market fluctuation, but I am not optimistic the market will grow much in the upcoming \~three years.

If I halt retirement contributions and add the $1,600 to the $4k (or at least dial way back from 20% contributions) I can afford to pay triple+ on the mortgage, $5,100-$5,600 a month, and get out from under the mortgage in \~3-4 years. (check my math, interest calculations are not my strong suit)

I have no other debts/payments. I have a small rental that turns a little revenue, enough to pad an emergency fund, but selling it wouldn't even cover closing costs.  I'm 30, and working 40 hours a week. I could also survive a part time job to pad an emergency fund for 3-4 years, but not something I'm looking to do for 30. I'm also not looking to work in my field for 30 years, and expect to at some point peruse a lower paying, more enjoyable career path.

Edit: 

Thanks everyone for the support and info. It looks like the winning answer is dropping retirement contributions to only what is getting matched. After re-running numbers I realized I was calculating off the 1,200 ""principal/interest"" payment, but subsequent payment are only on principal, so that frees up a little more to continue to retirement, and keep on track with the schedule I would like to keep. 

Also we found a third option to leverage the rental beyond renting and selling it.  We can open a line of credit against it at a much lower interest rate than the mortgage, and use that to help pay down he mortgage principal to a small extent. The line of credit would have an adjustable interest rate so there is some risk it could raise above the 6%. We don't want to throw more on than we are comfortable getting out from under in a rush.

I keep hearing horror stories of people trying to rollover their previous ER funds into the TSP (government 401k), so I am considering rolling it into a new Vanguard Roth 401k or IRA. I currently have less than 10k in my TSP since I just started as a federal civilian in the last year. Looking for tips on whether to leave it as is, rollover to TSP, or Rollover to Vanguard (Roth 401k or IRA), and why, since I’m a rookie at investing long term in general.

personalfinance,Cashing out inherited 401K,"I'm inheriting a 401K from a deceased family member and planning on cashing it out.

I'm aware that I can roll it over to avoid all the taxes and penalties but would still like to know consequences of cashing it out. 

I'm younger than the 59 years old required for penalty free withdrawals.

The 401K has about $100K in it and I would like to get a better understanding of the tax implications (federal + state (Georgia)) and penalties associated with cashing out the 401K. 

If I decide to gift this money to family members are there any additional tax implications for this?",finance,1661898926
personalfinance,Is buying a car in cash the only choice now?,"My commuter got totaled and I got a check from the insurance for about $20K. Most of the cars that could replace it run from $29K to $39K. I checked many cars but due to the inventory shortage and high-interest rates, finance and lease don't make much sense for new cars (will end up paying an extra $10K on top of the car price in both cases).  The used cars are only a couple of grand less than the new ones. 

I came to the conclusion that buying a new car in cash might be the sane choice during this time, any caveats?

MachineLearning,"""[R]"" Collaborative Learning: averaging and pruning difference? ""[R]""","Hi,

I am reading the concept of collaborative learning, and I came to know that it is also called federated learning, but the following link performs averaging:

[federated learning or collaborative learning](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/federated-learning/)

# When locally trained, the updated models are sent back to the central server via encrypted communication channels. Well, here it’s worth noting that the server doesn’t get any real data, but only trained parameters of the model (e.g., weights in neural networks). The updates from all clients are averaged and aggregated into a single shared model, improving its accuracy.

But the following text uses pruning,

# The training method implicit in the framework could be described as a semi-supervised and halfway model pruning collaborative learning method, denoted by SSHFMP.

I got the above text from the following paper:

Following is the link of the paper (NetSpirit: A Smart Collaborative Learning Framework for DDoS Attack Detection):

[NetSprint](http://www.thucsnet.com/wp-content/papers/ke_network2021.pdf)

Both the paper and web article focus on collaborative learning. Somebody, please guide me on why the link [https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/federated-learning/](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/federated-learning/) uses the concept of averaging and why the research paper uses the concept of pruning.

personalfinance,First Time Home Buyer - Conventional vs. USDA loan,"I'm a first time home buyer in suburban/rural Missouri.  Currently looking at a new build which would be ready in November, and would cost \~290k.

It looks like I would qualify for a USDA guaranteed loan, and that potentially opens the door to lower interest rates.

It seems like one of the big benefits of USDA loans is no down payment, but I have no problem putting down the 5% down payment for a conventional loan.  Really just interested in getting the lowest interest rate/lowest overall costs.

Are USDA guaranteed loan interest rates actually lower, and meaningfully lower?  (If they're guaranteed by the US government I don't know why they wouldn't be at treasury bond rates)  Are there any catches I'm missing?",finance,1661900653

cybersecurity,My Internship Experiences (long post),"I have recently finished a summer cyber security internship and wanted to provide my experience in case its useful for others. I am mid-career (old) and began my part-time masters program in Sept 2020. I have participated in two different cyber related internships. 

The first one was a part-time virtual one with the (US) Virtual Student Federal Service Internship with Army Cyber. This was only 5-10 hours a week, consisting of meetings and research. My group worked on compiling data about the cybersecurity workforce, university programs, and how the Army’s civilian positions pay, benefits and roles compared with private industry. I learned a lot about different cyber roles and some details from the cyber recruiter side. Also interesting discussions on cyber in the military. I know that this program has spots in many federal organizations. 

My second internship was also virtual at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which is located in WA state (US). I was lucky enough to create a flexible schedule at both my full-time job and the internship to do both for the summer. I do not do a lot of cyber experience currently so really wanted an internship to gain some hand-on experience. I am also interested in cyber as it related to the electric utility space. I happened upon this opportunity by posting a question to an utility-cyber forum, asking for assistance in choosing a capstone project. This lead to discussions with a cyber engineer from the Lab and then to the internship. This was an excellent experience, where I worked on project around electric vehicle-grid cyber, some CTF beta testing and building out cyber tabletops related to attack scenarios against utility devices. As one project was looking at applying zero trust, it was nice to learn some of the real details behind this buzzword.

I know everyone’s situation is different and I’m lucky to be able to work these opportunities into my learning, but highly recommend it for anyone else who can also make it work. I also understand I probably had an easier applications since I had some related industry experience, but in both internships most of my peers were younger undergraduate students from a variety of programs – soldier going part-time, community college student, full-time at well know university. So I know that getting the internship can be difficult but keep trying, they are out there.",technology,1661903557
personalfinance,5 year arm vs 7 year arm - which one is better to go with?,"I am buying a townhouse in California and got estimates from a bank and credit union. The loan amount is slightly over a million dollars. Bank is offering 7/6 arm at 4.125% and credit union is offering 5/6 arm 3.875%. Can you suggest which one is better to go with?

I plan to stay in this house for at least 6-7 years. I like to go with 30 years fixed but it did not have attractive rates when I was locking the interest rates with these banks; I am hoping for the interest rates to fall and refinance sometime by the end of the term (5 or 7 years).",finance,1661905824

I plan to pay my loan off early regardless of refinancing, hoping to have it fully paid off within 12mo. 


With that said - should I still consider refinancing? Or at least see what lower interest rates I may get approved?

personalfinance,Paying off credit cards.,"I recently drafted a plan for me to finally get out from under my credit card debt. I am going to be applying the snowball method starting with my lowest balance card as I feel eliminating payments will be the best for my mental health. I've already went through and cancelled every subscription service that I have. But the main question that I have is about the most practical way to use the 5000~ dollars that I have in stocks. 

My current card balances are as follows.

Wells Fargo - 646 - 24.74%

Chase/Amazon prime - 2242 - 21.24%

Amex - 3030 - 29.99%

Captial one - 3686 - 24.4%

Chase freedom - 4935 - 21.49%

Discover - 8587 - 22.49%

I do not have all the interest rates in front of me at the moment but I was wondering if the most practical way to use that 5000~ would be to pay the largest full balance that I can or eliminate as many of the smaller payments? Thanks for any advice given.

Edit: Added apr to my balances. Also I think I changed my mind after plugging everything into a calculator. If I pay an extra 350/mo and eliminate the amex/wells fargo and then pay the remainder towards the capital one balance I can have this paid off in relatively no time.",finance,1661908249

stocks,20K -&gt; 100K In Two Months With Macro and Forward Thinking,"https://imgur.com/a/9UK58zv

Did tons of macro economic research in the last two weeks, stared at charts to watch volume and understand market sentiment, checking 1s order sizes to see larger players enter or exit, etc.

I timed the top of the market when I saw AMZN  (and the rest of the market) do a quick jitter down on the day of the top. Other people noticed it too but brushed it off. The medium sized sell made the price of AMZN, QQQ, SPY, etc move down way too much for the size of the liquidation. I took this as a sign of the market being very fragile and oversold so I sold all my AMZN (with margin).

Next day, market started it’s descent. This caused me to do all the aforementioned research because I’ve lost my money before on the first 2022 crash and I understand how important capital protection is now. I decided to be bearish on the market as a whole.

I decided that Jackson hole speech would be a catalyst for a huge change in the markets because of what the fed was saying vs how the greedy market was acting and not believing the fed and how they were pricing in a fantasy. Blackrock convinced me a bit too, since I’m sure they would be greedy if the risk was low, but they were ultra bearish.

I place my 130P SEP 2 puts, two nights before jackson hole, unfortunately AMZN went up 2.6% the next day. If this didn’t happen I should’ve been up $120k from the beginning.

Anyway, I kept buying and liquidating my put positions as the market ebbed and flowed down. I stopped today because I saw the inverse of what happened on the top of the market: very very low volume market buys we’re keeping the market up. The market should’ve been destroyed today, with the sell volume, but since the top side of the market is all wiped out, there are now huge gaps in ask sizes, causing it to moon upwards with ease. Another possible $100k+ day. I was up 35k and I waited out the action, until the aforementioned was too strong. Ended at 15k profit for the day.

Now ive deleted my trading app and I will time the housing market bottom and buy a nice 3 bedroom house for $600,000 CAD with a 20% down payment :) Which will be the equivalent to an $800,000 house right now, pre-upcoming-crash

Fast forward to this week where I accepted an offer at a new company where I'm extremely excited for. 

I'm going from $55,000 to a $90,000 base salary a year and I would like to invest/save for my future in any way shape or form. I am going to be 35 this year, I have no children, I have a $78,000 mortgage on my condo, $500 in credit card debt.

The new company matches up to 5% in their 401k which I intend to do.

I was contemplating getting in touch with a financial advisor but thought I'd ask you wonderful folks for advice. I'm also concerned about taxes and I'm curious what would be some options.

The labor market is also still very strong. For those deep divers out there, here is some quality technical analysis: https://wolfstreet.com/2022/08/30/this-labor-market-still-defies-any-slow-down-layoffs-quits-job-openings-and-hires/

Many analysts and journalists love to talk about market headwinds as being priced in.  As if anything bad that may happen is, of course, already known and accounted for.  While this is somewhat true, there's a lot of money to be made gambling on these future scenarios. The hope of threading the needle between a soft recession and a hopefully dovish FED seemed fairly strong, until Jackson Hole and reports like the two above.  Headwinds being priced in are just as mush as a crystal ball reading as anyone trying to time the market.

I'm optimistic overall, but I see a steady hangover phase after the last two (or 10+) years of loose monitary policy. For a while now its been ""bad news is good news and good news is good news"", now it's more like ""bad news and good news is bad news"".

29. Wow! The Netherlands arrested the developer of Tornado Cash on Friday (Aug 12). The stakes just got a little higher in crypto. I suspect a lot of crypto platform developers will feel a little less easy about relying on their open source/decentralized credentials as a shield against government action.

30. An interesting point has been made that validating blocks in ETH 2.0 that contain Tornado Cash or other sanctioned transactions would be a violation of the sanctions while not validating those blocks can also lead to financial penalties (“inactivity leaking”) in ETH 2.0. The fear is that this could lead to protocol-level censorship to accommodate sanctions.

personalfinance,Driving Uber full time and burnt out,"As the title says I’m burnt out and tired of doing Uber after almost 16,000 rides and over 3,000 on Lyft so close to 20,000 rides if you count my 1500 on Uber eats as well, 4.96 rating mostly doing short college trips.

I’m going to school full time to be a radiology technologist. Taking 12 credit hours this semester and starting program in spring next year.

I’ve been using Uber to support my self through college but now with inflation, gas, crappy market (Dallas is slow as hell except for Friday and Saturday) and maintaining this no longer seems like a valid option, not to mention all our other issues like false reports.

That being said, I am 40 year old female, no kids, no husband and less than 15,000 non student loan debt (just my car and few medical bills).

I’m considering taking out a small 10 to 15,000 student loan to put my self through the 1 year of medical school or associate program, and make Uber part time only on weekends.

Use the weekend money to start paying back loan, and other expenses and no longer having to drive 8 to 10 hours a day.

I’ve talked this over with a few close friends of mine and they say yes, as I can use the loans to pay for my rent 1,400 a month, and slowly pay back loan.

This is not those private student loans that ballon with interest but the federal student loan that stays at a fixed 3% interest rate.

Does this sound like a sound plan to fully quit Uber and move on? Or should I try something else?

# [Stock futures tick higher as Wall Street tries to recover from third straight day of losses](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were slightly higher Wednesday after Wall Street’s losing streak stretched into its third day and endangered the market’s recent summer rebound.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 25 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures advanced 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures outperformed, advancing 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Chewy tumbled more than 11% in the premarket after the pet products retailer issued weak revenue guidance. HP Inc’s stock dipped 6% after the company missed revenue estimates.
*****
&gt; Investors have sold off heavily since Friday after hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Most recently, New York Fed President John Williams called for “somewhat restrictive policy to slow demand.”
*****
&gt; The sell-off on Wall Street rolled into Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliding nearly 1%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.1%, and the S&amp;P 500 slumped 1.1%, falling below the 4,000 mark for the first time since late July. All the major averages were on pace to finish August with losses.
*****
&gt; Despite Tuesday’s sell-off and hawkish Fed remarks, some investors are hopeful that the rate hiking cycle could be nearing its end.
*****
&gt; “We think we’re close to the end of this rate-hiking cycle, but it certainly depends on a lot of things,” Brenda Vingiello, chief investment officer of Sand Hill Global Advisors said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday. “No doubt the Fed’s gonna raise rates in September, and likely two more times this year, but they will have at that point done a lot and we will be in restrictive territory.”
*****
&gt; Ahead of Friday’s closely watched August jobs data, more Fed speeches are slated for Wednesday. Chicago PMI and ADP employment data are also due out in the morning.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s also the last trading day of the month. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are both down more than 3% in August, while the Nasdaq has lost 4% in that time.

stocks,Fed’s Mester sees benchmark rate above 4% and no cuts at least through 2023,"Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said Wednesday she sees benchmark interest rates rising above 4% by early next year.

Mester anticipates the rate increases to slow economic growth, which she sees as running “well below 2%.”

Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said Wednesday she sees interest rates rising considerably higher before the central bank can ease off in its fight against inflation.

Mester, a voting member this year of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said she sees benchmark rates rising above 4% in the coming months. That’s well above the current target range of 2.25%-2.5% for the federal funds rate, which sets what banks charge each other for overnight borrowing but is tied to many consumer debt instruments.

“My current view is that it will be necessary to move the fed funds rate up to somewhat above 4 percent by early next year and hold it there,” she said in prepared remarks for a speech in Dayton. “I do not anticipate the Fed cutting the fed funds rate target next year.”

In line with that, Mester said rates will remain elevated “for some time,” a phrase used in recent days by both Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and New York Fed President John Williams. She said real rates, or the difference between the fed funds rate and inflation, will need to “move into positive territory.”

The Fed this year has raised rates four times for a total of 2.25 percentage points. Markets are pricing in a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase at the September meeting and looking for rate cuts to start in the fall of 2023.

Mester said she anticipates the rate increases to slow economic growth, which she sees as running “well below 2%” while the unemployment rate rises and financial markets remain volatile. She expects inflation to fall to a range of 5%-6% this year and then get closer to the Fed’s target in subsequent years.

In one concession to those looking for lower rates, she said she does not think the Fed necessarily will have to keep raising rates until inflation hits the central bank’s 2% goal. But she said policymakers must remain vigilant.

“It would be a mistake to declare victory over the inflation beast too soon. Doing so would put us back in the stop-and-go monetary policy world of the 1970s, which was very costly to households and businesses,” she said.

personalfinance,Should I agree on a fixed interest rate?,"I took out a student loan from KfW Bank in 2012. I'm still paying it off until 2041. 

Every few years, you can apply to KfW for a fixed interest rate. So far, I thought I would do that because I thought it would be easier to plan. But as of now, I'm no longer sure: Should I agree to a fixed interest rate in the current situation (inflation, war, etc.)? 

Or is it maybe even better not to agree on a fixed interest rate, because the interest rates would be lower?

More Info:

I am in the repayment phase. 

KfW Bank offers me an interest rate of 6.25% p.a./6.72% p.a./annually for the rest of the loan (up to 10 years (?)).

 Now I still have an interest rate of 2.25% until 01 October 2022.

The remaining amount with interest is about 25.200€.

investing,OPINION: The Fed and Major Central Banks are the main cause of the oncoming recession?,[removed],finance,1661949055
economy,OPINION: The Fed and Major Central Banks are the main cause of the oncoming recession,"Firstly, the Fed and Major Central Banks are raising interest rates to combat inflation. But raising interest rates to combat inflation only works when the problem is on the demand side of things. Due to COVID and the Russia-Ukraine war, the cause of inflation is purely down to supply. So effectively the fed raising interest rates will only have negative impacts on the economy without actually bringing down inflation. 

On cue, companies are starting to announce lay offs whereas before the rates started hiking the labour marke was tight and thriving. The Fed and other central banks raising rates have led organisations and consumers to believe hard times are ahead, consequently businesses are cutting costs and consumers not spending as much.

Central Banks have very limited tools in terms of how to deal with inflation other than raising interest rates - however due to the nature of this inflation it's pretty clear that this isn't going to work. Regardless, central banks have decided to cause a recession by raising rates, as opposed to letting inflation keep increasing. But what is worse, a recession where people lose their homes and their jobs due to central bank attitude to spending, or a strong economy where the labour market is solid but we all have to pay a bit extra for every day things? 

Obviously none of the ideas is ideal, but central banks are choosing the by far most destructive option in my opinion. My question is why?

I'd be keen to hear other people's thoughts?",finance,1661949531

CryptoCurrency,Let's not just look for adoption to remain the latest Bitcoin narrative...,"Granted that September is a very bad month for both crypto and equities historically, one thing for sure is that there could be a change in pace based on how bad the sentiment already is. What I am talking about is focusing on a theme of a bull market revival that not only justifies an overdue bounce and relief rally but could mark the beginning of the next cycle.

Understanding why there should be another narrative to focus on next year ahead has a lot to do with seeing how the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates from here on, while observing  whether the economy has suffered enough pain due to a recession. Last Friday, Jerome Powell had made it crystal clear that the Fed's attempt at a soft landing is far from over, and that rate hikes ahead of September could be significant to the tune of 75 basis points or more. However, it remains to be seen whether they will accomplish what he and his Fed governors set out to do without bringing about a financial death spiral, both in the US economy and across all global markets. In doing so, it could take several years and more sluggishness in the economy for any goal to be realistic going forward. Overall, a recession of his making could welcome a rude awakening for Democrats on Capitol Hill, since it's understood that while making ends meet in an inflationary environment is bad, living through a deep recession is worse. 

With that said, the next narrative that all crypto markets should look toward is the Federal Reserve's pausing of interest rate hikes, if any, during the 2023 time period. Why? Generally, it wouldn't look good for Powell's argument to suggest that their toughness on inflation will fully translate to restoring economic growth while obtaining a much lower inflationary rate. Most importantly, it could position the market towards the next Bitcoin halving, while all other crypto projects will cement their presence with further development and adoption leading up to 2024 and beyond.",cryptocurrency,1661955439

personalfinance,Checked wife's paystub at new job. Are her taxes too low?,"I looked at my wife's paystub from her new job.  They have her federal deductions as 'married filing jointly'.  Her base income at her new job is $70k.  Her company is only taking out $146 for federal taxes per paycheck. Meanwhile, OASDI is $165 and state taxes are $170 per check.  She's contributing 10% of her pay to her 401k (traditional) and only has about another $100 in pre-tax deductions.

I currently make $135k and file as married but filing at the higher single rate. I realize I am overpaying a bit by filing like this (I just do not want to owe a lot of taxes at the end of the year).  Every paycheck I am paying almost $750 in federal, $315 in OASDI, and $383 in state tax.  I max out my traditional 401k ($20.5k).  

Should my wife be filing as married but witholding at the higher single rate too?  I cannot figure out why her federal holding is so low, even lower than her state income taxes and OASDI.  Is her company assuming I make $0 in income and calculating her tax rate for a 2 person married household?  From what I can tell, we'd have a shortfall by almost $3-4k per year because I think her income tax with holdings for federal are too low.

vet,"Runny nose, itchy ear (dog)","Hello! My dog (13F) was totally fine last night until I fed her a blueberry. Almost straight after, she started reverse sneezing. She was otherwise all good (eating, happy as, wanting to play tons before bed) until this morning when her nose started running heaps (nose bubbles, too!). 
- She's snoofing but not really sneezing. 
- Discharge is mostly clear but also some yellow comes out when she does big snuffs
- We just got back from 3 days camping where she swam in a lake and was in nature. 

I'm wondering if it's just allergies as she had a bout maybe a week long of reverse sneezing and regular sneezing maybe a month and a bit ago which she had never done before. I know a lot of allergens are in the air right now. 

As for her ear, she isn't itching all the time. In fact, very rarely (probably when I'm not home). But she has scabs in it and it seems to be a bit irritated. I think it might be healing up now but just in case they might be tied, I thought I'd include it.

solar,Dealer fee loans are not always a bad idea.,"Every time dealer fee loans come up in this sub, they are discussed like they are nothing but a scam.

I would really encourage some of you to work out with the actual monthly and lifetime payments on a low APR high fee loan come to and then compare that to a no fee, market rate APR loan.

You're going to find that even a lot of these very high fee loans work out to something like a 5% or 6% APR equivalent lifetime cost. You're going to have a damn hard time finding general home improvement loans at that rate on those terms.

These loan products don't make a lot of sense if you're talking about someone who is planning to pay down the loan early in order to avoid interest. Those kind of customers would be much better off going with a higher APR no fee loan with no prepayment penalty, but frankly most of those kind of customers can probably access a HELOC.

Most people who finance solar are looking for a bill swap and likely intend to pay the loan over the term whatever that may be. If they are going to be paying that loan over 20 years, I don't think it really matters whether the bank gets their cut in the form of the APR or in the form of the dealer fee. What matters is the lifetime cost of ownership to the customer and their monthly cash flow.

I'm not encouraging anyone to go out and sell a dealer fee loan without having a frank conversation with the homeowner about it. We are generally not allowed to disclose the exact fee structure per our agreements with the lenders, but I found that it's an easy conversation to have one way or the other. I explained to customers that we are able to offer a much lower APR by buying it down up front similar to buying points on a mortgage. I'll ask them whether they plan to pay the loan over the term or whether it was realistic that they were going to be buying it down early, and I'll explain how a dealer fee loan would impact that.

Just sit down and do the math though. Take the monthly payment with the dealer fee loan and run it through the Excel RATE function using the cash price as the present value to see what no fee APR equivalent it comes to. I think you'll be surprised that it is very often still a better deal - and that's not even getting into the fact that some of these very low APR loans have negative real interest rates (APR significantly below inflation). I would absolutely not suggest getting into that level of conversation with a customer, particularly if you aren't financially savvy enough yourself to be able to understand the implications of that, but it's a point in favor of some of these products.

I suppose the simplest way of summarizing this is to say that dealer fee loans are a valid financial instrument that are actually beneficial to customers in many circumstances, but you as a solar professional need to understand the cost / benefit, take the time to understand your customers financial situation and long-term plans, educate your customer, and responsibly offer them the financial product that best aligns with their goals. You may be surprised how often that is a dealer fee loan.",energy,1661963959

personalfinance,401k Cash out tax question,"Throwaway because of embarrassment for asking. I understand the stupidity and penalties that I will incur for cashing out some of my 401k early(in my 30s) but I'm in a situation that it's the option I'm choosing to take. I'm having a hard time finding an answer on when the taxes are taken out.

The penalties come out immediately, but when I use a 401k cashout calculator it gives me a rough idea on the taxes I'll owe. Does that get taken out immediately or does the income get added as ""untaxed income"" to my end of year filings?

For instance, my AGI last year was 35k, which puts me at 12% federal at the top end, if I take out 10k, that would mean after 40k I would be taxed at 22%. 5k @ 12% and the remaining 5k at 22% (just using rough math for sake of argument)

Assuming that, would it be smart to keep around $3500 of the cashed out money in a savings account to pay those taxes when I file 2022 taxes?

personalfinance,Bigger Appraisal gap vs. higher interest rate on mortgage,"Put an offer for $490k for an asking price of $450k and the appraisal came back at $470k. We have an appraisal contingency waived and said we would cover the difference. So we talked to another lender who's appraisal came back at $490k but the interest rate will be 5.95 instead of 5.125.

So the question now is would it be better to pay the $20k in cash for the appraisal gap to have an interest rate at 5.125 or to save the $20k now and have an increased monthly cost due to the higher rate. We have the money to cover the difference but it would be nice to not have to pay it if we don't need to.",finance,1661971931

CryptoCurrency,Mini Bull market will begin the end of September.,"I am too sceptical to believe in coincidences especially in markets and from market makers.

In the stock market, companies must disclose their price sensitive information within a reasonable timeline. But crypto is unregulated and doesn't have to.
Because it is unregulated, top crypto projects could collude and introduce ground breaking developments all at once. All in theory. Until now...

ETH's merge is now looking likely at September 26th or soon afterwards.

Chainlink's Smartcom is 28th of September https://smartcon.chain.link

Atom's Cosmoverse is at exactly the same time https://cosmoverse.org

Cardano's vasil hard fork is again pushed to September. 

Coincidence? Maybe. All these projects have utility and can be/are fundamental to crypto as a whole. There is nothing in the pipeline from Shib or Doge I can find. 

What about the macro environment? The FED were very hawkish in their comments last Friday. This is set up possibly so any actions that are slightly lighter, should move markets more. 

Then the killer. Jim Cramer who famously advised retail to buy Bear Stearns before the 2008 has recently just advised us to stay away from speculative assets like crypto.

Credit Card 3 : $9,256.16     24.24% ($200 minimum) 

We are paying higher than minimums on everything but we are trying to decide between paying down the largest balances or going after the highest interest rates, or freeing up the most monthly to throw those payments at the other debt. So either paying off Card 3 and then throw the rest at Card 1 or pay off Card 2, the loan, and then hitting one of the other cards as well. Any advice would be appreciated and I’m happy to answer any other questions. Card 3 does get used for monthly expenses and that gets paid down regularly plus extra to pay down balance as well.

personalfinance,Triplets on the way - are we OK $?,"How does anyone know where they stack up in comparison to their peers? How can I know whether we’re doing okay and will be okay once these babies arrive?

Looking for advice - should we be saving more? Should I be looking for a higher paying job? 

Triplets were an enormous surprise. The first thing my husband said when he saw the ultrasound was, “How am I going to pay for college?” We’re expecting them to be here sometime in October or November, very hard to predict dates with multiples. These are our first and only kids. 

My husband (29M) and I (28F) have combined annual income of $160K. Post-tax deductions and retirement contributions, we take-home $94,900 annually ($7,900/mo.)

We both contribute to employer Roth 401K, I contribute 12% and have a 5% match from my employer. Husband contributes 14%. 
I have $57K saved in my retirement account and husband has $32K.

In our checking account, we have $18K and savings we have $62K. 

We have $68K in student loan debt, reduced to $58K after the forgiven $10K. I’ve been paying those loans aggressively throughout COVID while the interest rate is 0%. Hoping to get it down to $53-54K before the year ends and then pay about $800/mo. at 5.75% interest for 6-7 years. 

We pay our credit cards in full every month so no debt or interest accumulating there. 

Our house was bought for $363K in June 2020 with 3.125% interest and now Zillow estimates it’s worth $485K. We plan on staying here with our 30 year mortgage. We love the public school system and we’re 10 min away from our parents who are going to be hugely instrumental in helping us with the triplets. 

Monthly, we pay $2,400 mortgage, $315 for one car and $265 for the other. Trying to avoid buying a new/used car right now because the market sucks. We can fit car seats in our current cars. 

There’s all our other necessary monthly payments - groceries, gas, utilities, etc. which come to around $1,500 per month. I try really hard to limit our spending on non-necessities but we do get takeout and gifts and things like that occasionally. 

Other than our 401Ks, I think we are able to save somewhere between $500-1,000 more per month which I just squirrel away in those savings accounts. 

With all that background given, does it sound like we are headed for a wealthy future?

What about with triplets? 🤦🏽‍♀️ We’ve been gifted with lots of baby gear (cribs, clothes, etc.) but we’ll probably spend $2K on diapers in the first year alone. My GOAL is to work-from-home so I can breastfeed/pump and keep myself employed for my health insurance and retirement account. We are hopeful that between myself and two grandmas, we will not need to pay for childcare. No idea how things will turn out in reality, but these are the goals. 

We’ve invested in my husband’s clinic so we will get 10% returns on whatever profit they make. His boss estimated $10K payout 2x a year, not sure what the deal is for taxes on that. 

How should we save for college for these babies? 529s? What other options are there? Are we ever going to be able to afford vacation again? 🤷🏽‍♀️ What other info would you need to know how we’re doing?

For our age, does it sound like we’re doing OK? I would love to be super wealthy but don’t think we’ll ever NOT worry about money. Thanks for any insight/suggestions for how we are looking and how we might succeed financially in the future 😊",finance,1661977289

I know that the solar tax credit can only be applied to solar equipment/installation costs and not roof installation. I also know that most of the Tesla solar roof tiles are non-power generating matching glass tiles which only serve a structural/aesthetic function.

However, their estimated federal tax credit is given at exactly 30% of the total cost (minus ""roof tear off"" cost). Am I wrong thinking that this is massively over-optimistic? Unless every single tile they install is a PV cell how could this possibly be the case?",energy,1661978667
personalfinance,Projecting tax payment for 2022,"Trying to project how much to save up for taxes this year. Back in June, I had a significant raise that turned me into a salaried employee instead of hourly. So I at least know a firm number of my withholdings every other week.

At the end of the year, this is what I project.  

**Federal**	$6,716.00  
**State**	$2,249.00  
**Social Security**	$3,389.94  
**Medicare**	$792.77  
**Total**	$13,147.71  

After my deduction for student loan payments, it appears that I would receive a federal return of about $1,700. Now add on my freelancing job which will be about $14,000 in income I have to report. Now I owe $1340 according to a number of online calculators.  

That’s as much as I’m confident in after using a couple of online calculators (H&amp;R Block projects a slightly lower payment compared to these #’s from Smart Asset). But there are a couple of things they haven’t considered.  

1. Gas credits for my freelance job (I’ll have driven ~1300 miles, which at 56 cents per mile = $728).   
2. My state refund/payment.  

A. Am I right that the gas credit would be completely applied to my fed payment ($1340 - $728 = $612)?  
B. And how would I go about estimating my state taxes? Is that roughly a third of the fed payment? I’m in Iowa.

I’m playing catchup setting aside money from my freelance job since I had to pocket almost all of it in the past few months. So I’m looking to see what percentage of each check I should set aside until April.",finance,1661978915

personalfinance,Will tax grossed up earnings (company paid for relocation) put me into a higher tax bracket?,"I thought this sub was better suited to answer this than the tax question.

Basically, I got relocation expenses covered by my company this year and the relocation expenses were tax grossed up. They showed up as their own ""pay stubs"" where the the total amount (nearly 40K) showed up as earnings, taxes were withheld, and then they deducted the remaining amount so my take-home was $0.00.

My understanding was that tax grossed up earnings are a way to avoid increasing a tax bill. But, let's say that my salary is 100K, will my total income for the year on my W-2 show up as 140K? Wouldn't that put me into a higher tax bracket, and effectively increase the taxes I owe? Like I said, the tax grossed up expenses show up as earnings on my paystub. I am mainly asking because I like to check the IRS tax withholding calculator a few times a year to see if I am on track for a near-zero return but I am not totally confident I am using the right numbers.

In the tax withholding calculator, I was planning to plug in just my salary earnings, and then calculate and plug in the federal withholdings from my salary only (I will not include the federal withholdings from the tax grossed up earnings). Does that sound right? TIA!

EDIT: Thanks for some of the quick response! Just to clarify, I know how tax brackets work.

&amp;#x200B;

The lender is saying the following:

&amp;#x200B;



&gt;**3 Important Things to Know Before You Enroll:**   
&gt;  
&gt;With Biweekly AutoPay, your mortgage payment is automatically broken into two half-payments processed every other Friday. Due to the nature of this payment schedule, there are a few important things to keep in mind:   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;With Biweekly AutoPay, **you are always paying toward the following month** (i.e., the two withdrawals made during June will be applied to your July payment). Because of this, your first month on Biweekly AutoPay may feel like you’re making the equivalent of two full mortgage payments.   
   
&gt;  
&gt;Your half-payments will be drafted every other Friday for a total of 26 withdrawals a year. **This means there will be two months during the year when three half-payments will be withdrawn**. This third payment will be applied directly to principal.   
   
&gt;  
&gt;**Processing your enrollment could take up to 30 days**. In the meantime, please continue making your payments like normal. We’ll send you written confirmation when everything is ready.
