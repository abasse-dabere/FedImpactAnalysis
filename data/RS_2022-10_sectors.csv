personalfinance,"Hoping to donate roughly 10% of my income per year, should I start an LLC/Non-Profit/Trust?","Hi all, I live in a state without an income tax and make roughly **$235k** per year. Personally, I detest that our state doesn't have an income tax as it leaves those like me better off at the expense of those less fortunate who pay larger shares of their incomes through flat taxes, fees, penalties, etc. But, that's not what this post is about. Until recently, I had been earning below the median income and have now jumped quite a bit. I want to **donate about 10-15%** of my income (roughly what my state income tax would be) to public institutions (schools, parks, libraries, housing, clinics, etc). I don't have any big expenses like a mortgage or kids, I drive a used car that should last, and am relying on PSLF to pay off my massive student loans (**7 more years of roughly $250k**). 


Would it make more financial sense to start an org to do this through? I have no interest in starting or running a business. I just want to limit some liability and make sure I do it effectively and without putting myself in a bad financial situation. I get the irony that this would lower some of my federal taxes (as hypocritical as it may sound, I don't like paying federal taxes, but that's also not the point of this post). 

Let me know if this isn't the forum for this question, but couldn't find anything that addresses this. 

Thanks for reading!

Edit: Also, other than student loans, I have no debt, I will first maximize all of my retirement contributions. Don't plan on buying a house anytime soon, but will eventually if it makes financial sense, generally live pretty frugally, don't like spending/consuming and have 0 interest in playing the capitalist casino.",finance,1664584158

personalfinance,What kind of mortgage would you do?,"Me and my wife are looking for our first home. We have good credit but our interest rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage would still be 6.5%. 

My dad was suggesting an ARM but if we did that we’d pretty much have to sell it in 5-7 years.

He also mentioned you can get an interest only loan from a financial advisor, which would mean you never own the house and never pay down the principal and only pay the interest but then when you sell it you get the increase in value and the bank gets their entire original amount back. The risk here is if the market goes down you’re on the hook for thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

What do you think?",finance,1664588642
CryptoCurrency,The Bitcoin Standard,"There is a glaring lack of bitcoin and blockchain literature in my opinion. The bear market seems a great time to devour any books on blockchain and get some insight from previous cycles. I read The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous and here is my book review.

The book is about 300 pages long and the first 165 pages tell the history of money. Bitcoin is barely mentioned at all in this portion of the book. The author starts with Rai Stones on Yap Islands, then metal money such as brass, Roman money, money backed by gold, post gold standard money, and finally brings up the alternative of decentralized digital money. Its all told through the lens of Austrian Economics which advocates individualism. The main tenant of this school in relation to money is that economic incentives will drive individuals to behave rationally to foster economic prosperity. If hard money such as gold is available, people will have a longer time horizon and thus value the future more than the present and make choices like save or build wealth through innovation. The author argues that easy money , or money that can be printed out of thin air, causes society to mortgage the future in favor of short term satisfaction because their wealth will decrease in the future due to currency debasement.

He definitely makes some decent points about hard money (broadly gesture at everything happening right now). However, he takes some big liberties in my opinion. Stating that music and art in the 1800s was better than contemporary art because they had hard money? It was pretty clear he hated Keynesian Economics on a personal level. I'm not a economist or anything, but I felt the tone really subtracted from his credibility.

Then it was on the bitcoin in the final chapters. His explanation wasn’t too technical in nature. He briefly explained the basics such as proof of work, blockchain tech, and hard capped limit. He compares it to gold in the desirable qualities such as durability, portability, acceptability, limited supply, divisibility and uniformity.  The author concludes BTC is digital gold and in many ways superior to gold. Some quotes that really stood out to me: “Bitcoin is the cheapest way to buy the future, because Bitcoin is the only medium guaranteed to not be debased matter how much it's value rises.” He then focuses on BTC potential as a universal sound money making a case that the Banks and countries that adopt early will have a huge advantage. “But perhaps the real case for banks owning Bitcoin is as insurance against the scenario of it succeeding.” Saifedean Ammous also mentions some of the limitations of BTC like TPS and admits that certain types of transactions are not likely to be practical.

All in all I really enjoyed the book. It was an easy read compared to some of the other crypto books that use too much technical jargon. It is a good gateway to the crypto newcomer who wants to get the sense of why the community thinks it so revolutionary. I do also agree with the sentiment that governments cannot resist the lure of printing money to pursue frivolous projects and short term success in a bid to get re elected. Take the money out of the governments hands, they cant be trusted. I give it 19 out of 21 Satoshis.

I don't think there was a raisin in the piece. If there was, it would have to be a small one. In any case!! I'm aware this could be serious.

Fair enough, except poison control's automated system tells me they charge $95 for their services, which I do not have at this moment.

I also don't have my own car to take him to a vet, and live in a semi rural area (which means basically zero rideshare this time of night).

We went through a similar situation with a Chi mix a few years ago, and so I know how to relatively safely induce vomiting with hydrogen peroxide.

personalfinance,TD Bank Visa Card Fraud Nightmare. Has it happened to you too?,"Update 10/11: TD Bank still has not actually opened a fraud investigation, only adding notes to my account. I don't know what else to do. It looks like I am going to have to pay this to avoid them destroying my credit. 

Update 10/15: still no resolution. After filing a complaint with the CFPB TD Bank issued a credit, and closed the case with the CFPB, the next day they reversed the credit without any investigation. In fact they issued and reversed the credits 3 times and now the agents say that there is nothing that can be done anymore and either have to pay or be forced into collections. 

Below is what is appearing to be a common story of TD Bank attempting to avoid covering fraudulent credit card charges, and duping customers into taking actions that will prevent the customer from having legal protections. I hope that my story will bring forward more stories, so that this can come to light.

On September 5th, 2022, I received a fraud text alert from TD Bank about my TD Bank Cash Credit Card. I immediately logged into my account and noticed multiple PENDING charges for an aggregate of several thousand dollars. I locked my card and called the fraud department. The charges were still pending, and I told the agent that they were fraudulent and to stop them from posting, as only one charge had posted. The agent informed me that she marked the charges as fraud, I would be issued a new card, and would expect to receive a letter in 5-10 business days with a case number and a credit on my account while the investigation happened. While the investigation was ongoing that I would receive a statement credit per the advertised Visa Zero Liability Policy. 

Two days later, the thousands of dollars in the charges I called to stop all posted. Seeing this, I immediately called the bank again. I was told that the dispute was opened, confirmed what charges were being disputed, and was again told I needed to wait 15 days for a letter. This seemed very odd since I have never heard of anyone having to wait this long to resolve a dispute.   
 

I called again on September 9th, to check the status and attempt to get a case number, as there was no way to verify that the charges were disputed. On this phone call, I was told to wait \*90 days to receive a letter\*. I confirmed with the agent that 4 charges were being disputed. 

Feeling very uneasy about the timeline she provided I did some research and read my cardholder agreement and the law. Their agreement, which mirrors the law states that: any disputes or claims must be made in writing via certified letter within 60 days. If you file a dispute on the phone the bank has ZERO obligation to investigate. If, I had listened to the agent telling me to wait 90 days I would have lost my protections under the law. 

At this point, I reached out to TD on Twitter. They had someone from their ""leadership"" team call me. This person assured me that the case would be handled by September 19th. I wrote a certified letter on September 19th, after seeing no changes to my account, as promised several times. In this letter I outlined the charges and why I was disputing them. I sent this letter certified mail. It was delivered a few days later. I continued to call every day for an update and verify what was being disputed.

On September 25th, I finally received a letter with a case number and that they were opening an investigation and that a credit would appear on my account. The letter provided no details about what was being disputed (in violation of their cardholder agreement). No credit ever appeared. And so, I called again to get the details. I was told AGAIN to wait 90 days; I told the agent she should not tell customers this because it would mean they couldn’t dispute if you TD didn’t open a case. It was at this point I got a sinking feeling that they were trying to delay. But, since I had sent the certified letter, I at least knew they couldn’t ignore my claim.  
 

At some point in this time frame, I had received another call from the member of the leadership team PROMISING me that on September 26th, the issue would be resolved one way or another. They could not provide me with any details on the status on case but confirmed again that four charges totaling about $2,300 were being disputed as fraudulent. I figured I would give it a few more days. 

Today, I noticed I still had NO credit on my account for the nearly $2,400 in fraudulent charges. A full 10 days after I got a letter saying I would receive a temporary credit. (edit: 10 days after they sent the letter) So, I called yet again, was transferred four times after spending several hours on hold and being hung up on twice.

Finally, I spoke to an agent in their ""fraud"" department, and this is when my fears came true. They informed me that no case was ever opened for anything except for one $7.99 charge. As far as TD was concerned: I made the other thousands of dollars in charges. This is despite nearly daily phone calls to them and direct conversations with their leadership team disputing the four charges and asking for case numbers and updates, anything in writing showing I was disputing those charges. It turns out TD Bank had not opened an investigation or marked the charges as fraud. All the while, telling me to ""wait 90 days"". 

I firmly believe this was intentional, so that they would no longer have to investigate anything since my 60-day window to send a letter would have long passed. Luckily, I know the law and they can't pull this anymore. Adding to this, I confirmed with the agent who finally informed me that I was lied to about the other charges being under dispute that there is NO ONE in the company a customer or agent can speak to with who has the authority to reverse charges or even look up disputes by a case number. I asked her why they would send me a case number if no one could look it up. She didn’t have an answer.  

Things only got worse and worse on this phone call.  After I found out they never opened a claim, but instead had spent a month continuously pushing me to take actions which would void my right to dispute charges, I was livid. And here is where I believe that the bank’s actions went from unethical to likely criminal. I asked the agent to mark the other thousands in charges as fraudulent. She said she could not do that because ""the system would not let her mark those charges as fraud"". Instead, she pushed me hard to file the claims as a ""goods not received"" dispute. This was extremely shady, and probably illegal. I refused to do this because A) these types of claims do not afford as much protection under federal law, AND B) it would be considered an admission that I made purchases. Which I did not. 

Again, I believe trying to get me to reclassify this from fraud to “goods not delivered” was intentional. I demanded they be filed as fraud disputes. I am still not confident that this was handled properly as the agent had to issue me yet another credit card and CLOSE my other case, for $7.99, without a resolution (illegal). 

The final extremely suspect behavior was when she asked me to contact the merchants. I do not want to contact the merchants because that is TD's job, and by me contacting a merchant it would potentially associate me with the charges. 

TD Bank claims they have 90 days to resolve a dispute, this is a lie, they have two billing cycles and no more than 90 days under the law. Should they deny my claim, they must provide evidence that I made the purchases, which I obviously did not. If someone took 90 seconds to look at the origin of the charges, and the pattern of charges including the CCV hacking which occurred against my card via a botnet they would see the fraud. The fact TD didn't flag hundreds of 0 cent charges made with a 2-minute period as suspect is negligent in and of itself. It’s obviously a botnet used to exploit VISA cards which allow unlimited CCV attempts before locking a card. 

Has anyone else had any issues like this with TD Bank? I fully expect them to attempt to deny my claim and force me into court as they never even filed the dispute in the first place and lied to me about it, which indicates their primary motive here is to not cover these charges by delaying until the customer has no legal options left. Luckily, I sent my letter so they can’t just not do anything, but from the other stories I have heard, they have no problem going to court to avoid having to pay these claims out. 

I filed an initial complaint with CFPB but am waiting until I get some sort of resolution on this dispute before filing another as I expect them to attempt to avoid responsibility yet again.

tldr; credit card hacked. called TD almost every day for a month; was told the charges were being disputed; was told to wait 90 days for a letter, even though if i waited that long i'd lose my rights to dispute the charges; find out that they never opened an investigation except for one $8 charge; was pressured to claim i purchased the items; was told there no way to check the status of a claim or investigation and that no one at the company who a customer can speak with has the authority to reverse any charges.  Has this happened to you?

Bitcoin,S&amp;P 500 vs. Bitcoin - Accounting for inflation / Money Printing. Thought Experiment. A light perspective from your average bitcoiner. Is bitcoin still out-performing S&amp;P using M2 as a metric?,"**Forenote:** I'm going to be choosing some cherry-picked data that fits a near-perfect timeline: a little bit over 4 years ago today.               

https://i.imgur.com/He6KEVC.png - The S&amp;P 500 September 7th, 2018 - $2871.68. **Modern day: $3585.62**

Back then, mention of a recession was passive in a sense like, ""Oh, well, we usually have a recession once every decade. We're almost overdue for one now.""            

18 months later, covid hits America and we start printing money (that largely goes to bankers and benefits mega-corporations).              

The M2 money supply: https://i.imgur.com/M8L9jcG.png                     

Inflation: This is hard to actually quantify because the CPI report is based on the average price of an ever-changing basket of cherry-picked goods, that conveniently disregards gas and oil. Let's humor the last CPI report released at the FOMC and say that it is 8.3%. Others say it is as much as 20%. Let's use both spectrums for a thought experiment.              

If we go with the [8.3% figure of $3585.62](https://i.imgur.com/wYBZv3k.png), this means The S&amp;P 500 is actually valued at an actual value of **$3,288.02** in ""2018 dollars"".             

However, if we go with the [20% figure](https://i.imgur.com/e5aro41.png) that would mean the value of the S&amp;P 500 would be valued at **$2868.50** in ""2018 dollars"".           

Now let's apply the same logic to Bitcoin:              

Bitcoin is at $19,323.60 USD. That is nearly 3x the price that it was 4 years ago.              

Accounting for [8.3% inflation](https://i.imgur.com/NnJBpLw.png), bitcoin would be worth **$17,719.75** in ""2018 dollars.""              

And the [20% figure?](https://i.imgur.com/lHSjuFg.png), that would put Bitcoin at **$15,458.88.**               

Just some food for thought. If bitcoin goes lower, I'll definitely buy more. For the record, this is cherry-picked data. I'm sure there are companies in the S&amp;P 500 that performed well, as the S&amp;P 500 is itself a basket of companies that gets added and removed regularly.",cryptocurrency,1664613446

I max out my TSP, Roth, and HSA. Balances are not as high as I would like because it took me a while to get to this salary range, and I invested in several moves for career opportunities. Also I bought a house with 20% down 2 years ago.

I have been approved to work remotely, so I have relocated to live with family. I accepted an offer on my house, and close November 1.  My proceeds from the sale will be about $124k. This is not profit as I put 20% down. 

I will pay rent to my family but will be roughly equivalent to my previous house payment. My basic expenses will drop a little overall due to sharing, but I will lose deductions for the house. I ran the numbers including changes in salary (fed pay is based on location), new local taxes, additional expenses and shared savings. The overall impact becomes very minimal when I consider everything.

The question is what to do with the house sale windfall?

$30k for house upgrades, furniture, new stuff 

$25k replenished and increased emergency fund

CryptoCurrency,What's wrong with current medical research and an example of how cryptocurrencies can solve these shortcomings (a post from u/geistluchs ),"***(This is a post from*** u/geistluchs ***,*** *I'm posting for him because his account doesn't have enough comment karma to post on this sub.)*

First, this is important to understand what are some problems with medical research to then understand how cryptocurrencies can help solve these problems:

* Medical research has a money problem
* Many studies are poorly designed to promote an agenda.
* Replicating results is necessary for good science, but rare
* Peer review has many shortcomings
* Too much science is locked behind paywalls
* IP is slowing down science

**Medical Research has a money problem**

Medical research funding in many places around the world can come from public sources (tax money) as well as private organizations which distribute money for equipment, salaries, and other research expenses. This is one of the biggest challenges for medical scientists, is to find a sustainable source of many to run experiments and concentrate on the science.

In most places around the world, Governments or public organizations provide funding for research, which is good, as there are fewer chances of conflict of interests, but there is not enough. The USA offered 900 federal grant programs, and half of this funding, 800 billion USD goes to healthcare. In 2020, the National Institute of Health accepted only 21% of research grant proposals (11,000/55,000). Source:[ https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/report/20](https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/report/20)

So researchers then look for private funding, which will support science if it supports their corporate agenda. This is catastrophic because it means that some science is guided not by what is good for society/humanity in terms of science, but by what will make the most return on investment to these private funders. Much of nutrition science is funded by the food industry, and this is a major conflict of interest, food companies will not change the results of research, but they will not fund something if the hypothesis goes against their interests, thus shaping how science evolves. This is the same for drugmakers that fund most drug clinical trials. This means that drugs for a disease that won’t be profitable (In places with poor populations or very few people touched by the disease) might only get funding from charitable organizations (less than 3% of funding in the USA).

Since scientists have to compete for this finite and decreasing amount of funding (at least for public funding), it creates conflicts of interest between scientists of the same field, puts pressure to publish many papers instead of few quality ones, and it forces scientists to oversell their work (use buzzwords to get funding). This competition between scientists for funding affects what people study, the risk they take, and the risk they don’t take, overall it pushes researchers to do predictable, safe and hyped science. This also means scientists have to spend a lot of time and energy competing for funding and writing grant proposals which means less time for science.

On top of that, grants are usually short-term (3-5 years), which means that scientists are less likely to apply for long-term projects, even though these are usually the ones that create the biggest discoveries. New, experimental, but potentially breakthrough research takes a long time to produce, requires the work of many people, and it does not always pay off. So scientists often avoid these types of studies that don’t easily get funding and prefer short-turnaround, safe research.

**Science is pressured to display certain results**

Medical researchers are judged by the research they publish, and they have tons of pressure to get certain types of results. If you get good splashy results, it will be easier to get published in a prestigious journal, but if they get mediocre results, many scientists consider presenting the data differently to keep it exciting.

“The consequences are staggering. An estimated $200 billion — or the equivalent of 85 percent of global spending on research — is routinely wasted on poorly designed and redundant studies, according to meta-researchers who have analyzed inefficiencies in research. We know that as much as 30 percent of the most influential original medical research papers later turn out to be wrong or exaggerated.”

Source:[https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process)

Rewards for medical research should be based on the research methods, and quality of analysis, not just the outcomes of the research.

Going back to the funding problem, this problem is exacerbated by private funding methods that expect certain results that align with their agenda.

**Not rigorous enough**

There might be a “crisis of irreproducibility”, a survey made by[ nature.com](http://nature.com/) about reproducibility (1576 researchers) concludes that “70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.”

The data from the survey also reveal contradictory thinking about reproducibility: “52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.”

Source:[ https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a)

On top of that, studies that fail to replicate results from a “good” study might not get published. Studies need to be at the cutting edge of science, with new and positive results, this pressure prevents necessary replication and might produce many false positive results.

Some causes could be a lack of understanding of statistics, poor experimental design, lack of mentoring from senior researchers, fraud, hyper-competition, lack of resources, or simply selective reporting of results.

**Peer review needs to be improved**

Peer review is an essential aspect of research, scientists send their articles to a journal, and if the journal accepts the article, it is sent to peers in a similar field, for constructive criticism, to then be published or not in that journal. The journals set up a blind reading, reviewing, and editing of the articles to reduce bias. This system in theory works, but it has many shortcomings, it often does not detect fraud, selective results, and other problems. Researchers are often not paid to review articles, which creates less incentive to do serious peer reviews.

**Science is behind paywalls**

A lot of science and research is locked away and not easily accessible. They are often costly to access and can be hard to find. The publication process can also be slow, which slows down many other processes. Many Researchers have argued that academic research should be free for all to access, as many for-profit publishers slow down the pace of science. One article in a scientific journal can cost you 30$, some yearly subscriptions are 300$ and up to 10,000$. On top of that, it can be quite expensive to publish a scientific article: “the average cost to publish an article is around $3500 to $4000” and most of that cost is falling on the researchers themselves.

**Science is slowed and locked by intellectual property**

Protected patents are a relatively recent invention, the first modern patent system was created in 1474 in Venice, it has since evolved into a complex set of laws and regulations, both at the local and international levels.

Source:[ https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=585661](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=585661)

When patent rights are expensive, it makes successive activities more costly, as research will have to seek permission from patent holders, and when patents are debated, this can slow down the progress of science and technology. Patents are also used as a business strategy, often used by large firms, that use patents to entrench their position in the market by making it expensive/complicated/impossible to research on certain subjects (many times not even using the patent). The current patent system does not reward follow-up research, as scientists are scared of litigation.

Is the right to intellectual property or Human rights more important to you? I believe that patents should not extend so far as to interfere with individuals' dignity and well-being. Where patent rights and human rights conflict, human rights must prevail.

This is an overview of present problems in medical research, and we could in much more depth on the systematic shortcomings in science. But this is good enough to understand what needs to be solved in the medical research field. A great example of a project that solves these problems is [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/). But i am sure there are other cryptos that are similar.

**What is Etica?**

You can learn a lot from Etica on the main website:[ Eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org/)

From [u/makeasnek](https://np.reddit.com/u/makeasnek/): “Etica is a blockchain and platform for funding medical research. It also produces rewards for those who evaluate proposals and vote on them or otherwise participate in Etica. These can fundamentally change how scientific research is incentivized, opening a new world of patent-free, open medical research. Etica runs off its own version of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, which uses proof-of-work to mint coins and secures the network.”

Etica funds research with its inflation, the distribution of ETI coins will look like this:

Each Era is approximately 1 year.

Era 1: 1 890 000 ETI to mining reward and 210 000 ETI as protocol reward

Era 2: 1 680 000 ETI as mining reward and 420 000 ETI as protocol reward

Era 3: 1 470 000 ETI as mining reward and 630 000 ETI as protocol reward

Era 4: 1 260 000 ETI as mining reward and 840 000 ETI as protocol reward

Era 5 to Era 10: 1 050 000 ETI as mining reward and 1 050 000 ETI as protocol reward

The mining of ETI will then stop (in 10 years) and the 2.61% of inflation will be used to reward researchers and voters.

Grant proposals are grouped by disease on[ Etica.io](https://www.etica.io/), and then users (holders of ETI) can vote and get rewarded for correctly participating. In the long term, Etica.io will be only one of potentially thousands of websites connected to the Etica blockchain. Potentially, instead of having science locked in journals with paywalls, We could have websites directly connected to the Etica blockchain, without restriction and free of any patent. To that extent, the Etica blockchain can be called a permissionless decentralized science journal.

Any proposals can be anything, the community will decide what gets funded or not. I recommend reading this Reddit post to understand Etica better:[reaction to makeasnek](https://np.reddit.com/r/Etica/comments/u44d8r/reaction_to_makeasnek_post/)

**If we go back to the main problems (TLDR):**

* Big money problem: Etica provides a new additional decentralized funding system for medical researchers to use. We are not naive, most people will act in their own interest. Good and evil people will come to Etica but what is different is that Etica is not under the control of the incumbent of the system that chooses the pace and direction of research according to their vested interest.
* Poorly designed studies: It will be important for the community to select quality and not flashy research. In fact, the token holders have a collective interest that Etica maintains its value. If the network globally accepts useless proposals then the network is going to become worthless. A key part of the Etica system is that the token holders have a responsibility to get the best proposals rewarded so that people keep increasing the amount of work they do for each proposal and create a healthy open source ecosystem.
* Replicability problem: Etica's main aim is not to solve this problem, but open science contributes to more replicable science.
* Peer review: Peer review is incentivized on the Etica platform and can be a way to earn more ETI, this means researchers can be paid to peer review. Voters that make the curation work are rewarded with 38.2% of the ETI research rewards. Token holders will not necessarily be scientific experts on everything, but we can imagine different ways people can get informed on proposals and share information. They can use earned ETI to finance expertise and do quality peer reviews.
* Paywalls: All Etica proposals are public and free to read, as well as easy to access.
* Intellectual property: Etica removes intellectual property which is costly to medical research and human rights.",cryptocurrency,1664629785
stocks,"Peter Lynch: ""If you spend 14 minutes a year on economics, you've wasted 12 minutes.""","This quote is from his 1994 lecture. It's available on YouTube if you search ""Peter Lynch 1994 Lecture"". I can't post the link here since this sub doesn't seem to allow YouTube links. The sentence in the title is at around 15:50 in the video posted by GiraffeValue.

The video is quite long and the image quality isn't good due to the age, but I think lots of his advice  are timeless and would be helpful for investors seasoned and new. I  highly recommend going through the whole lecture since it's very informative and quite funny.

**His words leading up to this quote:**

First  they tried to predict the stock market. This is a total waste of time.  No one can predict the stock market. Then they tried to predict interest  rate. If anybody can predict interest rate right 3 times in a row, they  would be a billionaire, and there ain't lots of billionaire on the  planet. No one can predict the economy. In 1982 we have 20% prime rate  with double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment. I don't remember anybody telling me in 1981 about it. I read and study a lot and  I don't remember anybody telling me we're gonna have the worst  recession since depression. What I'm trying to tell you is that it would  be very useful to know what the stock market are gonna do. It'd be  terrific to know the Dow Jones' average a year from now would be X, that  we're gonna have a full-scale recession and the interest rate gonna be 12%. That's useful stuff. You'd never know it though. You just don't get to learn it.

**Philip Fisher, another very successful investor and the author of some great investing books also held similar belief:**

Postponing  an attractive purchase because of fear of what the general market might  do will, over the years, prove very costly. This is because the  investor is ignoring a powerful influence about which he has positive  knowledge through fear about a less powerful force about which, in the  present state of human knowledge, he and everyone else is largely  guessing. (Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, Ch.6)

**My 2 cents:**

We've  been seeing lots of posts saying ""Don't fight the feds."" or ""The  economy's gonna be a lot worse."" recently. These people could be right  this time, but if they have the ability to consistently predict the  market, they would be making millions and enjoying their life, not  posting on reddit. Even the Feds themselves failed to predict the economy considering how many time they revised their plan for the past year. The best course of action would be keeping DCA into  index funds if you're a boglehead and keep buying stocks of companies  you believed in at reasonable valuation if you're a stock picker.

**For stock pickers, Philip Fisher also wrote about his criteria of a resilient business:**

1. The  product or service provided by the company is recognized by the  customer as being very important for the proper conduct of their  activities.
2. Inferior or malfunctioning product/ service would cause serious problems for the customer.
3. No  competitor is serving more than a minor segment of the market so that  the dominant company is nearly synonymous in the public mind with the  source of the supply.
4. The  cost of the product is only a quite small part of the customer's total  cost of operations so that moderate price reductions yield only very  small savings in relation to the risk of taking a chance on an unknown  supplier.
5. It  has many small customers rather than a few large ones and it's  customers are sufficiently specialized in different nature so that it's  unlikely for a competitor to reach many of them with a single advertising  media.

(Conservative Investors Sleep Well, Ch.3)

**My 2 cents:**

While  it's hard to find a company fitting all of these criteria and it  requires quite a bit of knowledge of certain industry or company to  apply, these rules should be quite useful provided you want to leverage  the knowledge obtained from your work or hobby on your investments.

This  post is primarily quoting words of great investing minds of the past  since I don't have much to add that is valuable. I just hope the wisdom  of them might prove helpful to investors trying to navigate through the  current market conditions.",finance,1664629855

Bitcoin,My thoughts about Bitcoin.,"Hello -

I'm new to Bitcoin Investing, and after doing some research below is what I think so far about crypto and bitcoin. I'd like to hear your comments, and hopefully I'm wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing you have to do with Bitcoin and other crypto's, is to separate them from the story of the Blockchain. 

Rather like separating the story of the Internet away from the story of computers. Computers were not invented for the Internet, that came later. The Internet is a by-product of the computer in the same way that Bitcoin is a by-product of the Blockchain. The Blockchain may be an amazing invention but that doesn't mean Bitcoin is.

There are many stories of the US Government experimenting with digital currencies. Long before Bitcoin, there are news reports of the US government talking about one day turning to digital currencies (CBCD). It's going to happen one day, but will it be like Bitcoin?

**Does Bitcoin work as a currency?**

I think that's it's clear that it doesn't work as a currency. It's too volatile, one day it's 20,000 dollars and the next it's 21,000 dollars. Some retailers will choose to accept Bitcoin whilst it's going up, but will quickly drop its use when it starts to go down. If it was made their only choice, then the volatility that makes it interesting to investors goes away. They would never store their money in Bitcoin as would be seen as too risky. Would you put all your cash flow money from your business into Bitcoin? I think it would be NO. You could wake up in the morning and have twice as much but you could also find yourself without enough money to buy any goods. You would at the least not know where you stood from day to day. 

**Is Bitcoin secure?**

I don't know if there is a backdoor into the Blockchain for Bitcoin. I suspect that there is, but I don't know.

Assuming there isn't a backdoor and the Feds can't look into people's finances. If you bought a car from a dealer using Bitcoin, would your transaction stay private? the answer is NO. The dealer would have to pass on the information about the buyer to the authorities. If you bought a table from Ikea, they would also need your information. If you paid for the table by cheque or credit card they would have your info, so why not Bitcoin. Only cash avoids this. Bitcoin is great on the Black market. If you want to launder money or get rid of your stolen items, it works, and both parties can stay private. But not much use in the real world.

**There are only so many Bitcoins?**

If they can make ever smaller denominations of Bitcoin (satoshis), then you can't use the argument that Bitcoin is limited. There are as many Bitcoin parts as there are specs in the Universe if they choose it to be so. 

**Conclusion.**

Bitcoin is the digital equivalent of collecting baseball cards. Its value is in making other people think it has value. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't invest in Bitcoin. A lot of people made money in Holland buying Tulip's in the 1600's, before the market crashed. It's about knowing when to get out, when will the people tire of this fad. 

I wish I had bought Bitcoin in the early days - that makes sense. But I don't think I would have profited much as I would have cashed in once my money had gone up a little. 

Bitcoin just doesn't work as anything other than a commodity like Gold, Silver or even Tea. But if Bitcoin fails it goes to nothing unlike the other commodities. It doesn't exist, it's just numbers on a Blockchain. If the central bank makes its own digital currency, then that will make a lot of investors drop out of Crypto's. Bitcoin only keeps going up if new investors can be convinced it will make them money, Every fad has its end time, I think this time, like the Tulip buyers time, is fast approaching.

If you already have Bitcoin, you should wait until you are in profit and then get out. But you shouldn't wait for ever as you could be making money with the Bitcoin money invested elsewhere. Sometimes you have to go backwards before you can go forwards again. 

I think in ten years time all you will hear from the buyers is, ""I wish I had sold mine earlier"".",cryptocurrency,1664640262

personalfinance,"Bank reversed scam transfers involving Venmo debit card, but Venmo may take issue. Advice?","**TL;DR: **
I’ve filed reports &amp; disputes with the police, FTC, Target, Venmo, my bank, and the state attorney general. I also placed a freeze on my credit. Target recovered some of the gift cards and gave a partial refund to my Venmo account, but said the rest of the cards were already drained.

My bank was able to reverse the transfers to Venmo, but my Venmo account (which made the Target payments via Venmo debit card) froze after those reversals. I’m afraid Venmo might demand the money my bank refunded/reversed.

**More details:**
I was the victim of an elaborate &amp; threatening phone + gift card scam a few weeks ago. Under threat from spoofed phone numbers posing as govt agencies, I made the transactions with my Venmo debit card (couple thousand $), which withdrew/transferred from my bank as my starting Venmo balance wasn’t enough to cover anything.

Venmo rejected all of my “unauthorized transaction” disputes. I requested documentation of their rejection research because they said I could, but I only heard back from support bots pretending to be humans. They said they couldn’t provide the docs, and (maddeningly) suggested again that I request the docs from that same email. With each of my replies they just transferred me to another bot-human who would say the same.

After that, I filed disputes with my bank via phone. Then my bank reversed the transfers! They showed up as new items labeled “Venmo reversal.”

But as soon as this happened, I received a bunch of emails from Venmo, one for each transfer:
&gt;	“Your debit failed. This account is no longer valid to make payments. Please update your bank account details and request another transfer from your bank. Reason for failure: Customer advises not authorized (SEC consumer codes except ARC, BOC, IAT, POP)”

I also received Venmo emails that my account was frozen:
&gt;	“Your Venmo account has been frozen. If you would like to reactivate your account, we first need to verify that you are the legal account holder. […] Once you submit your [ID and a recent bank statement]. through the above link, we will review your case and reply with more information regarding your account.“

Re: frozen accounts, the Venmo chatbot asks for one of two reasons that were provided for why the account is frozen: “Bank transfer failed” and “ID requested.”

For “*Bank transfer failed*,” the chatbot says:
&gt;	Venmo refunded the amount of the payment to your bank account, but the recipient of your payment still received funds. For this reason, you owe Venmo for the loss created by this payment.

But for *“ID requested,”* the chatbot just says to verify ID. I suppose my “account frozen” emails only requested ID, but they clearly happened after those failed transfers.

**I’m spiraling/overthinking as Venmo’s emails never explicitly told me that I owe them or that there was loss.** It just seems like that could be the case here. I haven’t completed verifying my ID with them; It would be nice to unfreeze my account but I’m worried about what might follow. 

A couple days ago, I received a call &amp; follow-up email from an Attorney General agent who said she would help recoup my funds. I believe this agent is real as she referred to my AG report, her name &amp; address checked out, her email was valid, and she didn’t ask for any compromising information or payments, only additional documentation to verify the scam occurred. She offered to write to Venmo asking to unfreeze my account, but I told her I needed a few days to think about it first. I’m paranoid that involving the AG with Venmo might somehow escalate this to Venmo being more explicit about requiring I pay them.

I told this to the AG agent, who suggested that if my bank reversed the transfers, Venmo shouldn’t be at a loss (“Venmo is just a conduit”). She said the freeze is only because my bank account seemed compromised. I don’t quite see it that way as the money transferred to my Venmo balance, then was spent out of Venmo to a merchant. Plus, there’s what the bot said. 

Do I have any options here? Should I ask the AG to contact Venmo? Or should I just avoid Venmo and hope that the other shoe doesn’t drop (Venmo following up against me)? Am I being paranoid?

**Extra details:**
-	I submitted all the scam documentation + related case numbers in my AG report.
-	As of last week, it seems an actual human at Venmo is now looking at the dispute case. She said she needed to forward the case to another team.
-	I’m aware that “unauthorized transactions” are typically cases where the spender is not the account holder. But I’ve also seen that it can apply to cases where the account holder is made to initiate the transfers “by force.” Can the fact that I was coerced “under threat” help? It seems like my bank classified it as such but Venmo did not. But my bank hasn’t given me an official statement about the reversals.
-	I’m also aware that victims of gift card scams don’t usually recoup any money unless from the cards. So I feel really lucky that my bank reversed the transfers. I’m worried Venmo might reverse that.
-	**Please don’t leave comments about red flags I should have acted on or any judgments of the sort.** I'm well aware of my missteps. I already feel stupid &amp; ashamed of this whole thing and wish I found r/scams earlier. As you can probably guess, the callers’ spoofed numbers and constant pressure/threats made me act in ways I’m still struggling to process. I’m emotionally exhausted, just trying to get my bearings &amp; guidance toward best next steps. Thanks for reading.",finance,1664647096

I make about $160,000 a year plus bonuses and RSUs (but I can’t access the RSU money for three more years—currently worth about $110,000). I put $3,000/month in savings. I’m in my late 30s and am extremely behind in saving for retirement and just saving in general. 

I’ve done steps 0-2. 

I’m not done with step 3. More on that later. 

My understanding is that I can’t do step 4 because my income is too high. 

I’ve done step 5 by contributing 15% of my income through my employer-sponsored 401k and Roth 401k (split about evenly). I think 15% is the max my company will let me do. 

Total retirement savings are just $30,000. 

I’m working on step 6 by saving for a down payment. I currently have about $35,000 in my down payment fund. I will be a first-time homebuyer. Long story why but I’d rather wait to get a large down payment so I can get a nice “keeper” house than buy a starter home and move again a few years later. So I have a long way to go in saving here. (My rent is very low so I’m not throwing a *ton* of money away.)

Anyway, back to step 3. This is where I need help. 

I have no credit card debt because I declared bankruptcy in 2020. I have a car payment but it’s at 0% interest because I’m just paying my dad for it. $10,000 left to pay on that and I do have the cash to pay it off in full if I wanted to. 

And I have about $160,000 in student loan debt. Interest rates are 7-9% IIRC. I’m on the Income-Based Repayment plan which forgives all debt if it’s not paid off within 25 years. I still have 16 years left until I reach that. 

Step 3 says to pay down debt with over 4% interest rates. Does that mean I need to *completely pay off* that debt before moving to the other steps? If that’s the case, I should only save the minimum for retirement to get my employer match and I shouldn’t be saving for a down payment at all. It will take years for me to pay all that student loan debt, pushing home ownership even further out, which makes me uncomfortable because I’m already in my late 30s. I would also be missing out on the higher rate of return I’d probably get on my retirement funds. And it would really suck to pay that off and then the government starts forgiving more student loans. I know I shouldn’t bank on that but it’s tempting. For example, even if they don’t forgive more loans but do continue paused payments and 0% interest, maybe there will be enough years of no payments that I’ll reach that 25 year mark and save a lot of money. 

I’d like to keep paying the minimum (IBR rate) on my loans while simultaneously saving 15% for retirement and $3,000/month for a house. Is that a terrible idea?",finance,1664648077
personalfinance,Using my home equity to pay off credit,Ok so here is my situation. My home is worth 375k with $124k left to pay on it at a 4.5% rate. I have a few outstanding credit cards of approx 20k and i owe 5k on my car. I would like to get rid of the high interest rate credit card debit. I figured a home equity loan might be my best option.

personalfinance,Young workers shouldn’t invest…?,"An article popped up on my news feed with the clickbaity headline “Many young  people shouldn’t save for retirement” seems to be based on this paper from last year: [NBER Paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28396/w28396.pdf)

Am I missing something or is this entirely based on assuming real interest rates of retirement accounts at 0% - aka putting it in bonds or worse a savings account at a major bank which no one in their right mind would recommend. Inflation adjusted average annual growth rate of S&amp;P is 7% right? What am I missing?

I can understand saying we might be undervaluing present spending for young workers with likely high wage earning futures but basing entirely on 0% real interest rates when market rates of return are much higher just seems silly.

Edit: I just want to point out, this isn’t a behavioral economics paper, there is no behavioral data being presented. you read the paper it’s claiming “optimal” behavior based on their mathematical model which assumes 0% real interest in retirement accounts.

*****
&gt; Stocks fell in choppy trading Friday as Wall Street closed out a terrible week, month and quarter that brought the S&amp;P 500 to a new 2022 low.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below 29,000 for the first time since November 2020. The index fell 500.10 points, or 1.71%, to 28,725.51. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.51% lower, ending the day at 10,575.62.

*****
&gt; “In the near term, we are likely to have continued market volatility with a downward bias as we head into earnings season,” Hill said.
*****
&gt; An inflation report closely watched by the Federal Reserve released Friday showed that prices continued to increase at a rapid pace.

&gt; # October First Trading Day Volatile Past 25 Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9486dc1b48c416cda77e22af75a85bd0/b65fc96ac5431d67-d8/s500x750/38ea4e0a88e36b29547ed79a9c883c9bd31c2e71.jpg))**

&gt; We coined the term “bear-killer” for October way back in 1968 in the 1969 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the second edition. The original theory from the 1969 Almanac still holds water.

&gt; Based upon data in the soon to be available 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanacon page 90, the big gain on 10/1/2021 pushed the first trading day of October into 7th place for DJIA of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA points gained.

&gt; S&amp;P 500 has been up 14 of the last 25 years on the first trading day of October. DJIA’s record is slightly softer with 12 declines and NASDAQ’s performance has been the worst of the group, down 13 times with an average loss of 0.25%.

&gt; # October has been a midterm bear killer

&gt; October can evoke fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point DJIA drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point DJIA drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, DJIA lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline, in percentage terms, in our database going back to 1901. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the largest and third largest DJIA weekly point declines. The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens.

&gt; October has been a turnaround month—a “bear killer” if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). Seven of these years were midterm bottoms.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/968004055de59af55e0f405c42800095/09b4658c6124f812-17/s500x750/716c61aa1d0d073c493cd748a2d7fa37b85399b1.jpg))**

&gt; Midterm-election-year Octobers are downright stellar thanks to the major turnarounds mentioned above; ranking number one on the DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. Midterm October is NASDAQ’s second-best month and Russell 2000’s third best. This is usually where the “Sweet Spot” of the four-year-presidential-election-cycle begins. The fourth quarter of the midterm years combines with the first and second quarters of the pre-election years for the best three consecutive quarter span for the market, averaging 19.3% for the DJIA and 20.0% for the S&amp;P 500 (since 1949), and an amazing 29.3% for NASDAQ (since 1971).

&gt; # 10 Answers to Questions About the Bear Market

&gt; 2022 has been historically difficult for investors so far, and it’s likely you have questions. We’re here to answer some of the most common questions we’re hearing nowadays.

&gt; Feel free to talk with your advisor about any of these topics – or if you have other questions not addressed here.

&gt; # 1) Just how bad has this year been?
&gt; There’s no way to sugar coat things – 2022 has been a rough year. Bonds historically have done well when stocks don’t, but this year that isn’t happening. In fact, the five previous times the S&amp;P 500 lost 10% or more for the year, bonds (as measured by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index) gained every time, up 7.7% on average.

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 price index down 22.5% for the year and bonds down 13.8%, only 2008 was a worse year for a 60/40 portfolio (with 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://carsonhub.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-092922.png))**

&gt; # 2) My bonds are down a lot. How bad has it been?
Yields have soared this year on higher inflation expectations and a hawkish Federal Reserve. As a result, bonds have been performing poorly.. Yields and bond prices historically trade inversely.

&gt; The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is currently down nearly 14% for the year, far and away the worst year historically (since 1976). To put things in perspective, it had never been down two years in a row (which will likely happen this year) and the previous worst year was a 2.9% drop in 1994.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://carsonhub.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-092922.png))**

&gt; # 3) Why shouldn’t I just sell everything right now?
Stocks historically haven’t done very well the first few quarters of a midterm year, but they do quite well once the midterm election is over. In fact, since World War II, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher a year after the midterm election every single time, up 14.1% on average. Much better times could be coming – and soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://carsonhub.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-092922.png))**

&gt; One final reason to remain optimistic and not sell now is that data shows stocks have historically tended to perform well after a midterm year low. Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 32% on average off the lows and has never been lower a year later. The June lows are not far away from current levels. Should new lows be made, it could be another positive for investors going out a year or more.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://carsonhub.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-5-092922.png))**

&gt; # 4) Should we have seen this trouble coming?
&gt; Although the size of the drop in stocks and bonds is surprising, to see some weakness this year wasn’t overly surprising. Some of the worst quarters of the four-year cycle took place during this year. The second year (so this year) under a new President tends to be quite weak as well. The good news is how well stocks historically do the following year under a new President.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://carsonhub.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-6-092922.png))**

&gt; # 5) What should we do now that stocks are in a bear market?
There’s an old saying that the stock market is the only place where when things go on sale, everyone runs out of the store screaming. Things are no doubt on sale and investors with a long enough investment horizon may want to look at this weakness as a potential opportunity.

&gt; We continue to think the economy isn’t in a recession (more on this below), so that likely means stocks won’t fall significantly from here. Historically, the bear markets that took place without a recession showed stocks falling about 24% on average. In fact, only once did stocks fall more than 30% without a recession and that was the 1987 crash. More near-term pain is always possible, but a major low could be quite near.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://carsonhub.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-7-092922.png))**

&gt; # 6) What could happen once the bear market is over?
&gt; No one knows when this current bear will end (we do think it will be fairly soon), but you should be open to significant gains coming off the bear lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://carsonhub.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-8-092922.png))**

&gt; # 7) Is the Fed going to break something? Or when will they stop hiking?
&gt; The Fed has made it very clear that they would be okay with some pain (think a mild recession) to put a lid on inflation. There is no easy answer here, but Chairman Powell knows history and knows that the Fed didn’t increase rates enough or keep them high for long enough in the 1970s, which led to massive inflation in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s. The truth is the Fed might break something and that might be part of their plan.

&gt; Looking back at the previous eight rate hike cycles shows that the Fed hikes until rates get above the headline CPI number. With inflation still running at 8.3% and rates at 3.25%, more hikes could be in the cards. And the Fed’s latest projections suggest we’ll see at least another 125–150 basis points of rate hikes.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://carsonhub.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-9-092922.png))**

&gt; # 8) Will inflation ever come back down?
&gt; The recent CPI number was disappointing, showing prices for many goods and services at the consumer level were increasing more than expected. The good news is various other inflation measures are coming back, and quickly, in many cases. For starters, energy prices have fallen and in many cases are lower than before the war started – a good sign. Meanwhile, supply chains are improving, as this survey by the NY Fed shows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://carsonhub.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-10-092922.png))**

&gt; One of the main reasons we are optimistic that inflation could be about to come down quickly is used car prices are rapidly dropping. The recent Manheim Used Car Value Index fell 4% last month, which is one of the largest drops ever. Used cars make up a large part of inflation readings and this should provide a nice tailwind going forward.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://carsonhub.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-11-092922.png))**

&gt; # 9) Aren’t we in a recession right now?
&gt; The odds of a recession in 2023 have unquestionably gone up, as the Fed continues to hike rates. But currently, we do not see the economy in a recession. The main reason is the employment backdrop is so strong. More than 3.5 million jobs have been created this year, one of the most ever and not at all recessionary. Additionally, industrial production has been very strong, another important component to the economy. Even consumer spending has remained stubbornly strong amid all the concerns.

&gt; Now, there are obvious worries as consumer confidence has been very low (but has been improving with gas prices falling) while manufacturing has slowed, and housing data is tanking due to higher mortgage rates. Currently, we think this is more of a midcycle slowdown versus the start of a recession.

&gt;  # 10) What could happen after the midterm elections?
&gt; One thing we try to stress on the Carson Investment Research team is not to mix your politics with investing. Many investors didn’t like President Obama and missed out of significant gains, while others didn’t like President Trump and missed out on gains.

&gt; Turning to the midterms, we know the party that lost the prior Presidential election is the motivated party and they tend to gain four seats in the Senate and nearly 30 seats in the House. Should this pattern hold again, and the Republicans take both chambers of Congress, this is the very best scenario for stocks. A Democratic President and Republican-controlled Congress has seen the S&amp;P 500 gain more than 16%, on average, during the calendar year. In fact, we saw this in the late 1990s under President Clinton.

&gt; What if the Democrats keep control of the Senate? This is about a coin flip by the odds makers and the good news is a Democratic President with a split Congress is also a bullish scenario.

*****

&gt; # Optimism No Where to Be Found

&gt; Although the S&amp;P 500 hit 52-week lows for the first time since June this week, bulls actually stepped back up to the plate (in a very small way). Bullish sentiment, according to the AAII sentiment survey, rose back up to 20% after a low of 17.7% last week. Even with that modest increase, bullish sentiment remains historically muted at 17.7 percentage points below the historical norm.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092922-AAII1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment likewise remains elevated and hardly improved. The latest reading dropped marginally from 60.9% to 60.8% marking the first time on record that there have been back-to-back readings of 60% or more as we noted in an earlier tweet. The only other times bearish sentiment came in above 60% were in March 2009, October 2008, and August and October 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092922-AAII2.png))**

&gt; Given the near record high in bearish sentiment coupled with the slight increase in bullish sentiment, the bull-bear spread improved rising from -43.2 to -40.8. Again, in spite of that improvement, the latest reading shows that bears continue to heavily outweigh bulls to a historic degree.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092922-AAII3.png))**

&gt; Given both bulls and bears are at extremes, recent moves have borrowed heavily from neutral sentiment. That reading has fallen sharply over the past three weeks and is back below 20% for the lowest reading since April 2020. The 9.5 percentage point decline over the past three weeks has been the largest drop in such a span since May pointing to investors being increasingly polarized.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092922-AAII4.png))**

&gt; The AAII survey may have moved slightly less bearish this week on net, but other sentiment surveys saw the opposite results. The Investors Intelligence survey saw bulls hit the lowest level since 2016, and the NAAIM exposure index showed the least long exposure to equities since March 2020. Standardizing and then combining each of these surveys shows that the average reading is now two full standard deviations below the historical norm. That is slightly better than the June low with the only other period with as depressed a level of sentiment being the financial crisis years.

personalfinance,Savings for elementary age kiddos,"My husband died last year and the kids and I have been living off of the their survivor benefits and some savings we had.

I anticipate going back to work soon and I’d like to put money into savings accounts for the kiddos and put some of their survivor benefits in there each month as well. I don’t want to put the money into a credit union because the interest rates are bologna and I don’t want to lock the money away either so I will not be putting their money into a 529; and it’s their choice if they go to college or not.

I was thinking of doing online banking and am leaning towards Discover Card Savings accounts since I already use their credit card.

personalfinance,Check interest rates on savings accounts,"With inflation as severe as it has been it is best to minimize the erosion of your buying power on any account with significant capital (i.e. your emergency fund).

I don't find it worth it to min/max and chase the absolute best rates but be aware that **just because interest rates are rising does not mean your bank is raising your rates**.

Capital One for example offers &gt;2% on their ""new"" savings accounts (and there are certainly better rates out there). However, they will not increase the rate on any existing account which with the recent historically low rates was only paying 0.05%.",finance,1664654182
solar,How can a charger draw more current from a solar panel when the panel is hit by more intense light?,"I have  a doubt about this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGe90rG4aQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGe90rG4aQ4)  


In this video, a ""solar charger"" is made by connecting an array of solar panels to a buck boost-converter, and the 5 V output is fed to a phone directly.  


In my naive understanding, the phone's internal circuitry should determine how much current it will pull from  a 5 V input. If the solar panel produces enough wattage to supply this demand, then the phone should charge. If not, then the phone should not. Any excess watts above this threshold should not increase the current, because doing so would mean that either the voltage is higher than 5V, or that the internal charging circuitry of the phone has changed.   


So, this setup should be binary: the phone should either charge if there is enough light to exceed the threshold, or not charge if there is not enough sunlight. But the charger should not charge faster as the intensity of the light continues to increase above the threshold.  


Is this correct? Or am I missing something about chargers?",energy,1664654361

personalfinance,Credit score and closed accounts,"About 6 months ago the wife and I decided we needed to ditch the credit cards.  Too many some with high balances and some with low balances.  Constantly paying and taping them out just to do it all over again the next month.   
We tried debt consolidation before and we didn't have the necessary discipline and eventually racked them back up again.  We also tried the snowball effect and it was great for all our small balances but when we hit the big 3 it just kind of fell apart.  
Option 3 started 6 months ago and it was working with American Consumer Credit Counseling (ACCC).  This consisted of us surrendering our accounts to them and the negotiated lower interest rates and lower payments.  This also would cause any account we put into the program to be closed. 

The question I have is while these accounts are closed and no longer incurring any charges, they no longer show up on my credit karma so if I am no longer using them and my balances have been consistently going down I have seen VERY LITLE increase to my credit score.

personalfinance,advice on home owner ship..,"I have broken out of the medical disability hell I was in for most of my 30s. I just turned 40 the same month as getting my first real career type job. My SO and I both work for the same company and make good money, around 70-90k each depending on overtime, bonuses etc. We currently have 1800$ credit card debt, 35k saved for a deposit, both have emergency funds, but very little retirement anything. She's a bit younger at 28 so I've encouraged her to put whatever her company matches into 401k, and she's also sitting on a 50k bonus, fully vested in 1.5 years. 

We really want a house. Though after looking this week we're on the fence, maybe lea ung heavily towards holding off. Here in Orlando it's expensive, we both work downtown, but even 25-30 min out starter homes are 400k. At 6% interest or whatever the hell it is now, pmi, taxes, it's gonnabe over 3,000$/month for 30 years to own out first home. We can afford it but we will go from spending less than 25% of our monthly take home on housing to like 35% which is just a trend I'm not sure I want to start. We live well with no kiddos, but signing off on the much money for basically the rest of time seems crazy. 

Just not sure what to do. We are both currently saving a MINIMUM of 25% of our checks, most months even more. I just have my checking set up to pull 25% of every check, and more at the end of the week if I have money left in my checking, paid weekly. Should we save more for a down-payment so we can get a monthly payment closer to 2k a month? I don't forsee us being able to find a house we love for less than 380-400k here. So 100k down payment might atleast kill PMI and lower the mo they costs. I guess it just depends on the market and interest rates over the next year or two?

personalfinance,Looking for advice whether to make Roth of Traditional contributions as an Army Doc.,"Hello everyone, like the title says, I’m a doc in the US Army, specifically I’m a general dentist. I’m trying to determine whether I should be investing into Roth or Traditional accounts. I file single for my taxes And my current pay is about 98k per year with about 73k being taxable. So far I have been investing into both a Roth IRA and a Roth TSP (the federal employee equivalent to a 401K) I am not eligible for matching to the TSP. At the end of November I will be starting a part time job off base (as a W2 employee) and I expect to make about $1,500 per week three weeks per month. This should bring my taxable income to about 94k by the end of the tax year. Is it a good idea to keep investing in Roth or should I change? 

Looking further ahead, I could be making around 135-140k taxable for the next year (if I don’t burnout with my part time civilian job) it’s my understanding that I would likely benefit to switch to a traditional TSP, correct? What would be the best to do with the IRA? Is there anything else I should be doing? Thanks for the help.",finance,1664661585

We are a middle age, middle class couple with a child in a part of the US where housing is very expensive. Just looking at accounts and seeing that it’d be easy to end our mortgage. 

We only have $22,000 remaining on our home mortgage, our home is currently worth approximately $550k. We have no plans to move, now or ever. Our mortgage payment plus extra we pay is about $1400/month. It is slated for payoff in 2024 (original payoff was in 2026 but we’ve paid extra for some years). We have about $60k in savings, which making nothing interest-wise. Our mortgage interest rate is 4.2%. We have another $50k or so in various investments and our retirement funds are an additional amount that will be enough to live off when we retire in 10 or so years. Our incomes together are about $6k/month. Our child has a sizable college fund and plenty in savings and investments. 

Any reason not to pull the payoff amount out of savings and be done with our mortgage now? I would divert the amount we’re paying now back into savings and would have savings back to where it is now within 16 months, which we would find something making interest to put money into.  I know we would need to set aside money for taxes and insurance. Anything else I should consider?  Thanks! I’m not a financial whiz and appreciate your advice.",finance,1664666243
investing,What do bond holders get when a company or SPAC goes bankrupt?,"I've seen a couple people recently on CNBC say that they think in the near future several SPACS and companies will go bankrupt because their business models are failing due to rising interest rates and that they stock price will go to zero.  Basically, they rely on debt to keep going at this stage in their business and the cost of the debt will bankrupt them.  They went on to say that their plan is to buy up bonds in the companies they like that they think will go bankrupt because they are good businesses aside from the debt.  And that everyone that owns equities in the companies will lose everything but the ownership of the companies will get turned over to the bond holders.  Lastly, they went on to say that this will be the opportunity of a lifetime to have an ownership in these companies on the cheap.  Of course they wouldnt say which ones they were targeting.

This is the first time I have heard of this.  Can anyone validate that this is true and elaborate more on how this works?

CryptoCurrency,Stoned Idea,"I wanted to ask if there's a crypto that uses a concept I'm imagining or if its a good idea or not. For starters I'm not very knowledgeable on monetary policy or blockchain tech, so go easy on me.

 I was thinking about a way to create a very stable in value, decentralized means of exchange. I had thought a good way to do that would be to have a crypto currency that had a circulating supply directy linked to the population of the world. 

There would be some issues with this like motivation to validate the network during population decline, and the fact that it would require verifying the population of the world accurately on a regular basis which seems impossible. Im sure there's so many other issues aswell.

 I'm just curious if the core concept of circulating supply being tied to world population as a means of exchange for the whole world is a good idea if it could be accomplished. I thought I had a light bulb moment and just made a discovery haha, but I'm kinda a dumb ass with regards to all the relevant fields related to this stuff so I realize I'm probably gonna get put in my place. Thanks people!

Edit* better explanation for use case and why I think this has value. I was talking to a friend and he brought up bitcoin being destined to appreciate if adopted because its deflationary, so it would not be a good means of exchange. It made me think that the perfect amount of circulating supply is relative to user population if you want to keep a means of exchange stable while still secure and decentralised. So the use case is simply a stable, secure, decentralized means of exchange.

CryptoCurrency,Tell me if my idea is bad,"***this is a repost since I got many downvotes for my bad format. I made some edits and broke it down into paragraphs. Many people on the last post talked down on the idea but did not give any legitimate reason why this is a bad idea. Id love to be educated.

I wanted to ask if there's a crypto that uses a concept I'm imagining. Also I would like to know if people think this is a good idea. For starters I'm not very knowledgeable on monetary policy or blockchain tech, so go easy on me.

I was talking with a friend about bitcoin and he made the argument that it is destined to appreciate in value so it can't be a good means of exchange. This made me think of a way to make bitcoin more stable in value. 

I was thinking that the best way to have a very stable in value, decentralized means of exchange would be a clone of bitcoin but have the circulating supply directly linked to world population. My thought process is that population is an accountable variable affecting price so if accounted for you would have a more stable price longterm assuming bitcoin was already being used worldwide as a means of exchange by everyone. 

My method to accomplish this would be to replace the halving method of block rewards determination to instead be determined by population change. If population was steady block reward would be equal to the transaction fees within the block. If population increases new supply is added into block rewards. If population decreases part of the transaction fees would have to be burned until circulating supply is back to scale with population. The population accounting and supply adjustments could be handled on regular basis at whatever time interval seems reasonable, or after a certain amount of blocks.

There would be some issues with this like motivation to validate the network during population decline, and the fact that it would require verifying the population of the world accurately on a regular basis which seems impossible. Im sure there's so many other issues aswell.

I opened an account with UFBDirect only to realize that the money isn’t super liquid and their customer service stinks. The money is for a house down payment I plan on purchasing within the next year (market permitting) so I may need to open another HYSA that allows the money to be a bit more accessible.  Should I be concerned with all these accounts? Would opening another be a bad idea?,finance,1664676943

economy,Quick question on interest rates.,I've been listening to a lot of economists lately commenting on the macro environment. Something I've heard several times recently is that the fed rate has some arbitrary cap based on the 2 year treasury yield. Basically the 2 year bond falls as the fed rate climbs and for some reason they are very confident that the rates won't cross. Can anyone here elaborate on the cause of this relationship? I'm not interested in why anyone on Reddit disagrees with all these PhDs. I want to know their reasoning for stating it. Thanks.,finance,1664683196
datascience,Looking for recommendations to shore up my mathematical foundation,"\*\*Please read the tl;dr version if you don't have the time to read the entire post\*\*

I have an engineering degree (graduated in 2005) but have always been on the management side until after my MBA. Post-MBA, I had my first Analytics role in FedEx in Pricing Analytics and I really enjoyed my time there. I had to leave my job as I was diagnosed with a chronic illness and haven't been able to hold down a job in the last five years.

During this time, I tried to bolster my foundation in programming, stats, and math through online courses but it feels quite shallow to me. I was admitted for a Master's program in Analytics in 2020 and I have been deferring it because every time I feel what I know in the areas I mentioned is inadequate.

tl;dr: I am looking for book recommendations (or any other resources you can think of) to make my foundations stronger in Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability and Statistics. I have a fair bit of an idea about what courses to take for SQL/Python/R/Tableau but if you have any suggestions there, that would be great too.",technology,1664693843

Many homes cost upwards of 50% more than they did a year ago, and interest rates on mortgages have gone up from what...3% ish at the end of 2020 to now 7%+?

Who is actually buying a home right now? I was getting ready to buy around around the start of this year and decided to hold off seeing where the market ended up, but Im just so astounded as Im still seeing homes bought regularly by individual consumers.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context - my significant others step mother just recently sold a home for 340k. She bought this same home in 2017 for ""under 200k"" according to her. They put up a for sale sign on this property and **it was sold within a week**, apparently they were flooded with inquiries about buying this house.

Inflation plays a part considering the value of the home now compared to 5 years ago of course, as does the area the home is in, etc...but Im at such a loss to understand why people would want to buy homes like this so badly where the market is currently. I can also respect that some people need a home and renting may not be a viable option for one reason or another, but is it really a viable option to so clearly overspend on a house right now?

Also, for clarity, they are living in this home with no intention of flipping (according to them).

**See the real-time analysis of this portfolio at** [https://degenomic.com](https://degenomic.com/)

TL;DR

* **What is this thing?** After blowing a few accounts on terrible single-name crypto choices, this portfolio/project was set up to see if DCA'ing emotionlessly would prove a profitable strategy over the long run.
* **How's it performing?** At the end of month 4, the portfolio has a lifetime return of -3.19%. Total inflows since inception are $1343.67 and the portfolio value stands at $1300.87, yielding a lifetime PnL of -$42.80.

# Macro Overview

It's been another tough month for markets including crypto in general, as the Fed indicated that it was willing to take any measure necessary to curb inflation, even at risk of collateral damage to the economy.

2022 has seen crypto trading like a risk asset driven by macro risk sentiment. Worries over a global recession, interest rate hikes and a strong USD have weighed on sentiment. That said, there are some signs of crypto decoupling from tech stocks and other related assets, as BTC's correlation to the NASDAQ fell significantly this month.

# Performance Detail

The return for September alone was a slight underperformance of -0.09% (a PnL of $-1.23), compared to last months return of -14.22%. Total inflows for this month stood at $326.93.

https://preview.redd.it/27ctrka0dfr91.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a28c1f93a936fbaba82e0ba288c55e4392fbdae

After a strong performance in July, two consecutive months of underperformance puts the portfolio into negative territory when measured against the US Dollar (whereas the weakening pound, GBP, sees the portfolio marginally positive).

XRP has propped up the portfolio with an extraordinary return of 46.66% following positive news in their ongoing legal battle with the SEC. LINK also had a healthy return of 13.13% which came as a result of its recently announced partnership with SWIFT. This partnership involves building a proof-of-concept that will allow SWIFT to instruct blockchain token transfers.

This biggest losers were RUNE(-15.56%), ETH (-14.18%), DOT (-9.88%) and AVAX (-9.15%).

# Asset Allocation

The portfolio currently holds: BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, SOL, DOT, DOGE, SHIB, MATIC, AVAX, LINK and RUNE. Despite almost equal inflows, the portfolio has become unbalanced as a result of XRP and MATIC overperformance vs poor RUNE and DOT underperformance.

Here we can see this continue to play out, with an increase in the index resulting in stronger performance in the portfolio. The dark red line represents a period of 'Extreme Fear', the light red represents 'Fear' and the white section represents 'Neutral'.

# Final Comments

Thank you for getting this far and for showing an interest in this project. As someone who doesn't have the time to watch charts all day, this was set up as an easy, emotionless and consistent strategy to gain exposure to crypto, and I am curious to see how this portfolio performs over the long term. Seeing the portfolio [ebb and flow in real-time](https://degenomic.com/) also gives one a perspective for how volatile the crypto universe is.

I hope you've found this post interesting and gives you some inspiration for your own adventures in crypto. Feel free to get in touch or [follow the project on Twitter](https://twitter.com/degenomic) where I provide intra month updates. If you have any questions, or suggestions for the portfolio and/or analysis drop me a line on Twitter/Reddit.

personalfinance,Considering an ARM home loan,"Given the current interest rates, I'm considering a 30yr ARM(5/1) over a 30yr fixed home loan, and would appreciate a sanity check. The initial ARM rate about 2% points under the fixed's rate with a lifetime cap of 5%. The hope of course would be that interest rates come down significantly in the next 5 years, and we'd refinance to a fixed. If rates continue to rise, though, it looks like my monthly payments could increase to about 1k over my initial monthly payment. This wouldn't break me, but it would certainly be less than ideal. Is it crazy to be considering an ARM?

Other info: I'm not planning leave the house for at least 15-20 years, so selling before the rate can adjust is not part of the plan.

**What are Casascius coins?**

Casascius Coins are physical metal coins created by Bitcoin user Casascius  (Mike Caldwell) and sold until Nov 26, 2013, that contain an embedded piece of paper with digital Bitcoin value, covered by a tamper-resistant hologram. Casascius coins are available in 1, 10, 25, 100, and 1000 BTC increments. They can no longer be purchased.  (you can find some sellers on E-bay, or other market places though)

**How do they work?**

The coins are designed so they could be circulated in face-to-face transactions. The first person to redeem its private key, gets the value on the coin, and afterwards, the coin no longer has any Bitcoin value. It is difficult or impossible to read the private key on the coin without damaging or destroying the hologram, which exposes a honeycomb-like tamper-evidence pattern when peeled.

The piece of paper inside each coin has a private key which forms the backing for the Bitcoin value represented by the coin. Redeeming the private key back into digital Bitcoins is currently available with a patched reference client and many of the alternative clients.

Caldwell imagined placing a private key on a piece of paper inside a washer with a tamper-evident hologram on each side. However, he found it was more economical to have a real coin minted with a hologram on one side than to have two different hologram designs, and so the first Casascius coins were customized brass coins ordered from a mint that makes car wash tokens.

**How many are left?**

As of Nov 27, 2013, Mike Caldwell suspended sales of items that contain digital bitcoins.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a branch of the Treasury Department, informed him before, that minting physical bitcoins qualifies him as a money transmitter business, which means he needs to register at the federal level and probably get state licenses too.

According to Casascius Tracker, there are 19,676 physical coins left to peel.  Each physical bitcoin has a different fraction of digital BTC.  Some coins carry .5 in BTC value, while some carry a single BTC.  Caldwell also made gold bars with bitcoins loaded on to them, like the popular 100 BTC Gold Bar.   There are some that hold 25 BTC and even units that carry 500 to 1000 BTC.  On March 30, 2022 an ""S1-COIN-25"", thats worth 25 BTC was peeled and redeemed for the digital value of $1.14 million.   The S1 COIN also held 25 BCH and 25 BSV, but those assets haven't been spent by the owners.   There are approximately 42,516 BTC left unredeemed on the 19,676 Casascius coins left unpeeled, at today's rates, that's $1.9 billion worth of bitcoin.   

I would like to thank user u/MilesPower for inspiring this post.   His comment from an earlier post lead me to go down this rabbit hole.  Thanks Miles.  Much respect and thanks to you.  Also, thank you Mike Caldwell.  Great idea and follow though.",cryptocurrency,1664741049

investing,Explanation needed: Why are short term US treasury ETFs not reflecting the rise in interest rates?,"Hi there,

I was looking at short (1-3months) US treasuries, to take advantage of the rising interest rates for the next couple months until I return to total market ETFs. I have been looking at the following ETF: SPDR® Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill UCITS ETF (Acc) ([link to justetf page here](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?assetClass=class-bonds&amp;groupField=index&amp;country=US&amp;bm=0-3&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00BJXRT698#overview)). 

However, the funds past performance both in the Key Investor Information Document (KIID), and the graph shown on justetf reflect much more modest gains, nothing close to the current treasury yield.


(note: the currency must be switched to USD, otherwise you will be looking at a pretty flat line overlapping the USD/EUR exchange rate, which is why the ETF appears to have gone up significantly in 2022 in euros).

Where is the catch? According to [the official treasury website](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&amp;field_tdr_date_value_month=202209), the current yield for 3-Month treasuries is 3.2%, significantly more than the cumulative 0.2% rise in the ETFs share price in all of 2022.

My interest would be using it as a money market alternative, which I can't find on DEGIRO. US treasuries at 3.2% with such short duration is as ""low"" risk money as there can be right now while maintaining flexibility and immunity from continually rising interest rates crashing longer term bond ETFs.

So the big guys just don't want to risk their money in any alternative which is riskier than that without getting more and therefore the treasury won't be able to finance itself without raising the coupon rate.
Is my intuition correct? I would like to know more :)

- currently bumming with the parents so limited costs right now. We will likely rent for the next year or so until the market cools down to buy a house, and we figure out where we want to be

personalfinance,"Roth IRA to Traditional IRA recharacterization, possible?","My family had health insurance through the Affordable Healthcare Act and had tax credits that reduced our monthly premium.

personalfinance,Cosigned with my dad after refinancing the home a few years ago with plans to sell in a few years. The time has come and he no longer wants to sell it anymore. What can I do?,"He bought a home during the 2008 housing crash in a VHCOL city (bought for $550K, now worth $1M, $300K remaining on the mortgage). He refinanced in summer 2020 for a low interest rate (3.75% I believe) and cosigned with him because at the time he was afraid he wouldnt be able to qualify for the refinance with just his sole income and needed me to cosign with my retail managerial job that I had for a year at the time. But he was also threatening to kick me out if I didnt cosign and theres no way I could afford rent in that city on a $40K salary at the time, so I had no choice but to cosign. Being homeless is very rough as I've had friends go through it and its very difficult to get out of it and some of them are still homeless to this day.

He also said he was retiring and the home ownership will be under me after he leaves the country. Ok so I'll sell the home once that happens.

Fast forward to now and I've now got a new job for a few years now since Fall of 2020 making more than double than my old retail managerial job and also moved to a MCOL city. I could afford rent here and still have plenty of money left over which I've been just saving and doing the minimum on my retirement account with company matches primarily because I want to focus on getting my own home here first.

Problem is, my dad still doesnt want to sell the home and keeps pushing his retirement date to his ""anniversary work date"" or ""birthday"" and 2 years has passed since then and he's still fucking working at 72 years old at his blue collar job doing mad overtime 6 days a week. I ask him each and every time WHY because his health is quickly deteriorating as my mother tells me from time to time about how he always feels all sorts of pains from his body, and he says he wants to save up as much as he can to build his own home back in his home country which costs him about $50K and he's supposedly saved $30K so far. So why not sell the home to not only get rid of my name on there so I can get my own, but they can have some money for retirement? He says he doesnt want to.

So now I'm stuck in this situation where even though my dad is alright with me not having to pay the mortgage anymore, I'm still financially obligated to pay anything thats owed related to the mortgage. I'm not sure what exactly to do here... just keep working and putting my extra money into my savings and hold until my dad finally gets why I made this decision to move and just let him bleed out or what? I believe he just holds this sentimental value to the home sort of like having that one rare item in a video game thats no longer obtainable and everyone else wants it. But its just him and my mother (now retired due to health reasons) in that home that I know they cannot afford even with SS.",finance,1664764010

vet,Could this be because of Gabapentin?,"SPECIES: Dog
AGE: Approximately 13 years old (rescue; exact DOB unknown)
SEX: Female, spayed
BODY WEIGHT: 3.5 lbs

HISTORY:
- EPI, high liver enzymes (Liver enzymes were high around the time EPI was diagnosed about 1 year ago. Since then, diet has been changed to freeze dried raw chicken and turkey, mixed with water and poultry bone broth, along with powdered Panakare. Change in diet and addition of Panakare has gotten EPI under control.)
- Poor teeth (Already had many teeth extracted over the years prior to current issue)
- Apartment living/Use of puppy pads (Was rescued already puppy pad trained. Encouraged continued use due to apartment living. Dog uses both puppy pads and outside to relieve herself and typically is very excited to go outside and go for walks.)

CURRENT ISSUE:
Took dog in to vet for annual dental cleaning on Tues 9/27. Vet said teeth were worse than ever (abscesses, etc.) and said ALL remaining teeth would need to be pulled. Vet prescribed Clavamox and Gabapentin (see attached pics). Specifically mentioned that Gabapentin was being tried instead of Metacam (which we used to use after dental extractions) since dog has a somewhat recent history of elevated liver enzymes.

CLINICAL SIGNS:
- Tues 9/27 and Wed 9/28, face was very swollen and dog was clearly in pain. However, she continued to eat (though less than normal), drink water, and used a puppy pad for relief. Each day after, the swelling was less and the dog's personality started to come back. She also began eating more food again and never refused the prescribed meds.
- Toward the end of the week, I tried several times to take the dog outside for a walk and to relieve herself, but she refused. She wanted to stay inside and continued to use the puppy pad.
- Today, Sun 10/2, I managed to get her outside and while she was slower than normal, she did walk and do her business. I kept the walk short so that she didn't over exert herself. (Prescribed meds were taken shortly before the walk.)
- (Today 10/2, cont.) Dog seemed ok after walk, but as the day went on, she seemed more and more lethargic. Now has trouble standing and walking. Joints in front legs seem swollen. Back legs don't seem to be working properly. She has gotten up to use the puppy pad, but as the day has gone on, this has been more and more difficult for her. She refused her afternoon meds and refused her dinner. I did get her to take a small bite of food from my hand and spoonfed her some water, which she seemed happy about. However, she doesn't seem to want to leave her bed and even lays on it in such a way that seems awkward, I think because she wants to move as little as possible. 

DURATION: Most concerning symptoms have been within the last 12 hours

LOCATION: Nevada

I already called in sick for work tomorrow and I'll be taking my dog to the vet as soon as they open, but I'm hoping to get some peace of mind until then. Here are my questions...

1. I read online that Gabapentin should be weaned off, but the vet said nothing about this. She has refused her afternoon meds. Should I try to get her to take a 1/2 dose?

2. If the Gabapentin is causing the wobbling/instability with legs, why did it take so long to manifest? Did I cause this problem when I took her for a walk this morning?

3. Besides taking her to the vet ASAP, is there anything I can/should be doing tonight to help her?

Thank you in advance for your help!",cryptocurrency,1664769673
personalfinance,"Backdoor Roth IRA, Direct Rollover, Taxes","(thanks [u/DeluxeXL](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeluxeXL/))

I am planning on doing my first ""[backdoor Roth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backdoor-roth-ira.asp)"" conversion. I have a few questions. My basic circumstances are described below, but I don't think they matter for most of the questions.

**MY CIRCUMSTANCES:**

* I want to roll over from a traditional to a Roth IRA. (I'm not sure ""roll over"" is the right term, sorry). I will call this a ""backdoor Roth conversion.""
* I will not make any withdrawals from my Roth IRA for at least 5 years after my ""backdoor Roth conversion.""
* I'm only interested in US federal taxes.
* I have never claimed any IRA contributions as deductions on any tax form.
* I haven't done anything with my traditional IRA this year, besides making contributions.
* My traditional IRA has only ever had cash in it (USD).
* I'm over the income limit for contributing directly to a Roth IRA.
* I am the only owner of either IRA, but my sister is a beneficiary on both. (I'm not sure ""owner"" is the right term, sorry.)
* I do understand that I need to pay income taxes without deducting any IRA contributions.

**MY QUESTIONS (and answers from the comments):**

1. My brokerage makes it easy to do ""direct rollovers"" (discussed on [this IRS page](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/rollovers-of-retirement-plan-and-ira-distributions)). **Is this a way to achieve what is described in the** [**above Investopedia article**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backdoor-roth-ira.asp)**? (A: No.)**
2. If no to #1, **what are the disadvantages of a direct rollover, compared to the ""backdoor Roth IRA"" strategy?** I'm especially interested in any tax differences.
3. **Am I allowed to make a ""direct rollover"" from my traditional IRA into my Roth IRA**, even though I am above the income limit for contributing directly to a Roth IRA?
4. Once I make my ""direct rollover,"" **will the assets that I rolled over get the same favorable capital gains tax treatment as the rest of the assets in my Roth IRA?**  (I think the answer is ""yes."" My reasoning is at the end.)
5. 'm pretty sure that I need to report my conversion on IRS form [5498 and 1099-R](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099r). I also think that this is the main place I need to go to find out the tax implications of this conversion. **Is this likely to be correct? (A: for direct rollover, maybe. For conversion, no: use form 8606.)**
6. I think that I need to use distribution code ""G"" (**no numbers**) in box 7 of form 1099-R. **Is this likely to be correct?** (""IRR"" stands for ""in-plan Roth rollover."")
7. I have never claimed any IRA contributions as deductions on any tax form. Because of this, I'm pretty sure that I do not need to withhold or pay any taxes as a result of my direct rollover (other than the income taxes I already withhold and pay). **Is this likely to be correct?** (My reasoning is at the end.)
8. I also will not make any withdrawals from my Roth IRA until at least 5 years after my direct rollover. Because of this, I'm pretty sure that I do not need to withhold or pay any taxes as a result of my direct rollover, even in the future when I make my withdrawals. **Is this likely to be correct?** (My reasoning is at the end.)

Here is my reasoning for why I don't think I need to withhold or pay any additional taxes as a result of my rollover, and why I think that I will get the ""normal"" favorable capital gains tax treatment for my Roth IRA:

1. [The Investopedia article from the top of this post](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backdoor-roth-ira.asp) says that ""if you make after-tax contributions to a traditional IRA—that is, contribute funds that are nondeductible and taxable that year—these amounts will not be taxed on their transfer to the Roth IRA.""
2. [The instructions for IRS form 5498](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099r#en_US_2022_publink1000291999) describe various withholding requirements. If I'm reading it correctly, all of the cases they describe are for ""distributions."" The instructions also say that ""\[t\]he 20% withholding does not apply to distributions from any IRA."" I think that a ""direct rollover"" counts as a distribution.
3. [The above IRS page on rollovers](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/rollovers-of-retirement-plan-and-ira-distributions) says that ""\[w\]hen you roll over a retirement plan distribution, you generally don’t pay tax on it until you withdraw it from the new plan."" It also says that ""\[n\]o taxes will be withheld from your transfer amount"" in a direct rollover.
4. [This random page from my broker](https://guides.interactivebrokers.com/cp/cp.htm#TransferandPay/directrollver.htm?Highlight=direct%20rollover) says that ""\[t\]he Direct Rollover is a tax-free distribution to you of cash or other assets from one retirement plan that you contribute to another retirement plan, including an IRA. The contribution to the IRA is called a rollover contribution. The Direct Rollover method transfers the assets directly from the retirement plan (and not to the IRA owner) into the investor's IRA, avoiding the 20% mandatory IRS withholding.""
5. [This random page from Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/roth-conversion-checklists) says that ""\[g\]enerally, converted assets in the Roth IRA must remain there for at least five years to avoid penalties and taxes."" It also says that ""\[a\] distribution from a Roth IRA is tax-free and penalty-free, provided the 5-year aging requirement has been satisfied and one of the following conditions is met: age 59½, disability, qualified first-time home purchase, or death.""

Flaws in this reasoning:

1. It relies on the idea that a ""direct rollover"" has the same beneficial tax treatment as what the Investopedia article describes, but I think that the method in that article is different from a direct rollover. (For example, that article rarely mentions rollovers but does mention that its conversion method is not subject to the one-rollover-per-year rule.)
2. If I'm correct that a ""direct rollover"" is not the same thing as what Investopedia describes, then I'm not sure whether I'm allowed to make a ""direct rollover"" if I am above the income threshold for contributing to a Roth 401(k). Even if I am allowed, I'm not sure whether I'm allowed to make a ""direct rollover"" without incurring some kind of penalty.
3. The most optimistic pieces of evidence (#1 and #4) do not come from the IRS website. One of them (#4) comes from a guide that I'm not sure is current.
4. I'm having trouble learning about direct rollovers from an IRA into another IRA, because many of the search results I get are about direct rollovers from a 401(k) into an IRA.",finance,1664777845

personalfinance,"Please Advise! Received a suspicious check in the mail and subsequent reminders to deposit it, allegedly from Wells Fargo","* I cannot find any subreddits for Wells Fargo (I feel like there should be one. Does this mean I’m blocked? If so, I’ve never even mentioned Wells Fargo) or for bank accounts. *

I recently received a check in the mail that appears to be Wells Fargo. The check is for around $50, and the letter states that it was sent to me after they reviewed my account which, after I looked it up, I realized was the checking account I had closed 3-4 years ago because money was being stolen from my account being hacked. Money was being taken everyday and it was super hard to catch. I banked with Chase momentarily, then returned to Wells Fargo. 

There’s **a lot** of strange stuff about this check. I have experienced a considerable amount of identity fraud. I decided to get my bank statements mailed to me instead of sent online since the internet has been the culprit that made so much of the identity fraud I experience a possibility.  Well, either my mail is being stolen or Wells Fargo isn’t sending my bank statements, because I have not ever seen one. I’ve confirmed with them that they are being sent. This has created a lot of issues for me. I have had the amount of money changed with certain transactions so that it appears I’ve spent more money than I actually have. Without a bank statement available to prove what I actually paid, I’m unable to prove how much I actually spent.  I understand this doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with the letter I received. I wanted to mention it just to emphasize that there’s just so much identity fraud I have experienced, and I don’t want to be tricked into cashing a check. I don’t know what the consequences could be - I don’t have anything in mind about what could potentially go wrong, but I just figured I would reach out in case people are aware of any potential problems I could encounter. I also find it a bit odd that there aren’t any subreddits for Wells Fargo or bank accounts (at least that I can access). That almost feels like a way to suppress people (or me!) from expressing questions and concerns and learning about issues from other customers.



**Here’s what’s weird about the letter:**
• the letter said the check is reimbursing me for any fees that may have incurred while a **restraint** was put  on my account
- I don’t recall any type of restraint being put on my account, and don’t even understand what a restraint actually is. I did not have any issues with owing money to the IRS, or over drafting too much, or anything that might have resulted in some type of hold or freeze occurring. 
• they have sent me three letters within the past few weeks reminding me to deposit the check. Why do they care whether I deposit a check for $50? Why are they keeping tabs on it? I find this very bizarre. What if I had another bank account and decided to cash it with that bank. I feel really weird about this, and feel like I am being set up or something. 
• the letter mentions they might be required to report “some of this payment to the IRS.” And that I might “be responsible for any federal, state, or local tax obligations associated with a portion of this payment. We recommend consulting with a tax advisor if you have any questions about potential tax liability or form 1099(s) you may receive. 
- first, do I really need to be concerned about the IRS over a $50 check?
- also, what is the deal with the wording? “some” of the payment, and “portion” of this payment? I mean, $50 is a minuscule amount as it is… and they are telling me I need to worry about IRS wanting to know about a fraction of that? 
- If the IRS does want to know about this check, wouldn’t they want to know about the entire check, and not a fraction of it?
- this would be for an account closed 3-4 years ago, so would this apply to the tax year at that time, or this current tax year?
• this is for an **old** and **closed** account. As I said it was closed 3-4 years ago. I know banks are supposed to keep records for 5 years, but why are they looking at closed accounts, why me, and why now?

**HERE IS THE PART I AM MOST SUSPICIOUS ABOUT**
They include a phone number for me to call 1-800-715-2716. I have not called that number, but I have googled it. I was very surprised to find that **nothing** showed up that ties it to Wells Fargo.
And if that’s not strange enough, I only get one page of results, and all but 1 or 2 are for links with half of the title or description being in Chinese characters. So it’s like Google doesn’t even recognize it as a phone number. Normally when I type in phone numbers I at least see those sites like, “Who called me at this number”, where you can either find the number you searched, or a similar number (slightly different numbers, like -2717 instead of a -2716

This seems like a red flag for me. I suppose it’s possible for anyone to fake a letter from Wells Fargo. I could do this easily if I knew someone’s bank account number. I’d really appreciate some feedback. I’m not desperate enough for $50 that I want to deposit this. I’m more interested in whether people know about this being a known scam, in which people might have a certain amount of information or access to a individual’s account, and depositing a specific check helps the hacker gain full entry and control over the account of something.",finance,1664794560

[Third post 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ot65n7/daily_fi_discussion_thread_wednesday_july_28_2021/h6uaj5m/?context=3)

Hello, I was excited to make my 1 year update post when I quit my job at the beginning of the year, but I wanted to say something different than just the numbers and our story (don’t worry they’re still below), so I’ve thought about it for more than half the year.

Married couple 40s, 2 kids (5yr and 3yr). Wife working \~100k, husband quit, net worth 1.5 million, USA. Inherited 600k. 253k mortgage owed, house value $320k, 30 year conventional 2.875%, no car payments, no other debt, credit cards always paid in full each month. Paid off $300k in student loans.

While approaching my planned quitting, it was hard to find information on what I should be planning and when to quit other than for traditional retirement. I did find it in fire blogs and YouTube channels after some searching. Most were successful fire personalities with income from that, but they all tended to agree that they found income after quitting and leaving a little before reaching your fi/fire number is good. So I agreed I didn’t need to stick it out yet another year, especially with kindergarten starting this year, and being very ready to leave my job.

On the other side, I think back to when I started a fire type journey, when I started worrying about my finances, back to my first job, and even my first allowance for cutting the grass. I see a lot of younger people interested in fire, so I’ll give my thoughts on it. I have a paper from my last year of college where I listed out my finances and had a negative net worth of $8k. (Could have been much worst, but my wife had 300k in loans we worked on for years after getting married) Even with a first salary of $55k, and my next job even less at $45k, my goals were to focus on my career and work/life balance (never found a job I wanted to stay at or balance, but I do have some good memories, accomplishments, and friends from work). I just wanted to keep my finances under control, not become wealthy, and just end up with enough to retire normally at 65 or something. I had just started at the 2008 crash, in IT, in a finance company. It was hard getting each of my next jobs, usually taking 6 months of interviewing and searching each time. Only towards the last few years did I make twice as much because I was focused on the salary and benefits. The benefits helped with fire more than a large salary, but you often don't know the details until you're already hired. My wife’s student loans led me to learning about all things finance and increased my worries. When she started paying them I could see the loan companies would lower the minimum payment over time and the math seemed like she’d end up owing more over time, a million dollars, not ever paying them off! I decided we needed to do nothing but pay them off and we did over 4 years (a mutual decision and all our finances combined). I did think to keep our finances separate, but I also started listening to Dave Ramsey at the time and decided to do everything together, only after we actually married. I learned a lot from Dave and even though I wouldn’t exactly follow much of his advice today, its a good place to start and still enjoy listening to a show every once in a while. I paid for his advisor once while still paying down loans and needing a new car and the person basically said we already have it figured out, but why keep these small stashes of cash around, pay off the loans (I would keep some extra emergency funds in my bank, money market, etc) and I had to let that go to the loans. Which I did. We had a 200k net worth once they were paid off, nearly all in my 401k's.

I think fire is a noble pursuit and at the same time not exactly right for someone in high school or even college. Yet, I’d recommend it as a goal. Goals are good to have as long as you leave room for flexibility and changes. You can eat rice and beans and forgo vacations in the pursuit of fire and even push yourself, as long as you also let yourself have a break, a splurge, etc. Learning from the corporate world, I made a BHAG (big hairy audacious/aggressive goal) after we paid off the student loans to grow our net worth the same way, but using an aggressive 12% return as the goal in addition to our contributions. We were behind our target every month for another 4 years and then the market jumped up and we surpassed it! We hit $1 million net worth this year (down to $800k with market back down). Looking back I never would have believed it was possible with my career, abilities, and our debt. Having a big goal changes your decisions, lets you see opportunities you normally wouldn’t see or look for, and ultimately changes your path. Yes, we’ve been lucky, bull market, careers, but there was no indication when we set out our goals that we were going to have the recent bull market, so luck favors the prepared.

We took a vacation right away, not because of quitting but because of an invite and timing working out. After a week or two I was starting to wind down from work mode. Not having to be oncall for the first time in like a decade was freeing and weird. I kept snapping back to panicking I don’t have my phone on me then realizing I can leave it on a table.

I thought I’d be eager to get back to doing some kind of work, even as a hobby. Normally when away from tech I want to get back into a project. That hasn’t happened and now I’m feeling less and less likely I’ll go back to the work I did with computers/tech, but who knows. Although my time is now filled with household projects.

I settled into getting things done around the house, food shopping during the week and taking care of more things during the week so we could start enjoying our weekends more.

Then, my dad passed away. I was able to focus on helping him before he passed because I was not working. I’ll never get that back and more than one person said thank god you’re not at that job right now.

We just inherited 600k bringing us to 1.5 million, but it really just gets rolled into the plan, and we may have reached that in 2 years without it. In the inherited IRA I’ll be taking equal amounts out over 10 years (IRS rule they take 50% if you don’t withdraw by end of 10 years). It's taxed as ordinary income so needs to be spread out over the years to reduce our yearly federal taxes. The plan with that is to invest half over 4 years, a bit each month. With this amount, I’m playing with individual stocks now, the majority of our investments are in index funds. The other half, over those first 4 years, will come out each month and go into VTI index in brokerage. At that point, I'll reassess and decide to keep doing stocks with that 20% of our net worth, or just go back to index funds. I’m reading about investing now, one book I really liked is 100-Baggers by Christopher Mayer.

That’s about it for now. I spend my time working on things around the house, projects, spending time with kids, researching investments, and getting used to the new routine. Any questions, please ask!",finance,1664799937
stocks,(10/3) Monday's Pre-Market Movers &amp; News,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week, month and quarter and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, October 3rd, 2022-

*****

# [Dow futures rise as Wall Street tries to recover from tough September](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/02/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher Monday as Wall Street tried to start the new month, and quarter, on a solid note.
*****
&gt; Dow futures traded 164 points higher, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were flat.
*****
&gt; Those moves came as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell further, after finishing the previous week 18 basis points down from its mid-week high.
*****
&gt; “It’s pretty simple at this point, 10-year Treasury yield goes up, and equities likely remain under pressure,” Raymond James’ Tavis McCourt said. “It comes down, and equities rally.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a tough month, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 notching their biggest monthly losses since March 2020. The Dow on Friday also closed below below 29,000 for the first time since November 2020.
*****
&gt; The Dow shed 8.8% in September, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 9.3% and 10.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; For the quarter, the Dow fell 6.66% to notch a three-quarter losing streak for the first time since the third quarter of 2015. Both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite fell 5.28% and 4.11%, respectively, to finish their third consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2009.
*****
&gt; As the new quarter kicks off, all S&amp;P 500 sectors sit at least 10% off their 52-week highs. Nine sectors finished the quarter in negative territory.
*****
&gt; In the fourth quarter, elevated inflation and a Federal Reserve intent on bringing surging prices to a halt regardless of what it means for the economy will likely continue to weigh on markets, said Truist’s Keith Lerner. Oversold conditions, however, also make the market vulnerable to a sharp short-term bounce on good news, he added.
*****
&gt; “I think we could be set up for some type of reprieve but the underlying trend at this point is still a downward trend and choppy waters to continue,” Lerner said.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, Markit PMI and ISM manufacturing data are slated for release on Monday along with construction spending.

CryptoMarkets,SEC Charges Kim Kardashian for Unlawfully Touting Crypto Security,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Kim Kardashian for touting on social media a crypto asset security offered and sold by EthereumMax without disclosing the payment she received for the promotion. Kardashian agreed to settle the charges, pay $1.26 million in penalties, disgorgement, and interest, and cooperate with the Commission’s ongoing investigation.

The SEC’s order finds that Kardashian failed to disclose that she was paid $250,000 to publish a post on her Instagram account about EMAX tokens, the crypto asset security being offered by EthereumMax. Kardashian’s post contained a link to the EthereumMax website, which provided instructions for potential investors to purchase EMAX tokens.

""This case is a reminder that, when celebrities or influencers endorse investment opportunities, including crypto asset securities, it doesn’t mean that those investment products are right for all investors,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ""We encourage investors to consider an investment’s potential risks and opportunities in light of their own financial goals.""

""Ms. Kardashian’s case also serves as a reminder to celebrities and others that the law requires them to disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities,"" Chair Gensler added.

""The federal securities laws are clear that any celebrity or other individual who promotes a crypto asset security must disclose the nature, source, and amount of compensation they received in exchange for the promotion,"" said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. ""Investors are entitled to know whether the publicity of a security is unbiased, and Ms. Kardashian failed to disclose this information.""

The SEC’s order finds that Kardashian violated the anti-touting provision of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Kardashian agreed to pay the aforementioned $1.26 million, including approximately $260,000 in disgorgement, which represents her promotional payment, plus prejudgment interest, and a $1,000,000 penalty. Kardashian also agreed to not promote any crypto asset securities for three years.

The SEC’s investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Jon A. Daniels, Alison R. Levine, and Pamela Sawhney of the Enforcement Division’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, and Kerri Palen, Lisa Knoop and Victor Suthammanont of the New York Regional Office. The case was supervised by Mark R. Sylvester of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and Carolyn Welshhans.

The SEC’s statement urging caution regarding potentially unlawful celebrity-backed crypto asset offerings can be found here. SEC Chair Gensler today published a video warning investors not to make investment decisions based solely on the recommendations of a celebrity or influencer.

CryptoMarkets,Crypto Lending vs. Staking,"The following are the ways to invest in crypto: Lending and Staking  


https://preview.redd.it/euhn4vcuglr91.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdd17a2b336543bce75e6dc9f23e1b0bfb938c51

**Staking:**  
Staking is a financial concept that is largely exclusive to the markets for cryptocurrencies. In a word, as an investor, you consent to stake the cryptocurrency you invest with a particular network to aid in the network's transaction validation. You are rewarded for doing so, often in the form of tokens.

A consensus process called 'proof of stake' is essential to staking. ''Proof of work is the consensus method used by Bitcoin and many other blockchains. In this approach, miners use a lot of processing power to crack a code that allows the blockchain to approve all the transactions in a block. Whoever completes the puzzle first receives the prize.

However, mining takes place in a different way in a proof of stake blockchain. The network assigns a miner, or node, the right to execute the validation job based on the quantity or stake of tokens the node currently possesses, as opposed to machines competing to solve a challenge.  
**Lending:**  
While staking aids in network security, lending enables investors to earn passive interest while helping in facilitating the trade.

DeFi, or decentralized finance companies, lets you lend your cryptocurrency to other traders and get paid interest for it. Many  loan firms like Maker, AAVE, and Compound have more than $8 billion invested in them.

Your cryptocurrency joins these lending pools created by these DeFi. Which then starts to earn money very immediately when the pools establish an interest rate, which varies based on the cryptocurrency you are lending and the rate established by the DeFi itself.

**An in-depth summary on Aquarius Loan:**

DeFi's attractiveness to many users is obvious, especially when compared to traditional financial services (TradFi), which are slow, have fewer features, demand considerable personal and financial information, and frequently offer meagre rewards. However, Aquarius Loan thinks that a more user-conscious DeFi is necessary for mainstream adoption of DeFi with all of its advantages to become a reality.

In order to deliver the best prices for all market players, including those who are interested in lending assets and those who are looking to borrow them, Aquarius is fueled by a strong and long-lasting liquidity incentive structure. Aquarius uses price feeds given by the decentralized data oracle platform Band Protocol to ensure fair and accurate asset price estimation.  
Aquarius is a decentralized exchange (DEX), automated market maker (AMM), as well as a decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing protocol that runs on the widely-known BitTorrent Chain (BTTC).   
Users will be able to create appealing APYs on their assets as liquidity providers (LPs). They will be able to borrow different crypto assets as borrowers as long as they offer the required collateral. In order to become liquidity providers the for Aquarius DEX and lending, users must lock their assets in the Aquarius smart contracts and get rewarded the assets that represent the collateral, such as aBTC or aBTT, which may then be used to reclaim the underlying assets at any moment in the future.",cryptocurrency,1664804514

CryptoCurrency,"Feds Siezed Stolen Crypto Funds And A ""Hacker"" Stole It Back From The Feds.","The full story is [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-03/feds-seized-311m-in-bitcoin-btc-the-crypto-hacker-stole-it-back) but for those with no Bloomberg subscription I'll break it down.

In 2014, a dude named Larry Harmon created a search engine called Grams. It  helped users scour the darknet for illegal drugs, guns, and hacking services etc. Users could then basically launder the money using a mixing service he ran called Helix, earning Larry 2.5% on each transaction.

In late 2016, AlphaBay another separate illicit market on the darknet, began pushing its ""customers"" to Helix. US authorities were looking at all this activity and an undercover FBI agent transferred Bitcoin from AlphaBay to Helix, prove a link between the two. In July 2017 AlphaBay was shut down, but authorities didn’t yet know who ran Helix. It was months later when Larry closed down the mixer, after having completing 356,000 Bitcoin transactions. He also went ahead and developed Dropbit, an app he dubbed as ""the Venmo of crypto"" for  transfers between users. Larry was a huge promoter of Bitcoin and his company Coin Ninja. 

Larry was eventually found out as authorities worked with Chainalysis using the bitcoin blockchain to track helix transactions and was later arrested and pleaded guilty to laundering 311 million in crypto. Authorities also found a Trezor wallet on him. Agents couldn’t gain access to them from the storage device found in his  office because they didn’t have the correct passphrases to unlock them.

Gary Harmon, Larry's brother, lived across the hall from the office. He talked to agents that morning and attended the hearing where prosecutors convinced a judge  that Larry was a flight risk and should stay locked up. Gary, who wrote letter of support about Larry’s positive influence on his life,  saying his older brother had given him a job, taught him coding, and  “truly made me a better person.”

In April 2020, IRS agents realized Bitcoin was disappeared from the faddresses they had flagged prior. Judge Howell said she was “very skeptical” that this had occurred without  Larry’s knowledge and direction. “Do you understand that?” the judge  asked. “Yes, I do know,” Larry said. “Don’t try and be cute with me,”  the judge snapped.

Howell ordered Larry to turn over all his passwords so agents could transfer the remaining 4,164 Bitcoins—then valued at $40 million—to a  secure wallet. Larry did, and the thefts stopped. Less than a month later, authorities were told by *Larry* that Gary was the culprit, and also from another informant. Larry faces up to 20 years in prison, but his cooperation with  prosecutors will likely earn him a lesser sentence. He’s also been served a $60 million civil fine from the US Department of the Treasury. 

Federal agents began building a case against Gary. An informant told them Gary had asked fpr advice on Bitcoin gambling services. The source believed Gary wanted to use them to mix Bitcoin which he took  from Larry. Gary is “not the sharpest tool in the shed and did not think through the consequences for his brother” before he moved the  Bitcoin, the informant said. Agents later found emails from Trezor in Gary's wallet that reflect his wallet re-creation. He has denied taking the Bitcoin. Interviewed by agents in July 2020, he said, “If I took it, why wouldn’t I take it all?”

Recently, Gary’s lawyer said in court that “just because the government  cannot manage to keep up with its technology, that is not the  defendant’s problem.”

Agents traced 519 of the stolen Bitcoin through two mixers and prosecutors say the transactions correspond to a “dramatic  transformation” in Gary’s finances. It is said he deposited 68 Bitcoin  with the BlockFi. He used most as collateral for a $1.2 million loan. And of course, some of this went to buy a luxary condo in Cleveland. (Always a big mansion with these people, because that's so unassuming.) Within the government filings, there were also pictures of him in a bathtub full of dollar bills surrounded by scantily clad women. Because of couse he was.

Gary was  arrested in July 2021, on money laundering and other  crimes. He, like his brother, requested bail. He was told to turn over the seed phrases to secure his bail. His lawyer said that condition effectively admittance of the crimes, which  violates his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

At a July hearing, prosecutor Brown said Gary turned down two plea offers. His trial is scheduled for February.

personalfinance,Need some advice on consolidating debt,"So, hopefully I can get some good advice/direction. 🤞🏼🤞🏼

So, my wife and I just applied for an equity loan through Discover, hoping to put our $20k credit card debt into a much lower interest rate loan. It would if reduced our monthly payment from just over $1000/month to just under $400/month.  Was also going to use $10,000 of it to pay for a ton of required dental work I just found out I need.

Well, Discover ended up denying us. My credit score is at 675, and my wife's is at 663. Hers dropped after Discover ran her credit for equity loan, it was about 670 but not sure how much those 7 points matter overall.

I'm just at a loss on how to move forward and get ahead.  It's so frustrating to get denied a loan, that is pulling from my home's equity, when the overall monthly payment would be less than we are currently paying. We are never late on any payments, and have perfect payment history on both of our credit history as far as I can tell. However, we do have a bankruptcy on our credit that is due to fall off in about 1 year.

Mainly, does anyone have any advice? I know there is the pay it all off slowly method. But honestly, we are just barely making minimum payments. We are able to pay all our bills, but just barely. We have nothing saved anywhere other than my smallish 401k, and wife has a pension.  But I also have this massive dental issue I need to also figure out, and I'm also worried that as interest rates keep increasing, our hole is just going to get deeper.

devops,OIDC with github actions and security,"Hi all,   


It's my first time setting up the OIDC connection for the github actions runners to not need static credentials.  

I love how it works and it's almost seamless/black magic with the ease of setting it up

My concern however is around ( and maybe this is a bigger issue) that you eventually just begin to assign it Admin permissions because of how much it's supposed to do  


For example in my setup I have used terraform to establish the connection 

&amp;#x200B;

    resource ""aws_iam_openid_connect_provider"" ""oidc_github"" {
      url = ""https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com""
      client_id_list = [
        ""sts.amazonaws.com""
      ]
       ... More code
    }

and then have something like   


    resource ""aws_iam_role"" ""role_github"" {
      name = ""role-github""
      managed_policy_arns = [
            aws_iam_policy.vpc.arn,
            aws_iam_policy.kms.arn,
            aws_iam_policy.iam.arn,
            aws_iam_policy.ec2.arn,
            aws_iam_policy.aks.arn,
            aws_iam_policy.dynamodb.arn,
            aws_iam_policy.rds.arn
      ]
    
      assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
        Version = ""2012-10-17""
        Statement = [
          {
            Action = ""sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"",
            Effect = ""Allow""
            Sid    = ""RoleForGitHubActions"",
            Principal = {
              Federated = aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.oidc_github.arn
            }
            Condition = {
              StringLike = {
                ""token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud"" = ""sts.amazonaws.com"",
                ""token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub"" = ""repo:myRepoName:*""
              }
            }
          },
        ]
      })
    }

So I at least I'm following ""best-practises""  ( or at least i think I am ) by creating individual IAM roles for each of the services and it only has the permissions it needs to operate. 

So for example someone adds a dynamodb module they also create the `aws_iam_policy.dynamodb.arn` but in order to create this role terraform itself would need the `IAM` permissions to create roles. In which case I'm struggling to see much improvements over the lazy option 

      managed_policy_arns = [
        ""arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess""
      ]

For example if someone has access to the repo but not AWS itself couldn't they just use that the ""better"" method to hack in their code for their nefarious purposes just as easily as if I used the lazy generic method ?",technology,1664811055

personalfinance,Can you explain what the words mean plz?,"Hello there!

I have questions about some financial…tools? I guess you’d call them. We probably should talk to the institution that manages them and/or an actual professional like an accountant, but I thought I’d solicit the internet for opinions in the meantime.
 

My wife is nominally a trust fund baby. Her grandfather set up funds for all his grandchildren when they were born to pay for college. Said college is now 10 years past but there is still money in those accounts. The setup and disbursing of funds for her education was all handled by her grandfather’s lawyer but he’s retired now. Every time we have tried to talk to the financial institution about this, my wife starts to shut down because she doesn’t know what they mean or what they’re talking about – she may be a trust fund baby but we both grew up poor and don’t totally understand the jargon. Plus without exception the guys on the phone seem to be trying to sell something and she feels very talked-down-to, so she’s basically written off the whole thing as “if I ignore this, I don’t have to deal with obnoxious financial dudebros”.


We would like to understand better what our options are though, as well as actually understand what these things are. I hope that makes sense? At the moment, I don’t really know what we can do with these things, if anything, let alone what is the best course of action. Again, we should probably talk to an accountant, but the internet is free, so… details below, more or less anonymized: there are two accounts in my wife’s name with the same financial institution, a life insurance policy and an annuity.  


The life insurance policy says (on the annual statement) that it has a total death benefit of about $900k and a cash value of about $150k, dividends are used to purchase paid up additional insurance and pay annual premium. There is also something about an automatic premium loan for missing interest payments.


The annuity statement says that it is a fixed annuity, single premium retirement series, in the personal annuity market. It lists a contract value and/or cash surrender value of about $85k, lists an interest rate of 3.50%, and says “your contract can be converted into an income plan that cannot be outlived”.
 


Again, at this point I’m mostly on a fact-finding mission, trying to figure out what these accounts are and what we can do with them, if anything. I would talk to the financial institution directly, but again they have been dickish and talked over our heads. If anyone has any advice I can’t stop you from voicing it, but I'm really interested in a layman’s explanation of what these things are and what they do. I/we are reasonably intelligent people, but this sort of thing is not something either of us has any familiarity with.

2) Fixed rate HELOC at 7-8% (Requires a $5k draw)

Based on the current rates offered, I'm thinking it would be wise to get a fixed-rate loan -- seeing as interest rates could continue to rise into 2023 (and likely will) given inflation, the war, supply chain, solid job market/unemployment rate, etc.

*Our energy regulators seem to be suffering from Firefighter Arsonist syndrome. In the realm of public safety, this refers to firefighters who set fires so they can show up and play the hero. With our power grid, this refers to the policymakers and regulators who strangle competitive electricity markets so they can say the market is broken, allowing them to exert greater control over the grid.*

*State policymakers and utility commissioners, alongside their federal counterparts at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, have saturated power markets with unworkable policies and are now openly lamenting the inability of those markets to deliver the results they expect. Specifically, some go so far as to say that regional transmission organizations, which coordinate and monitor regional, multi-state power grids, are failing to ensure reliability, and fail to deliver cost-effective electricity and are therefore no longer appropriate.*

stocks,Cargo Shipowners Cancel Sailings as Global Trade Flips From Backlogs to Empty Containers,"From the Wall Street Journal:

Ocean carriers are canceling dozens of sailings on the world’s busiest routes during what is normally their peak season, the latest sign of the economic whiplash hitting companies as inflation weighs on global trade and consumer spending.

The October cancellations are a sharp reversal from just a few months ago, when scarce shipping space pushed freight rates higher and carriers’ profits to record levels. Last October, companies like Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. were chartering their own ships to get around bottlenecks at ports to meet a surge in demand for imports.

Trans-Pacific shipping rates have plummeted roughly 75% from year-ago levels. The transportation industry is grappling with weaker demand as big retailers cancel orders with vendors and step up efforts to cut inventories. FedEx Corp. recently said it would cancel flights and park cargo planes because of a sharp drop in shipping volumes. 

On Thursday, Nike Inc. said it was sitting on 65% more inventory in North America than a year earlier and would resort to markdowns.The erosion in global economic conditions, from the war in Ukraine to factory shutdowns in China, have dealt heavy blows to trade activity. The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for global growth in gross domestic product multiple times this year. Consumer prices are rising at the fastest rates in years in the U.S., countries in Europe and other parts of the world.

One response to the melting demand has been to reduce sailing trips. In September, container capacity offered by ship operators in the Pacific was down 13%, dropping the equivalent of 21 ships that can each move 8,000 containers in a single voyage, from a year earlier, according to shipping-data providers Xeneta and Sea-Intelligence.  For the two weeks starting Oct. 3, a total of about 40 scheduled sailings to the U.S. West Coast from Asia and 21 sailings to the East Coast from Asia have been scrapped, according to the data companies as well as customer advisories viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Typically at this time of year, an average of two to four sailings a week are blanked, the industry’s term for canceled sailings. 

Carriers also are increasingly canceling trips along key Asia-to-Europe routes, the data providers said.

“In the first week of October, one-third of previously announced capacity will be blanked and for the second week, it will be around half,” said Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta. “The downturn pace in recent weeks has been very fast and it looks like carriers misread the low volumes of a nonexistent peak season.”

The period between late summer and early fall typically is the busiest time of year for the largest carriers, as retailers and other importers build inventories ahead of the holiday shopping season. 

**Daily freight rates now average $3,900 to move a single container across the Pacific, compared with $14,500 at the start of the year and more than $19,000 in 2021, according to the Freightos Baltic Index.**

(a) When money or property has been wrongfully withheld, interest shall be an amount which fully recognizes the gain or benefit realized by the person withholding such money or property from the date of wrongful withholding to the date of payment or to the date judgment is entered, whichever first occurs; or, at the election of the claimant,
(b) Interest shall be at the rate of eight percent per annum compounded annually for all moneys or the value of all property after they are wrongfully withheld or after they become due to the date of payment or to the date judgment is entered, whichever first occurs.
(2) When there is no agreement as to the rate thereof, creditors shall be allowed to receive interest at the rate of eight percent per annum compounded annually for all moneys after they become due on any bill, bond, promissory note, or other instrument of writing, or money due on mutual settlement of accounts from the date of such settlement and on money due on account from the date when the same became due.

Some facts of my situation:
- I am 30, and work in accounting and have a pretty good understanding of general finance. I also have a part time job that I love that I work evenings/weekends.
- I currently live at home which has offered an opportunity to build a savings. I’ve got about ~$50k in savings/bonds, along with a 401k &amp; Roth that I contribute to per paycheck/monthly (I don’t plan to touch either for a home purchase or anything in case of an emergency).
- I have ~40k in student debt (expecting to have $20k forgiven due to receipt of Pell Grant in undergrad).
- My current full time job offers salary+benefits package of  ~$70k-$80k range. Financially, it’s not a bad gig, the unfortunate part is it’s high stress, incredibly boring, and has caused physical ailment (sedentary/stationary lifestyle does not work for me nor does the stress) and general mental health issues.
- My new job would shift my part time side gig to full time and is expected to bring in ~$55k. I’m expected to work 4 days, offering an opportunity to pick up part time work if I chose to supplement my income and would offer a much better general existence for me. It aligns with my passions and provides genuine life fulfillment. It’ll keep my active, and Is also is a bit unconventional and flexible which I love.
- I’m looking to purchase real estate (I’ve been watching the market in the area for 2ish years). Despite rising interest rates, it seems home prices are slowly coming down. I hope to purchase in the $200k-$250k range, which could put my monthly payments as high as ~$2,200 with current rates. Moving could cut my 40 minute commute in half, if not more, saving on gas and wear and tear on my vehicle which I’m expected to pay off next year. 
- Rent in the area (with two dogs) could be as high as $1,800/month. The option for roommates is also a possibility.
- My credit score is somewhere in the 790-800+ range.
- My monthly expenses vary, and I could definitely budget if need be, but I believe a mortgage would put me into a position of little cash flow mobility.

We currently own and reside in a home in another state.  We are not too far out from saving up for a down payment for a second house, maybe two years to do it comfortably, or sooner if we cash out our stocks and retirement (which doesn't seem like a good idea at the moment).

If we rent for one year, it would eat away greatly at our ability to save up for a down payment of the home and walking away leaves us with no equity.  We would need somewhere between $3500-$4000 a month to afford rent. 

If we buy, the down payment on a $850k house would be about $170k with a monthly mortgage of $5400 with current interest rates.  Although the mortgage is higher than the rent, at least we would have equity for when we sell the house right?

But then the other costs that you don't recoup such as closing costs when you buy ($20k) and agent fees when you sell ($45k) should also be factored in.  I've done the online calculators but they seem to leave out important information.

If it works out to about the same cost for living in it for 3 years, I'd rather buy to make it our own, but if it's drastically more expensive, then renting a year as a trial run seems like a better option.",finance,1664833662

personalfinance,Need Real Estate Advice: Can I recover Earnest Money when lender extended closing period past contracts close date but won’t provide me with a denial letter?,"Hi, first time home buyer here. 

I started the process about 8 weeks ago to try and purchase first home. I spoke with a large lender (won’t name drop but big bank) and explained I was interested in getting prequalified to purchase a condo with an FHA loan. 

Got prequalified and found a realtor I liked. After seeing several condos within my budget I found one and submitted an offer just slightly under asking. Seller accepted my offer. 

I spoke with my lender before signing and gave them all the details, and they told me they could close it in the allotted 5 week closing period my seller had ask for. The condo was not already FHA approved but looked like it would fit their requirements and lender said they could submit everything to get in approved. 

So I went under contract. Paid earnest money, had an inspection, and got pre approved from my lender. Inspection went perfectly and found nothing. 

Now 3 weeks into 5 week closing period I had been asking lender for a few days in a row when I could expect an update on the appraisal and FHA approval. After 3 and a half weeks my lender finally got back to me and told me they “were at the mercy of the appraisal and approval companies and they would need the seller to agree to an 8 week extension to the closing period.” 

Seller did not agree to the extension and stopped answering my realtor or myself. I realized that we may have to terminate the contract because my lender can not reach the allotted closing date. Reached out to my realtor and was told we would need a denial letter from the lender at this point to recover the earnest money by way of failure to secure buyer approval. 

I reached out to the lender to ask for a denial letter and escalated the situation up the chain and they will not provide me with one. Reason being- I myself am not denied. They just cannot reach the closing period they told me they could and I went under contract with the expectation they could. Lender said to simply show emails to escrow agent to get earnest money back. Now my realtor is saying it’s unlikely I will get the earnest money back at all.

CryptoCurrency,Fed Will Trigger a Global Recession if Rate Hikes Continue: United Nations,,cryptocurrency,1664835915
stocks,U.N. agency warns of recession linked to 'imprudent' monetary policy,"From Reuters:

A United Nations agency warned on Monday of the risk of a monetary policy-induced global recession that would have especially serious consequences for developing countries and called for a new strategy.

""Excessive monetary tightening could usher in a period of stagnation and economic instability"" for some countries, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said in a statement released alongside its annual report.  


&gt;""Any belief that they (central banks) will be able to bring down prices by relying on higher interest rates without generating a recession is, the report suggests, an imprudent gamble,"" it said.

The report said that higher interest rates, including hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, would have a more severe impact on emerging economies, which already have high levels of private and public debt. The report, entitled ""Development prospects in a fractured world"", also warned of a potential debt crisis in the developing world.  


&gt;*""The current course of action is hurting vulnerable people everywhere, especially in developing countries. We must change course,""* UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan told a press conference in Geneva.

Asked about solutions, she suggested there were **other ways to bring inflation down**, mentioning windfall taxes on corporations, better regulations to control commodity speculation and efforts to resolve supply-side bottlenecks.

""If you want to use only one instrument to bring inflation down...the only possibility is to bring the world to a slowdown that will end up in a recession,"" she said.

Overall, UNCTAD revised down its 2022 global growth projection to 2.5% from the earlier 2.6% estimated in its March assessment. It expects growth of 2.2% in 2023.

The International Monetary Fund also warned last month that some countries may slip into recession next year and revised its growth forecast downwards.

stocks,My Bear Thesis,"I have been investing for over a decade and I have not seen anything like the past two and a half years. 

As 2019 came to a close we were seeing a general softening of the market and than COVID-19 hit and central banks around world started with the most accommodating fiscal and monetary policy in history. Interest rates dropped to essentially 0 and everyone got a free money like an Opera talk show. We saw the fastest and strongest bull run and shortest recession in history. It created crypto and meme millionaires commodities sky rocketed like lumber, copper, lithium, rare earth metals etc. housing prices increase by 50-100 percent in most market in North America we had one of the largest drops in labor force participation and turnover. 

In 2022 this all changed as our fearless central bank leaders ignored the ramped run up of assets and impacts of free money for all polices as just a transitory hiccup not to worry about  to only see one the largest increases inflation since the 70s. This of course led to the ""o faaak"" moment where they decided to raise rates quickly to avoid hyperinflation and so free money ended, eviction moratorium were lifted and the most aggressive tightening cycle in history ""The Big Squeeze"" has begun.

Today we continue to see a tight labour market, a rising USD, an energy dislocation, rising costs of almost all things including debt and a high interest environment that hasn't been fully priced in nor adjusted to which is leading to business and consumers being squeezed and a high degree of volatility in financial markets. 

We are seeing one the largest periods of personal savings evaporate and consumer debt starting to rise as the global synchronized tightening cycle  continues with promises of increase unemployment and pain. In many markets we have seen the impact working it's way through the real estate market, reduction in real consumption and disorder in financial markets as a result from USD aggressive apperction. 

1. As unemployment ticks up, household debt to increase and  real estate price declines will accelerate. 

Typically people will hold on to their homes until the bitter end But with rising rates, food bills, car payments, declining real wages and loss of an income earner many house holds will reduce consumer discretionary purchases, end leases or financing on second cars and increase the use of credit before having to sell their house. 

We have already seen big declines in consumer discretionary items and we are likely to see used cars and auto related stocks see drying up demand as a precursor to accelerated real estate declines. 

Short Consumer Discretionary ETFs 

Leap PUTs on auto traders / manufactures with high valuations, low margin of safety and operating margins of less than 30%. (2022 Q4-2023-Q1)

Short US Real estate - decline have started in many states in the US but more advanced in NZ, AUD, CAN, UK.  (2023)

Bullish - Agriculture, discount grocers, fertilizer, oil consumer staples, utilities. 

EU energy Crisis and War in Ukraine 

Higher prices for energy at multiples of other regions will have an outsize impact on manufacturing and will lead to a recession in Q4 2022. 

Short EU equities (EPV)

Bullish - LNG exporters, Uranium, Defense companies, USD.


Consumer Debt crisis - moderate to high probability with declining real estate equity and increases unemployment/ debt.(DRV)

Financial crisis- increasing probability with liquidity reductions over 2022-23.

Sovereign debt crises - increasing probability in emerging markets and is occuring in some countries already.

We are entering a period of higher uncertainty and volatility (UVXY) equities and bonds have both underperformed over the last 6-9 months with the USD being the safe haven has appreciated greatly. It is likely we will see a continuation of this trend as assets and consumption continue to decline and the accumulative impact of a high rate environment over longer duration has an outsize impact on the consumers, companies with larger debt loads and lower operating margins and countries that are import dependent with declining currencies. 

While a pivot is possible it will likely be short lived as cash inflows into equities and commodities will likely re spark inflation which policy markers are trying to avoid as history of the 1970s pivot has been closely examined.

It is more likely that monetary policy will only be used as last resort to prop up asset prices when they breach well below March 2020 lows to stem off deflation as the war against inflation is declared over at least in the short term.

personalfinance,$37k Special Assessment! What is the best option?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

The title says it all. My HOA is about to vote on a $37,000 special assessment. If it doesn't pass, units will not be able to be rented out because they will not be up to code, which will most likely mean it will be hard to sell as well. Because of all this, I'm expecting the special assessment vote to pass. 

Here is the information given to me by the Board:

* Special Assessment: $37,000/unit
* Option 1: Pay Lump Sum
* Option 2: Monthly installments over 15 years (5.75% interest rate) + other fees

I'm trying to figure out what is the most financially smart option for me and my family:

* Pay lump sum.
* Take the 5.75% interest loan offered by the Association's lender and make monthly payments.
* Some other option I'm not thinking of.

Based on what I've learned from lurking on this subreddit, here is my assessment of these options:

* **Paying lump sum:** This is almost my family's 1-year worth of expenses, but we have ~3 years of expenses saved up (we're saving for a home down payment). However, I assume putting the money in the S&amp;P 500 is the better option (~7% return vs. 5.75% interest rate from Association's loan).
* **Take the 5.75% interest loan offered by the Association's lender and make monthly payments:** This, to me, seems like the best choice. I understand the economy is bad right now and I can't assume a ~7% return from S&amp;P500 every year, but even if the economy will get better in a few years, I assume that would average out to the ~7% return after the life of the 15-year loan?
* **Some other option I'm not thinking of:** It was suggested in another subreddit that I should look into a personal loan and seek a better rate than 5.75%. A quick Google search shows rates &gt;5.75% and for shorter term (2-5 years). Unless I'm missing something here, I assume this is the worst option.

Hoping the kind souls of r/personalfinance will be able to point us in the right direction. Thanks in advance!",finance,1664837469

I'm now considering doing just $100k (25%) down to avoid PMI and get a slightly more favorable interest rate and putting the remaining $75k into a 4.25% CD that pays monthly interest into my brokerage cash account. The increase in my mortgage payment will be +$363 and the interest income from the CDs will be $266. Basically, I'm paying an extra $97/month to keep $75k in reserve. It doesn't seem worthwhile to put down an extra $75k to reduce the mortgage by $97. The taxation side of it (mortgage interest deduction &amp; tax on interest income) basically cancels out.

Isn't it interesting that in 2017, Nazis in Ukraine were a concern for commentators (see Reuters article below) who criticized Trump for not doing more about them.

&gt;The latest example: local authorities in the capital recently voted to rename a major street after a former Nazi collaborator and anti-Semite named Roman Shukhevych.

&gt;Shukhevych led the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), an organization responsible for the mass slaughter of Poles and Jews during the war. Even inside Ukraine the renaming is a disputed move, with hundreds of people taking to the streets last Friday to protest the decision – only to be attacked by an ultra-nationalist neo-Nazi group called C14.

stocks,Smoke and Mirrors. Beware of buying into the hype of flashy tech demos.,"With all the talk of the latest Tesla robot demo I just want to give people a view behind the curtain.

Early tech demos of products that aren't market ready are very often smoke and mirrors.  100% of the time if they are performed in front of stakeholders they are highly scripted and many times that scripting is designed to follow a ""happy path"" that often hides considerable shortcomings in the product as it exists.  The most famous example of this is the first generation iPhone demo by Steve Jobs.  Here's some description of what was going on behind the scenes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The iPhone could play a section of a song or a video, but it couldn’t play an entire clip reliably without crashing. It worked fine if you sent an e-mail and then surfed the Web. If you did those things in reverse, however, it might not. Hours of trial and error had helped the iPhone team develop what engineers called “the golden path,” a specific set of tasks, performed in a specific way and order, that made the phone look as if it worked. 

 

&gt;They had AT&amp;T, the iPhone’s wireless carrier, bring in a portable cell tower, so they knew reception would be strong. Then, with Jobs’s approval, they preprogrammed the phone’s display to always show five bars of signal strength regardless of its true strength.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;None of these kludges fixed the iPhone’s biggest problem: it often ran out of memory and had to be restarted if made to do more than a handful of tasks at a time. Jobs had a number of demo units onstage with him to manage this problem. If memory ran low on one, he would switch to another while the first was restarted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say everything worked out for Apple in the end and the iPhone was a massive success, but it doesn't always go that way.

A personal anecdote, I worked on a multimillion dollar project for a fortune 100 company.  By the time I came on the project as a contractor to right the ship it was already a garbage pile on top of a toxic waste dump.  The C-level was losing patience and it was clear the project was doomed to fail but about a month in we were asked to walk them through a demo no matter what and told jobs were on the line.  Our contractors had a lot of startup experience going into this unlike the rest of the team we were supplementing so we knew what to do.  We basically hard coded functionality in the software all over the place and inserted custom values in the database that would not have been possible for users to add through the actual program anytime in the near future and made it look like the project was making considerable progress. I reality it was easily still a year or two away from being able to actually do the things we made it do and several more from being what they actually wanted.  I created a complete script, click here, click here, open this, step by step, and if you fuck up the program is going to crash.  The team's lead manager learned the script like the back of his hand and walked through the demo in the C-suite and the project got funded for another six months.  The in-house engineering team called us ""the Wizards of Oz.""  Six months later it predictably melted down and everyone packed it up to move to the next thing. A couple executives lost their cushy 7 figure jobs as a result.  This is EXTREMELY common.  

That was the most glaring example but I have done this same thing or seen it done dozens of times and several of those were walked out in front of investors.  Many of those products never even came close to the capabilities we scripted into the demo.  I would be shocked if a single early demo from any tech company doesn't have piles of hard coded garbage in some intermediate build just to get through the demo, then it's up to the engineers to just figure it out later.

It's very easy to spoof your way through showing off a new phone's planned features or make a robot slow walk a circle on a stage.  It's about 100x harder to make a phone that someone can actually use like a phone or make a robot that can do actual work and doesn't fall over and die when it steps on a Lego.  I just want to make people aware that this is how the tech world operates since reading some of the comments I've seen after big flashy tech demos I realize this is not common knowledge.

Sometimes the engineers will push through and you will end up with an iPhone but a lot of times by the time the demo comes around everyone in the back knows the project is already doomed and they are just trying to extract value from something they've already sunk millions into or they secretly know that it will easily take years to get the product to the usable state portrayed in the demo and are trying to excite investors.  Some of these projects you will never see or hear mentioned ever again and it's even more common in hardware products than software.  

This is just a friendly warning to take all tech demos with a giant grain of salt.",finance,1664861336

stocks,This sub perfectly encapsulates why you can’t beat the market.,"There’s a hell of a lot of fear running around (whether you’d like to admit it or not), and all I see on here are people abandoning those ideas that kept getting trotted out during the bull market (be greedy/blood on the streets/buy low etc). This sub is far more smug than wsb so it’s far more infuriating to see here. Let’s address the FUD:

1.) ‘Don’t fight the fed’ - bullshit. Since the 1950s we have had 13 rate hike cycles - 9 of these correlated with up markets, 4 correlated with down markets. My point is not to say that this time there won’t be a correlation. My point is that NOBODY KNOWS. Link for reference:

https://images.app.goo.gl/oVzhVPgG4Y4q2cnW6

2.) I see a lot of people going ‘fear/blood isn’t here yet etc.’ - these people will never buy because they are scared. These are people who will say, ‘I’ll buy when SPY hits 300’ but if it actually does they’ll 100% go ‘I’ll buy when SPY hits 250.’ These people are scared and have always been like this. Every bear market you hear the same thing. And if you’re still not convinced? Look at the ‘fear and greed index’ - it combines multiple factors including put/call ratios and vix. Currently we are at ‘extreme fear’ with levels comparable to March 2020 and 08/09. We also see ‘extreme fear’ in essential non-events but hey that’s human nature. Link for reference:

https://edition.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed

3.) ‘If you invested in xxxx then it would’ve taken you x years to break even’ - this assumes that you lump summed SPY just before a crash and then never invested again. This applies to almost nobody. But even if you did - if you held, you would’ve been fine. Link for reference: 

https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/

4.) All I’ve seen this last month are people essentially espousing market timing in an effort to find the bottom, or jump back in only when a bottom has been established. But what’s wrong with this? On the surface the latter sounds sensible. Again, history says otherwise. Bank of America did a study showing what your returns would look like from 1930 if you missed the best and worst days in the market. If you stayed invested since 1930, didn’t take out a penny, your returns would be 17,715%. If you missed the best 90 days (out of 21,252, so 0.43% of market days), your returns drop to 28%. That’s not per year, that’s 28% over 90 years.
Of course, if you missed the 90 worst days you’d do the best, but here’s the kicker - 80% of the market’s best days come within 2 weeks of its worst days. I guarantee you - you can’t time that. Link for reference:

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html

So what conclusions do we have? Buffet/Munger/Lynch all say the same thing. History says the same thing. Statistics say the same thing. 

Ignore the macro. Stick to DCA for indices or valuation for individual stocks. This is financial advice.

stocks,U.S. manufacturing nearly brakes; price pressures abating,"*This is the second data point that we've seen in a 24 hour period that could indicate that inflation is cooling; the other data point was reflected in the* [*shipping containers/cargo article released yesterday*](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xusbuy/cargo_shipowners_cancel_sailings_as_global_trade/)*, which showed a material slowdown in loads.*    


Summary:  


* Manufacturing PMI falls 1.9 points to 50.9 in September
* New orders, employment measures contract
* Price pressures at factories, supply bottlenecks easing
* Construction spending falls 0.7% in August 

\--  
(Via Reuters)

U.S. manufacturing activity grew at its slowest pace in nearly 2-1/2 years in September as new orders contracted amid aggressive interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve to cool demand and tame inflation.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Monday also showed a measure of manufacturing employment contracted last month for the fourth time this year. **A gauge of inflation at the factory gate decelerated for a sixth straight month.**

ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee chair Timothy Fiore said ""companies are now managing head counts through hiring freezes and attrition to lower levels, with medium- and long-term demand more uncertain.""

Fiore, however, noted that there were no comments from firms about large-scale layoffs, which he said indicated that ""companies are confident of near-term demand."" The Fed's tighter monetary policy campaign has raised fears of a recession next year, triggering a sharp sell-off on the stock market.

""In many ways, this is the cooling economy the Fed would like to see,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""It could, however, merely reflect a consumer shift away from goods towards services.""

The ISM's manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.9 this month, the lowest reading since May 2020, from 52.8 in August. ISM said the fall in the index ""reflects companies adjusting to potential future lower demand."" A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index slipping to 52.2. Nine manufacturing industries, including machinery, transportation equipment and computer and electronic products reported growth. Furniture and related products as well as textile mill and wood products were among the seven industries reporting a contraction.

Some of the slowdown in manufacturing reflects the rotation of spending from goods to services. Government data last Friday showed spending on long-lasting manufactured goods barely rising in August, while outlays on services picked up.

The U.S. central bank has since March hiked its policy rate from near zero to the current range of 3.00% to 3.25%, and last month signaled more large increases were on the way this year.

The higher borrowing costs are undercutting spending on big-ticket items like household appliances and furniture, that are typically bought on credit.

Construction has also not been spared. **A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending fell by the most in 1-1/2 years in August as single-family homebuilding tumbled 2.9%.**

""It all comes back to higher borrowing costs and weaker demand,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""The mild recession call still holds.""

We’re currently in process of building a home and with how interest rates are I’m looking for ways to cut costs in case our payment ends up higher than expected. 

Now my question is, I am a little confused how imputed income works - can anyone tell me if the “value” of the benefits gets taxed as income each month or is that just a end of year tax liability if that makes sense? If Im taxed on it as part of my income each paycheck, I’m considering removing him for the year to see how my take home changes.",finance,1664895478
CryptoCurrency,The Real Reason GBP and Other Currencies Are Crashing Against The Dollar,"We need to establish some ground rules first. All currencies are only measured against *other* currencies. Typically, when you see a currency exchange rate quoted, it is quoted as a measured against the USD. For example take the following.

&amp;#x200B;

[Currency Year-to-Date Change](https://preview.redd.it/wsj9o2t20tr91.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94b55351141a2ee113fa0fa86882f5d9f046497b)

The above table shows the changes in each of these currencies against the USD in 2022. The ""/USD"" implies a change against the USD. If media mentions change in a currency, it usually is implied to be against the USD.

Now, we have see across the board virtually all currencies falling against the dollar. Every piece of news media mentions the Indian Rupee, the Chinese Yuan, the Japanese Yen etc falling against the dollar but no one ever explains **why.**

Well the USD is the world reserve currency. Everyone likes to make the statement but no one explains what it really means. [Per the IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2019/10/01/global-financial-stability-report-october-2019), 40% of the world's debt is issued in USD. [Per the BIS,](https://www.bis.org/statistics/rpfx19.htm) 88% of forex trades were between the U.S. dollar and another currency. [Per the IMF again](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2021/05/05/blog-us-dollar-share-of-global-foreign-exchange-reserves-drops-to-25-year-low), 60% of known Central Bank reserves are in the USD.

Now, the economy of virtually every country is tied to that of every other country. That is to say we have a global synchronized economy. Gone are the days were a country provided for all its needs within its own borders. Countries are dependent on other countries, and these other countries are dependent on yet other countries. This means that if one country falls, they are all affected, of course to varying degrees depending on the level of inter-dependence. To illustrate this level of dependence, [the World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.IMP.GNFS.ZS) currently has the % of imports per GDP globally at 28.1%.

So we have established two things. Countries globally are heavily dependent on the USD and also on each other to varying degrees. Now with all this USD dependence for trade, what would happen if the US Central Bank, the Federal Reserve suddenly started *raising rates.* Well, higher rates means less people are willing to borrow USD and less borrowers of USD means less USD in the **global** economy.Take a look at the graph below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p53xaws50tr91.png?width=1273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3802011276db2a02a312fa56b15f69dc24325954

This graph shows real GDP, the total value of goods and services produces in a country *adjusted for inflation.* Basically, when we remove the effects of inflation, the trade in US economy has been faltering since *the fourth quarter of 2021.* This is **coincidentally** when the Federal Reserve started raising rates. Because the global economy is dependent of USD, as we established before, this chart of effective US trade is a good estimate for global trade.

So now the main question: why are we seeing currencies fall against the USD. You probably have an idea by now. It is because we are experiencing a **US dollar shortage**. Let me erase any doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bsmzarq60tr91.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daf25e4ab345cc1326110eb6e98438a04f5d0ec0

The thing is it is now all about interest rates. Above we see two graphs. There is one of **US Treasury Supply** and the other of **Demand.** Treasuries are essentially loans firms or individuals provide to the US government. You can think of US treasuries as futures dollars as you may lend the US government 1 million today and you will be paid back say 1.05 million in one year.

The charts show the **demand** for these *future dollars* or treasuries has shot **up** this year, while the issuance or **supply** of treasuries has gone **down.** Which can only mean that the **price or value** of dollars must go waayyy up. So other countries must now *pay much more* to get USD to be able to trade, and must run government deficits, that is borrow money, to do so which increases inflation and *further* decreases the currency's value relative to the USD.

The tl;dr is the world is experiencing a double whammy of a **global USD dollar shortage** that is hampering global trade and crushing the value of other currencies relative to the USD, as well as a **shortage of US treasuries** which feeds the same problem. Countries are printing more currency to pay for more expensive dollars which is further decreasing their currency's value. Such is the real power the US Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department holds.",cryptocurrency,1664895809
personalfinance,Advice for paying off credit card debt,"Looking for advice on how to best pay down about 20k in credit card debt. This is my first time having credit card debt and it feels almost impossible to climb out of it. 

Prior to 2020, I always paid my cards off entirely or almost entirely (if it was a large purchase). When the pandemic hit, I found myself using my credit cards way more often and on a daily basis, as everything was online or contactless. Not sure if it was the uncertainty of the times but I also stopped paying off my cards monthly. My credit score has obviously taken a hit too. 

I pay more than the minimum every month but with the regular monthly usage plus interest charges, it seems like I’m not getting anywhere. I think it’s time for a more drastic solution rather than just paying each month. 

Do I get a zero interest card and transfer the balance of the highest interest card? Chip away at the other cards, while that one doesn’t collect interest. 

Take a small personal loan to pay them off and just pay the loan off - which will probably have a much better interest rate than my cards? 

I realize I’d just be moving my debt around but feel these options might give me a better shot at actually paying down my debt.

stocks,Inflation leaves 60% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck,"**Unrelenting inflation is taking a toll, leaving more Americans living paycheck to paycheck**

Almost everyone has felt the sting of rising prices.

As of August, 60% of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, according to a recent LendingClub report — a number that hasn’t budged much since inflation hit 40-year highs. A year ago, the number of adults who felt stretched too thin was closer to 55%.

Even high-income earners are feeling the strain, the report found. Of those earning more than six figures, 45% reported living paycheck to paycheck, a jump from the previous year’s 38%. 

“More consumers living paycheck to paycheck indicates that many are continuing to lose their financial stability,” said Anuj Nayar, LendingClub’s financial health officer.

The consumer price index, which measures the average change in prices for consumer goods and services, rose a higher-than-expected 8.3% in August, driven by increases in food, shelter and medical care costs.

Although real average hourly earnings also rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% for the month, they remained down 2.8% from a year ago, which means those paychecks don’t stretch as far as they used to.

A separate report by Bank of America found that 71% of workers feel their pay isn’t keeping up with the cost of living, bringing the number of people who feel financially secure to a five-year low.

Many Americans are dipping into their cash reserves, and nearly half are falling deeper in debt.

Those struggling to afford their day-to-day lifestyle tend to rely more on credit cards and carry a higher monthly balance, making them financially vulnerable, according to Nayar.

“It is no secret that prices have been increasing for everyday Americans — not only in the goods and services they purchase but also in the interest rates they’re paying to fund their lives,” he said. “This can have detrimental consequences for someone who pays the minimum amount on their credit cards every month.”

For its part, the Federal Reserve hiked its target federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points for the third time in a row to calm runaway inflation.

The central bank has indicated even more increases are coming until inflation shows clear signs of a pullback.

personalfinance,Withdrawing from Roth IRA due to negative return as of 2022 pre-recession.,"Hello,

I am in my 20s and contributed to my Vanguard's Roth IRA account for 3 years, and I am highly considering withdrawing it early and contributing it to I bond. 

As of early October 2022, I had about -20% return. My dad and this [article](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/roth-ira-early-withdrawals) said that if I am only withdrawing my contributions (because I lost 20% of it), I can withdraw my Roth IRA amount without paying a penalty. 

My question is can I safely withdraw my current amount without paying 10% of the amount for the ""federal withholding""? The Vanguard account says with a red and yellow sign that I may be subjected to 10% federal tax. I just wanted to be sure that I would not pay it.",finance,1664921827

I'm hoping for some help. My father is an elderly man with Parkinson's disease in the state of South Dakota whom I have been trying to push to reach out for some kind of assistance. I understand at working age, he'd automatically qualify for SSDI, but as he is above 65 and his unearned income is $19k a year which is above the threshold for SSI it looks like there's no help he can get... which also appears to disqualify him from medicaid in South Dakota which is a non-expanded Medicaid state... But, even if it was expanded it appears he cannot get any help.   


I have done research for day sand cannot find any clear information for requirements/resources for specifically DISABLED seniors above 65 either for federal SSI, or South Dakota Medicaid. There is clear resources for Disabled individuals but ONLY those that are working age which is frustrating... Does the SSA not differentiate between seniors above 65 and Disabled seniors above 65?   


I greatly appreciate any insights or help into this. My dad is in poverty, has no dental benefits and hasn't been able to eat solid food in a year... Any direction to any kind of help he can get would be a godsend. Thank you.",finance,1664928104

personalfinance,Question about Car loans and paying down principal early,"I have owned a few cars in my life, but I never have actually done what I am looking at doing now, I am going to call my credit union in the morning, but I figured I could get some feedback in the meantime.

My question is in reference to how the interest payments are compounded on the new loan.  If I make the purchase with the downpayment only, and then come through later and drop a large principal payment shortly after the loan is opened does that impact the month to month interest payments or is the interest payment set in stone throughout the term of the loan?

Edit for clarity: The large payment to the principal is not a total payoff, it would be the positive equity from a different car sale just being applied to the loan balance late instead of at the same time of the loan term start.

For reference the lender here is Navy Federal Credit Union.",finance,1664930610
personalfinance,Max 401k or focus on emergency fund? E-fund was recently wiped out. Also wife is now taking on student loans and not sure how to approach,"Hello, I recently discovered the Prime Directive and found it a good guide to follow since I still have a lot to learn about finance. I recently started with a company with a probably good enough 401k plan and began getting as close to maxing it out as I could  based on father's advice and general impressions from the internet and here. 

My wife has started school as well and is now going to be taking on student loan debt (we might be able to pay her schooling but to start out we decided to take out a loan) at a nearly 6% interest rate after she graduates. Should we try to get her through without taking on more debt? Or take on the debt and pay off very aggressively? (ie pay off as if we were paying for school without loans) Somewhere in the middle?

After I found the Prime Directive, I'm considering if I should adjust my contributions to get my employer match (%5 to get full match) and try to build my emergency fund after being wiped to 0 (it was small to begin with only ~$1200) and then open an IRA. Should I do this? After running the numbers and setting up projections and a more proper budget to build the e-fund it's painful to see how long it could take. Especially considering the markets right now and how I think I agree that its an opportune time to invest at a discount.

My finances in a nutshell:

* Salary before tax and contribs and health: $\~90k
* Current take home close to maxing 401k: $4400
* Take-home after adjusting to 5% contribution: $5600
* Living expenses (monthly): $2,800 (\~$1600 rent M-HCOL city)
* 401k worth: \~$15k
* E-fund: $0
* CC: paying off in full each month
* Debt: 
   * $480 line of credit no interest if paid in full by Feb 
      * Current monthly to avoid interest: $96
   * $1120 like of credit no interest if paid full by Apr
      * Current monthly to avoid interest: $160
* Wife's first semester student loan: \~$4000

personalfinance,Would it be stupid to use profit from the sale of our house as a down payment on a new house otherwise out of our price range?,"I may be relocating for work in the near future. I will make around $120,000 profit off the sale of our current house and will have minimal moving expense (work covers most everything). 

Household income is around $160,000 per year. Our budget on a new house right now is right around $400,000. This said, a lot of the houses on the market right now would be a downgrade in comparison to what we’d be leaving behind unless we jump up to the $500,000 price range. 

Would it be foolish to put $100,000 down on a $500,000 house to bring it into a more comfortable price range? 

We would be in this house for quite a while and I wouldn’t expect it to depreciate and worst case I figure I’d break even at the end and get that money back out of it should we sell. 

The biggest rub here is we’d be giving up our 3.75% interest rate for something presumably closer to 7% but I guess we can always refinance in the future.",finance,1664936240

I’m in my first “career” job out of college. I have a BS in environmental science and graduated this past May. I’m currently working in local government in compliance. So far, I love my job and the people I’m around. The benefits are awesome and almost perfect, except for taking 8 years to be vested (225% match), but I only make 45k and I’m already 29. After taxes, 7% mandatory retirement payments (with a 7% interest rate), and ~$400/ month healthcare payments for my husband to be on my plan, I’m taking home about $1100 every two weeks. 


I’ve heard of a lot of peers having second jobs, but it’s not something I’m excited about considering. Our main goals coming up are buying a house and having kids, neither of which we have been able to save for recently. The pandemic is still severely affecting my husbands industry (automotive). I’m just not sure if staying here is beneficial financially, or if I should be looking for something else, or wait a few years for the experience and then look for higher pay then? Or, stay and try for promotions, but that idea makes me feel like we’ll never be able to afford our goals. 

Am I wrong in that idea? Do the benefits out way the worth of take home cash pay? I know the match at the 8th year is unheard of..

I’ve considered staying for the benefits through having kids but am I risking never being able to afford them at all? Should I be more patient for my husbands industry to recover?

I’m full of questions and really fear making the wrong financial decisions when I’m starting out at basically 30. We want to be comfortable and not have to worry but it feels very far away. Thanks for your time and advice.",finance,1664939858

Forex,EUR/USD to break back above parity this week?,"The weak ISM manufacturing print on Monday seems to have increased bets on a possible Fed pivot, and the easing of US Dollar strength because of this has helped fuel a strong rebound in EUR/USD after it hit another record low last week. 

However, the pair’s rebound is currently stalling around parity, and this week's upcoming US economic data, including the all-important NFP report on Friday, will likely drive direction from this major psychological level. 

After the RBA elected to slow the pace of their tightening cycle yesterday, further indications that higher interest rates are starting to take a toll on the American economy may add to the speculation that the Fed will do the same. This could help EUR/USD break back above parity, and target a retest of its bearish channel’s upper trendline. 

However, all trading carries risk, and after the significant pullback in yields and USD that has already taken place, better-than-expected data over the next few days could easily spark a sharp reversal, and see EUR/USD face rejection at this key resistance. 

Either way, with US non-manufacturing PMI and ADP data due in a few hours, it will be extremely interesting to watch how this develops.",finance,1664961544

Thank you all so very much for your help.  A few things I've done/we're working on:

* I called two of the credit card companies and asked about hardship programs. I don't have the cards (I don't remember where they are because my brain just isn't today) but I was able to get some good info so he can call or I can call once I remember where the cards are
* I left a message with the local credit union to see about counseling and/or a personal loan
* I called one of the hospitals to explain what happened and ask about financial aid (I thought it was too late).  Learned they didn't have or run things through insurance. Provided insurance. Husband helped me with application last night and I emailed everything this mornig. Between the two, we should be getting some money back.
* Husband met with friend who he has done work for who owes him money and outlined payment plan thing (not the right description, but brain can't)
* Will be ""meeting"" (over the phone) with a loan person a good friend recommended to figure out some stuff there
* Still working on the budget (husband worked extra yesterday then had to make a pharmacy run, which is never quick and then helped me with the hospital aid application).  Already stopped using cards and...something I've forgotten, but this is still an urgent priority and in progress, just thought the thing that gets money back to us should get done asap. 
* I feel like there is more but I can't remember. Still need to organize replies/suggestions and make a list then of course work on doing the things.

I am going to take some meds that make it harder to think (the don't operate fork lifts sort) but doing so much stuff has made stuff flare up and I can't put off dealing with it any longer or I risk bad stuff.  Again, I can't say how much I appreciate all of the help and time people have given. 

Last bit, I really wish I could change the title because while he put used the credit cards, the expenses are both of ours. I not only didn't mean or want to throw him under the bus, I don't want others who have been in this situation to feel hurt by it either and better phrasing would have helped people help better (and not waste their time on things that don't apply because I was not clear).

My cognitive issues make things tough and I'm really overwhelmed and anxious, but it really helps to have some guidance and a starting point.  I appreciate everybody's time a lot.

I'm not sure if it would be better to update this or make a new post after I have specific numbers, but I'll do something.

**Original Post Bit**

Hi all and thanks in advance for any advice.

I recently found out that my husband has 50k in credit card debt. Cards are all in his name. I don't know the specific interest rates unfortunately (will be getting access to things for transparency soon).

No car or other loans.  The mortgage is in my name only and owe 40k on a house valued at about 135k.

What are our options?  Sorry if I've left important info out.  I'm not doing the best mentally so my focus is not focusing well.

**Edit to add** I'm disabled and debt is due to car repairs, medical bills, etc.  Had I known, I'd have kept the bills with the hospitals and set up payment plans, but I can't do a do-over.

**Edit 2:** Husband brings in about 60k a year before taxes and takes on extra work (freelance, stipend work at main job) for a couple of extra thousand a year.  I am disabled and bring in...like 15k.  The mortgage with taxes and insurance is about 500 a month. I'm not sure what the other bills are.

I'm so sorry I'm not super helpful.  My brain just doesn't cooperate and trying to even just figure things out is making my brain even less helpful.

**Edit 3:** I have to head to a medical appointment but I will check in again in about an hour to 90 minutes (from 10:30 am EST).",finance,1664971167

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell on Wednesday, putting Wall Street on track to give back some of its sharp gains from the last two sessions.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures declined by 275 points, or 1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 1% and 0.9%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Tuesday jumped about 825 points, or 2.8%. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 3.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 3.3%. Those gains, which come on the back of falling bond yields, led to the strongest two-day stretch for the S&amp;P 500 since 2020.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, a weakening in the most recent job openings data had some investors considering whether the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Market participants wondered whether those signs could mean markets have finally priced in a bottom after the sharp declines in the prior quarter.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think you have to worry about a recession until the second half of ’23,” Stifel chief equity strategist Barry Bannister said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “So there is room for a rally as you go into the early part of next year.”

&gt; Traders are expecting a raft of economic reports on Wednesday.

personalfinance,At a crossroads at how to prepare best for next house/mortgage,"I’m trying to figure out what next step makes the most sense in my situation. We purchased our house @170k back in 2017 @4.25% on. 30 year(only put 3% down). Since then I was able to pay our mortgage down by applying a 70k settlement to our principal. We were then lucky enough to refinance last year on the remaining 81k to 2.25%. Since then we have been additionally paying $300 to principal to pay down (yes I know this money was best to put somewhere else at such low rates). 

Our mortgage payoff currently sits at $67k, and we have recently received just enough inheritance recently from a family member that we could pay the mortgage off as well as our vehicles (~10k ranging from 3.5-4.5%). We have 6+ months savings separate from this inheritance (25k) as well as a secondary emergency (kids savings 10k).

My SO and I contribute the 6% 401k that our employers match, and I have a roth 401k that I was contributing to up until inflation and temporary lapse in employment caused me to reduce it from 11% to 1%.

SO wants us to move into a bigger house with a goal of 2-3 years in mind. My biggest concern is that at that point rates will definitely be higher than what we have now, so I want the ability to save up enough to where we are able to buy a new house while not getting set back significantly on a 150k+ mortgage on 30 years again at a much greater interest rate. Preferably sub 100k on a 15 year. 

Obvious responses will most likely be ‘invest now in SP, market is low, pull out when ready to purchase new home in 2-3 years’. As much as that’s generally true, I do not trust the market. I could throw the money in high yield savings just so I can pull from it if anything detrimental happens. I also plan to begin throwing the $300/mo into savings rather than at the mortgage. If I were to pay off the mortgage we would in turn throw those access funds into savings as well and hope to have enough savings built up to not be too worried about a new mortgage at a much higher rate.

Would like some opinions to help justify the more optimal path to go here. My 2 brain cells are saying to invest it, but also telling me that the market is unpredictable and will 2-3 years investing really make much of a difference for all the stress and footwork involved?",finance,1664981414

We have decent credit and are expecting a 6.2% interest rate with $0 down. 

This house is expected to last 5 years until about 2027 when we’ll be moving out of state. We’re planning on overpaying on the mortgage to increase equity in that time. 

My questions pertaining to this are just generally, is it a decent time to buy? Could there be a return at the end of the 5 years or would it be better to maintain ownership and rent to a family? And can we feasibly afford a house in this range?

deeplearning,Best way to remove sequence dimension from attention output,"I'm currently working on a model that combines a static encoder with a lstm followed by an attention layer. 

I face the problem, that the attention makes the performance of the model slightly worse instead of improving. I think it's because I just use the last element in the sequence weighted by attention instead of combining all hidden states of the sequence. Is there another common way to remove the sequence dimension from attention output except averaging/summing or picking a single element?

It could be also possible that attention just doesn't work in this case, but I looked at several papers that showed improvement through attention.

Some side notes in order to understand my problem better:

\- The model without attention only uses the last hidden state of a lstm, which encodes the whole sequence.

\- All lstm hidden states are fed into attention, resulting in the same dimension output after the attention.

\- Attention is followed by a standard dense network with a non-lin between layers, which results in the embedding. This embedding gets propagated to the decoder part.

\- I also tried to add residual layers all over the network, but the main problem seems to be the attention

\- The overall architecture is self-supervised and uses combinations of reconstruction losses.

CryptoCurrency,I Read Through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Report IR 8408: Understanding Stablecoin Technology and Related Security Considerations Report for You,"Today, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, also known as NIST, released the report IR 8408: Understanding Stablecoin Technology and Related Security Consideration draft for the public comment period that ends January 6th, 2023. Totally 60 pages long this report actually does a pretty decent job at explaining stablecoins and the vast differences that are in the space. The report continuously mentions the term stablecoin has been used to apply to a wide variety of cryptos and that some of them are not trying to live up to a 1-to-1 level with the dollar and highlights rebasing stablecoins as an example of this.

&amp;#x200B;

The top 20 stablecoins by market capitalization were investigated for this report over the course of a year ending August 15, 2022, and showed that of these 20 the majority retained their peg. Within the top 20, the top 5 represented 87% of the total top 20 market capitalization. The top 5 to maintain their peg where

1. Tether (USDT)
2. USD Coin (USDC)
3. Binance USD (BUSD)
4. Dai (DAI)
5. Fraz (FRAX)

As we know not all of the stablecoins from May of 2022 made it to the present day. NIST identifies TerraUSD the number 3 stablecoin at the time as one that is not expected to recover from its de-pegging. This is where it begins to break down the different types including fiat-backed, crypto-backed, non-currency asset-backed, algorithmic, hybrid, and private institutional. Of the 20 top stablecoins only two were purely algorithmic coins and both of them TerraUSD and Neutrino have lost their peg while Neutrino has lost and regained it three times this year. NIST highlights this and does state that it does show that there could be an issue with this type of stablecoin for long-term investments but does not make any sort of statement on if it was bad or good altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

The detail that this report goes into is expanse and does highlight different things that couple cause issues long-term for stablecoins like dynamic interest rates since some issues use loans to issue the stablecoin, governance token devaluation, transaction price costs, and native currency devaluations. All of these could cause issues and while I did not see anything about it stablecoins on Solana could really be faced with significant hurdles due to network outages.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall the report was super balanced highlighting both pros and cons of each type and listed examples even if there were not any located within the top 20 at the time. Hopefully, Members or their staff take time to read through this before rushing to judgment. In some ways, it actually does counter a lot of what the Chairwomen and Democratic party wanted in the Stablecoin Bill and that could be vital to really get the drafts changed into something that would be not only fair but allow the industry to continue to grow and develop.",cryptocurrency,1664996166

Work has been withholding too much based on the IRS withholding calculator for my circumstances. My work uses Paychex Flex. The issue has been that when I submit a new W4 to try to fix this, it takes so long to process that it is not in effect by the next paycheck. The effect is that by the time the next paycheck rolls around, that new W4 is no longer correct either.

At this time, I am getting very close to the estimated tax burden and obviously do not wish to give the government an interest free loan. If I can't get this fixed, can I manipulate the W4 to withhold no more federal income tax at all? Can I enter an absurdly large amount on line 3 to accomplish this?

On the Paychex website, on the ""taxes"" column of the ""my pay"" tab, there is an option to edit the information that is in the W4. I dealt with Paychex customer support, and was told that I can actually modify the W4 online and it will take effect immediately, bypassing the time it takes to process when sent in by paper.

personalfinance,How do I choose the best bank for me?,"Hi all,

So I recently started finally earning enough money to hopefully be able to put some aside from month to month. I already actually have a bank checking account, but I basically opened it as a kid just going with what my parents told me, and the bank doesn't even operate in the city I've since moved to. So I'm thinking it's time to move my money somewhere else and actually start making my own informed financial decisions. But I basically have no idea how to choose the best bank for me. PNC is the big player in my area, and seems to be what most people go with. Should I just go with them? I've also heard that strictly online banks can have better interest rates so I would be interested in hearing if anyone has any suggestions for those. But since I don't know what I'm doing idk if maybe it would be better to go with a bank where I can actually sit down and talk to someone in person. I'm just looking to open a checking and savings account at the moment I guess, unless anyone else has any suggestions. Please let me know! Thanks!",finance,1664999479

Combined Cash on hand (Savings + Checking): $90,000 in savings, I have about $7,000 in my own personal fun savings and she has about $5,000

401ks, IRA's. I have about $200,000 in my $401k. She does not have a 401k as she has worked with her dad for her whole life and they have never offered one. She has a ""quasi"" 401k where she owned a townhoome in '08 for $70,000 and now worth about $250,000. Yes I know she needs one and am working to get her an IRA.

No car payments. We own both are vehicles. No debt.

Current mortgage: $1300 a month

Credit: Perfect 800+ for both of us, last checked a few months ago.

""debt"" No debts outside $1200 daycare. Everything else is splurge (netflix, spotify, etc..) and utilities.

Area: Phoenix, AZ

Got quoted up to $1.3m at 6.3% interest rate. Obviously not thinking that high but thinking more of $700 - $850k

Gameplan: Don't touch the townhouse, sell our current house (balance is $180k, low end I think we could sell for $500) and use that (say $300k) and then another $25 to $45k from savings to use towards house.

Given the figures, do you think we could afford that? All the numbers say we can but given that our mortgage is at $1300 then seeing it at roughly $3500- $4000 scares me to death. She wants to get the hell out of this house as she feels cramped with our 1 year old LO (it's a 3 bed, 2 bath with an office). I want to say lets wait 3-6 months as I think that will be more advantageous for us with the housing prices (yes I know we can re-finance later).",finance,1665002327

investing,What’s your pick for a CAD-hedged inverse ETF?,"Obviously not everyone is going to agree with this analysis, but on the assumption that the world is heading towards a severe financial crisis (the likes of 2008, or a new Great Depression), inverse investing provides a spectacular opportunity. It’s essentially gambling; but there could be big gains on something like this if everything really does break from high debt and rising interest rates.

Take SQQQ for example (USD-hedged). It’s been on a steady decline since 2010, which makes logical sense because monetary policy has been loosing throughout that period and the stock market did very well. It was once at $500,000 a share and is around $50 today. Let’s say you were to invest $1500 (the 1 day instant access limit on WealthSimple) and you bought it today. Putting aside conversion, you’d get about 30 shares. Now imagine the world really does break and this were to go to just $700 a share (what it achieved in the 2020 lockdown). You would have made nearly $20,000 on this trade. 

It could go sideways, but it seems like a generational opportunity being between two paradigms. Are there any really good CAD hedged (preferably non-leveraged) inverse ETFs you’re looking throw a bit of money into right now?

personalfinance,I got a high-paying job late in the year - how should I prioritize my leftover money before year-end?,"Hi Reddit,

After finishing grad school, I was lucky enough to get a high paying job (earning about 4x compared to my next highest-paying job...though working twice as much as well lol). I'm hoping to invest rather aggressively but I never gave much thought to what I should do this year, for my three months of employment. Adding to the complications, I also got married a few months ago - and my husband is unemployed (he just got his green card so is now looking for work). So, this is also the year that I learn about ""married filing jointly"" benefits.

If I'm correct, my pay this year will amount to $57,000 and I will have about $23,000 to ""play"" with, after both taxes and fixed expenses.

What I'm hoping for is some advice with how to prioritize my investments. I never had disposable income like this, and when I was plannign post-hire it was in yearlong terms. Here are my options.

1. 401(k) (company doesn't match) - $19.5 k limit for myself, $39k if I want to throw into my husband's
2. HSA - $7,300 for my husband and I, triple tax advantage. We're not likely to stay on my current health plan after my husband finds work, so should I prioritize this now?
3. Roth IRA - I won't be able to contribute to this after this year so I honestly never put too much thought into this.
4. 529 - $2,000 can be deducted and I can use this to pay towards my student loans which have an overall interest rate of 7% (I've already contributed $8k towards the 10k allowed for student loan repayment)

I should note that I don't expect to continue making this salary (200k+) for very long - I'm a type B personality and it's a high stress job. So I guess priority-wise it makes me lean a little towards HSA (I have high-ish healthcare costs) and 529. But I'm interested in your thoughts!",finance,1665011189

I'm 26 and just coming out of a few very rough years with COVID and mental health (as I think many of us are). I was employed part-time from fall 2021 to spring 2022 and while I had some in savings I was essentially only making enough money to pay my rent and everything else went on the credit cards. Long store short I maxed out my credit cards and am now sitting pretty with $15K of credit card debt and a credit score in the mid-600s... Money has always been the primary source of anxiety in my life and I would love to get out of this situation as fast as possible.

CryptoCurrency,Signs of a eventual bull run (it might be closer than you think),"We know the market enjoys pricing in before major events (as it tends to happens before a FED meeting).

FED's president said if they raise interest rates to **1%** it can reduce developed countries GDP by 0,5% and under developed countries by 0.8%. USA had a increase on interest rates from 0% to 3,25% in 8 months.

**Why this is important?**

Because it can give us signs that we are approaching a real market bottom and we might see a recovery in 2023.

John Williams (president and chief executive officers at FED) said he wants to keep inflation rate at **2%** in upcomming years, down from the expected 3% 2023.

To make it a reality, they need to keep increasing interest rates until those numbers are met. and knowing this, the market tend to price it in.

John also said that unemployment rate will increase from current **3,7%** to **4,5%** by the end of 2023.

**FIRST** sign that is a strong indicator of market bottom is **wage inflation**, what does it mean?

After the pandemy we had a lot of job offers and lets say you worked at company A  for 1k wage but company B is paying 2k, you would swap ofc. This is a good thing right? Yes and no. Let's understand it.

If wage inflation is, let's say, 10% and general inflation is 7%, it will reduce the company's profit margim because if they have to pay more in order to remain competitive, they will also have to increase products price (but they also have a limit because if they incease too much, clients won't be able to pay for it) to make profit and customers will have to pay more and it's a god damn snowball that nobody benefits.

This can't happen, it needs to be balanced. That's where the **bottom of the market** is.

**SECOND** sign is **FED-Pivot** and what i means is when FED change their politcs and instead of increasing interest rates, they **lower** them, let's take a look.

[As you can see, when interest rates are too high, a fed-pivot happens and it hits a bottom \\""right after\\"".](https://preview.redd.it/na5mg517r2s91.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11343b1dc218d233bfa8ebe344ae0a9bbda9efbb)

**When will this pivot thing happens?**

When job offers reach a balance 1:1 (one job offer for one person and not 2 job offers for one person), the wage inflation and general inflation slow down.

This is important to understand because when you think we hit a bottom, we are already 10/15% above it.

So keep an eye out for the job market, signs of less job offers, less people willing to leave X job for Y , companies paying less etc.

[WIth this graphic we can see job offers are on a small decline. When it hits a dip, FED-Pivot will happen and make econmy bullish in response. You can use the website and look for specific dates \(2008\) and see a good correlation of a bear job offer market, a pivot happening and a bullish market right after.](https://preview.redd.it/8kulfedss2s91.png?width=835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21b9030a71d4c70262b662473366a8333548bf51)

Regarding **inflation**, if you look for results around the world there is a clear sign of a SMALL dip, showing inflation is going down VERY slowly, pair this with low job offers/wages (people not having much buying power) and FED lowering interes rates , they will probabily do what they done many times, hit that **print money**  buttom &gt; Booming economy.

This will cause the dollar to be weaker too.

Of course nothing is 100%, and we don't know what will happens at 13th October but have FIAT ready and if we have a bull run at the begning of 2023, don't be surprised.

Firstly I'm in my mid 20s and looking to buy a car that I need for work. While I want to buy an affordable car I may need a SUV because of the area I live in and the harsh winters especially with the upcoming change in weather. Before I was driving a 2000 beater given by my parents. I have no idea how to buy a car and am utterly clueless would it be easier to lease/ in what case is it better to lease. I'm currently thinking about buying a used car but theres so much I don't know. I also heard this is a bad time because of interest rates and supply chain issues. Additionally I don't even have a ride to the dealerships. I would have to finance, because I don't have all the cash on hand. Would putting the downpayment on a credit card be better if allowed, or possibly a loan( how would I go about getting this?). But my biggest problem is my credit is shit and my parents won't cosign. Even if they would I'd rather them not seeing as how they might hold it over my head in the future to leverage the car or something else. I'm going to need a car very soon to get to and from work since theres no public transportation.

I had near perfect credit until a year ago. I put a big purchase on my credit card that wasn't going to be charged for months I had the money on hand too. However I was let go from my job due to Covid and was forced to spend the money on essentials. The purchase hit-my account immediately putting me over 100% of my utilization. I had never gone over 30% and had always paid in full each month. The interest is whats killing me. It got away from me since I had to pay other bills, now I can't even catch up with the minimum. It was initially set at a rate of 22.29% but is now around 24% due to increased interest rates. My credit score dropped from 710 to 449 with a 103% utilization rate and I am beyond overwhelmed. 

I am receiving collection calls and bills from past due medical bills. I am supposed to be on my parents insurance but I guess all the bills are in my name since thats the name they give the office since I'm an adult. They haven't been paying the bills and since they are technically in my name I am responsible? My parents expect me to pay but I was never initially told this and did not plan for it as they told me it would be covered by insurance. I would have gotten insurance through work had I known. This was an expense I was not prepared for and now have thousands in medical bills that they are threatening to send to collections.  What should I do?

lastly the job I am working has sporadic hours I am making $30 an hour but I never have any idea how many hours I will work a week. It's all dependent on the work they have available which they don't know till the day of. As a result my schedule fluctuates rapidly from 9-4 or 10-7, or 11-6 these are just examples. This makes it very hard to keep a steady budget. I have a degree in stem and I searching for new jobs but the erratic schedule makes it hard to apply since I can be called in at a moments notice. Would it be beneficial to quit and focus on applying to jobs?

I have around $700 in a brokerage account should I liquidate it, I don't have any immediate essential bills, just the debt and medical bills.

TLDR; I have 0$ in savings $70 in checking, 103% credit utilization 710-&gt; 434  Credit Score, Medical Bills going to collections, and I need to buy a car ASAP. feeling hopeless HELP PLEASE!",finance,1665017954

personalfinance,Short Term Loan Help,"My MIL passed away unexpectedly in August 2021 with about $150k owed on mortgage, very little cash (~$5k,) and about $50k of combined medical and credit card debt. Home is currently valued at $300k and located in the same neighborhood where my wife and I live.  She also left a 2013 Honda Accord (KBB ~$16k) which is paid off.  

Not really an estate issue. My MIL was widowed and my wife was an only child. MIL had a will making my wife the executor of the estate and leaving all assets to her, so not complicated situation there. 

What gets complicated is my wife’s emotional state even after 14 months is extremely fragile. She’s taken every possible opportunity to delay the probate process/ closing the estate because she just doesn’t want to deal with the pain of thinking about her mother being gone. Understandably, I feel like I can’t really push the issue here or I’m the bad guy sending her sobbing into a spiral. 

So since August 2021, my wife and I have been paying MIL’s mortgage, car insurance, landscaping (HOA), pest control, and small power bill. Before this, we had a fairly healthy 5-6 months of expenses emergency fund, but it has slowly dwindled down.

The estate is scheduled to close sometime by the end of November but I’m worried my wife won’t be emotionally ready to sell the house for several months after that which leaves us continuing to pay the mortgage and bills during that time.  Most of the credit card and medical debt has been written off. 

I know we can sell the car which will ease some strain/pay funeral expenses and estate attorney but assuming scenario where our emergency funds run out, what would be my best option for a short term loan to float us until we can liquidate MIL’s house?  HELOC? Home equity loan? Borrow from 401k? Are their other types of personal loans I should look into?

We own our home, and have about $95k (according to mortgage lender) in accessible equity in our home. 

Also have over $50k combined in available credit cards, but I don’t want to use that as an option unless absolutely last resort due to high interest rates. 

Both wife and I have good credit. 790-810 range. 

Thanks to everyone in advance. Please let me know if there are other details that would be helpful.

personalfinance,$5k high interest CC debt a year after bankruptcy - I need some advice and perspective.,"Yes, yes, I know. I'm stupid. Before you tell me to not have credit cards again, I know. 

Recently I have been diagnosed with Bipolar I. I went to seek help because I noticed my spending habits and how out of control I felt. I don't have anything to show for the debt - I don't drive or have a bike or new clothes or vacations. Unless you have Bipolar, I can't really explain how out of control you feel. Bipolar mania plus credit card debt is so insanely common. Since diagnosis, I've been on medication, in therapy, developed a budget, stuck to it, removed temptations, let my family know I'm on a no-spend, etc. I've been doing insanely well the past few months. My life did a 180 and I'm upset I've been dealing with this for over a decade not knowing what was wrong. But know I have to do damage control.

My bankruptcy was for $20k in CC debt from 2018. I filed for bankruptcy in March of 2021. In May of 2022, Capital One sent me an email for apply for a new card. Maxed out that $5k pretty fast - I bought my brother new school clothes, a new bed (teenage growth spurt), mom got a new washer/dryer after hers went out. I have nothing new. Grew up poor and it's hard not to want to help (dealing with that in therapy now). 

Currently have $5199 @ 26% APR (yeah, I know) with Capital One. Missed a payment when I got COVID last month and I called Capital One to ask for assistance since I couldn't make that $200 payment. Their solution? Pay 158 now, 300 in November, and 500 in December to catch up. I almost hung up in frustration.

$5k is an insane amount and I'm glad I caught it before I majorly fucked up again. But I'm at a loss how I can get it under control again. I don't qualify for a balance transfer card from anywhere. No personal loans from SoFi or LendingClub or my local credit union or anything else I've seen. I've seen some people get interest rates lowered for 6th months or something, but idk. 

The obvious answer is throw all extra money at the debt. That is the goal. But I wanted some outside perspective if anyone sees better options to get that APR under control or not. Would it be totally weird to explain to Capital One that I was diagnosed with bipolar and am trying to get the debt under control?",finance,1665031785

personalfinance,How to ask for a raise without being too pushy,"Let me start off by saying if this is the wrong subreddit to post this on I apologize and I’d love if someone could direct me to one that would be more helpful.

A little background, I currently work an hourly position at a popular chain restaurant, I’ve been there nearly a year and a half now and things have changed a lot since I started. When I first expressed interest in the position, starting wage was $11/hr. I was hired at $12/hr because of my experience. 

My location in particular is not the best at holding up their end of the bargain. Upon hiring myself and others in my position were told that after each 6 month review was an opportunity to receive a 50 cent raise, 50 cents for cross training into a different workgroup, as well as after being trained for the lead position.

At around 2-3 months I was trained for the lead position. After I didn’t receive the raise I’d been promised and months had passed, I finally decided to bring it up to management at my 6 month review. They assured me they’d fix my hourly wage to what it was supposed to be. 

They ended up only bumping me 50 cents but I decided not to complain because I didn’t want to start any problems. Just before my year in review, a new employee was hired and went around bragging how she was hired at $14.50/hr. This was obviously upsetting to those of us who’d been with the company and we’re still making multiple dollars less than that.

After myself and a few others complained to management, they raised everyone in my workgroup to $14.50/hr. This left me frustrated seeing as I’d been there a year plus I had previous experience and I was back to making the same as new employees.

I met with upper management and explained my reasoning for believing my wage should be increased to $16 as that would be $1.50 more than starting wage, which would include my 6 month, 1 year, and lead training raises.

They ended up offering me $15.50 which included if my raise for cross training into a new work group. I decided just to accept it and not cross train for the time being. (Let me note that I’d been asking to cross train since before my 1 year review but they just kept hiring outside employees).

Recently my workgroup got a new manager who after reviewing all the wages and history of wages amongst she informed myself and a few others that she would be advocating for us to receive raises. First she spoke with our previous manager, who informed her that I SPECIFICALLY was “maxed out”. She also said I was always giving up shifts to others and was on my phone too much. 

After countless attempts to discuss our wages with the general manger, and him continuously putting off having a meeting with her, she actually ended up being transferred to a different location and we were put back under our previous manager.

I decided to have a meeting with my workgroup manager in which I asked her what she meant by “maxed out” and if that meant I’d not be able to receive any additional compensation. I also reminded her I was interested in cross training and asked her if there was anything I could do to improve.

She told me “maxed out” meant that because I was given a raise less than 6 months ago I wouldn’t receive another. She also said that when my next review came around she was unsure if I would get the full 50 cents and that I might get more like 25 cents or another smaller amount. 

She informed me cross training wouldn’t be happening for a few more months because they’d taken too many outside hires and were now over staffed. And finally she said the only things I needed to work on to improve were small communications with guests so as to improve guest experience. Nothing about my phone or giving up shifts, which wasn’t true anyways. I’d trade shifts but never just give them away.

I now feel as though I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I’m trying to get better at advocating for myself, but I feel like in the past I haven’t been confident enough and now it just seems like I’m always complaining. My next step was going to be setting up a meeting with my general manager, but I have no idea how to go about this in a confident professional manner as I’m usually pretty soft spoken when it comes to these things. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read this. Hope everyone has a great day!",finance,1665035591

ada,Help fixing platform-dependent with-statements,"Hello all.

I am doing a university course this semester where we are programming a microbit v2 controller in ada. We are using gnat studio, and there are a bunch of examples one lecturer has provided for us. However, I use Fedora and not Windows, and the ""with ..\..\""-statements are throwing errors because the path is of course not the same as on Linux. I fixed one file with the correct syntax for Linux, but realised that I'd have to do this for every single file in the git repo and I haven't actually fixed it, because now it won't work on any Windows systems if I send a pull request.

Is there any way to get this to work seamlessly on both platforms?

EDIT: I made a mistake and it was in the gpr/project files and not the source code itself. It was fixed by using the Linux naming convention as this now works on Windows 10 and onwards.

datascience,Would the real data scientists please stand up?,"There are a number of myths surrounding the field of data science, the jobs available, and the pay. When I was in my salad years and green with judgement (read: before I started my master’s) I was lead to believe that data scientists are brilliant individuals who go on to earn $10,000 a month right out of school—provided that they can pass the rigorous demands of their educational programme.

The reality is much more nuanced. It is true that there are a small number of graduates who earn that much straight out of school, along with a somewhat larger number of experienced individuals (e.g. Head of Data, Senior Machine Learning Engineer, Data Science Lead). However, there are many things they don’t tell you:

1.  Those kinds of salaries are rarely found outside of the US, and since most data scientists have at least a master’s degree, that often means debt—as much as $100,000, for which the Federal interest rate is a criminal 6%;
2.  They typically go only to graduates of the top schools;
3.  They are typically only for on-site roles in some very expensive cities, e.g. San Francisco, New York and maybe London, where rents are sky-high;
4.  They are mostly offered by brand-name tech companies, finance firms, and a few startups; the recruitment process tends to be arduous. It often involves a battery of tests in coding, maths, IQ, and personality tests, in addition to multiple interviews. And by “interview”, think live-coding.
5.  By “right out of school”, think PhD. A master’s is just a pre-requisite in many firms.

So clearly, data scientists being paid $100,000+ per year are the minority. If you look at job sites like Glassdoor, you’d think that this is the _median_ salary, but these sites suffer from sampling bias. The actual median salary in the UK is little over 50K GBP. Comparing salaries across countries is difficult because:

1.  Exchange rates fluctuate, and purchasing power parity needs to be taken into account;
2.  In the US, employers pay 7.65% social security taxes; in European countries, it’s usually higher, e.g. 15% in the UK, 25% Belgium.
3.  Rents vary.
4.  Student loans vary dramatically.

So what are some typical salary bands, responsibilities, and what kind of skills are actually required? If you think that you can get a six figure job just by knowing how to work with sklearn, pandas and matplotlib, you are sadly mistaken. These are simply the basic requirements for an entry-level job. (And not even all the basics, at that.)

In order from highest to lowest:

*   $100,000+ per year, or the PPP equivalent in euros and pounds: There are 3 types of people, in my experience.
    *   The most “classical” profile is someone with a PhD in machine learning/AI from a top school who has written a few white papers in novel ML algorithms. These people work in really cutting-edge applications.
    *   The second kind of person is someone with at least a couple of years of experience who is very proficient at programming, and competent with many technologies: not just Python, but they may also be crack C++, Java or Julia programmers. They know their way around cloud computing, containerisation, distributed computing, and have read a book or two on design patterns. They know SQL and NoSQL. These people _productionize_ ML models. They are basically glorified software engineers.
    *   Experienced personnel with deep domain knowledge in medicine, business, finance, or linguistics who _also_ have the technical skills.
*   Anywhere from $60K to less than $100K: These are either PhD grads from reputable-but-less-than-top universities (those other than MIT, Oxbridge, Ivy League), or ML engineers with some experience. Fresh PhD grads will start on the low end of the scale.
*   From $40K to $60K or PPP equivalent: They know the basics, I guess. Strong Python/R skills and stats. Decent SQL skills. Can wrangle their data, write OOP code, and knows how to setup a Docker container or write a shell script. Fresh grads start on the low end, but salaries increase quickly with a bit of experience.
*   Less than $40K: These are typically called data analysts. They might write a Python script or two.
*   Unemployed (or not employed as a data scientist): The legions of wannabes from bootcamps, online certificates, and 1 year degrees who write awful code (usually in Jupyter notebooks), don’t understand statistics, don’t know how to query a database, clean data, or understand how to properly evaluate the output of a model.

Some other things to discuss. I hear a lot of people mention domain knowledge; often, these people have a lot of domain knowledge in their field of expertise and are trying to break into data science. I hate to break it to them, but while domain knowledge is valuable, all the domain knowledge in the world won’t help if you don’t the master the basics of programming and statistical analysis. It’s usually the coding part where they struggle.

Is there a shortage of data scientists in the industry? Ten years ago, definitely. [Reputable sources](https://www.itpro.co.uk/careers/28929/data-scientist-jobs-where-does-the-big-data-talent-gap-lie) still claim that anywhere from 20% to 50% of companies struggle to fill data science roles, but take these numbers with a pinch of salt.

What I can say is that there’s definitely a shortage of talented, experienced data scientists who are willing to work for less than six figures. (The competition for six figure roles is blisteringly intense, with many talented, qualified individuals applying for each role.) The shortage is particularly acute for “full-stack” data scientists who can productionize models and do data engineering. However, there seems to be a big oversupply of bootcamp/online course graduates, as well as degree holders from orthogonal disciplines. The life and social sciences are the worst offenders. A bit of data analysis in SPSS, or rookie Python ability probability won’t net you a job, or a low-paying one at best.

If you are looking to enter the field like I am, my advice is to start by getting a degree in DS, CS or statistics (but make sure it’s a stats course with strong programming requirements). It’s generally easier to become a data scientist by first starting out as a developer or a data engineer (glorified developer). By the way, a position as a data analyst does _not_ prepare you for the reality of data science or software engineering. The stories you hear about data analysts becoming data scientists was from years ago when management didn’t know the difference – or they have the title data scientist but only do analytics work. A data analyst is usually a glorified Excel monkey who maybe knows some Python and SQL. While they might be able to create a simple ML model, they often don't really understand how to interpret the model or tune it, as their statistics knowledge only covers the basics. The learning curve for software engineering is even steeper and such a person can only do their job if they have an army of data engineers and ML engineers working for them.

Although companies like IBM tell us that data is a fast-growing field, the threat of automation should not be discounted. In 10 years, there might not be a market for data scientists, or at least, it won’t employ large numbers of people. The bar could be set even higher as simple, routine tasks become automated.

I do believe that creative jobs are immune from automation, and certainly, there are no AI models that can write stories, so I still plan on being a writer in the long-term. We’ll have to wait and see whether my creative abilities end up being more lucrative than my technical ones.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures dipped Thursday, as a massive rally to start the month eased, with rates ticking higher once again.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures declined by 152 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures slid 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year rate climbed more than 1 basis point to 3.773%. The 2-year yield, which is more sensitive to monetary policy changes, rose 2 basis points to 4.14%.
*****
&gt; Wall Street started the week on a high note, with the S&amp;P 500 staging its biggest two-day rally since 2020. Stocks fought to keep the winning streak going Wednesday but ultimately fell short. The Dow closed about 42 points lower, or 0.14%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.20% and 0.25%, respectively.
*****
&gt; “Few are convinced that the recent move is more than a bear market rally, with skepticism over the durability,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide. “Confidence remains weak, ranging from CEOs, small businesses, consumers, and investors. Universal pessimism is bullish from a contrarian perspective, though timing of the pendulum swing is difficult to predict.”
*****
&gt; Investors continue to monitor economic data to see if inflation is cooling off, or if the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes are pushing the U.S. closer to a recession.
*****
&gt; Data from ADP showed that the labor market remained strong among private companies in September, when businesses added 208,000 jobs. That beat the 200,000 job estimate from Dow Jones. On Friday, the September jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics will be released, giving the central bank and investors another piece of data.
*****
&gt; Some companies are reporting earnings, as well. On Thursday, Constellation Brands will announce its results before the opening bell, and Levi Strauss will report after the market closes.

personalfinance,Am I in a pickle with my Roth IRA?,"Where do I start? As the title suggests, I may be in a situation with my Roth IRA. I am newer to contributing outside of my traditional 401k and as of late last year, I started contributing to a Roth IRA and HSA. 

To give you some background, my wife and I got married this past February 2022 and started living together since then. For the year, my salary is $132k, while my wife's is $60k. I talked to my Tax advisor and we decided the best option for my wife and I was to check the box for ""Married filing separately"" on our W4's (+additional money each month for Federal) for proper withholding/adjust for any shortages and ""Married filing jointly"" on our 2022 tax returns. I have earned a gross income of $100k YTD. I was recently awarded a raise effective later this month that will take my salary from $132k to $150k and a bonus of $20k. Effectively, our combined salary and bonus will take us to $230k. For my Roth IRA, I have been contributing $500 per month since the start of the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

My confirmations/questions are this:

1) Do contributions to a Roth IRA follow your W4 status or your tax return filing status? Since our W4s will read ""Married filing separately"" but our tax returns will read ""Married filing jointly"" which limit contribution applies? Separately = cannot contribute anything over &gt;$10k, while jointly reads limits of &lt;$214k.

2) If contribution limits follow the status of my W4, what do I do with the contributions I've already made this year?

3) If contribution limits follow the status of my tax return for 2022,  do I stop contributing to my Roth IRA now or when our gross reaches a limit?

4) For both scenarios, would I have to recharacterize my Roth IRA to a Traditional IRA for these excess funds? What are any penalties I might see?

5) Overall, are there any penalties/fees I will run into?

Thank you all in advance. Long time lingerer here, but again, I am newer to this, looking to learn from possible mistakes. Any and all feedback is welcome.",finance,1665066517

My current source comes from an Econ professor at FSU who was an advisor to the FED branch in Atlanta. Here is what I found according to the Federal Reserves website.

“Why is the Federal Reserve paying banks interest?

The payment of interest on banks' reserve balances is a common monetary policy tool at the disposal of major central banks. The Congress authorized the Federal Reserve to pay interest on balances that banks hold at the Fed, effective in late 2008. Since then, the Federal Reserve has paid interest on those balances. The Board of Governors sets the interest rate the Federal Reserve pays on reserve balances (the IORB rate) to help implement the FOMC's monetary policy decisions.”

personalfinance,Afraid to spend my money.,"Time is ticking and I have to make a decision. So, we moved to Charlotte in hopes of leading a mcol life in the beginning of the year. We soon purchased a new construction at $500K at a place 40 minutes away from our rental place. Now closing date is near and we don't want to close. My wife made friends where we live and she doesn't want to go that far away. Also all her social events are near to this current rental place. I also got a new job that requires me to be in office that's 30 minutes away. We put $25K down. Another wrench in the situation is we have interest rate lock until November at 4.25. This rate can only be transferred to a new construction with a close date in November. We found a similar square feet but luxurious construction in a desirable area at $720K. We will put 20% down. It is also 15 minutes away to my office. To compare: monthly payment is $2800 with only 5%(25K) down on the 500K and $3400 with 20%(145K) down for $720K. I can afford to go with $720K but it goes against my saving mentality and I moved to this area to have a lower cost of living.

Our financials are as follows we are in 30's: 

Take home is $8K after maxing out our 401Ks 

401K - 566K 

Taxable brokerage - 500K 

Cash - 50K

My only goals is life to leave my daughter inheritence as much as possible and to retire at 55. Choosing the $700K feels like I'm cheating my daughter out of money. Another thing that's making the decision hard is we are leaving 100K increase in home price on the table plus 25K deposit. Another line of thinking is we are aging and we need to enjoy life instead of always saving. To sum it up, I'm afraid to spend my money for $720K with the saving mentality block.",finance,1665074671

CryptoCurrency,Stablecoin Security - NIST,"The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) aka the governing  body for cyber security controls for US state and federal agencies (also used and referenced by an enormous number of public and private  companies for cyber base lining) has published a draft on [Stablecoin Technology and Related Security Considerations](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8408/draft).

Now I’m not entirely sure what the prioritization process for publishing  new guidance like this is but I doubt it’s a willy-nilly free-for-all.  My thoughts are this is related to Do Kwon’s escapades and/or the Fed’s  increased conversations about creating a US dollar stablecoin and the  need for increased regulation.

This could be a critical path item for the US gov to establish a stablecoin  that they control so it seems promising (if that’s even what you want to  happen) and a great adoption driver…. but… negative for  decentralization if that is true. Or at the very least good for better  stablecoin security overall!

Any other reasons why this might be getting traction?

personalfinance,Selling vs renting when moving out of state.,"We bought what we thought would be our forever home 2 years ago. However we both have since transitioned into remote jobs and would love to try living in a different part of the country and hopefully make that are our home base. 

We are torn between selling and renting.  It’s a 3/1 1500sqft 1920s bungalow. Bought for 300k at 2.875% interest. Payments are about 2.1k a month with 281k remaining.  We have also owe 15k on kitchen cabinet loan (2yr 0% interest 600/mo) and 6k home repair loan (2yr 0% interest 300/mo).  “Zestimate” currently at 460k (says 420-500k range).  Renting comps seem to be 2.5k-2.8k range.  We’d also be using a PM since we’d be so far away. 

As evidenced from the loans we’ve put a lot of money into making this home work for us and we love it. In the event our cross country move doesn’t work out (homesick, miss family/friends), don’t actually like PNW as much as we fantasize); we wanted to rent it for a year incase things don’t work out. Also with the interest rate being 2.875%, we didn’t want to lose out on that. 

So with these numbers what do you guys think? Financially would it make more sense to hold onto this property and rent while we’re gone and keep it? Or should we sell the property and pay off our 0% loans and move with a clean slate.",finance,1665085083

personalfinance,Late beginner at money management-- where should I get started with investments?,"Would really appreciate any advice and insight on how to better set my finances up with some sort of investment/savings to eventually be able to buy a house, retire, travel, etc. The topic of money has only ever elicited feelings of intimidation and deep discomfort for me, hence why I've avoided thinking about investments seriously until now.

Plainly, I am bad at money-- I spend it mostly thinking about the possibility of not being alive in 10 or even 5 years, and my income either sits in my checking account or goes towards rent, food, social life, and material items. I try not to go overboard with spending and make sure to pay off my credit card regularly, but I also just.. leave money in my checking because I like to see it there for reasons between my next therapist and me. 

For years, I've disregarded financial responsibility as something for Older Self to worry about when I had more money to save. Now, that time has come-- I'm 26, recently started getting paid a bit more, and the prospect of getting older without investing in something with compounded interest/returns before I potentially lose out on a ton of money later on in life is itching at me. I'm afraid I've lost too much time already. As for goals, buying a house or apartment feels nearly impossible but I would like to be able to one day, or at least save up for a trip abroad in the shorter term. 

Here are my stats:

Income: $75K annual (aka about $4300 a month after taxes and insurance). Graduated late, started working at 23 making $40k, then 55, 63, and now we're here)

Savings: $8K (chucked money into Discover Bank years ago since it apparently had relatively good interest rates + was recommended for college students at the time?)

Rent: $1K a month (I split with my partner)

Monthly spending: on average, $2-2500 a month (again, bad with money as long as I'm not in the red... plus pricey coastal city living)

Retirement accounts: I have \~$2500 in contributions to a 401k from my last job, but my new job doesn't allow contributions to a workplace retirement account until you've worked there for a year. I never invested within that 401k (didn't even realize it was an option at the time).

My parents don't want me to and thus I can't get their info for the FAFSA.

I still filled it out with my information and asked my school if I can still get a Fed Unsub loan (which is all I want), but they haven't responded yet, and I just want to see what my other options are as I'm not holding out hope on that path.

I'm now looking to take a private loan without a co-signer. To contextualize, I have about $6k in cash in my bank account, a credit score of 720-725 depending who you ask (down from 750 a few months ago due to some CC apps), and a singed job offer with a salary of $120k plus as $10k singing bonus. I currently have no debt besides regular CC payments. I have never not paid off in full and have a history length of 2.5 years. My current official limit across cards is $7.5k, but in reality, it would be closer to $25k due to Amex not reporting a limit. Access to revolving credit doesn't really matter though right?

Given that I have a signed job offer and no debt, seeking $5k would give a debt-to-income ratio of less than 5%. As such, I am looking for issuers who would be able to give that amount without a co-signer. I know the current fed loan rate is 4.99%, and I'm not going to get anything near that via a private loan, but would it be possible to get something that doesn't exceed 10%? Would I be able to get a personal loan instead of a bonafide student loan as my expenses would not be used to pay for tuition? Thank you so much in advance.",finance,1665091020

**Summary/Analysis:**

To put it plainly, shit don't look good. Lots of analysts lowering estimates and forecasts, but they are still being absolutely irrational. Q3 isn't the bottom for these earnings, its just the beginning as employment hasn't even meaningfully dropped yet. All signs point to inflation having peaked, but if you paid attention to the White House's reaction to the OPEC production cut, you can tell they are very worried that energy prices will again push on inflation once the releases from the SPR end. 

Common themes across these early poor reporters seems to be a glut of inventory, a quickly deteriorating consumer, as well as extreme FX issues due to the too strong US dollar. Fedex is also a canary in the coal mine for all things ecommerce as well. Again, all this has occurred in Q3 and we haven't even seen unemployment make a meaningful rise. The Fed will absolutely not pivot anytime soon as inflation has yet to meaningfully fall (SPR releases mess with the number). If something breaks and the Fed is forced to lower rates, inflation is going to murder the economy.

personalfinance,Inherited a fixer upper two years ago,"Ok I need some big advice!
Back story: My dad died March of 2020 and I inherited my childhood house which is basically a fixer upper (lot of critical repairs including roof and some structural). I was 23 at the time of his death and I’m almost 26 now. At the time of his death there was about $95k left owed on the mortgage. Unfortunately my dad had a variable rate mortgage so this April the mortgage went up by almost $400 a month. My name has been on the deed long enough now to refinance if I choose (took a long time bc of the estate). I’m not sure if I should refinance and take cash out or not. I know interest rates are high but the repairs I need to do are crucial and I live in the house. Any advice on this would be great and I’m happy to answer any questions.

personalfinance,I want to understand payroll taxation and how it jumped quite a bit from one to next.,"I newly joined a company in Seattle, WA,working in IT. They pay bi-weekly, on fixed dates company-wide. I got my first paycheck at the end of first week, for 40 hours. There my total tax was ~23%. Two weeks later, I got my second paycheck today, for 80 hours. There my total tax is ~29%! 

To explain the scenario with fudged numbers - 

Duration | Hours |Gross Salary | Federal Tax | Social Security | Medicare | Take Home
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
09/19 - 09/23 | 40 | 400 | 65 | 25 | 6 | 308
09/26 - 10/07 | 80 | 800 | 172 | 51 | 12 | 568

Would it be worthwhile if I refinanced my current car loan if $7,000 (w/ Wells Fargo) with the credit union.
I plan to pay it off within 12mo. Would the hard inquiry be worth the positive repayment history l'd build with navy federal? What about if I also opened a debt consolidation loan of about $10,000 with intention of paying it off also within 12mo.
Essentially moving all my debts to navy federal with the intention I plan to pay back considerably fast. Or would this likely make a negligible difference when it comes time to open a mortgage with the credit union. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks all",finance,1665105082
CryptoCurrency,Q3 Bear Market Relief,"The US is currently in a recession. Here is why.

*Trends during a recession include a rise in the unemployment rate and a decrease in the GDP for two consecutive quarters.*

The U.S (biggest crypto market globally) GDP contracted -1.6% for the first quarter, and -0.6% for the second quarter. **This fulfills the above requirement.** Stocks saw a massive dump of -20%, and BTC has seen a -71% dump since November, the peak of the bull market.

Although, there may be some relief coming. According to the [Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow#:~:text=The%20GDPNow%20model%20estimate%20for,0.5%20percent%20on%20September%2015), the GDP is expected to rise by about 2-3%.

But again, there are a variety of other factors. There is still the European energy crisis, the Russo-Ukraine war, and currencies crashing to all-time lows (GBP, EUR).

stocks,Deflation to coincide with the rise of the stock market?!,"The aggressive rise of interest-rate could lead to a financial crisis that scares the Fed to abandon the original policy-tightening plan to avoid a full recession.

Bank of America's chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett stated when ""Markets stop panicking when central banks start panicking""

Investors are selling in this bear market with their negative sentiment which creates the opportunity to buy stocks now.

Signs that prices are falling fast and hard preluding a deflation:

1. Energy prices are down sharply.
2. Commodity prices are falling fast.
3. Rents are now dropping.
4. Retailers are slashing prices to clear excess inventory.
5. Supply chains are improving.  (ECO 101 of Supply &amp; Demand)
6. Businesses are failing to raise prices.
7. Labor market dynamics are improving.

Inflation spikes are symmetrical.  This inflation spike took about a year to form and probably peaked in March or April of this year.  This means inflation will probably be back to a not worrisome level by next spring or early summer.

Investment strategist Jim Paulsen stated, ""If you buy at the peak, you do pretty darn well over the next 12 months.""

The market reaction to CPI data on Oct 13th at 8:30 AM could give a telltale sign of what's to come.

personalfinance,Passing Inheritance or Monetary Gifts to a S/O While in Debt?,"For brevity, the names of these real people will be Mr. X Jr, his girlfriend Ms. Y, and his father Mr X Sr.

**THE FAMILY:**

Mr. X Jr. is in his 40's. Defaulted on federally-backed student loans, which total about 55k. Has not made a payment on said loans in decades. Laid off from work. Owns one non-working vehicle KBB would say is about 4k. No investments. No savings. Possessions include typical personal items (computer, tools, fridge, appliances, etc). One child that S/O claims on returns. All live in same home.

Ms. Y is the girlfriend and mother of their child. Sometime in the next 5-10 years, Stands to inherit a brick home, as well as ten acres of developed land (electric, internet, well water, etc) that the home is on, out in the country. At present, she has absolutely no net worth, no possessions of value.

X Sr wants to purchase a vehicle for X Jr, worth 30k. His will also includes very modest annual music royalties, and gold coins kept in a safe deposit box. 

**THE PROBLEM:**

X Jr and Ms Y have deliberately not gotten married because of how much debt X Jr is in. The assumption is that if they did marry, Ms Y would inherit X Jr's debt, say if he were to die in an car accident. Namely the $55,000 in student loans. And potentially wouldn't be able to keep the vehicle that X Jr purchases, or has purchased in his name. 

**POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS?**

Given that X Jr doesn't care whose name is on the car title, nor whose name the gold will be under the ownership of......

1. Can X Sr simply ""gift"" 30k to the girlfriend to purchase the new vehicle?
2. Should X Sr purchase the vehicle himself, then transfer the title to the girlfriend?
3. Can X Sr list the girlfriend in the will as who will inherit the gold?

For the sake of this discussion, it is totally irrelevant as to whether or not X Jr and Ms Y will remain in a relationship for another week, or the next 40 years. It only matters that Ms Y has a dependable vehicle, and a financial safety net should X Jr die unexpectedly in the immediate future. And most important of all, that the government not be able to take Ms Y's new car, gold, land, home, in an attempt to cover the debt X Jr left behind when he dies.",finance,1665109646

personalfinance,How to estimate tax withholding using IRS tax withholding online tool?,"IRS tax withholding tool seems to have confusing wording. I am trying to help my friend estimate her tax withholding for her new hire paperwork for a new job. IRS tool at this [link](https://apps.irs.gov/app/tax-withholding-estimator/income-and-withholding/) mentions the below in step 2 ""Income &amp; Withholding""

&gt;Enter information for each job you **will** earn income from this year.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How many jobs will you and your spouse have this year in which federal income tax **is** regularly withheld? Include past,  present, and **future** jobs. The first one has been added for you.

What does this mean exactly - all jobs held during the calendar year even if you worked at them one at a time and did not have more than one job at the same time ---- or ---- all concurrent jobs you have had/plan to hold?

In her example, this new job would be her third job this calendar year, but she never worked more than one job at a time. For e.g.

Jan - Mar ---- Job 1 ---- past job  
Apr - Oct ---- Job 2 ---- current job  
Nov - Dec --- Job 3 ---- future job for which the withholding information is being asked for

So, should the number be 3 or 1? She is afraid saying 3 may be construed as concurrent jobs and her withholding may be considerably higher? What is the ""correct"" way to enter this information?

My friend is not too concerned about having higher withholding but rather providing incorrect information on W-4, since it is subject to review by IRS even though employers usually are not required to provide it to IRS, as mentioned on IRS [website](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/small-business-self-employed-other-business/form-w-4-wage-withholding/form-w-4-wage-withholding-1).

personalfinance,"Question about transferring Roth to Vanguard or Fidelity from Financial Advisor, and Roth vs. Traditional IRA","I'll try to be brief. Back in 2015 I started a Roth through a Financial Advisor from Transamerica. He set up the Roth through Nationwide insurance and it's invested in NCDCX (ticker). I never liked the guy and he is the epitome of a persuasive, sleazy sales-ey kind of person and he definitely kind of screwed me. There was a lot he didn't tell me, for example I didn't know I could actively be part of the investing process or that I had a choice investing in different things to make the money grow. He never once told me about other options I had, or gave me any kind of advice on what to invest in, nothing. I have always had it set to withdraw $50 a month and I  would just forget about it. I've been meaning to contribute more every month, but only this year am I making more money than I ever have before in  my life, so now I'm able to contribute more. Currently, it has almost $4K in it.

Fast forward to earlier this year to my newest landlord who is aged 70, he is all about stocks and investing, etc. He really has helped me out with taxes and opened my eyes. He suggested transferring my Roth to a Traditional IRA with Vanguard or Fidelity and with a money market account. He said I could just call say, Fidelity, talk to an advisor and they would tell me all the necessary steps to set up the transfer and to just have the Nationwide statement and account number, etc. Is it that easy? Can I just stop talking to the Financial Advisor I went through initially? I really don't want to to talk to him. My landlord said ""Do you want it with a federally insured money market? There's no minimum. Or do you want the Vanguard money market? One is not going to pay as much."" Any insight into that statement?

Also, I'm conflicted as to whether I should open and transfer the money into a Traditional vs. a Roth. I want to go the Roth route. My landlord recommended the Traditional which is what he has, as contributing is tax deferred (yes I know it's taxed when you take the money out). But what gets me is he said ""You'll never take it all out"" referring to withdrawing. I guess everyone's different. Any pro tips on advantages and disadvantages of each? (Besides the tax penalty and tax deferred parts). Also any thoughts on Fidelity vs. Vanguard?  Thanks so much in advance!",finance,1665118819
CryptoCurrency,"I read the dismissal docket regarding Jarrett v United States. I think it says that the IRS has determined staking income to be non-taxable at time of receipt and to only be taxable at time of sale. I provide my summary along with the text of the docket, along with my thought process.","A Tennessee district court has dismissed the [Jarrett v Unites States](https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/crypto-staking-tax-lawsuit-ruled-moot-after-irs-issued-refund) case.  According to the [docket](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/JarrettetalvUnitedStatesofAmericaDocketNo321cv00419MDTennMay26202/7?1665117690) \-

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For the reasons stated herein, the motion to dismiss will be granted, and this case dismissed  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The Jarretts contend cryptocurrency “Tezos tokens” Joshua Jarrett created in 2019 were not taxable income in 2019 and, therefore, the Jarretts are entitled to a refund for all federal income taxes paid on the “Tezos  tokens.” (Id.). After the Jarretts filed this action, the United States authorized the Jarretts’ refund, plus statutory interest.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to adjudication of “cases” and “controversies.” U.S. Const., Art. III, § 2. “A case becomes moot —and therefore no longer a ‘Case’ or ‘Controversy’ for purposes of Article III – ‘when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;It is undisputed that the United States issued a refund check to the Jarretts in the amount allegedly owed for the 2019 tax year. The question for the Court is whether there remains a live case and controversy. The Court finds there does not.  Plaintiffs filed this case ostensibly seeking recovery of overpayment of taxes – an overpayment the United States has now refunded in full

&amp;#x200B;

The case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds as the IRS had requested.  Specifically it was dismissed on the grounds that the IRS issued the refund in the first place and thus there was no case to begin with.  While the Jarretts had argued that they had refused the refund and thus had standing to file under precedent set by Campbell-Ewald v Gomez, the court found that they cited the case in error.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Plaintiffs’ reliance on Campbell-Ewald is misplaced. Here, the United States has not made an offer of judgment under Rule 68 or any other kind of offer. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a refund check, not an offer. The Plaintiffs are certainly entitled to decide for themselves whether to deposit the check tendered by the IRS, but their failure to do has no bearing on whether there remains a live case or controversy for the Court to adjudicate. The United States explains, “\[r\]efunds are simply what happens when payments exceed liability on a taxpayer’s IRS account.” (Doc. No. 53 at 3). The United States does not “ask” taxpayers if they will accept a refund. The refund is simply issued upon determination of an overpayment. See 26 U.S.C. § 6402(a) (“In the case of an overpayment, the Secretary … shall refund any balance to \[the person who made the overpayment\].”).

&amp;#x200B;

The Jarretts went on to claim that a judicial decision was necessary to prevent recurrences of a similar event.  Here the court disagreed with the Jarretts yet again.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Jarretts argue that even if their claim for a refund is moot, they can obtain prospective relief under the refund statute and this part of their claim remains live. Again, the Court disagrees.  
&gt;  
&gt;Two statutes appear to foreclose forward-looking relief. The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), which allows federal courts to declare the rights of parties in cases of actual controversy, specifically excepts declaratory relief with respect to federal taxes (except under circumstances not appliable here).  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Further, the Anti-Injunction Act bars suits “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection” of taxes  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;(“\[T\]he district \[court\] correctly concluded it was without jurisdiction to entertain a suit containing solely forward-looking claims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the IRS. These type of suits are expressly proscribed by the \[Declaratory Judgment Act\] and the \[Anti-Injunction Act\].”)

&amp;#x200B;

The Jarretts' final argument was a furtherance of the above argument, except that they argued that the court retained jurisdiction due to two exceptions to the court's lack of jurisdiction.  The first of the two exceptions is argued straightforwardly. I think it is important to note the position taken by the government regarding this exception, as mentioned in the third section of this quote box.  The second of the exceptions, which by the court's own admission is more murky, is also found to be null.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Plaintiffs argue that even if the issuance of a refund moots their claim, the Court nevertheless retains jurisdiction because the claim falls within the exceptions to mootness. (Doc. No. 51 at 12). There are two exceptions to the mootness doctrine. First, voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct does not moot a case unless it is “clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.” United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Exp. Ass’n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968). Second, a case will not become moot if the injury is “capable of repetition yet evading review.” Plaintiffs add that the Sixth Circuit has also suggested that a claim will not be moot if it is “capable of repetition and one of public importance.”  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness, “a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;This exception is inapplicable for a simple reason, the United States’ refund of the claimed overpayment of income tax is not “voluntary cessation of conduct.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The United States has not changed the tax rules or regulations and does not claim to have changed its position. It has merely refunded Plaintiffs the overpayment requested  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;“The capable-of-repetition doctrine applies only in exceptional situations, and generally only where the named plaintiff can make a reasonable showing that he will again be subject to the alleged illegality.”  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;As to whether this suit is capable of repetition, the answer depends on one’s perspective. From the Jarretts’ vantage point, despite the fact that the refund suit is seeking refund of taxes for a specific year, the suit concerns whether creation of Tezos tokens is taxable income. They contend this issue will arise each and every year because Joshua Jarrett intends to continue creating Tezos tokens. The United States argues that this suit, which concerns only the refund for 2019, is not capable of repetition because any subsequent suit would necessarily involve a different tax year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Court finds no reasonable expectation that Plaintiffs will be subject to the same action again. As stated above, the instant controversy was limited to whether Plaintiffs were entitled to a refund of taxes paid for the 2019 tax year. This particular issue is not capable of repetition as any subsequent claim for refund would necessarily apply to a different tax year. Christian Coalition  662. F.3d at 1196 (“The tax amounts in dispute and the nature of the claim for a refund are specific to each individual tax year.”). Moreover, as this is the Jarretts’ first suit to seek a refund after paying income tax on Tezos tokens, it is premature to speculate the Jarretts’ tax refund claims will repeatedly evade review

&amp;#x200B;

The court concludes with the following, essentially saying that the taxation status of staking income is not up to the court to decide.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Plaintiffs’ claim for relief is MOOT. They filed a refund claim seeking refund of a tax overpayment. Now that the overpayment has been refunded, Plaintiff seeks an advisory opinion on whether it was entitled to the refund under the current tax law. The Court does not provide advisory opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

With all of that in mind, it seems realistic to believe that the IRS has now confirmed that income received due to staking is not taxable upon receipt.

My thought process is that because the IRS issued a refund for taxes that were erroneously collected on staking income (quote box 1, section 4), and there has been no change in official guidance since that time (quote box 4, section 3), and the equal protections clause exists, it must follow that the IRS has determined that staking income is not taxable until the time it is sold.

personalfinance,Should I wait to finance a “better” used car or save and buy a cheaper used car outright,"As the title briefly describes my current back and forth argument with myself I don’t know what to go with obviously. Not that inclined in stuff like this so turning to here. Recently turned 18 with no car and will need one soon. Currently just getting by getting driven to and from work 4 days a week 30 minutes each away by friends and family and that isn’t working out for anyone. I don’t have much saved up as this is my first job and just started practically and basically no credit yet.

I don’t know if I save for 3-6+ months and use that money towards a down payment on a car that’d be lower mileage, newer, “better, better driver experience, more presentable, and possibly more reliable. Or use that money  and attempt to find something in decent condition, hopefully reliable, decent mileage, not beat, and preferably something I’d be happy with the driving experience.

I make roughly 1500 a month and about 500 a month would be going to rent, small expenses, and gas for all those rides. That said responsible eating and saving and some side income or overtime I could save up more.

If I were to buy outright my budget would likely stay at or around 7.5k whenever I reach that but I also don’t like the idea of using all the money saved up on a car I may need to do repairs on if I get unfortunate with the car I get. But with the used market going down a bit I may get lucky.

With my career choice being something where first impressions are everything I’d prefer something relatively newer and lower mileage as I’d be moving around a lot and a 100k mile 2007 Honda civic with fading clear coat won’t help but it’ll do it’s that all I can do then I’ll do it. 

Yes, when I finance my credit won’t be amazing but I’m fine with waiting a bit and working on it to have something lenders would like more for a more comfortable interest rate.

I am keeping gas, insurance, and maybe car payments in mind and my current monthly expenses would lower a tiny bit as I’m covering a bit of my parents insurance for taking me to work and I’ be paying less people for gas if that’d really make a difference for me.

With all that being said, what should I do?

Dear Diary

So the 15th of December I started my journey into crypto.

Because I did not have the funds to go in lump sum, I will follow the strategy which I described in my original post.

So to sum it up:

\- Monthly deposit to exchanges;

\- DCA 80% of deposit weekly over top 5 Mcap;

\- Allocate 20% to Buy the Dip;

\- Stake holdings on exchange;

\- Investment horizon 5 years;

\- Dip defined as minimal 8% drop on 24H time frame.

\- For DCA I will also look into the Fear and Greed index. DCA more when the market is in fear, DCA less when in greed.

\- For the meme I also DCA a bit into DOGE... :)

\- ADJUSTMENT-

I have started to buy the dip a bit more aggressively. As we come deeper in the Bear market I decided it was time to push my average cost down a bit more. Also once I have started to buy a coin in the top five I keep DCA into it. I stop when they exit the top 10 excluding stable coins.

Now to update where do I stand and what are the results up till now

So to measure performance, I will look at what this strategy has done compared to a lump sum investment at my starting point on the 15th of December.

UPDATE

Must admit I had FOMO...made a gamble on Luna....probably a stupid one.....I'll keep it and take it as a lesson learned.....Stick to the F$#@%$\* plan!!!

I have adjusted my strategy a bit. I am upping my investment in BTC and ETH compared to alts.

UPDATE 19-9-2022

Heavy on BTC and ETH.

UPDATE 28-9-2022

Implement flexible DCA day and time. When pump postpone DCA in bear market.

UPDATE 7-10-2022

Starting to look like a very good time to accumulate. Still wondering if there is going to be another drop. Hold off on DCA this week, due to unemployment rates release in the US today and FOMC minutes next week.

**Total PNL** \-34.56%

So as you all can see some have worked out better then the others.

But IMO it is very interesting that we are in a downtrend combined with this strategy.

Will try to keep you all updated once in a while on how it is performing.

# Background

* In the past, he worked as a TradFi developer for banks.
* In 2012 started to get into BTC.
* Went full-time around 2016.

# Statechains on Mercury Wallet

* Mercury Wallet produces statecoins in which BTC can be put in and then transferred.
* An address with two private keys is created, where one private key is with the user and one with the recipient.
* To transfer it to another wallet, the recipient should create a statecoin address in Mercury.
* There is cooperation between the sender and statechain server to tweak the sender’s private key and generate a new private key for the recipient.
* With the two private keys, you’re creating one public key which exists on the BTC blockchain.
* There is a 3-month time limit during which statecoins can be sent back and forth.
* Mercury is non-custodial and the users can always pull their funds out.

# Mercury Wallet Interface

* The deposit button allows users to create a statecoin.
* Withdraw button allows taking your BTC back to BTC main chain.
* Privacy Score in the pop-up window means how many times the state coin has been swapped.

# Criticism

* Some people don’t like the hardware security module (HSM) that the team is using.
* To avoid the risk, the team has hard coded the 3-month period.
* Every L2 has a reduction in trust compromises.

# Regulatory Concerns

* Different lawyers have different views.
* The team is trying to copy what others are doing.
* They don’t have custody, they don’t charge for using the swaps, and they charge only for using the statechain entity.
* FinCen released a report in 2019 stating that non-custodial mixers are ok to operate.
* Custodial mixers are in control of the funds and you need a money transfer license.
* The team has plans to protect themselves.

# Thoughts on Fedimint

* [Fedimint](https://twitter.com/fedimint) is different, it’s similar to [Liquid Network](https://twitter.com/Liquid_BTC).
* Mercury is fixed UTXO, which means that you can’t break the statecoin into little pieces.
* The next step for statecoins is to integrate with BTC Lightning Network.

# Mercury Use Cases

* Mercury currently has around 16 BTC going through the system.
* Statecoins could be used for Discreet Log Contracts.
* The team is working on being able to onboard Lightning users.
* In some ways, Mercury is better than [Wasabi wallet](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet), in some ways it’s not.
* Mercury is not doing any type of coin join, it’s doing coin swaps, which means that the exchanges can’t see anything. The downside is you might get a dirty coin.
* The team wants the project to be seen as an L2 project rather than only a privacy project.

**Lazarus hackers abuse Dell driver bug using new FudModule rootkit**  
The notorious North Korean hacking group has been observed installing a Windows rootkit that abuses a Dell hardware driver in a Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver attack. The spear-phishing campaign unfolded in the autumn of 2021, and the confirmed targets, an aerospace expert in the Netherlands and a political journalist in Belgium, were emailed fake job offers at Amazon. ESET reports that among the tools deployed in this campaign, the most interesting is a new FudModule rootkit that abuses a BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) technique to exploit a vulnerability in a Dell hardware driver for the first time.

**Ex-NSA employee charged with violating Espionage Act, selling U.S. cyber secrets**  
The former employee, Jareh Sebastian Dalke, appeared in federal court Thursday on charges that he attempted to transmit classified “national defense information” to an FBI agent he believed was a Russian operative, in exchange for $85,000, according to the Justice Department. He had allegedly told the undercover agent that he had access to information “relating to foreign targeting of U.S. systems and information on cyber operations,” according to the affidavit. Dalke was only employed by the NSA for about three weeks before quitting on July 1, but while there he had a top-secret clearance in his role as an “information systems security designer,” according to the FBI.

**Former Uber security chief found guilty of data breach coverup**  
A U.S. federal court jury has found former Uber Chief Security Officer Joseph Sullivan guilty of not disclosing a 2016 breach of customer and driver records to regulators and attempting to cover up the incident. Sullivan has been convicted on two counts: One for obstructing justice by not reporting the incident and another for misprision. He faces a maximum of five years in prison for the obstruction charge, and a maximum of three years for the latter. The 2016 hack of Uber occurred as a result of two hackers gaining unauthorized access to the company's database backups, prompting the ride-hailing firm to secretly pay a $100,000 ransom in December 2016 in exchange for deleting the stolen information.

**LA school data published on leak site**  
The Los Angeles Unified School District confirmed that a ransomware organization began publishing exfiltrated information about students online. The files appeared on the leak site for the Vice Society ransomware organization, known for targeting educational organizations. The attack occurred over Labor Day weekend, with the threat group issuing a ransom demand on September 22nd. The district did not negotiate or pay the ransom, in accordance with advice from the FBI. Bleeping Computer reports folder names in the leaked data suggest it includes social security numbers, passport information, and “Secret and Confidential” documents. NBC Los Angeles’ law enforcement sources say it includes legal records, business documents, and some confidential psychological assessments of students.

**Fraud hitting P2P payment apps**  
A new report from the office of Senator Elizabeth Warren found an increasing prevalence of fraud and scams using the peer-to-peer payment service Zelle. The banks Bank of America, Truist, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo own the company that operates Zelle. Since the second half of 2021, data from four of these banks shows 192,878 cases of fraud resulting in $213.8 million in losses using payments made with Zelle. Despite bank ownership, the reports found only 3,500 cases where the banks reimbursed for the losses, and in those cases only reimbursing an average of 47%. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is expected to issue regulations to require banks to reimburse customers for a wider array of scams and fraud.

**Twitter deal isn’t done yet**  
We covered yesterday that Elon Musk re-offered his original price to take Twitter private, with a share price already approved by Twitter’s board. The deal isn’t done yet, with Twitter getting a new concession in the case. The Delaware Court of Chancery approved Twitter to proceed with a limited investigation into whether whistleblower Peiter “Mudge”  Zatko contacted Elon Musk’s lawyers prior to his previous attempt to back out of buying Twitter. This involved a May 6th email sent from an anonymous ProtonMail account claiming to be “a former exec at Twitter leading teams directly involving Trust &amp; Safety/Content Moderation” and offered Musk information on Twitter through alternate channels. If Musk and Twitter reach an agreement to end litigation, the matter would be moot.

Australia’s largest telco Telstra confirmed it suffered a data breach at a third-part organization, exposing employee data dating back to 2017. It estimates 30,000 people were impacted, with names and email addresses leaked. This comes two weeks after another telco in the country, Optus, suffered a data breach impacting up to 10 million accounts.

**Netwalker ransomware affiliate sentenced to 20 years in prison**  
On Tuesday, a court in Tampa, FL sentenced former Netwalker ransomware-as-a-service affiliate, Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, to 20 years in prison and ordered him to forfeit $21.5 million.The 34-year-old Canadian man was extradited from Quebec and plead guilty to a series of computer and wire fraud related crimes. After serving his prison sentence, Vachon-Desjardins will have to serve three years of supervised release and will not be permitted to use any device capable of connecting to the Internet. Back in February, Vachon-Desjardins was sentenced to 6 years and eight months for similar charges in a court in Ontario.

defi,I rebuilt DCAStack.com - An Automated Crypto Dollar Cost Averaging Bot on Defi!,"**DCA Stack - An Automated Crypto Dollar Cost Averaging Bot on Defi**

Twitter: https://twitter.com/DcaStack

Website: https://www.dcastack.com/

Source: https://github.com/DCAStack

Discord: https://discord.gg/UGzTnZ8k58

&amp;nbsp;

***Why?***

&amp;nbsp;

I originally built DCAStack as a tool to automate purchases on centralized exchanges. But now given the market conditions, general uneasiness and overall distrust with centralized entities; It became time to pivot and work on the next generation of DCAStack that would enable ***Trustless, Transparent, Trading***.

I built this web app because I was so fed up with the lack of options in Dollar Cost Averaging. The current situation with DCA is:

* Centralized exchange fees to DCA are too high
* Trading bot websites need your API keys
* Give up complete custody of your funds with no transparency

And so, DCAStack was reborn.  Built for the community, open sourced and hoping to restore your purchasing power :)


&amp;nbsp;

***How does it work?***

&amp;nbsp;

With the beauty of smart contracts, you no longer have to share your API keys with anyone to take advantage of dollar cost averaging tools. The best way to see DCA Stack is simply as an account you manage and fund to automate your dollar cost averaging schedules. 

To get started, you will need to deposit two things, gas and the token you want to sell to DCA into your desired token. So if you wanted to DCA into ETH every day with 1 DAI for 30 days, you would:

1.  Deposit 30 DAI (1 DAI x 30 trades)
2.  Deposit gas to cover 30 trades
3.  Let DCAStack do the rest! 


Here's what the dashboard looks like with an active schedule: https://i.imgur.com/XXJO7pf.png

Your funds are always liquid, so there are no lockups of any kind and you are free to withdraw any and all funds at your discretion. 

And here's the ability to manage your funds: https://i.imgur.com/3VnzREt.png

&amp;nbsp;

***Note on Bugs :O***

&amp;nbsp;

There will be bugs and due to this simple fact, we have decided to launch on the goerli testnet to address them. With the community's help, we'd love to gather feedback and help resolve all of them so that we can launch a bug free version on a L2. 

Anyone who submits feedback that helps resolve a bug or a critical issue, will get free trading for when we decide to add a fee schedule (TBD). We'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, improvements and anything else you have for DCAStack so please chime in on discord :)",cryptocurrency,1665151733
investing,Yield differences in 4W T-bills?,"Hi, I am looking at the yields for two 4W T-bills on TreasuryDirect - 

1. Issued 10/4/22 Maturing 11/1/22 and has a high rate of 2.66%
2. Issuing 10/11/22 Maturing 11/8/22 and has a high rate of 2.92%

There is a difference of 26bps in such a short term T-bill and they’re only issued a week apart. What explains this and how should I think about it? I was under the impression that bond prices fall to match the yield (so the price of 1. Would fall till the yield was ~2.9% but that is not the case as per current prices). Additionally, why are they being issued at such different yields each week?

I’m trying to understand why the newer T-bill was issued at a larger discount one week later and whether the 11/8 expiry being after the next Fed meeting has anything to do with it. Additionally, why didn’t the 11/1 bill fall in value to match this? Thanks in advance!",finance,1665151760

Bitcoin,Episode 2: A history of other printers in our midst,"As  noted earlier, there's still lots of people arriving to bitcoin and may  not have a good understanding of all that's going on or has gone on.  Allow me to explain the wider crypto-space.

In  short, first there was bitcoin but it didn't stop there. People who  wanted to print their own money without all that difficulty of playing  by the bitcoin rules started some clone currencies. Some even tried to add a little value in making their competitor and printing their own money. But that was too much work to  need to put in to print money, so there was an explosion of new coins on existing chains. But even that wasn't enough money  printing for people so people invented trading tokens on chains to make it just super easy to print.  All of these are efforts to make something of value from nothing that people will trade like money. All are just more money printing. Everyone wants to print money, not just the central banks. Crypto is trying so,  so hard to print money.

The  difference, of course, is that bitcoin doesn't have an owner, doesn't  allow rollbacks, doesn't have pre-mining, doesn't allow changes in  monetary policy. All the NFTs and ICOs and altcoins and central banks do. So no one gets to print bitcoin and that's why isn't a good currency  and those others are not.

economy,September job gains affirm that the Fed has a long way to go in inflation fight,"September’s jobs report provided both assurance that the jobs market remains strong and that the Federal Reserve will have to do more to slow it down.

The [263,000 gain in nonfarm payrolls](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/07/jobs-report-september-2022.html) was just below analyst expectations and the slowest monthly gain in nearly a year and a half.

But a surprising drop in the unemployment late and another boost in worker wages sent a clear message to markets that more giant interest rate hikes are on the way.

“Low unemployment used to feel so good. Everybody who seems to want a job is getting a job,” said Ron Hetrick, senior economist at labor force data provider Lightcast. “But we’ve been getting into a situation where our low unemployment rate has absolutely been a significant driver of our inflation.”

Indeed, average hourly earnings rose 5% on a year-over-year basis in September, down slightly from the 5.2% pace in August but still indicative of an economy where the cost of living is surging. Hourly earnings rose 0.3% on a monthly basis, the same as in August.

investing,Is the Market hoping for Inflation Magic to happen?,"So this doesnt really make sense to me..

Market seems to be down, way down on ""surprise"" employment numbers today.??

The market seems incredibly bull thinking that the current US Inflation of 8.26% will drop to 2% in a matter of months? Or that just because of some labour data the fed wont hike?

Reminder, inflation only started to tick up in March 2021. Its been 1.5 years since then.

If history tells us, in the 70s and 80s, it took almost 10 YEARS from up to down peaks for inflation to get under control. They had to hike interest rates up to 20%+!!

You could argue we have more debt, but guess what we may only be able to hike to 5% due to US Debt.

Year and avg inflation that year.

1973 - 6.2%

1974 - 11%

1975 - 9.1%

1976 - 5.8%

1977 - 6.5%

1978 - 7.6%

1979 - 11.3%

1980 - 13.5%

1981 - 10.3%

1982 - 6.2%

1983 - 3.2%

1984 - 4.3%

So what the fed is trying to do, is do more with less.

Only hike up to maybe 5% and get inflation down from 8% to 2%.

if history tells us anything, its not going to be months, but years.

Fed should of starting hiking back in 2021, its way way too late..

Or if the fed doesnt hike, we all start protesting that Inflation ISNT transitory and wages hike up and inflation hikes up again and down the death spiral we go.

Some unions have already negotiated 5%+ raises and threatening job action for others... And no one is satisfied.

buckle up, i feel the ride is just starting.

personalfinance,Accepting a loan while a HELOC is in process,"Ok, so, as the title suggests I'm weighing my options. I recently purchased a home that needs some work and am trying to secure some extra funding. I got approved for a SoFi loan for $20k, but the interest rate is like 16% so I didn't accept the funds yet. Instead I reached out to my bank about a HELOC and got tentatively approved for $30k 

I don't know how long that process will be though, or if it will get approved in the end. So, I'm considering taking the $20k and then paying it off with the HELOC if it gets approved. But If I take the SoFi loan do you think my bank will reject the HELOC? 

Thanks in advance! Let me know if anything needs clarified

Edit: the SoFi loan is 100% approved, I just have to sign for it",finance,1665171128
personalfinance,To overpay on mortgage or not?,I have a 1.6% fix mortgage for the next 3 years. I have read it’s better to save in higher interest rate accounts than overpay the mortgage now that interest rates will be increasing. I have about £500k left on the mortgage. I would like to pay it off early but not sure whether saving now then waiting till higher interest rates then overpaying makes sense? (I know overpaying more than 10% carries fees),finance,1665172199

I just found it because I completely forgot about it and while the check is still good, I missed the 60 day mark to roll it over. (I am stupid I know!)

I called my new 401k provider as they were under the impression that I was still within the 60 days but I was not. We went ahead and I opened up an IRA with them anyways. The rep suggested I talk to a tax rep to see what to do with the check since it is 60 days over and he himself was not too sure and couldn’t give me any advice. He said if anything I can deposit it as a contribution instead of a rollover into the IRA.

I am pretty uneducated when it comes to taxes/401k,rollovers,etc. It all sounds pretty alien to me but I try my best to understand.  I am trying to look it up and all I see is info about paying a 10% penalty and whatnot. I just want someone who is more familiar with this than me to give me some advice on what I should do! For more info, the check looks like it already had fed taxes taken out and the check is made out to myself only. Any advice? Im sweating here! Dont wanna mess with the IRA! (Also the check is only around $100) Do i just mention this when it comes tax time? Thank you in advance",finance,1665173389

At the new job, I get paid 26 times a year (every 2 weeks) vs 24 times a year (2x a month) at the old job. I understand that makes a difference in my take home since it's more spread out, but why would the Fed and State taxes be higher when the taxable wages are the same?

personalfinance,Advice on land purchase,"I’m looking for some advice regarding a land purchase. I’ll put in as many details as possible (and a tl;dr- sorry for the novel below). We are honestly just hoping for some perspective on whether this is a sound investment or wildly impractical.

TL;DR: My husband and I are looking to purchase a $70k 5-acre lot of improved land that borders our current home. Our combined income is 147k/yr, our current monthly mortgage payment is $1508. We own 2 vehicles (no car payment) and have high levels of job security. Our only debt beyond our mortgage is $9,570 with 0% interest (we purchased a new HVAC for our home). 

Our main motivation for purchasing the land is to maintain the privacy around our home. We love where we live, and see ourselves here long term (we are in our mid-30s). Our home is on 5 acres of wooded land in a beautiful part of the county and purchasing the neighboring lot would ensure that we retain what we have currently. If someone built on the land next to us, it would greatly diminish our enjoyment and satisfaction.

Finances: 

According to Redfin, etc. our home is currently worth $450,789 (I know those aren’t super accurate; however, the market has changed so much since we purchased in 2000).

We owe $258,580 on our mortgage, with an interest rate of 3.125%.

Rough estimate of equity is $192,209, with LTV being 43%. 

We have $40k in cash savings, $50k in stocks, and $300k+ in 401k/retirement accounts.

Is this a sound investment? Why or why not? And if you think we should go for it, what’s the best approach? Land loan, home equity loan, or paying cash? Seller financing is not an option.

personalfinance,"26 y/o, seeking advice on purchasing a house","Hey all, 

I've recently gotten a nice job with a Fortune 50 tech company and was looking at the idea of purchasing a house within the next year (hopefully..) for personal reasons with family roommates and pressure from parents. However, with the prices of ideal houses within 20 miles of my office, I wouldn't be able to get 15-20% down on a decent home. I have a partner of 7 years that is willing to help, but for now I'm trying to plan as if I'm the sole owner since we aren't married and charge rent.

My financial situation: 

* 770 credit score
* 190k gross salary
* 40k savings
* Only loan is a recent 29k car loan - $850/mo with insurance
* $250/mo rent
* Spending habits average 1-2k a month (cutting this down lately)
* Maxing 401(k), HSA, ROTH IRA. 13% @ 50% match
* Maxing out Employee stock purchase @ 15% (10% discount) 
* Carried over 10k of capital losses from the last few years (No longer personally investing..)

The low of houses that wouldn't have a ton of hidden costs in my area are roughly 700k+. 

I was thinking either:

* Cut back on either ROTH/ESPP/401k (unsure which one..) to get closer to 20% 
   * Thoughts: projected monthly retirement sounds like way too much
* Stay as-is with probably a 10% down payment
   * Thoughts: Discounted stock beats high interest rates + PMI
* Find a lower cost home (probably condo/townhome) that I can rent out when I decide to upgrade
   * Haven't explored much. But worried on the timeline as a single-family home would be ideal for starting a family in the near future. For anyone that has done this. How long did you stay at this home before transitioning out?

Given this, what are some thoughts or advice you all have? I'm open to all suggestions to maximize my  future. Thanks!",finance,1665181657

personalfinance,best easy to pay for a pole barn,My partner and I bought our dream house this year on a big piece of property in the country. We want to have a pole barn put up sometime in the next year but not sure of the best way to pay for it. We just moved into our current home in May. It appraised at about $405k which is about $10k more than we paid for it. The quotes we've gotten for the barn including materials and labor have been coming in around $35k. We have a bit more than that in the bank from the proceeds of our previous home's sale. I'm reluctant to put all of our cash on hand into this project. I like knowing that we have a nest egg in case any major life events or maintenance is needed on our home. My partner suggested we could use half of our cash on the barn and he can put the rest on his credit card. We both have excellent credit (750-850 range). My concern is the high interest rate he would have to pay on the card. I'm thinking it might make more sense to take out a home equity loan or to get a low interest loan from a credit union. This is the first big renovation type expense we've ever had so I'm not sure which option makes the most sense fiscally. Thanks in advance for your suggestions!,finance,1665184435
personalfinance,Advice on used car purchase,"I would appreciate any advice on buying a car! I currently have a 2009 sonata that passed 100k miles and I'd like to sell it and get a used 2017-2021 Dodge Charger RT. Price for the car is about $22k-$28k depending on mileage and I'm thinking I could sell my current car third party for around $6-8k. My expenses are as follows:

Age: 24

Salary: $63k/year

Credit score: 770 with about 4.5 years history

Current emergency fund: $9.5k

Roth IRA balance: $25k   (started maxing out annually since I turned 20)

Student loans: Will have $8k left at 3% interest after the Biden plan goes through (no other debt)

Rent: $720/month (approx $850 with utilities)

Car insurance: $180/month

Food: About $200-300/month

Misc stuff: Prob about $200-300/month

So my net salary per month after taxes are taken out is at about $4100 - my expenses = about $2500 left over. The car payment I'm looking at is prob around $500/month over 4 years with interest rate about 4-5% including a $2000 down payment. Is this doable or am I going into a bad financial decision?

If we assume inflation does trend back to the Fed's 2% target over the next couple of years, what secular inflationary pressures are there in the US economy that would allow for rates to remain this ""high"" without disinflation occurring?

My understanding is that long-run inflationary pressures depend largely on the rate of economic growth. This is why over the last several decades they have slowly trended down as trend growth in the West has slowed.

Is this theory incorrect, or are there reasons to believe economic growth will be higher this decade than post-GFC, and therefore we require higher rates? Given that economic growth is basically, population \* productivity, it's hard for me to see how this decade will have higher inflationary pressures than the last.

It seems to me the US is much more likely to trend towards Japan, with secularly lower growth and lower inflationary pressures?",finance,1665194633
personalfinance,"17k in old pension account, not sure what to do with it","I have 17k in a pension account from an old job in a state I do not plan to return to.

I’m in my mid 30s so I have plenty of working years left. My wife and I both work and have decent retirement from our current jobs.

My options are:
1) Transfer to IRA account and let it grow over time. Take out a HELOC to make repairs on the house. Interest rates are not great right now, and my credit is excellent but my wife’s is just ok due to her not really having much credit history. 

2) withdraw it, take the 20% tax hit, and pay off our credit card debt ($5k) and use the rest to fix up the house.

devops,Is devops-guy the next generation of anykey-guy?,"N.B. This post is about 'devops-guy' job, not about 'devops syntergy bla-bla-bla', and it's not about deveopers with ssh access to production.

My first job was 'system administrator assistant', which is the person to crawl under table to fix cables, to replace cartridges, to help with 'odd windows', etc. They called this job 'anykey'. Person to come and to help user react properly on message 'Press any key to continue'.

20 years later, I'm venerable devops guy shoveling yamls like pro.

There is hype, and aura of decent money, few offers from HRs, etc, etc.

But! Recently someone said that 'devops is anykey'. And it start to crawl in my mind. I see all symptoms for 'anykey'.

1. Called when 'something is oddly broken' in CI/CD
2. Not participating in core company activity (there are programmers who are dedicated to that)
3. Tasked with half-routine half-creativity thing 'make this work'.
4. There are other people on the team with not-the-less qualification but with 'other goals', so 'devops-guy' is hired for reducing routine stress for other personnel, not for they unique skills.
5. Invent specific rules to enforce and acts as a 'enforcing proxy' for others (no, you can't do `latest` on production), which are important, but trivial.
6. Always works on verge of incompetence. Are you really know `npm`, `maven`, `cargo`, `mezon`, `poetry`, `dh_python`, `opam`, `cabal`? Really-really? Do you even knows all programming languages they use?
7. Invent small-scale automation to solve local problems (yes, I wrote automated print-server enrollment script in 2004, I just finished writing workflow generator...)
8. Extensive vendor knowledge for AWS/GCP/Azure is as important as knowing about 'Federated forest of domain trees' in AD. Super-duper important until no one need it anymore.
9. (by /u/like-my-comment). There is no subject anykey may not know. From SQL to cisco configs. Same for DevOps. It must know everything!

The more I write those, the more I believe it's true. It's well-paid now (but not much as some solidity-geek), but its rapidly been get fixed by the industry. I feel that the whole 'devops guy' thing is industry reaction on imperfections of the existing tooling. Tooling get better, devops-guys get less of importance. It required a skilled 'anykey' to install workstation in 2002, now people don't understand 'skilled' part, because ""it's just works"", and ""everyone knows how to connect to wifi nowaday"".

So, I don't see any sings of obsoleting in next 5 years, but  I'm pretty sure, that 10+ is going to be very much different.",technology,1665219692

I'm all set to marry a Hong Kong-born Australian and I feel content here and might want to stick around for the next 30 years or so before decamping somewhere else with my partner for retirement. 

Homes here average around US$1m for a 2-bedroom 400sq feet (37 sqm) apartment. It might just be enough for me and my partner and a kid. 

Here are my assets, income streams and liabilities: 

Age - 34 (no debt, no medical conditions) 

 | Asset | Liability | Description
---|---|---|----
 | $49,200 p.a |  | Salary (my partner earns 10% more)

 |$2,820 p.a |   | MPF/pension fund matched by employer (I can increase this by $7,600 every year to reduce my tax liability)

 | $57,888 |   | Insurance-linked investment plans in rupees that will mature and be valued US$86,500 in 2031 (but likely to be lower due to depreciation) 

 | $6,000 |  | Indian mutual fund that's grown to $11,000 as of Sept 2022

 | $6,000 |   | US ETFs invested earlier in the year (80/20 in VTI/VXUS) that are down by 27% this year but I intend to continue investing US$1k per month for 20 years. Assuming an annual return of 5%, I'm hoping to at least cash out with $800,000 in 2052 for my retirement

 | $22,900 |  | Cash in bank account

 | $12,700 |  | Loan to a local business 

 | $48,000 |  | Last valuation of 2br home I stand to inherit in my hometown (probably only available 20 years from now and will likely be worthless)

 | | $16,800 p.a. | Rent (likely to shoot up with a kid to $30,000 per year in a couple of years)

 | | $1,000 p.a | Life insurance and critical illness insurance

 | | $24,000 p.a. | Estimate for annual lifestyle expenses (food, drinks, travel, digital subscriptions)

 | | $2,200 p.a. | Tax

Total estimate by 2032 |  $670,000 (5% RoI) |  $501,600 | $168,400 (available for downpayment)

According to this [Rent vs. Buy Calculator](https://imgur.com/a/WLe2ofe), I shouldn't bother (altho the mortgage rates are much [lower] (https://imgur.com/a/JljYNsQ) here than in the US). My mortgage would be US$3,800 per month or nearly 82% of my salary if I pay it off alone. However, it is tempting. I'm sure my partner would be interested in having a place of her own in the place she grew up and would help pay off the mortgage. 

My big concern is that I may struggle to hold down a job for 20 years so my partner might end up footing the bill after a decade (she's in teaching and it's quite stable). She's okay with that. What do you guys think? I'd love your thoughts. Been thinking a lot about it. 

The alternative is to rent for 20 years and  buy a bunch of rental real estate properties in India (Bangalore) and flipping them ten years from now (US$1700 per month for 3 apartments between me and my sis with 80% of mortgage covered by rent with cousins looking after it) and investing US$1k for 20 years in VTI/VXUS (80:20).",finance,1665229645

personalfinance,Car needs work. Should I sell it or trade it in?,"In 2017 I purchased a 2016 Chevy Equinox with 25k miles, upgrading from my perfectly-fine Honda Accord to support some lifestyle changes (kayaks, skis, dog, future kids.) I hoped the vehicle would last a very long time as I generally take care of my vehicles, but also don't care about having a *nice* car but rather as a way to get from Point A to Point B. I paid off the loan early.

However, as soon as the Chevy hit 50k miles, I have had one issue after another, and now, at 67k miles, I am done with it. It needs $2,500 of work to *maybe* fix the problem or $4,800 to *probably* fix the problem. The KBB on the Equinox is around $10k-$12k, so I'm not interested in spending half of that on a repair. The warranty expired at 60k miles. I clearly bought a lemon and I want out. 

The dealer is doing enough work to make it safe to drive for now, but I'm looking at it as a ticking time bomb. I know the best resale value is found in the personal sale market, but I'm not willing ethically to sell the car to an individual knowing there are issues with the car. I'm more comfortable selling it to a dealership where they have mechanics on staff who could fix it and then provide their own warranty to whoever buys it next.

What are my best options here?

I WFH, so I have considered selling the car to a Carvana/Carmax type place and trying to survive as a 1 car family for several months, as I've heard the car market is still pretty brutal. If it's stabilizing, would the spring be any better? 

What are vehicle interest rates like on new/used cars for an 800 credit score? My DTI is high since the mortgage is only in my name - would having my wife (750 credit score) co-signing on a loan help significantly with that?

I've never bought a new car before, but I'm actually considering it if the prices are still somewhat upside-down. I'm also exhausted by having my car in and out of the shop. Am I crazy?

Our budget is pretty tight, but I could make room for a car payment of up to ~$500. I'll have more flexibility in 6 months as I'll be getting a small pay bump in the new year + will likely be looking for new jobs in my field.

TLDR - car needs work equal to 50% of it's value, and I'm frustrated and want out. Am I gaining anything by selling it now and then buying in 6 months? Or am I overthinking it and should just trade it in now?",finance,1665232227

# **Dow drops 600 points, Nasdaq closes 3% lower as rates pop after September jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks fell Friday as traders evaluated September’s jobs report, which showed the unemployment rate continuing to decline and sparked an increase in interest rates.
 *****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 630.15 points, or 2.1%, to 29,296.79. The S&amp;P 500 lost 2.8% to 3,639.66. The Nasdaq Composite slid 3.8% to 10,652.41, which is less than 1% above its low of the year.
*****
&gt; Friday’s losses trimmed the gains for what started out as a big comeback week for stocks. The major averages still ended the week higher but gave back most of the gains from the rally that kicked it off. The Dow rose 2% for the week, while the S&amp;P added 1.5%. The Nasdaq eked out a 0.7% gain.
*****
&gt; The U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in September, slightly below a Dow Jones estimate of 275,000, the government said Friday. However, the unemployment rate came in at 3.5%, down from the 3.7% in the previous month in a sign that the jobs picture continues to strengthen even as the Federal Reserve tries to slow the economy with rate hikes to stem inflation.
*****
&gt; 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the S&amp;P 500 this week
*****
&gt; “While the data was about as expected, the drop in the unemployment rate is seemingly what the markets are obsessed with because of what it means for the Fed,” said Bleakley Financial chief investment officer Peter Boockvar. “When combined with the low level of initial jobless claims, the pace of firing’s remains muted and this of course gets the Fed all fired up about continuing with its aggressive rate hikes.”
*****
&gt; The falling unemployment rate sparked a jump in rates, in turn weighing on stocks. The 2-year year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 4.316%. (1 basis point equals 0.01%.)
*****
&gt; Advanced Micro Devices’ stock tumbled after the chipmaker warned its third-quarter revenue would be lower than anticipated. Levi Strauss shares slipped following a cut to the company’s guidance.
*****
&gt; “The conclusion many we have spoken with have reached is that not only will the Fed not help markets, but in their dogged pursuit of price stability keep going until something breaks in the capital markets,” said Christopher Harvey, an equity analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. “What appears to be their increasingly singular focus — price stability — will likely help catalyze the dislocation.”

&gt; # 7 Things to Know About The Historically Strong Fourth Quarter

&gt; “You make most of your money in a bear market, you just don’t realize it at the time.” Shelby Cullom Davis

&gt; We all blinked, and it is now October, which could be good if you are hoping for higher stock prices. But, as this great quote by Shelby Cullom Davis explains, people’s decisions in a bear market will significantly impact their investments down the road.

&gt; Are you going to sell now that stocks are firmly in a bear market? Many investors have done that over the years and missed out on massive rallies as stocks eventually returned to new highs. This year hasn’t been fun at all for investors, but better times could be coming, and making a rash decision now could greatly impact your investments years from now.

&gt; To help with this, today we’ll take a closer look at the fourth quarter and show why a potential year-end rally (and maybe more) could be likely.

&gt; First, the fourth quarter is historically the best quarter of the year, with the S&amp;P 500 up 4.1% on average and nearly 80% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image001-800x409.png))**

&gt; Second, this is a midterm year, and the good news is that market gains during these years are backloaded. In fact, October is the best month of a midterm year, followed by the second best month in November and the third best in December.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image002-800x338.png))**

&gt; Third, here’s a chart we’ve shared a lot lately, but we’ll do it again, as it is very powerful. Midterm years tend to see weak stock returns in the first three quarters (check for 2022), but the fourth quarter of a midterm is the second-best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle. The best quarter and third best quarter are right around the corner early next year. As bad as things have been this year, the calendar is currently a major tailwind.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image003-800x302.png))**

&gt; Fourth, the fourth quarter has historically done even better when September is down big. Given this year saw one of the worst Septembers ever for stocks, this could be another clue a bounce back is possible. To quote Lloyd Christmas, “So you’re telling me there’s a chance!”

&gt; Fifth, this was the third worst start to a year ever for the S&amp;P 500. Well, the good news is looking at the ten worst starts ever to a year saw the fourth quarter higher nine times. Only in 2008 was it red; fortunately, we don’t think we are in that environment. Going out a year, the S&amp;P 500 was up eight times and higher, a median of 25.5%.

&gt; Sixth, the S&amp;P 500 bear market cracked down 25% last week. As bad as that feels to investors, the stock market doesn’t care about what just happened and only cares about what is next. The good news is once a bear market is down 25%, the returns going out can be quite strong, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 23% on average a year later. Additionally, many lows took place soon after this milestone was hit, so a major low could be near. Yes, the ’73/’74 recession, tech bubble, and financial crisis all saw more weakness (and in some cases for a long time), but we don’t see an economy nearly as weak as those times. Therefore, we think this time will play out like the others, and stronger returns could be quite likely.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image016-800x501.png))**

&gt; Here’s another way of showing the study above. As you can see, many times once the S&amp;P 500 was down 25%, it was quite near a major low.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image010-800x383.png))**

&gt; Seventh and lastly, October is known as a bear market killer. Remember, this year was the worst start to a year since 1974 and 2002. Below we show how bear markets tend to bottom in October, and sure enough, both of those vicious bears ended in October. The ’73/’74 bear ended on October 3, while the tech bubble bear market bottomed on October 9.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image017-800x582.png))**

&gt; Investors are worried, and we understand those feelings here at the Carson Investment Research team. Could stocks bottom and rally? We think there’s an above-average chance. And a chance is all we need, as Lloyd Christmas would say.

&gt; # Bears Remain Above 50%

&gt; The past week's rebound in equity prices has bolstered sentiment a bit as the latest AAII survey showed an increase in bullishness. For the second week in a row, bullish sentiment rose week over week to come in at 23.9%. That is, of course, still below the reading of 26.1% only three weeks ago and even further depressed relative to the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The pickup in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears. After two consecutive weeks of readings above 60% (the first such occurrence in the history of the survey), bearish sentiment has turned lower falling to 54.8%. As with bullish sentiment, that marks some improvement, but much more progress would need to be made to bring bearish sentiment back in line with the historical average of 30.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Although the streak of readings above 60% is over, more than half of the respondents remain bearish. As shown below, that has grown to be the longest streak of such readings since the depths of the COVID Crash. Prior to that, there have only been six other such streaks: four occurring between 2008 and 2009 and the others occurring in August and October of 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-2a.png))**

&gt; With both bullish and bearish sentiment improving, the bull-bear spread has risen up to -30.9 after hitting the lowest level since 2009 only two weeks ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; Again, in spite of any improvement, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bears as it has for more than half a year. As shown below, the bull-bear spread has remained negative for 27 weeks in a row. That is the second-longest streak of negative readings on record but would need to continue for another two months to surpass the 2020 record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-3a.png))**

&gt; Not all of the losses to bearish sentiment went to bulls. Neutral sentiment also rebounded slightly rising from sub-20% (the lowest level since April 2020) to 21.3%.

&gt; The market may not be down during the Sell Rosh Hashanah/Buy Yom Kippur period which ends today on Yom Kippur 2022. But it sure was a wild ride. Most importantly it lines up perfectly with our Almanac Aggregate Cycle. Back in mid-August this Aggregate Cycle called the end of the summer rally and now it’s pointing to a big move higher.

&gt; You can check the full stats Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur, Sell Passover in our September 23 post, but here’s a reminder of the awesome history of rallies from midterm year Yom Kippur to pre-election Passover. DJIA p 10 of 12, average gain 12.0%.

&gt; # Big Bounce in Claims...Or Is It?

&gt; Following a few months of downward trending initial jobless claims bringing the indicator back down around multi-decade lows, there has finally been a significant uptick. Whereas last week's reading was revised lower to an even more impressive 190K (the lowest since April), the latest print soared 29K to 219K. That is only the highest level since the end of August, but it also is back in the range of pre-pandemic readings while also marking the largest week over week increase in claims since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose as might have been expected for the current week of the year. As shown in the second chart below, as far as consistency of week-over-week increases go, the current week of the year is tied with the 2nd and 45th (approximately the weeks of January 8th and November 5th) for fourth as claims have risen 85.5% of the time since 1967. Additionally, before seasonal adjustment, it was not a particularly large increase as the 13.3K WoW rise was half of the average for the comparable week of the year. Even after that increase, unadjusted claims have only been lower during the year's comparable week twice: 1968 and 1969. In other words, a drift higher in claims is normal at this point of the year, and even with that move higher, claims remain nothing short of impressive.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims which are lagged an additional week to the initial claims number, the latest week saw a modest increase of 15K to 1.361 million. That snapped a streak of four consecutive weeks of declines. Whereas seasonally adjusted initial claims have risen back into the pre-pandemic range, continuing claims have only experienced a modest move higher and are well below their own levels from pre-pandemic years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; In the past few months, we have consistently checked in on the ratio of initial jobless claims to continuing claims (both seasonally adjusted) as a measure of the lack of follow-through of the former to the latter. With last week's very strong initial claims number that was more reflective of the still strong continuing claims number, that ratio has now come back in line with the historical average.

&gt; # Market Rebounds 28.2% After Midterm Year Down YTD Q3

&gt; S&amp;P 500 closed September down -24.8% year-to-date – the 4th worst YTD Q3 performance since 1930. Since WWII (1946) when S&amp;P 500 was down YTD at the end of Q3 in midterm year it gained 28.2% on average over the next 5 quarters with no losses.

&gt; In all 23 years the following Q4 was up 69.6 % of the time for an average gain of 3.1%. Subsequent Q1s were up only 52.2% of the time for an average gain of 2.7%. The following Q2s gained ground 65.2% of the time for an average gain of 2.9% and then next years were up 73.9% of the time for an average gain of 11.9%.

&gt; But the record for midterm years down at the end of Q3 is better. Of those nine midterm years highlighted in blue in the table only 1946 into 1947 had no bounce with 1947 closing exactly at the same price as 1946 for S&amp;P. Overall, Q4s were up 88.9% of the time, average gain 7.6%, Q1s up 77.8% of the time, average gain 6.7%, Q2 up 77.8% of the time, average gain 4.6% and next years up 88.9% of the time, average gain 19.2%.

&gt; So, while things look grim out there on Wall Street, economically and globally, odds are we are nearing a bottom and the prospects for Q4 and next year are encouraging, at least historically, seasonally and 4-year cycle-wise. But there is still a lot that needs to go right, and the market likely has further downside left.

Next week all that matters will be inflation data. As long as the federal reserves keeps raising rates no market rally will be sustainable. Is really that simple. No one in the federal reserves has stated any dovish view. Inflation will be tamed even if it takes a recession. Note that market has not priced in a recession.

personalfinance,Buy now or wait — interest rates mean my monthly mortgage payment would be much higher though I can technically still afford it,"I have been searching for a home for about a year. I put in several offers earlier this year and got outbid given the crazy market at the time. I have been looking at homes with a list price up to $1 million. I live in a very high cost of living area. With the higher interest rates the monthly mortgage payment on a $1 million house would be over $6,000, much higher than when I first started looking—it was $4-5k something (I don’t remember exact number). In theory, I could afford the monthly payment as it is less than 1/3 of my gross monthly income but it feels insane to pay that much. I have some savings but would like to build more as I don’t want to have to work for the rest of my life. Obviously nobody knows when/if rates will go down but should I still try to buy or wait? For reference, I am currently renting a condo and my rent is $2200 (very good for this area as rents are typically much higher, but I am lucky because I have been here for awhile).",finance,1665244806
personalfinance,Is paying off my car a good idea?,"I have a remaining balance of $6.5k on my 2018 Honda Accord, that has a 2.9% interest loan on it. The monthly payments are roughly $400. I could technically pay it off today. It would deplete a good amount of my cash savings, but I could do it without putting myself in trouble. I'm debating if it is worth it,

My SoFi bank account where the money is current has a 2.5% rate, and if the news is right, the Fed will raise rates again this year, and SoFi has been very good about raising their rates on savings accounts. The difference between the loan and savings interest isn't that far apart. I think normally the smart advice would be ""pay off the car"" because it is costing me more than the deprecating value of my cash, but we live in interesting times right now. 

Because the used car market is also nuts right now, I can possibly get between $19k and $20k for my trade in (according to Kelley, which I know isn't gospel.) That means if I was to trade it in for a 2023 model, I might end up only having to take out a $8k-$10k loan. Even if the rate is 4%, that's not a lot.

I drive the piss out of my cars (about 78k on it right now) so getting a brand new one with a new warranty always sounds appealing to me. Plus...you know...new car. 

I don't have a lot of credit card debt and my mortgage is very manageable. These aren't weighing heavily on my monthly budget.

Am I looking at this the right way? Should I pay off the car with looking towards getting a new one in maybe the next 6 months? Should I just leave it alone and keep doing my monthly payments until 2024?

Thanks in advance.",finance,1665245383
stocks,FTC Pares Back Lawsuit Targeting Meta Platforms’ Bid for Virtual-Reality Company,"Federal antitrust authorities on Friday pared back their lawsuit seeking to block Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.’s [META -4.04%▼](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/META?mod=chiclets) purchase of a company that has a leading position in the market for virtual-reality fitness apps.

The move drops some claims the Federal Trade Commission made in July when it sought to stop Meta’s acquisition of Within Unlimited Inc., creator of the virtual-reality fitness game Supernatural. The FTC said the deal would stifle competition in the market for virtual-reality fitness applications and impede potential future competition as well.

The FTC’s original case argued that Meta’s own product, a game called Beat Saber, competed directly against Within’s popular Supernatural app. The deal was part of a pattern, the FTC said, of Meta buying studios that produce virtual-reality apps sold through Meta’s Quest Store. The original complaint also named Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg as a defendant in the case.

The FTC dismissed the claims against Mr. Zuckerberg in August. It now has also backed away from alleging the deal would undermine existing competition between Meta and Within, according to a court filing made public Friday. That eliminates one avenue for blocking the deal.

The move appears to conform with some of Meta’s criticism of the FTC’s case. Meta had said that Beat Saber, a music-and-rhythm game, isn’t targeted at fitness users. Supernatural, on the other hand, is a dedicated exercise service offering 800 virtual-reality workouts featuring trainers, music and settings such as the Galápagos Islands and the Great Wall of China.

Meta said Friday that the FTC’s lawsuit is still built “on ideology, not evidence.”

“What remains of the FTC’s case are speculative claims that continue to lack support in either the facts or the law,” a Meta spokesman said.

The FTC has the authority to challenge mergers that would substantially reduce competition or tend to create a monopoly. It argues the deal is still illegal because it would remove the benefits of potential competition. That is a less common argument for the government to challenge a merger or acquisition as anticompetitive.

The theory turns on the idea that Meta’s potential entry into the market for virtual-reality fitness apps spurs Within and others to compete harder to retain customers and improve their products. It also suggests that Meta, if it developed its own fitness app, could improve choices for consumers. That would enhance competition, while conversely the decision to buy Within would do the opposite, the FTC argued.

“The acquisition would eliminate that incentive for market participants to compete…in contravention of the antitrust laws,” the FTC argues in its amended complaint.

The FTC’s new complaint was filed in a federal lawsuit that seeks to pause the deal while it litigates whether the deal should be permanently blocked in its administrative court.

The FTC is already litigating with Meta’s Facebook unit over claims that the company has abused a monopoly position in social media. The agency’s lawsuit in that case seeks to unwind its acquisition of messaging platform WhatsApp and image-sharing app Instagram.

In the latest complaint against Meta, over the Within acquisition, the FTC alleges the company now wants to build, and ultimately control, a virtual-reality metaverse. The FTC says virtual-reality industry sales are projected to more than double from $5 billion in 2021 to more than $12 billion in 2024. Meta in 2021 shipped 78% of all VR headsets sold worldwide and distributes many apps through its online Quest Store, the FTC said in court filings.

bonds,Bonds or Cash,"Hi,

I have placed a call deposit with my bank on a weekly rollover basis with a yield of 2.6%. There is no tax on this (I don’t live in the US). 

I was wondering if I should put this in a short duration bond ETF like SHV, SGOV, or FLOT. But what do I look at - the 30 day SEC yield or the Average YTM? Seems the yield is better. 

Only problems are that I have to pay 0.15% brokerage for buying or selling and not sure if ETF distributions are subject to 30% withholding tax for foreigners (that’s what is deducted for equity dividends). Not sure if there are ucits version of these ETFs. 

So given the above is it better to stick with the bank call deposit or shift to an ETF?

My goal is to maximise my after tax yield and then when interest rates peak, switch to a long duration fund. Is this a good strategy given where we are with interest rates?

Thanks.",finance,1665246519

personalfinance,TIPS vs I Bonds - Which is better?,"Hello all,

Recently I read an article in the Wall Street Journal titled ""Why Are My Inflation-Protected Bonds Falling When Inflation Is So High?"" (paywall)  Some highlights:

&gt;Through Thursday, inflation-protected bonds tracked by ICE had lost 13.2% this year, including price changes and interest payments. The comparable loss for ICE’s index of regular Treasury bonds was 13.5%.

&gt;Holding a TIPS to maturity still ensures that inflation won’t reduce the purchasing power of your initial investment (more on this in a moment). But meanwhile, falling market prices are vexing investors who were counting on TIPS to cushion their portfolios. 

&gt;“These are some of the most pressing questions we get: Why the heck are my TIPS down when inflation is so high?” said Collin Martin, a fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.

&gt;The government sells TIPS that mature in five, 10 or 30 years. Like Treasurys, TIPS pay interest twice a year—exempt from state and local taxes—at a rate locked in when the bond is issued.

&gt;The difference is that the face value of a TIPS adjusts to account for changes in the consumer-price index. That means interest payments rise with inflation, and so does the amount you get back when the bond matures.

&gt;***If withstanding inflation is your only goal, buying and holding a newly issued TIPS until it matures will get the job done.***

&gt;***The real yield on five-year TIPS is now about 1.8% a year—or about 9.3% total over five years. In effect, the Treasury is guaranteeing TIPS owners that their money will buy 9.3% more goods and services in 2027 than it can now, no matter what happens to inflation between now and then. (Federal taxes, to be sure, will eat some of those gains.)***

Note, I've never purchased TIPS individually before.  I have purchased the ETF TIP and immediately noticed it was not doing what I wanted to do and instead sold it and purchased a short-bond ETF.  I also maxed out I Bonds this year.

I want to focus on the bolded.  My understanding right now is that I Bonds are yielding a zero percent real rate of return, i.e. the interest they yield matches CPI and nothing more.  Individual TIPS on the other hand seem to actually give a real yield, i.e. a rate of return above CPI.

Thus my question - Why would someone purchase I Bonds with all the myriad complications if you can purchase an indivdual TIPS and get a superior return?

I understand secondary market conditions may mean you will lose money on TIPS if you sell before maturity...is there anything other than that?

Thank you.",finance,1665255603

investing,"""Health care is the best sector in Europe when the dollar is rising. A very simple trade but it always works.”","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-08/wall-street-is-missing-the-risk-to-stocks-if-inflation-is-beaten

Investors are primed for any bit of good news to help them forget a brutal quarter for stocks that took this year’s value destruction to $24 trillion. A resilient corporate earnings season might give them that.

The MSCI All-Country World Index just wrapped up its third straight quarter of declines, the first time that’s happened since the global financial crisis in 2008.

The 7% drop came as investors grappled with persistently high inflation, a surging dollar and jumbo interest-rate hikes across the world that threaten to choke economic growth. Alongside that, analysts have slashed profit estimates, and a chorus of US and European companies -- including car giant Ford Motor Co. -- has issued early warnings about third-quarter results. 
But one view is that this could set firms a lower bar to clear, and fuel a much-needed recovery in stocks that are currently at levels last seen nearly two years ago.

Can Stocks Avoid a Rare Fourth-Quarter Loss?

Stocks have posted 4Q declines only three times in the past 20 years.
“Investors have to ask themselves how much of the bad news has already been priced in,” said Ron Saba, senior portfolio manager at Horizon Investments LLC. “Given extreme pessimism combined with reasonable valuations, the fourth quarter could give investors an opportunity to claw back some of their losses.”

History is an imperfect guide, but past stock performance bodes well for the quarter. The S&amp;P 500 gained an average 4.1% in the final quarter during the past 20 years, while the MSCI has posted a fourth-quarter decline only three times over that period.

That’s not to say companies will get through the season with glowing report cards. There’s still plenty of hurdles that could cement 2022’s reputation as a year to forget.

For one, the era of higher costs is making it difficult to defend profitability. Firms also face tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and others as central banks keep a laser focus on taming inflation. On top of that, there’s the war in Ukraine, a severe energy crisis in Europe, and economically damaging Covid restrictions in China.

Dollar Effect

US companies with a large international exposure are at risk from a stronger dollar, as underscored by Nike Inc.’s disappointing earnings report on Thursday. 
European and UK importers, on the other hand, are dealing with much weaker currencies. UK conglomerate Associated British Foods Plc and Swedish fashion retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB both blamed the greenback for a bleaker profit outlook.
But the scale of recent analyst downgrades, as well as the market reaction to the early announcers, suggest that “some disappointments are already expected and possibly even priced in to some extent,” said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at Flowbank SA.

FedEx Corp.’s withdrawal of its full-year guidance last month sparked the biggest selloff in its shares in more than four decades. Used-car dealer CarMax Inc. sank 25% after a glum quarterly report.
A Citigroup Inc. index shows US earnings downgrades have consistently outnumbered upgrades since early June, while global 12-month forward earnings have been revised down every month in the last quarter. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Stoxx 600 are in bear markets -- defined as a drop of 20% or more from recent highs.

Global stocks' forward earnings have been cut through the third quarter

The big question in the lead-up to the next earnings season is whether this will be enough. Strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. have warned that estimates are still too high and that “we’re going to see pretty substantial reductions for 2023.”
Yet, others see reason to believe earnings can hold up for a while longer. 

“Just looking at the resilience of the US economy, there’s little to suggest that earnings would be struggling at this stage,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “We’re looking out for the guidance, mentions of margin concerns, wage costs, etc. but we wouldn’t expect that to show through at least until about the first quarter of next year.”

Bloomberg Intelligence analysts expect S&amp;P 500 earnings to have risen 2.9% in the quarter, helped mainly by the energy sector. Gina Martin Adams, BI chief equity strategist, said the absence of “economic excesses” -- such as the indebtedness seen before the 2008 recession -- could insulate US demand from a severe decline.
Energy Boost

And while European importers are smarting from a weaker euro, exporters are benefiting. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi said it expects a positive currency impact of about 10% in the quarter.
“Health care is the best sector in Europe when the dollar is rising,” said Manish Kabra, head of US equity strategy at Societe Generale SA. “A very simple trade but it always works.”

Even Morgan Stanley’s Michael J. Wilson -- a stalwart equity bear -- said US stocks are in the “final stages” of a bear market and could stage a rally near term. True to form, however, he expects the selloff to resume thereafter.
The decidedly negative investor mood could also prove to be a contrarian indicator of a short-term bounce for stocks. 

Sanford C. Bernstein strategists say their custom sentiment gauge has triggered a buy signal, meaning a “bear market rally is very possible.”
US and European stocks both fell into oversold territory last month
Some technical levels suggest markets are lining up for a recovery into the end of the year. The relative strength indexes for the S&amp;P 500 and the Stoxx 600 are at “oversold” levels. That’s marked a short-term bottom in the past. 
“We have historically terrible sentiment, stocks are looking notably cheap, the VIX is spiking and the market is being indiscriminately sold,” said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs. Combined with seasonal tailwinds, all those factors “could lead to a year-end rally,” she said.",finance,1665258829
btc,Unchained Podcast Summary: What Does SBF Think About the Current Crypto Market?,"[Sam Bankman-Fried](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX) is the founder and CEO of [FTX](https://twitter.com/FTX_Official), a digital asset exchange.

In this episode of the [Unchained Podcast](https://twitter.com/Unchained_pod), he is being interviewed by [Laura Shin](https://twitter.com/laurashin), a journalist, and Unchained host. They touch on many topics, including stablecoins, the necessity of regulation, and even Sam’s political views.

Read our notes below to learn more.

# Thoughts on Crypto Markets

* BTC is going to be responsive to the general macro environment.
* Changes in interest rates are driving the market.
* Relative to stock markets crypto has stabilized.
* Regulatory environment clarity would have the biggest impact, particularly in the U.S.

# TradFi Markets

* Sam’s guess is that crypto and TradFi markets will evolve towards each other.
* Some of the most compelling applications in blockchain are in market structure.
* There is a limit on how much money retail is allowed to make with the current market structure.
* This can be fixed with clear, unambiguous settlement that’s fast and cheap, which blockchains provide.  


# Stablecoins

***Sam gives 4 categories of stablecoins:***

1. Fully backed stablecoins (e.g. USDC): A crash in these currencies shouldn’t happen.
2. Backed by debt instruments, but not exactly treasuries (e.g. USDT): In volatile times they might slightly drop. It’s a fine product but it should be disclosed that there is some risk.
3. Traditional algorithmic stablecoins (e.g. [Maker](https://twitter.com/MakerDAO) in the past): These are only somewhat stable. These should have very clear disclaimers of possible de-pegging.

# Thoughts on Institutional Leverage

* [Voyager](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/27/three-arrows-capital-crypto-hedge-fund-defaults-on-voyager-loan.html) is going through bankruptcy because of unpaid debt from Three Arrows Capital (3AC).
* 3AC took on that debt three weeks before its collapse.
* This is similar to 2008 when there were non-transparent systems, large leverage, etc.
* On-chain protocols don’t have this sort of problem because there’s transparency about borrowing and lending.
* There was more risk than Voyager’s customers understood, therefore, having disclosures, transparency, and more diligence is crucial.

# Risk Management

* [FTX](https://twitter.com/FTX_Official) team is working closely with [BlockFi ](https://twitter.com/BlockFi)team to understand what’s the best way to measure and manage risk.
* One thing would be to understand the nature of the counterparties, distributing the risk between many of them, taking actual collateral, and being careful about what that means.
* Being ready to margin-call people when necessary is important.

# Talks With Regulators

* It’s urgent to have a regulatory regime for crypto in the U.S.
* Some regulators do understand that the parts of the crypto world that get hurt are the parts that are least crypto-like (less transparency etc.).
* He is having a lot of discussions with lawmakers and his team wants to be helpful in any way they can.
* Lawmakers want straightforward constructive engagement.
* The priorities are stablecoin regulation, marketplace regulation, and token registration.

# Financial Regulation

* People get distracted by talking about more regulation vs less regulation, which is not the most important question.
* More important is the question of whether the regulation is fit for purpose.

# Decentralization vs Centralization

* FTX is a centralized company.
* The product they are building is a centralized product in a decentralized space.
* There are things that are more efficient if done by a centralized entity.
* However, [FTX](https://twitter.com/FTX_Official) is integrated with blockchain rails, with other centralized and decentralized players, and it is a part of the space.

# Alignment With the Democratic Party

* It’s policy, not politics that Sam cares about.
* No one issue is going to give a clear readout as to where Sam’s political affiliation lies.
* Crypto has been a somewhat bipartisan issue.
* Sam is looking for politicians who are doing good policy work in general, not specifically crypto-related.

# Alameda Research Concerns

* FTX has oversight and they are regulated in many jurisdictions.
* FTX marketplace is agnostic (they don’t care who sends an order apart from KYC).
* Sam is no longer working on [Alameda](https://twitter.com/AlamedaResearch), he doesn’t trade for it and is not involved in the day-to-day management.

# The Merge And BTC’s Narrative

* The merge happened in a very clean way which is impressive.
* BTC is the digital gold and it’s the most trusted and institutional, which is a different role from ETH’s core high trust smart contract blockchain role.
* BTC now is the only remaining major PoW coin.

# Macroeconomics

* FTX is keeping its reserves in cash.
* They want to be in a position where they can offer products that people want given the highly volatile and uncertain macro environment.

# What to Expect From FTX

* FTX is raising funds for deal-making.
* They are looking at companies that would make sense for them, including companies with in-depth regulatory know-how.
* They want to acquire great teams and businesses that have great user bases.
* FTX has a proposal to change the way derivatives are cleared which would make certain TradFi intermediaries obsolete.
* Working with Regulators to provide spot and futures from the FTX U.S. entity to Americans.

stocks,"""Health care is the best sector in Europe when the dollar is rising. A very simple trade but it always works.”","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-08/wall-street-is-missing-the-risk-to-stocks-if-inflation-is-beaten

Investors are primed for any bit of good news to help them forget a brutal quarter for stocks that took this year’s value destruction to $24 trillion. A resilient corporate earnings season might give them that.

The MSCI All-Country World Index just wrapped up its third straight quarter of declines, the first time that’s happened since the global financial crisis in 2008.

The 7% drop came as investors grappled with persistently high inflation, a surging dollar and jumbo interest-rate hikes across the world that threaten to choke economic growth. Alongside that, analysts have slashed profit estimates, and a chorus of US and European companies -- including car giant Ford Motor Co. -- has issued early warnings about third-quarter results. 
But one view is that this could set firms a lower bar to clear, and fuel a much-needed recovery in stocks that are currently at levels last seen nearly two years ago.

Can Stocks Avoid a Rare Fourth-Quarter Loss?

Stocks have posted 4Q declines only three times in the past 20 years.
“Investors have to ask themselves how much of the bad news has already been priced in,” said Ron Saba, senior portfolio manager at Horizon Investments LLC. “Given extreme pessimism combined with reasonable valuations, the fourth quarter could give investors an opportunity to claw back some of their losses.”

History is an imperfect guide, but past stock performance bodes well for the quarter. The S&amp;P 500 gained an average 4.1% in the final quarter during the past 20 years, while the MSCI has posted a fourth-quarter decline only three times over that period.

That’s not to say companies will get through the season with glowing report cards. There’s still plenty of hurdles that could cement 2022’s reputation as a year to forget.

For one, the era of higher costs is making it difficult to defend profitability. Firms also face tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and others as central banks keep a laser focus on taming inflation. On top of that, there’s the war in Ukraine, a severe energy crisis in Europe, and economically damaging Covid restrictions in China.

Dollar Effect

US companies with a large international exposure are at risk from a stronger dollar, as underscored by Nike Inc.’s disappointing earnings report on Thursday. 
European and UK importers, on the other hand, are dealing with much weaker currencies. UK conglomerate Associated British Foods Plc and Swedish fashion retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB both blamed the greenback for a bleaker profit outlook.
But the scale of recent analyst downgrades, as well as the market reaction to the early announcers, suggest that “some disappointments are already expected and possibly even priced in to some extent,” said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at Flowbank SA.

FedEx Corp.’s withdrawal of its full-year guidance last month sparked the biggest selloff in its shares in more than four decades. Used-car dealer CarMax Inc. sank 25% after a glum quarterly report.
A Citigroup Inc. index shows US earnings downgrades have consistently outnumbered upgrades since early June, while global 12-month forward earnings have been revised down every month in the last quarter. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Stoxx 600 are in bear markets -- defined as a drop of 20% or more from recent highs.

Global stocks' forward earnings have been cut through the third quarter

The big question in the lead-up to the next earnings season is whether this will be enough. Strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. have warned that estimates are still too high and that “we’re going to see pretty substantial reductions for 2023.”
Yet, others see reason to believe earnings can hold up for a while longer. 

“Just looking at the resilience of the US economy, there’s little to suggest that earnings would be struggling at this stage,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “We’re looking out for the guidance, mentions of margin concerns, wage costs, etc. but we wouldn’t expect that to show through at least until about the first quarter of next year.”

Bloomberg Intelligence analysts expect S&amp;P 500 earnings to have risen 2.9% in the quarter, helped mainly by the energy sector. Gina Martin Adams, BI chief equity strategist, said the absence of “economic excesses” -- such as the indebtedness seen before the 2008 recession -- could insulate US demand from a severe decline.
Energy Boost

And while European importers are smarting from a weaker euro, exporters are benefiting. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi said it expects a positive currency impact of about 10% in the quarter.
“Health care is the best sector in Europe when the dollar is rising,” said Manish Kabra, head of US equity strategy at Societe Generale SA. “A very simple trade but it always works.”

Even Morgan Stanley’s Michael J. Wilson -- a stalwart equity bear -- said US stocks are in the “final stages” of a bear market and could stage a rally near term. True to form, however, he expects the selloff to resume thereafter.
The decidedly negative investor mood could also prove to be a contrarian indicator of a short-term bounce for stocks. 

Sanford C. Bernstein strategists say their custom sentiment gauge has triggered a buy signal, meaning a “bear market rally is very possible.”
US and European stocks both fell into oversold territory last month
Some technical levels suggest markets are lining up for a recovery into the end of the year. The relative strength indexes for the S&amp;P 500 and the Stoxx 600 are at “oversold” levels. That’s marked a short-term bottom in the past. 
“We have historically terrible sentiment, stocks are looking notably cheap, the VIX is spiking and the market is being indiscriminately sold,” said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs. Combined with seasonal tailwinds, all those factors “could lead to a year-end rally,” she said.",finance,1665259364

politics,Discussion Thread: The 2022 midterm elections are almost upon us. Be sure you're registered to vote and consider becoming a poll worker. Resources in post.,"Voting is an indispensible part of any functioning democracy.  We won't sell you too hard on the importance of voting, if you're in r/politics you probably don't need to hear much about that.  You might consider taking the additional step of becoming a poll worker.

Poll workers go by different names in different localities.  Regardless of whether their responsibilities are carried out by ""election officers"", ""election judges"", or, as in Vermont, ""Justices of the Peace"", they serve a vital role in the conduction of free and fair elections in the United States.  If you are not otherwise busy on Election Day this November 8th, we highly encourage you to consider applying to be a poll worker.

Below you can find each US state, territory, or district's voter registration pages and, if available, a page to sign up to be a poll worker.

personalfinance,"Invest in IBonds, ETFs, or save money for house and other goals?","Quick background

* 34M, single, no kids
* $240k/year (this is new, more like $200k this year, $161k salary, what should be $80k RSUs but these days more like $60k)
* Monthly expenses \~$5k/month
* $40k in a 2.5% HYSA, $2k in a brick and mortar bank for those times where I need one; $30k of that is 6 month EF. I expect to have $60-70k in cash savings by EOY (so about another $25k between now and Dec).
* \~$60k in retirement accounts
* Maxing 401k and backdoor Roth IRA
* $35k of federal student loans are my only debt

I'm trying to figure out if I should put $10k in IBonds or hold onto the cash. My reasons for possibly not investing in IBonds are:

* I want an extra cushion over 6 months of living expenses during a recession. It won't be easy to find another job that pays as well as this one since a lot of the highest paying companies have frozen hiring until at least EOY.
* I'm also trying to save for a house in the next 2 years
* I've also got $35k of federal student loans. Since they count 2020 AGI too I think I'll qualify for the $10k forgiveness, so more like $25k of what I think will be lower interest (&lt;5%) loans.
* I could also just save more for retirement and try to buy index funds at a lower price for possibly better gain in the long run than IBonds.

I don't like that IBonds lock up the money for at least 12 months (15 if you want a full year of interest) and at best will give only a return of a little under $1k in that amount of time which is more like \~$650 over a HYSA (don't forget, HYSA gets 3 months more interest accrued vs. an IBond withdrawn &lt;5 years). Yeah, better than anything else you'll find right now, but is the opportunity cost worth it or should I keep it liquid in a HYSA, invest it in ETFs, or pay off student loans in January?",finance,1665260044

- graphics irrelevant, but no early/bad 3d (no n64 graphics, I don't know why, I just can't look at that)

- can immerse me for hours (basically like playing an elderscrolls title for the first time)

- lots of npcs to talk to/interact with (again, like in elderscrolls, just less scuffed)

- a gameworld that feels alive, and where my decisions matter (unlike in elderscrolls, I expect my surroundings to behave naturally, I expect npcs not to suffer from amnesia, but to remember if I helped or harmed them)

- satisfying character creation and progression (Where I get to choose a race, a class, level up, stuff like that)

- decent worldbuilding and story (doesn't have to be anything special, but something would be nice)

- random events and encounters (to keep me on my toes in the overworld, and make travel more interesting)

- procedural generation (this is more or less optional, but it would be nice to keep things fresh, even on a new playthrough)

Although it didn't get a ton of traction, I wanted to post an update to my financial situation and what decisions I made, and how I would change them with 20/20 hindsight.

I'm a 28 year old CPA/MBA, still at the same job, albeit a higher position with another promotion coming soon. Undergrad 2016/Graduate school 2019

# My financial situation:

 Salary/Assets

   * Salary: $93k, expecting a promotion to put me at \~$110k around March 2023, including a better bonus plan.
   * Checking account: \~$3k. Lower balance, see below.
   * 401(k) balance: has doubled to \~$59.5k, even with the market tanking. I save 15% of my paycheck (was only doing 10% until recently to help debt payoff timeline. Will most likely up to 20% with my raise) split 7% Roth and 8% traditional. Company matches 100% up to 5% salary, and also contributes an additional 5% if we have a good year. For what it's worth, I'd like to try and retire before 60 (not necessarily FIRE at 40 like a tech grad making $200k lol). 
   * Vanguard account: VTSAX $3.5k (basis $4k, $500 loss). Market is down = VTSAX is down
   * E\*Trade account: DKNG $1.6k (basis $4.5k, $2.9k loss). Purchased at the height of DKNG stock value, near March 2021 and some additional purchased to DCA over 2021. This was obviously a mistake, but I did my DD and thought this stock would continue to go up as legal gambling became legal in more states over time. Holding, so these are unrealized losses.
   * 2015 Hyundai Sonata with like 70k miles - completely paid off!

Debts/monthly
   * Per my last post, I had about $76k of debt between a HELOC on my aunt's house (for my undergrad loans), my car loan, my graduate student loans, and a new bed. **As of about a month ago, I am 100% debt free**
   * HELOC: completely paid off. Was about $30.6k without interest consideration from previous post. Rate was variable so thank god I paid this off in late 2021.
   * Car Loan: completely paid off, was about $10k at a low interest rate
   * Grad School: completely paid off. I owed my parents \~$32.5k from the sale of my grandmothers house that they allowed me to use to pay for grad school so my debt wouldn't be interest bearing. They forgave $10k and I paid them back the remaining \~$22.5k.
   * Quality bed and base: completely paid off, was \~$3.1k
   * $360/ month for car insurance, cell phone, and a little rent to my parents for allowing me to mooch off them still.

# My Thoughts

I paid off close to $70k of debt in about two years, which is crazy to think about. I'm very proud of this achievement and my original goal was to be free from any non-housing debt before 30. I didn't have much help/financial aid and had to put myself through college for the most part, so this is something I'm very happy about. **Now let's talk about a few elephants in the room**:

My current checking account is lower that I'd like at $3k. I have incredible job security as a CPA so this doesn't bother me. I was aggressively paying back the debt until about a month ago, so this will grow back up over time. I am disciplined enough to use this account as an emergency fund and not let it fall below a certain threshold once I've funded it as such.

I also used to have \~$25k of federal student loans (rates 4.5% - 6.8%) for undergrad that I paid off entirely in 2017. It is unfortunate I've ""missed out"" on the $10k loan forgiveness that started recently. However, I think the interest rates were high enough to justify the rapid debt repayment.

My largest regret about paying off all of my debts, many of them low/non-interest bearing, is the current state of the housing market.  Had I tried to buy a decent house/condo 2 years ago, I would be sitting pretty right now with a nice place and a relatively low interest rate. Instead, I'm 28 and unfortunately still at home. I feel so behind in this aspect of my life, and I'm kind of adverse to renting a single bedroom apartment for north of $2k near my job (I currently commute about an hour each way, which is trash). I'm weighing a decision between building up a down-payment for a place of my own or biting the bullet and trying to find a place to rent. It's bonkers that on $93k salary I feel like I've been priced out of the real estate market. I see values starting to dip slightly, but that's only because interest rates are skyrocketing.

With the information I had available at the time, I think my financial planning strategies were of sound mind and made sense. Hindsight is of course 20/20. I'm not afraid of debt if it's doing something for me (a car or a house), but I disliked the idea of carrying student loan debt into my 30s. You could make a pretty good argument this was a poor decision because of the state of the housing market and that most of the debt was low-interest bearing. Had I been born 5 years earlier in the exact same scenario (debt free, entering the housing market in 2017 or 2018), I think things would have worked out nearly perfect for me.

However, there is something that is a bit ambiguous to me that I couldn't find the answer to online.

When it comes to **pre-tax** traditional 401k contributions, the math is easy: if I make $1000 every paycheck, I can say that I want to contribute 10% and I know for a fact that it will be $100 that goes into the 401k account every paycheck because the money is taken out before taxes are computed. It makes it very easy to know how much I will be contributing in a year or if I want to start from a yearly amount and calculate the percentage I would need to contribute every paycheck.

When it comes to contributing **after tax** dollars, my company still asks me to use a percentage of my paycheck... How do I know what that percentage really is? My federal taxes + Medicare + SS + possible insurance premiums are a lot of computations (not to mention they change every year)... Is that percentage off of the gross (pre-tax taken out) paycheck? Is that percentage used on the money after the tax has been taken out? How does one compute this percentage if I would like to contribute a certain amount of after tax money to my 401k per paycheck?

If anyone has some clarification on this topic that would be awesome.

Bonus question: When contributing both pre-tax as well as after-tax money, does a new account get generated for the after-tax contributions? I ask because if they are all dumped into one account, how on earth would I be able to keep track how much of that money needs its tax paid later on and how much of that money doesn't?",finance,1665284999
personalfinance,Looking for debt advice,"Posting on a throwaway for anonymity. I am writing this for advice, and also to get it all down in writing and out of my head.


tl;dr- Went into credit card debt amidst a medical emergency. Now working part time and looking for full time employment, not sure if withdrawing from 401k is sensible.


The long version: 


I bought a house a little less than a year ago and spent my entire savings to put down a decent down payment. I had support from family and my partner and an okay (~$45k) salary at my job. It was a little scary, but all worked out okay. It came out to $165k at 3.7% for 30 years, and I would go back and do it again, seeing interest rates now.


Less than 2 months after closing, I slipped on some ice and fractured my leg in 3 places, including a compound fracture. I worked for a small company and had no short-term disability coverage. I cashed out all of my vacation and sick pay and my SO paid the majority of the bills.


I was out of work for 3 months. I did PT twice a week for 2 months, and returned to work part time on light duty during that period. Before I hurt myself, I signed a contract to have windows installed in the house, which I financed. Poor decision in retrospect—I should have paid the penalty to break the contract—but it is what it is now. They were installed 2 months after my injury.


After being out of work and then on light duty, I was required to return to my physically demanding position, which I found I could not physically handle anymore (10-12,000 steps a day, climbing on ladders, carrying heavy objects, walking on slippery floors, etc.).  So, I quit. I couldn’t do it, and the risk of reinjury was too high. There weren’t available positions doing less physically demanding work.


I have not had success finding another position working full time, but I am working part time bringing in about 2/3 of my previous salary. I left my 401k with about $20,000 in it at my previous employer until I can transfer it.


I barely paid off my medical debts, but I made it. I now have the following debt:

Credit cards: $4,000

  +Financing for windows: $7,000

Auto: $2,500

Student: $6,800

Mortgage payments are about $950.


I should receive a refund for student loan payments during deferment of about $2,000 and loan forgiveness for that debt, bringing my total non-mortgage to around $14,000.


All of that said, I understand there is a 10% penalty and taxes for taking money out of my 401k. Would it make sense to do that? Or perhaps to take out a personal loan and pay off the higher interest debt? Although with the hits my credit has taken in the past year, I’m not sure I’d even get approved at this point.

Investors cheering the ‘lower for longer’ narrative need to be wary of the long-term implication of central bank actions.

· Over the long term, low interest rates lead to higher return on capital requirements due to lower DCF (Correction by u/madrox1)

· A heavy domestic asset allocation strategy is risky.

· A low-cost index fund may not be the best option for everyone, especially in a low-return world.

· In the end, trends in profits matter – and a key component to profits includes a positive demographic story.

The only debt I have is literally just my student loans which are $42,000. I graduated last year in the middle of 2021 working my first tech job ever in cyber security for a series D late-stage startup (the company started in 2010) making a $60,000 base with a 10% in yearly bonus and stock options worth $18,000. The company is based in California, but I live in NJ with the expectation to travel 10% or 25% of the time.

This year 2022 I just received a raise of $10,000 which has bumped my salary to $70,000. I have a credit limit of $14,000 but I only **spend $700 monthly** and **pay the entire balance every month**. I don't have any kids, no significant other, or any of that life-distracting BS. Since I work remotely I don't need a car, but I'm trying to decide if I should buy my Dad's house next year or buy a different house and rent it out to random's.

Yes, a car is important, but a car depreciates in value so it just seems to make sense to buy my Dad's house next year and make him a tenant rather than rent it out to randoms, but I want to hear everyone's take on whether this is a good idea. The house is valued at $250,000 so I would need a down payment of roughly $50,000 to kick things off. The house itself is in good condition functionality-wise (no busted pipes, no heater replacements, he just bought new appliances and a new roof) it's just old appearance-wise since it was built in the late 95'.

My parents have always told me ""Please don't rent when you can own a house because you can do whatever you want and sell it later long term if you want. A landlord tells you what you can and cannot do with their property because it's not yours, but if you buy your own house you can do whatever F\*\*\* you want with it and it appreciates"".

Next year I also plan to find another job and I'm already interviewing for positions now. Does anyone have any others or advice? I would greatly appreciate it.",finance,1665327340
personalfinance,Pay Off Car Debt or Continue Saving?,"I (M29) purchased a car in 2019 when my then-job reimbursed me for milage several times over what I was paying for gas and maintenance. My plan was to throw the excess reimbursement at the car payment and pay down the amount financed as quickly as possible. After having the car for a month, the company purchased a company car, so I was stuck with the car payment and no longer receiving milage reimbursements. I originally financed $19,839.23 after a 3k downpayment at 9.45% APR for 72 months. At this time, I have a principal balance of $10,200 and my monthly payments have been $363.49. The car is a 2016 Ford Escape that had 22k miles at purchase and now has approx. 56,000 miles.

I've been working from home since the pandemic/March 2020. I got a better job with better pay and was able to save enough to purchase my first home in July 2022. After closing on the home, my savings were depleted and have been stagnant the past couple months as we work on fixing up our home, painting, etc. I have around 9k saved currently.

My question is whether it would be better in the short term to take what I have in savings and pay off the principal balance of my car. I'm thinking an additional $2000 payment towards the principal and doing that 5x over the next year so my savings aren't wiped, but I want to handle my car loan which is the highest interest rate of any debt I have (the other is the mortgage at 5%) before working on paying down the mortgage balance in the coming years. 

Or the other option I'm considering is selling the car which was tentatively appraised by Carmax at $14,000. I could settle the remaining 10k loan balance and have some money left over to purchase an older car in cash and not have a car payment going forward. I'd want something reliable, but I no longer drive like I used to and only use my car to drive to the store and the occasional road trip. The most important thing for me now is reducing my debt outside of my mortgage, since I want to start saving to make additional annual payments toward the principal balance on the house. 

Feeling like I've thought through the options, but feeling kind of paralyzed on which course to take. Any opinions or suggestions would be appreciated.",finance,1665331218

personalfinance,"Need advice on how to go forward with moving, possible change of jobs","I am 29, live with a roommate for cheap (around $300 a month in rent). Currently make good money ($55k a year) for my area. Over the last few years I began to invest in the stock market. This has been mostly a tragedy as I have lost way more money than I have made. I also invested in that trendy thing that went up and then down that I don't think this sub even wants typed. From doing the math in my head just now I would say I have lost over $8k in investing over the past few years. This is sad, and I constantly look at how many hours of overtime I worked to get that $8k. I also look at my current situation and realize that that $8k lost could have been spent on an apartment for myself where I would probably be a lot happier.

As of right now I am somewhat stuck where I am I feel like. Every 2 weeks when I get paid I feel this urge to invest most of my paycheck. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. If it helps I used to be a casino addict (counting cards in blackjack - which unlike the stock market I have made more money than I have lost). Just overall I feel stuck. Then the next thing I know a friend who lives on their own calls me and tells me how lucky I have it to live in a place where rent is only $300 a month. I want to move far away from where I am right now. I am no longer happy, and a small part of me (the same part of me that told me to leave casinos for good) is telling me to stop investing almost entirely. It tells me to take almost everything out of my brokerage accounts and put it in savings and move away and start to date, and to begin to at age 29 finally live life.

Tbh I do not know what I should do. The markets in the USA are down about 24-30% YTD. According to the great Nathan Rothschild ""the time to buy is when there's blood in the streets."" I fear that the opposite of what I am going through right now (looking back at my losses over the years) will come true (say in 2025 I will look back and see if I had **not** sold my stocks around now how much I would have made). I feel like SpongeBob Squarepants in that episode where if he leaves the bus stop the bus comes (bad reference I know). **One thing I need to mention is that I came from the lower class and lived in a house that had its power shut off a few times because my mom could not pay the electric bill. So I constantly fear if I move out that I will someday loose my job, become homeless, etc.** Here is a breakdown of my current financial situation. Pretend that I am your son and tell me what to do, be brutally honest please because I do not have a parent who knows how to budget money...

Liabilities:

Credit card = $2k owed (only reason I am keeping a balance is because this credit card has a 0% interest period that expires in September 2023)

My car is paid off and besides my student loans ($12k owed which will be forgiven if things go as planned under the Biden order) I should be debt free once my credit card is paid off

Assets:

Savings = $15k

Brokerage Acct. 1 = $6k

Brokerage Acct. 2 = $8k

Brokerage Acct. 3 = $3k

Brokerage Acct. 4 = $14k

\*Retirement Acct. from work = $56k

\*I do not know if I should include retirement accounts from work because (a) I cannot touch that money that my employer or I contributed until age 53 and (b) the amount will grow in value significantly over time because even if I leave employment both the employer and my contributions will grow as long as the stock market in the USA grows (which I am sure it will).

My current net worth is $100,000 if you include everything above and also assuming my $12k student loans are forgiven, which they should be because (a) they are federal student loans and (b) I did receive a PELL grants during my 4 year university time. I constantly fear if I leave where I have lived for cheap that I will loose everything somehow. It should be noted if I was to leave where I am now I would most likely, but not for sure, work for the same employer far away in the same state because they have many locations.

financialindependence,"Medicaid gap question: is it better to lower my MAGI for Medicaid eligibility through 401(K) contributions, or pay for marketplace insurance?","EDIT: Thanks to everyone who explained that I am actually eligible for a substantial ACA subsidy. I would only pay about $26 a month for a bronze plan with a $4,700 deductible, and $8,700 max OOP.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi. I'm a freelancer without a health insurance plan for next year. I would love to have some advice on whether I should

A) use traditional 401(K) contributions and freelance deductions to lower my MAGI to be under my state's Medicaid expansion plan limit **($25,520 MAGI).** I would then only pay $20 a month to cover everything, no deductible.

B) just pay for marketplace insurance. Annual premium would be capped at 4% of my income, and then to the best I was able to figure out the deductible would be about $10,000.

&amp;#x200B;

**Projected income:** I definitely have $10,000 from a maturing bond. My other income is unpredictable. I'd expect on the low end to make $26,000, but it might be as high as $36,400, plus maybe like $50 or so a month of interest from HYSA and T-bills depending on how interest rates go.

So my income range would be $36,000 to $47,400 and let's say my premium wouldn't be more than $1,896 for the year if I paid for marketplace insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

**The pros of lowering my MAGI to stay on Medicaid**, as I understand it:

* I can put the extra $11,000 to $22,000 to use for a combination of growing my 401(K) and developing my freelance business / writing off business travel instead of risking losing it all / most of it on a $10,000 deductible if I get sick.

**The cons:**

* A pre-tax 401(K) isn't ideal / I may lose out on the tax savings of using a ROTH plan while my income is low
* I won't be able to really grow my net worth ASIDE from my 401(K) while doing this plan because I'll essentially only be able to earn as much as I'm spending, like after the deductions I'm only allowed to ""keep"" about $2,100 a month, which I think taxes also need to come out of, so I'd only be able to keep about $1,400 of that, and I'd have to pay all of my non-deductible expenses out of that. (i.e. groceries, rent, restaurants, clothing). It would be a struggle to stay under this number and I'd probably be losing money monthly.
   * **Tax estimate:** I'm figuring if I make $25,520 after deductions, my marginal income tax rate would be 12%, plus self employment tax of 15.3%, plus and state income tax is 5.97% plus city income tax is $369 plus 3.762% of the excess over $12,000 (about $858.06) leaves me $16,171 a year or $1347.61 a month after taxes.)
   * **Budget:** Partial breakdown of my biggest expenses:
      * Rent: $840 a month
      * Food: $360 a month
      * Car insurance: $202.46 a month
      * Public transportation: $126 a month (this is 50% deductible)
      * Bars &amp; alcohol: $130 a month
      * Misc / other (toiletries, clothing, gifts etc): $100 a month
      * **TOTAL:** $1,695
   * However, I think even if I end up needing to spend $200 to $300 out of my savings a month without being able to earn back money to replace it, I'll still be net better off doing the Medicaid income capping and contributing $500+ a month to my 401(K) / investing in my business, versus paying for my own insurance and possibly losing $10,000 on the deductible.
   * I'll have almost $70K in savings after paying taxes in April, so I can afford to lose $300 a month for a considerable amount of time. (Other assets: Mutual Fund - $40K; ROTH 401(K) - $17K)

Are there any other downsides I'm not thinking of to doing this? The big one I can think of is that I don't have a plan to get off of Medicaid. I have a disability that makes it extremely difficult for me to get hired for + keep a ""normal"" full-time job that would give health insurance, so I think there's a chance I may need to live with the income limit until I reach Medicare age in 34 years, though I'll definitely keep trying for it. I'm getting some family assistance but I don't know if it will last forever and I'd like to be self-sufficient. (Unfortunately I'm well over the asset limit for the SSI disability Medicaid buy-in program).

A possible long-term idea would be to keep doing this plan until I've hit a COAST FI number where I can stop contributing to my 401(K), or maybe even a COAST FIRE number, and then the next year after that I could go onto marketplace insurance. Then at that point, I could plan on investing the amount of the deductible for the year in a HYSA instead of contributing to a 401(K) and slowly roll over money from the traditional 401(K) to my ROTH as long as my income stays low enough to justify this. Then, if I end up not needing $10,000 worth of medical care for the year, I'll ""win"", and if I do, I can afford it.

Thanks so much, apologies for the wall of text.

**TLDR:** As a freelancer with gross income in the ""Medicaid gap"" where I'm earning more than the Medicaid cutoff but not enough for the ACA subsidy, is it better to lower my MAGI until I qualify for Medicaid or just pay for marketplace insurance and hope I don't need to see a doctor?",finance,1665338857

CryptoCurrency,The hopium you need today: The next bull run will probably be the biggest one by total market cap relative increase,"There are several events piling up for the next 18 months.

1. ETH2 will be unlocked to unstake in about 6 months. After that, weak hands may drop the price to lower lows.
2. This time of the BTC cycle and moving forward, the global cryptocurrency market cap normally sees the lowest values.
3. The monetary policy is expected to be hawkish for at least the next few months, as a response to inflation, further suppressing prices.
4. The global economic situation is dire with most major economies hitting a recession at some point in 2023 (if not earlier) further dropping the prices. Not to mention the inflation, the war, the energy crisis,...

So we may see a very deep dip in the following months (possibly even 12 months). Similarly to the current perfect storm that we see today; when the bear is over, we should see the perfect storm for one of the strongest bulls ever to take off\[:\]

1. Ethereum PoS rewards HODLing (and staking), compared to mining and selling to run the mining operations (buy hardware and electricity). We should see stronger hands and prices going up; after the weaker hands are out. (The Matthew effect would be an interesting topic, for another day).
2. The BTC halving will happen by the \[end of March 2024\]. BTC halving has regularly triggered bull runs in the past.
3. The monetary policy should pivot when the recession becomes a bigger problem than inflation. The effects of monetary policy are not immediate in the economy but may be in speculative markets. Weak hands should be out by then. Arguably, weak hands should be out by now, but some cannot do that (e.g. ETH2 staking). Quantitative easing always causes bull runs.
4. The global economic situation will hopefully improve, at some point. Otherwise, there may be no more bull runs, but extinction ahead, which technically makes any assertion about bull runs ""true"".

Having said that, personal opinion:

1. We might not have seen the lowest lows of this cycle yet. The bear may not lose its strength until the second half of 2023. I know some people have the opinion that \[this is the bottom\], but new lower bottoms are just possible because the global and macro economic situation is different (and much worse) than previous bottoms. For example, in a recession, some HODLers may be forced to sell at a loss when shit happens. To what extent this might impact the prices is everybody's guess. Bear markets are usually not that long, but these are truly unprecedented times.
2. Some of the coins may not reach today's levels at the peak of the next bull run, even if we only consider the top 100. (There are regular posts in the sub reminding you that your most hyped alts may not make it to new ATHs).
3. There will be FUD, and there will be good news about adoption and technology. In the big picture, they nearly cancel each other out. The points discussed earlier have greater weight. All in all, it is a fairly \[bullish bear\], comparing cryptocurrencies with other markets in ""the everything bubble"".

DYOR and stay safe.

Note: While bull runs get larger in absolute numbers, as the cryptocurrency market grows, they get smaller in relative numbers (think of percent of change, see why \[you should be using logarithmic scale\])

Per Investopedia: The 200-day moving average is considered a key indicator by traders and market analysts for determining overall long-term market trends.

Consider the 200 dma a visual representation of the average price’s movement. If it is moving higher, that means that the average price today is greater than the average price 200 days ago (trending up). If it’s moving lower, then the current average price is less than it was 200 days ago (trending down).
 
How do institutions, hedge funds, and traders use the 200 dma?

Per Paul Tudor Jones: “I look at the 200-day moving average of closing prices. I’ve seen too many things go to zero, stocks and commodities. The whole trick in investing is: ‘How do I keep from losing everything?’ If you use the 200-day moving average rule, then you get out. You play defense, and you get out.”

As bad as things look right now (war, energy prices, inflation, dumb dumb Fed, etc.), the market could turn upwards tomorrow and start the biggest bull run in history. All we can do is recognize which way it is heading RIGHT NOW and adjust accordingly.

What is a Trend? 

Per Investopedia: An uptrend is a series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows. A downtrend is a series of lower swing highs and lower swing lows.

Case Study: the 2000 Bear Market

Exit Criteria: Price must close below a declining or flat 200 day or 40 week moving average, then start a new downtrend by closing below the previous swing low. This eliminates false signals where the price dips below then back above the ma. 

Entry criteria: Price must close above the rising or flat 200 day or 40 week moving average, then start a new uptrend by closing above the previous swing high.

Getting Out

•	Red Flag #1: Price dipped or closed below a rising 40 week ma several times starting in September ’99. Price chopped up and down for 1 year until the 40 week ma flattened in Sept ’00.

•	Red Flag #2: Price closed below a slightly declining 40 week ma the week of 9/24/00

•	Exit Signal: The very next week price closed below the previous swing low (week of 7/23/00). This was your signal to exit at $143.62.

The market then steadily declined for the next 2.5 years, including 8 bear market rallies. Price closed above the 40 week ma 2 times during the downtrend, but the MA never turned upward and a new trend never started above it.

Getting In

•	The market bottomed during the week of 10/6/2002, but none of us would have known that at the time. Price finally closed above the flattened 40 week of 4/13/2003, but below the previous swing high 1 week earlier.

investing,Why SPY is headed lower and CPI's downward trajectory is at risk,"**Summary:** 

* Year to Date, SPY is down 24%, but we still have room to go lower.

* Thanks to energy prices, there is a possibility that inflation has not peaked yet.

**S&amp;P 500:**

* [P/E and EPS Estimates](https://i.imgur.com/8MDtsAg.png)

* As shown on the above picture, while the S&amp;P's P/E ratios have fallen to somewhat normalish levels, it remains elevated when compared to the last 15 years. The P/E multiple is a function of growth expectations and discount rates. With growth likely headed lower and rates higher, it is very likely the multiple will continue to see pressure in the near term.

* However, another big issue is the earnings portion of P/E. As you can see, analyst EPS estimates are still too high. Even if the P/E multiple remains where it is, lowered EPS estimates will be a big blow to the S&amp;P and will take the index lower. 

* These EPS fears are further magnified by [margins](https://i.imgur.com/lGzqy0f.png). Margins are at notable highs and are all but confirmed to drive lower on a combination of higher inventory, consumer resistance to price hikes, and rising wages. 

**CPI:**

*  [Chart 1](https://i.imgur.com/3wBiTyu.png) and [Chart 2](https://i.imgur.com/UZbxTJb.png)

* In the above charts, you can clearly see how CPI/PPI has performed in relation to the price of crude oil and gasoline. To put it short, falling energy prices drives inflation lower and rising energy prices do the opposite. 

* Energy remains in an extremely tight situation and the relief from the SPR releases is beginning to wear off. This is all compounded by OPEC cuts, EU energy tightness, and further shenanigans from Russia. Note that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sees higher gas prices this winter as the EU cuts back on buying Russian oil and winter forces higher heating usage. 

* Just like lower energy prices flowed through all parts of the economy, pushing back against inflation, if energy prices rise, it will have the opposite effect, potentially pushing things back higher. 

**Conclusion:**

* While many on social media would have you believe things are great and the bottom is near, we have yet to discover how much pain the Fed is willing tolerate. This doesn't even include the impact of QT, removal of cheap Russian energy, and the potential for the Chinese growth engine to stall as their property markets implode.

stocks,Case Study: Timing the 2022 Bear Market Using the 200 Daily or 40 Week Moving Average (So Far),"The consensus is that you absolutely can’t time the market. This common advice is based on a Warren Buffett quote that goes something like this: “Any attempts to pick the times to buy or sell, I think, are a mistake for 99% of the population. And I think that even attempts to pick individual securities is a mistake for people.”

I think his advice is spot on for anyone who is not interested in playing the investing game and wants to be assured a successful retirement. DCAing into low cost, broad based index funds works exactly as everyone thinks it does, and doing so ensures your long term success.

However, there are other ways such as using the 200 day or 40 week moving average.

What is the 200 day moving average?

Per Investopedia: The 200-day moving average is considered a key indicator by traders and market analysts for determining overall long-term market trends.

Consider the 200 dma a visual representation of the average price’s movement. If it is moving higher, that means that the average price today is greater than the average price 200 days ago (trending up). If it’s moving lower, then the current average price is less than it was 200 days ago (trending down).
 
How do institutions, hedge funds, and traders use the 200 dma?

Per Paul Tudor Jones: “I look at the 200-day moving average of closing prices. I’ve seen too many things go to zero, stocks and commodities. The whole trick in investing is: ‘How do I keep from losing everything?’ If you use the 200-day moving average rule, then you get out. You play defense, and you get out.”

How to use the 200 dma: The trend is your friend

The stock market is always moving up, down, or sideways. No one can predict what direction it will turn at any time. As bad as things look right now (war, energy prices, inflation, dumb dumb Fed, etc.), the market could turn upwards tomorrow and start the biggest bull run in history. All we can do is recognize which way it is heading RIGHT NOW and adjust accordingly.

What is a Trend? Per Investopedia: An uptrend is a series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows. A downtrend is a series of lower swing highs and lower swing lows.

Case Study: the 2022 Bear market (so far)

Exit Criteria: Price must close below a declining or flat 200 day or 40 week moving average, then start a new downtrend by closing below the previous swing low. This eliminates false signals where the price dips below then back above the ma. 

Entry criteria: Price must close above the rising or flat 200 day or 40 week moving average, then start a new uptrend by closing above the previous swing high.

Getting Out

•	Red Flag #1: SPY closed below a still rising 40 week ma multiple times starting 1/17/22


•	Red Flag #2: Closed above the 40 week on 2/22/22 but fell right back below the following week, and the 40 week started to turn down.


•	Exit signal: Spy closed below the last swing low on 5/2/22 at $410.14


So far there have been 3 bear market rallies in 2022. Where will we stop, nobody knows.

personalfinance,How/Can I reduce my taxes temporarily to pay back a loan against my 401K faster?,"TLDR: How/Can I legally stop paying taxes for 3 months so I have more money to pay off a debt that is time sensitive?

&amp;#x200B;

During 2022 I had a lot of family expenses come up unexpectedly right after I spent money on my self to do some personal traveling. I ended up incurring approx. $9000 between two credit cards with an the average interest rate between the two of them being 23% APR. I (based on personal research) decided that it made sense to consolidate the debt at a lower interest rate to reduce the financial burden and save some money over time. I could not find a ""transfer card"" that would have covered $9000k. On the other hand most general loans I looked that could had fairly high interest rate so I decided that instead of going private I would take out a general loan against my 401k. The terms of that loan are quite generous at 3.75% against the loan with interest paid back into the account over a span of 5 yr.

By cutting my IRA contributions for the rest of 2022 (not necessarily 2023) which I would have maxed out a month from now (while still maintaining my 401k 2022 contributions to get employer matching). I budgeted that I could pay it off with major lifestyle concessions or to stop building an emergency fund in 1.5 yrs.

The ""issue"" is that I'm losing the ""opportunity"" to have compound interest work on the amount of the money that is unpaid ($9000).  3.75% over 5 years vs what ever the compound interest would be during that same period.

I've heard that its possible to ask your employer to stop with holding for taxes, or request all deductions as long as you pay the taxes properly when you file (Spring 2023). If that's true it would make sense to:

1. Stop withholdings and request all deductions from my paycheck for remainder of 2022.
2. Roll the short term extra income into loan payments now to reduce the loan amount, thereby giving  more time for compounding interest to work.
3. Save aside money in early 2023 to pay the taxes that will be due at tax season April/March based off what I didn't pay in Fall 2022:

Its a little unclear through the IRS information if doing this might expose me to [underpayment](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes). If claiming deductions will result in an unforeseen penalty outside of just paying the taxes, or if interest on unpaid taxes is calculated from the time you stop paying (in my case would be October/November 2022), or if you don't pay [when taxes are due](https://www.irs.gov/payments/pay-as-you-go-so-you-wont-owe-a-guide-to-withholding-estimated-taxes-and-ways-to-avoid-the-estimated-tax-penalty#:~:text=Taxes%20are%20pay%2Das%2Dyou,payments%2C%20such%20as%20Social%20Security) (April/May 2023)

Any other ideas outside of cutting more expenses to would also be appreciated.

Edit: I also have 26k in student loans that (maybe 16k near future), that are in forbearance and I make my budget with money taken out for that expense.",finance,1665346085

The company will set money aside towards my pension benefit based on my age , years of service. 

-Less than 35 points ….. 4% of my compensation 

-35 - 49 points… 5% of my compensation

-50 - 64 points… 6%

-65+ points … 7%

————
Cash Balance Pension 

-Grows at a predetermined interest rate based off of the 30 year treasury 

-Subject to 3% annual minimum &amp; a 9% annual maximum interest rate applied quarterly to my account. 

-once I begin to collect the account stops growing

-I assume no investment risk

-Company pays all the administration costs 

-guaranteed by the PBGC 

-receive annuities rather than a lump sum payment

-must begin receiving by 65




Defined Contribution Pension
- I get to decide how to invest my pension benefit and gains depend on how well my investments do
-I assume all the investment risk 
- I pay investment management fees from assets in my account 
- compensation credits end when I leave the company 
-doesn’t offer annuities with lifetime payment which means I’m responsible for making sure the money lasts long enough into my retirement. 
-not guaranteed by the pbgc
-can take a lump sum or annual , monthly quarterly payments 
-must begin receiving by 70 1/2.

personalfinance,Should I get a personal loan?,"Hello,

I am a college student on an indefinite leave of absence. I left because I can't concentrate and study for the life of me, and if I fail one more class I lose all my financial aid (I'm there on a full ride). So I gotta take it slow, relearn how to study, and return when I'm ready.

I'm in my mid 20s, don't have family, live with my bf but the relationship is a lil rocky rn. I work as many hours as I can at a local grocery store (can't seem to get more than 30h a week, usually they give me 15 or so hours), and between helping my bf with rent, paying my own lunches at work, and paying off loans for that stupid summer class I took at an ivy uni which I couldn't get aid for, almost every dollar I earn is lost. In the 5 months I've been working here I couldn't save anything.

Many things worry me. Every few weeks my bf and I argue and he insinuates that I leave. I save up my energy for the days I work and am too tired for anything on the days I don't. The amount of anxiety I get worrying if I can make this month's rent brings me down rather than pushes me towards other things like getting a second/better job or finding things to study. I've been putting off my mental health and it would be really nice to get on some medication. 

The solution I pose: take out a LARGE personal loan.
I don't believe having a few thousand dollars cushion would make me work less or spend more towards frivolous things. I think it would help me focus on the future problem of getting a degree, rather on the present problem of living paycheck to paycheck. It would also get rid of those monthly fees my bank keeps charging me for having a low balance. Ideally, by the time this loan terminates, I will have a nice job where I am earning instead of staying at a standstill. I have ""exceptional"" credit so I would get a low interest rate. I may even put some of it into a mutual fund and grow the money that way.

So I want your opinions, criticisms, good and bad experiences. What am I not considering that would make everything go south? Is it worth investing in myself like this, or should I find another way to make progress in life?",finance,1665348232

Like the title says, I’m starting a new job next week, and will be going from making 35k a year to 51k a year. I’m a 23 year old college grad living in a relatively low cost of living area. My rent is 800 a month but my brother will be moving in with me in January, cutting it down to 400 a month for my share. I live less than two miles from my job so my transportation cost is pretty minimal. I have about 30k in federal student loans that I’ve been making payments of $150 a month on even through the deferment. I have no other debt as I keep my credit card usage pretty low and pay it back every month. I have about 6k in the bank right now, but saving aggressively has been pretty tough with my current salary.

With this new increase in salary, I’m looking for what to prioritize, without going too crazy. 

My car is paid off but it’s in my parents name, not mine. It’s also got about 200k miles on it and going to give out pretty soon. I’ve been trying to decide between buying a used car and paying cash for it, or leasing a new car. 

I’m stuck with how I should start dividing up. I want to pay off my loans as soon as possible, but I also want to build my savings more. What should I prioritize first? Should I figure out my car situation sooner rather than waiting for it to die on me? Is leasing or buying more beneficial? Is there a certain percentage I should be putting in savings every paycheck? How much more should I be paying on my student loan? Is there something I’m missing that I should start doing?

I can maybe put 5k down payment. But I would like to go 0 or 1k$ down and finance the rest as that money could go towards my student debt.

The dealerships are usually vague about interest rate. They can’t guarantee or provide an interest rate until they talk to a bank. My credit score is decent (740). So I’m assuming I should get at least a not-so-bad interest rate with current market situation.

Based on structure, this is an area I would expect to see buyers.

This level was approached very quickly due to NFP which, in my experience, adds to the validity of it trading in the opposite direction of its aggressive approach.

I have a bias - Long, now I have to find an entry. My preferred entries for longs are on failed attempts of new lows.

[Here are my entries. The failures are more visible on 15m.](https://imgur.com/a/3WXGEQn)

Once I am in a trade I do have a static stop loss that is based on structures rather than R:R. This means I have to be more selective with entries to get beyond 1:1. Where am I wrong in my bias?

[Below these levels I would not longer be biased to the long side.](https://imgur.com/a/N5JNJY2)

Now I have a logical place for a stop, a logical place for an exit, and my R:R is above 1:1. Sweet. From here, what I do is monitor structure through the important levels presented in the higher timeframe candles.

[Continue to monitor closes. Splitting up entries can improve cost basis. Thesis still intact](https://imgur.com/a/TwjcZCl)

[Closes within previous 1H low. Thesis intact.](https://imgur.com/a/ccNM5Wj)

These failed lows allow better entries with the best possible R:R (vs. attempting to take a breakout of the zone high)

[Eventually we are provided with more insight into the success of our trade.](https://imgur.com/a/VAru2Kw)

There are still hurdles above so we continue to monitor price and how it interacts with said levels.

And next year, I will drop down to 14% (the percentage that will get be the $20.5k), and this will be the first year that I will max, and continue to do so until the retirement age of 65-67. On Lincoln's financial calculator, running the computation with my company's match, it says if I do this, I am on track with retirement at 85% of income to sustain until 87. Still, my anxiety and intrusive thoughts make me think otherwise.

stocks,Stocks: compare now to the last times when there were stock market drops during high inflation,"We know that the late 1970's were a time of high inflation and rising interest rates but no catastrophic economic events in the USA.

We know that the early 1970's were a time of high inflation and rising rates but with catastrophic economic events - the inability of our oil infrastructure to replace a sudden hold back of Arabian oil.

COVID from a medical perspective is ongoing, but in stock trader's heads it is over.  So my suggestion is we could compare what is happening now better to the late 1970's to 1982 than the early 70's.

In the late 1970's there were two notable stock market declines.

1. &amp;#x200B;

Nov 1976 to Jan 1978 decline of 14.3% S&amp;P500

The trailing 12 month PE of the average stock was around 9 at the start of this decline

2)

Dec 1981 to August 1982 decline of 18.5% S&amp;P500

The trailing 12 month PE of the average stock was around 8 at the start of this decline

So stocks started 2022 with an average PE of 37, and now they are going to a PE of 8 or 9?  Oh no, that is a historic crash including much more of a down market to go from here!

Not so fast.  If you look at the M2 broad money available per person, it is $7,370 in 1977, $8900 in 1981 and $65,000 in 2022.

Throughout the same time, GDP per capita has grown less.  We have grown GDP per capita by a factor of 2.16 since 1977 and factor of 1.98 since 1981.

My interpretation is that people have more dollars to spend in the stock market per GDP unit.

We have a factor of 8.05 more money per capita since then, and a factor of 2.07 GDP per capita increase since then.   8.05/2.07 = 3.89

Would it be that the PE's of stocks would tend to be higher now both at the highs and lows since we have more money to spend per person and based upon a GDP unit?

This takes the relationship that the value of a fair stock market increase over time should be similar to GDP increase.

At the start of these declines in 1977 and 1981, averaged together, the PE of your typical stock was 8.5.

An interesting stunt is 8.5 x 3.89 = 33.1 .

This 33 is close to the PE of 37 that stocks had at the peak of the market in January 2022.

In other words, if you put more money in each person's hands by a multiple for the same USA GDP unit, the valuations of stocks themselves will become more expensive on average in good times AND BAD.

The highs get more expensive, and the lows get more expensive in terms of the average stock's PE.

Right now in October 2022 our PE average has come down to 18.4.  This is in the area of 2008's valuations, before the average company in the S&amp;P500 lost money rendering the use of PE's nebulous.

But as bad as a gas shut off to Europe would be, we don't have Lehman brothers and AIG failing, and Wamu going under.  So it would appear to me that we don't have much farther down to go before December when these gas shortages in Europe start.

Even so, there are stocks like Bank of America and Citizens Bank that have PE's now of 8 to 9, as if they were in the 1970's.  Coupa is an example of a growing company that does not depend on the supply chain because they make software.  There are plenty of opportunities at this level in my opinion.",finance,1665374538
Bitcoin,Robert Kiyosaki Justifies His Bitcoin Purchases with Reference to Pension Funds and Inflation,"**He cited inflation as an example of why pension funds are investing in cryptocurrencies and claimed that they are conscious of the fact that stocks, bonds, and ""fake"" money ""are toast.""**

### Why Does Robert Kiyosaki Buy Bitcoin?

In a few tweets on Friday, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki outlined his rationale for buying bitcoin.

The 1997 book Rich Dad Poor Dad was co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been a New York Times best seller for more than six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold worldwide in more than 51 different languages.

The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad stated in a tweet that he buys bitcoin because pension funds do the same. He quoted a Forbes article with the heading ""Your State Pension Is Now Betting On Cryptocurrency"" that contained a poll indicating that 94% of American state and local government pensions are investing in cryptocurrencies.

The survey is a part of the most recent Investor Trust Study, which was published in April by the CFA Institute, a global network of investment professionals. Two-thirds of institutional investors reported that they currently invest in cryptocurrencies, which indicates that this practise is becoming increasingly common. Government-sponsored pension plans are also the ones that are most likely to invest in cryptocurrencies.

In another tweet, Kiyosaki discussed the justification for his recommendation to purchase gold, silver, and bitcoin. The eminent scholar stated that the pension problem demonstrated central banks' failure to keep inflation under control. Despite previously investing in gold and silver, he said that pension funds are now also doing the same with bitcoin.

The Bank of England informed legislators that many pension funds were only hours away from collapsing when it made the decision to interfere in the British bond market last week in response to a massive sell-off of U.K. government bonds.

In his tweet, Kiyosaki stated that ""fake currency, stocks, and bonds are toast,"" and that pension funds are aware of this. Recently, the well-known author urged investors to put their money in ""real money,"" citing gold, silver, and bitcoin, and issued a dire warning that the end of fake money is at hand.

The renowned author has long recommended acquiring bitcoin in addition to gold and silver. Last month, he advised investors to buy cryptocurrency before the biggest drop in history. He said he was waiting for bitcoin to test the $1,100 level in June.

Last week, he projected that as long as the Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates, there would be opportunities to purchase gold, silver, and bitcoin. He also predicted that the US dollar would depreciate by January of the following year",cryptocurrency,1665378510

My monthly bills may look low for a family of five in Southern California, but we are debt free and we live below our means. Also, my medical coverage is part of my pension, so I pay around $600/year (yes six hundred). 

Anyway, I know that I’m in a good situation, but I want to be smart about it. I’m trying to capitalize financially, but my happiness is extremely important as well. I spent a lot of time away from my family these past 20 years, so I want to be careful about what I do. I’ve been loving driving my kids to school and just focusing on my master’s since retirement, so a 9-5 isn’t something I want to do if I don’t need to. I’m really only doing the masters to collect the GI Bill and become an adjunct (online) professor in the future. 

Considering this, I have a few questions. If you were in my position, how would you invest your money? What would you do to make money beside a 9-5? Would you continue trying to make as much money as possible or take a break and enjoy life? I could list a bunch of questions, but these are the types of things I’ve been wondering about.  

I’m also contemplating on moving from California to New Jersey (I’m from there). I know both states have their issues but hear me out. My mortgage is only about $1800/month in California, and the state will pay for all of my kids’ tuition because I’m a vet. On the other hand, I have some equity in my house, and I can purchase something less expensive in New Jersey. Additionally, 100% of my property taxes will be waived in New Jersey because of my disability rating. 

I understand that the answers to these questions are situational and other factors such as personal goals are at play. I just want to get an outside perspective from those who don’t know me personally.",finance,1665384233

stocks,People who didnt sell end 2021 early '22. What made you hold? What did you expect from the investing landscape 2022/23. What went good/wrong,"*Honest question, since i want to learn what i did correct / wrong and how other people perceived the upcoming year.*

What made you hold on to your stocks etc. and not sell? So much information was coming in with huge red flags that pretty much market a shifting landscape. Especially since the graphs were parabolic to the upside almost. (Thats how i saw it at least)

\*Inflation spiking

\*FED announcements they will clamp down

\*Russia rumblings

The real kicker for me was the news reporting Russia setting up makeshift hospitals for real and stocking them up with real bloodbags etc.

Was it a lack of information at that time or just another mindset (Long term hold / dca). To me it seems very self destructive to hold through a market crash since you will lose so much investing years (% gain wise). If you now end with 20 million at age 60 you could have ended up with 26/30 million. And those last compounding percentages count the hardest.

I owe £50k in capital gains taxes.

I used all of my original capital and the gain I made to purchase a property to live in. I have paid £10k to the taxman towards my tax bill. I now have £0 cash in savings, and stocks+shares investments in my ISA of around £40k, currently sitting down at a £20k loss. I do not want to sell these or cash out of my ISA as these are my only savings/investments besides the property.

I now owe the taxman £40k, which I do not have in cash.

I earn about £2,400 per month after taxes, and have a small mortgage.

Should I take out a loan to pay the taxman? I know interest rates are incredibly high right now. I wouldn't mind securing the loan against my property and paying it back over a long period of time, such as 5 years.

My other option is to come to an agreement with HMRC, but I imagine its more flexible for me to take out a loan to pay them.

# [Stock futures fall to start week with key inflation data, earnings ahead](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/09/stock-futures-are-down-as-market-exits-rollercoaster-week.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures were lower Monday morning as the markets come out of a tumultuous week and traders look ahead to key reports coming in the next week that can offer insights into the health of the economy.
*****
&gt; Futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 28 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were lower by 0.18%, while Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.30%.
*****
&gt; Market observers generally consider the week ahead as the kickoff to earnings season, with four of the world’s largest banks – JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citi – reporting Friday. PepsiCo, Delta and Domino’s are also among companies reporting next week.
*****
&gt; Inflation will also take center stage as new monthly Consumer Price Index data comes Thursday morning.
*****
&gt; It will follow a week of whiplash for market participants. The first half of the week brought a relief rally that pushed the S&amp;P 500 up more than 5% in its largest two-day gain since 2020.
*****
&gt; But jobs data that economists say will keep the Federal Reserve on a path to continue raising interest rates and OPEC+’s decision to slash oil supply rattled investors, knocking the market down later in the week. When trading ended Friday, the S&amp;P was up 1.5% compared to where it started the week. The Dow and Nasdaq were up 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Still, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq had the first positive week in the last four. All remain down substantially so far in 2022, however, and the Nasdaq is less than 1% away from its 52-week low.
*****
&gt; “The direction of the stock market is likely to be lower because either the economy and corporate profits are going to slow meaningfully or the Fed is going to have to raise rates even higher and keep them higher for longer,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Given the conditions that we are operating under, we believe it’s prudent to begin preparing for a recession,” he added. “The talk of a shallow recession that is now the narrative-du-jour strikes us as eerily similar to the ‘inflation is transitory’ narrative of last year.”
*****
&gt; Last week brought heightened concerns that corporate earnings will show the ugly side of a surging dollar as Levi Strauss became the latest to cut guidance due to sliding international sales.

Her name was on the property (I believe) because of a quitclaim deed.  Is this still considered an inheritance?  How will the capital gains be calculated?  Will we owe taxes in Florida?  Will this be treated as income on our federal tax return?

stocks,‘This is serious’: JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon warns U.S. likely to tip into recession in 6 to 9 months,"* JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy was “actually still doing well” at present and consumers were likely to be in better shape compared to the 2008 global financial crisis when the world tips into recession.
* “But you can’t talk about the economy without talking about stuff in the future — and this is serious stuff,” Dimon told CNBC’s Julianna Tatelbaum on Monday.
* His comments come at a time of growing concern about the prospect of an economic recession as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks raise interest rates to combat soaring inflation.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Monday warned that a “very, very serious” mix of headwinds was likely to tip both the U.S. and global economy into recession by the middle of next year.

Dimon, the chief executive of the largest bank in the U.S., said the U.S. economy was “actually still doing well” at present and consumers were likely to be in better shape compared to the 2008 global financial crisis.

“But you can’t talk about the economy without talking about stuff in the future — and this is serious stuff,” Dimon told CNBC’s Julianna Tatelbaum on Monday.

Among the indicators ringing alarm bells, Dimon cited the impact of runaway inflation, interest rates going up more than expected, the unknown effects of quantitative easing and Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“These are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they’re likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,” Dimon said.

His comments come at a time of growing concern about the prospect of an economic recession as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks raise interest rates to combat soaring inflation.

Speaking to CNBC last month, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said he’s feeling apprehensive about the U.S. central bank going too far, too fast in its bid to tackle high inflation rates.

The Fed raised benchmark interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point last month, the third consecutive increase of that size. Fed officials also indicated they would continue hiking rates well above the current range of 3% to 3.25%.

Dimon said that while the Fed “waited too long and did too little” as inflation jumped to four-decade highs, the central bank is “clearly catching up.”

“From here we let’s all wish him success and keep our fingers crossed that they managed to slow down the economy enough so that whatever it is, is mild — and it is possible,” he added.

**‘To guess is hard, be prepared’**

Dimon said he couldn’t be sure how long a recession in the U.S. might last, adding that market participants should assess a range of outcomes instead.

“It can go from very mild to quite hard and a lot will be reliant on what happens with this war. So, I think to guess is hard, be prepared.”

Dimon said the one guarantee he could be sure of was volatile markets. He also warned that this could coincide with disorderly financial conditions.

Asked for his views on the outlook for the S&amp;P 500

, Dimon said the benchmark could yet fall by “another easy 20%” from current levels, adding that “the next 20% would be much more painful than the first.”

Speaking to a roomful of analysts and investors in early June, Dimon said he was preparing the bank for an economic “hurricane” caused by the Federal Reserve and Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“JPMorgan is bracing ourselves and we’re going to be very conservative with our balance sheet,” Dimon said at the time. He advised investors to do the same.

Market participants are monitoring a highly anticipated inflation print on Thursday as well as a slew of corporate earnings.

JPMorgan is scheduled to release third-quarter financial results on Friday.

Shares of the bank are down roughly 33% year-to-date.

There was a quick bidding war and it sold without an inspection. I check Zillow since then, and there's almost nothing available to buy that looks appealing.

I know interest rates will likely wreck purchase prices and be a bear for a while. 

I guess I am wondering what happens to mortgage broker stocks if overall sales volume increases when construction/rehab eventually resumes. Any ideas?",finance,1665425275
economy,Paul Tudor Jones believes we are in or near a recession and history shows stocks have more to fall,"Billionaire hedge fund manager [Paul Tudor Jones](https://www.cnbc.com/paul-tudor-jones/) believes the U.S. economy is either near or already in the middle of a recession as the Federal Reserve rushed to tamp down soaring inflation with aggressive rate hikes.

“I don’t know whether it started now or it started two months ago,” Jones said Monday on CNBC’s “[Squawk Box](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-live/)” when asked about recession risks. “We always find out and we are always surprised at when recession officially starts, but I’m assuming we are going to go into one.”

The National Bureau of Economic Research is the official arbiter of recessions, and uses multiple factors in making its determination. The NBER defines recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.” However, the bureau’s economists profess not even to use gross domestic product as a primary barometer.

GDP fell in both the first and second quarters, and the first reading for Q3 is scheduled to be released Oct. 27.

The founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment said there is a specific recession playbook to follow for investors navigating the treacherous waters, and history shows that risk assets have more room to fall before hitting a bottom.

“Most recessions last about 300 days from the commencement of it,” Jones said. “The stock market is down, say, 10%. The first thing that will happen is short rates will stop going up and start going down before the stock market actually bottoms.”

personalfinance,How to prioritize Budgets/Goals? Focus on Current Vs. Future,"Hey all, I am currently trying to figure out where my priorities need to be at the current stage of my life. I am going to give you a bit of background but I will also answer any questions if important info was left out:

I (30M) just recently started a new job 4 months ago making 108K Pre Tax plus 10% annual bonuses. This is the first time I have worked a job where I feel like I am not scraping by until the next paycheck (this time last year I was making 58K).


During my first 4 months on the job I have worked to pay off all credit cards, medical bills, and other outstanding debts and am almost done with that (Should be fully debt free by February/March excluding my current car payments)

Once that happens I need to figure out how to balance planning for the future. Here are my current expenses for our family of 5 (3 kids: 5, 2, 9m):

Post Tax Monthly Income (After insurance, 7.5% 401k, HSA): $6,250

Expenses:

Rent: $2,000

Car Payment: $600 (minimum payment is $431 but we are paying extra currently to reduce interest paid long term and get this paid off. 5.4% interest rate with 19k remaining if that info is needed

Preschool: $626

Car Insurance: $93

Phones: $207

Gas/Groceries: $1,700 (Babies/Kids are expensive man. Especially when you need hypoallergenic formula)

Misc. (Streaming, dance classes for oldest, subscriptions): $187

Total: $5,413

Remaining: $840


Now I am aware this budget could be tightened up a bit but there is a quality of life there for the whole family that we enjoy.


Some areas where spending can be cut: Car payment (Could go back to minimum or else this will be paid off fully in a few years at current levels), Food/Gas (youngest turns 1 in 3 months and then we can get him off of the hypoallergenic formula, middle child is potty training so that is fewer diapers there), Subscriptions (Currently paying for multiple subscriptions that aren't used a ton but overall that is a minor expense comparatively.)


Now to future goals:

Houses: We want to eventually buy a house but are waiting until either house prices drop or expendable income goes up (avg. 4 Bed House in my area goes from 400k-500k and it's not realistic at that price point

Retirement: Want to set myself up for a good retirement so I can enjoy my later years in life

Education: Wife and all 3 kids are indigenous and their tribe will pay all college costs so that aspect of education is a non issue currently. Hoping to be able to funnel that money into better education during their formative years (Preschools, private schools if possible, extra curricular activities, etc.)


Now to the heart of why I made this post. All 3 of these things take considerable money and with only $900/month extra it is impossible to work on all 3 goals. So, how do you manage wanting to improve life in the short term (Buy a house to build equity, nice schools for kids, etc.) with the need to save money long term for an already underfunded retirement?

If someone just wants 7% growth a year on their retirement funds, I’m having a hard time understanding why having a non-stock alternative for more risk adverse individuals is a bad thing on an individual level.

I kind of get that it makes debt more expensive and that people would invest less in the stock market, but what is the problem with having somewhere to put money, long term, that ideally would beat inflation (if it goes back down) with a few percent of growth?

vet,Kitten has had Diarrhea/Conjunctivitis for months,"Hello, my 3 month old kitten has had diarrhea since September and an upper respiratory/conjunctivitis since August. When it first happened his stool was completely clear and was as if water was being poured out of his backside. Now his stool has a sludge type of consistency but is brown. 

I've taken Soup to the vet numerous times (he also had a upper respiratory/pink eye issue) and was prescribe antibiotics topically for his eye and orally to help with his upper respiratory issues. I've done  two rounds od those treatments. When I got him from a pet shop he was 1.3lbs at  (born may 29th and I brought him home on 8/8). He has been gaining weight, at his last vet check, for the diarrhea last month on the 15th he weighed about 2.3 lbs iirc.

He's had 2 deworming sessions with my vet. He's been tested for Giardia and other parasites, both tests were negative (this was done on the 9/15 visit). I've tried dry, wet, and digestive health foods (all wellness brand) and imodium as per the vets instruction. I am now trying a probiotic that is made by Purina (Fortiflora), I added it to his food beginning yesterday. This morning he had explosive diarrhea. Perhaps the probiotic needs a bit more time to work (or maybe it won't work at all). I've added imodium to his food along with the probiotic (I don't know if that'll work). He was very gassy back in Aug, now he seems to be doing better. 

I am trying to remember what the pet shop fed him. They gave me a bag of it, the food was dark green and triangle shaped. To me the kibble looks a lot like greenies, which is NOT meant to be a meal replacement. I could call the shop and ask. But I am furious at them and if I ever contact them again things will get [redacted]. How dare they treat those poor animals that way!?!? There were 4 other kittens but they were not ""adoption ready"" due to an eye infection. Soup didn't appear to have signs of an upper respiratory illness. Literally 2 days later afyer i brung him homw he's gasping for air. I thought that he was going to die in my arms while I was on the phone with the vet!

Anywho, I am at my wits end, perhaps he has a food intolerance and whatever ingredient(s) that is in wellness kitten food is giving him IBS. I am tired of playing the ""elimination game"" with my vet. The last thing that I can think of is to get him tested for food intolerance to see what exactly is going on. The vet said that he most likely has herpes, but he hasn't been tested specifically for any type of virus or FEV. He has had 2 rounds of the distemper vaccine.

As for his conjunctivitis, today it appears to be *finally* clearing up and he has little to no discharge so far. His plica semilunaris and caruncula are more pink then red/inflammed as it used to be. Could it be that the probiotic is helping heal his eyes? 

With regards to the upper respiratory issue, he isn't having sneezing episodes or expelling snot anymore. But he does sneeze and gets congested occasionally. Hes sitting in my steamed bathroom right now to further help alleviate those symptoms.

I was wondering how can I help Soup, is there nothing else that I can do before taking him back to the vet? If I have to take him back to the vet, what type of food intolerance tests should I ask for? If his conjunctivitis flares up again, what type of antiviral, if there is one avaliable, should I ask for? My vet told me that there isnt an antiviral vaccine similar to the flu shot that can help him, that his illness has to ""run its course"". Thanks so much for the help!

Tl;dr my kitten is sick and has been for months. I've tried just about everything to help him and I don't know what else to do.",cryptocurrency,1665428979

stocks,The Game is Different Than Your Daddy's Market,"In the heyday of massive tech expansion and growth; with plenty of room to adjust interest rates down; in the midst of a half century bond bull market; sane PE ratios; lack of pervasively spidered leverage and swaps into all sectors of the economy; and without direct asset purchases by the Fed (and other central banks) ...

That environment was much more complex in terms of money flows between various asset classes, financial development, and interest rates. Things didn't just hinge on forward guidance and monetary policy. You could sometimes see rates rising, DXY rising, M2 slow down, and yet see stock market gains. They were general rules of thumb, but not perfect correlations, and could often countertrade. 

Well ... That's not the market regime we're living under anymore. And people intuitively know this, which is why everyone is hanging on central bank policies and forward guidance.

The post 2000 economy, and especially post 2008, with ZIRP and the start of ""QE"" (aka, central banks just buying bubble assets with printed money); it's pretty clear why the markets should hinge on central bank policies. 

The leverage that was spidered into the economy was never cleared out. It was expanded.  And when I say leverage, I mean that in a very broad sense. Not just the swaps and derivatives of the housing bubble. But more broadly - the printing of new money and loaning it out to institutions who will long the market ... *any* market ... *all* markets. So happens when interest rates rise and central banks sell assets for which massive leverage based on ZIRP still exists? 

In a macroeconomic sense, higher rates reduces the ability to service interest on loans, and increases margin/collateral requirements for leverage. So what happens? People/institutions are forced to sell assets to account for these changes; and do it in an environment where central banks are also selling. 

This, after more than a decade of ZIRP. So what do we have? The everything bubble. And the everything pop. Almost nothing appears safe right here. Bonds have fallen dramatically. Equities down. Gold isn't a safety play either. Real estate, down. Commodities managed to make a big move early on, but have since fallen significantly. 

And what will happen if the Fed lowers rates and starts asset purchases again? Literally everything will go up again. We've seen time and again since 2000, that when the market crashes, it crashes together. And when central banks intervene, it recovers together. *Definitely not evenly and not all at the same time*, but broadly speaking, yes, it all goes up. Especially in the 1-3 years post intervention recovery. 

You have to go back more than 2 decades, before near-zero interest rates and before central bank asset purchases, to find significant deviation from this pattern. Yes there are caveats and complexities; but in a broad bear market, it's rational for people to be hanging on the forward guidance of central banks. 

**TLDR**:

The people saying that you're irrational (or just lucky) for having sold, and for not rebuying right now, are living and hanging on the words of old guys who had a very different market regime than the one that exists now. You can do considerably better than the market, merely by DCAing both in ***and*** out of the market, based on central bank policies and forward guidance. This has been the reality for 2 decades now.",finance,1665431267

Tbh I don’t really need the maintenance as I’m living from home and have plenty savings from my job. In the current market, the only use I see for my maintenance loan money is to invest it which seems fitting in the current downturn. I’m not going to need this money anytime soon (at least 1-2 years) so I was thinking of just putting it in a company I’ve done plenty research on (I’ve been investing for the last 2 years). My parents say it’s better to get the loan in the current economic environment as anything could happen. With the rising interest rates im not so sure, Mabye I should try cancel the rest of the payments?

Ideally I’d want to DCA into a US company such as GOOG, AMD or MSFT. However given the £ is down so bad, any gains in the stock will be somewhat offset by the (hopefully) rebounded £ in the future. 

Now I realise these type of companies can be volatile so my other thoughts were buying some beaten down blue chip UK stocks such as TSCO, GSK, SBRY, RIO, AV. If they go down, I’m happy to hold while receiving dividends. There’s some potential upside in the stock too and there’s no currency risk.

personalfinance,Got a bill for $500+ for having a plumber out to look at a leaky toilet. Any recourse?,"Hi all, 

Long time reader of this sub. First time caller.

About 7 months ago I had a plumber out to my house to quote out replacing a couple of leaky toilets. As far as I remember, I went with this company specifically because they didn't mention any charge when I called them to schedule it.

He was here for 30m to an hour at most and we ended up discussing what seemed to be a pretty simple toilet replacement. Once I had everything in place I called back to schedule them to come back out to do the work, and I was actually talked out of it by the coordinator on the line. He mentioned that their company was pretty expensive for doing such a simple job and advised me to call around and consider somebody else.

Well I ended up doing just that and got it replaced by another plumber (with a few other minor headaches). All well and good right?

Not exactly - I just got a bill from this plumber for $544. They charged for two hours at $190 per hour plus $80 truck fee and a ~$23 environmental/safety fee.
I emailed back asking for an explanation on why they billed for two hours and haven't heard back. I'm a bit miffed because I didn't have any idea that I'd be charged for the quote and don't really remember agreeing to pay for the quote. I've had other contractors (electricians and such) come out and give me quotes on work. I didn't end up paying anything when I didn't go with their company.

Do I have any recourse here? I can't really find any policy about quotes on their website, and I'm worried about their lack of response since the bill says they will start charging interest after 30 days. Shopping around really doesn't seem like it provides much benefit if you end up paying $300-$500 for each company to just come out and give you a quote.

Edit: I called them and they gave the explanation that I was expecting to hear. “This looks like a bill for an initial service call to have the plumber come out. It would include any travel time plus time spent sourcing materials or researching.” They have a weekly review process and I asked for this bill to be added to it since I mentioned that I wasn’t informed that I’d be expected to pay for the initial quote. It’s kind of funny that he added that bit about sourcing materials and researching considering I asked them to replace some angle stops, and I’m providing the toilets. Like what is there to research?

Edit2: it’s been a week and still no call from them. The ball is in their court, so I’ll just keep waiting here until I hear from them.",finance,1665440116
stocks,Are interest rates correlated with market returns: a rudimentary analysis.,"A common piece of advice on this subreddit at the moment is to not fight the Fed.

The notion is that an environment with high interest rates will lead to an economic slowdown, consequently leading to earnings declines and stock market pullbacks. In theory, this makes sense, but does the data actually support this? 

I did a rudimentary analysis of the last 70 years of interest rate and annual S&amp;P 500 returns. Here is the first graph: [https://imgur.com/a/wsTQtAj](https://imgur.com/a/wsTQtAj). Looking at this graph, you don't see an obvious correlation between the two. Of course, you need a more rigorous analysis to come to this conclusion, so I made a scatter plot of annual S&amp;P returns vs interest rates and asked Excel to fit them linearly. Excel shows a very weak negative correlation (note the extremely low R square value of 0.063. [https://imgur.com/a/Vl4OJAc](https://imgur.com/a/Vl4OJAc)

Finally, I made a chart showing annual S&amp;P returns vs interest rate brackets (0 to 2%, 2 to 4% etc). [https://imgur.com/a/6k309lc](https://imgur.com/a/6k309lc) This graph doesn't show any correlation between the two factors either. The only thing to note here is that S&amp;P returns have been unusually low for interest rates between 2 and 4%.

- playing as Hesh, who now leads the Ghosts against whoever the enemy is, while also trying to hunt Rorke and find Logan

I personally think the Logan part would be the best and most effective way of telling a good story with how Ghosts ended, and both provide an opportunity for a more personal story. It'd also be new, where you'd be playing as a bad guy for a good chunk of the campaign 



For other games, they can look at time periods/conflicts that haven't been explored yet, while taking advantage of the new engine to create a realistic experience (think CoD WWII but done better, although it did make a good attempt). For example - create a grounded Vietnam game that isn't Black Ops, or an Iraq War game like CoD 2024 is rumored to be. Furthermore, with the end of the war in Afghanistan, having video games which have the War on Terrorism in them in a post-2021 world would be interesting (especially since CoD was the epitomie of ""America fuck yeah""). And with the travesty that is Vanguard, they basically owe us historically accurate games. The first CoD was basically a thematic adaptation of Band of Brothers.

She is the independent administrator of the estate and will be responsible for distribution of all assets in accordance with the will/accounts as well as tax filings associated with the estate.

Bitcoin,The Global Macro Environment is Near Perfect for Bitcoin to Show its Utility. A Brief Look Into Our Failing Monetary Policy Globally,"In 2000 the US M2 was 4,688.2 T, today M2 is 21,613.1T. Thats average, annually compounded growth of ~7.2%. 

Average CPI inflation rate over the period is ~2.5%. 

Which figure is closer to “true” inflation rate in your opinion? Both are reductive but the simple definition of inflation is growth in the money supply. I would argue 7.2% is closer since the CPI baskets have been known to be “gamed.”

SP500 returns have averaged ~9.1% over the period, if that 7.2% inflation rate is more accurate the US economic growth seems to be far overstated. It also means US bond yields have been negative in real terms for a long time. Salaries/cash savings have been devalued much faster than assumed, benefits don’t go nearly as far as they did. The US has been the strongest economy/currency in the world over the period, and this is how we are holding up?

If we can expect an even higher inflation rate going forward things look pretty bleak. It doesn’t seem like the FED will have any choice but to go back to QE and printing since these rapid hikes have been putting economies globally at risk and absolutely destroying foreign currencies. Some countries have already begun resuming QE. Is it even possible for the US to hike above rates of 7-10% again without total implosion? 

It really feels like all these macro factors globally are the perfect environment for Bitcoin to show it’s utility and purpose. Satoshi’s prescience is really incredible the timing of Bitcoin is truly remarkable. Or maybe there is something else going on here, is Bitcoin truly a random invention or is there more behind it’s creation?

I'm also going to leave you guys with my own advice below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcknsvEgRck (this is NOT my video, but gives you perspective on how long we could be in a recession / bear market)                   

You're going to get impatient in the next year or two, wondering how you can increase your holdings. The best thing I can tell you is, ""don't get greedy"" and ""Don't get impatient"". Just continue to stack whatever **reliable project** you think you can.                

My own two cents: this could be like the end of the dot com boom where we saw a bunch of websites that didn't survive collapse (like broadcast.com, look the history of that one up if you can) getting replaced by YouTube when it was created in 2004 or 2005.              

I also want to remark that the first time I can remember any ""geo-political"" events taking place that impacted crypto prices was the China trade war in 2019. Once that was declared, bitcoin went from like 6000 USD apiece to 8000 USD apiece. The second time I remember geo-policial events was when Xi Jinping said ""blockchain"" and bitcoin skyrocketed from 7k to 10k in October 2019.  I was also there for the covid crash, and on that day it felt like ""The end of the world."" for every single market out there - not just crypto.               

If you have the money, if you can afford the losses, and if you won't be mentally scarred by it, then just continue to dollar-cost average **responsibly.** I personally think another big leg down is waiting for us, but it will be a curve ball that almost nobody saw coming.                  

EDIT: Something else to pay attention to the DXY index, which is basically a measurement of how many people want to hold dollars or accumulate dollars. https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy - I suggest you switch to the 3 year chart and notice that it started to trend upwards just a few months before the most recent peak of November of 2021. When it trends down, that usually indicates lower demand for dollars, so people start investing in risky assets - stocks and crypto. However, when black swan events take place (like in 2008 and in March 2020) the DXY becomes a not-so-reliable macro indicator for the short term until the market finds itself. This can also be a misleading indicator since it would seem that as a financial crisis approaches, it tends to go down with the rest of the market at the same time.",cryptocurrency,1665471264

\- New government announced the tax cuts which made the investor lose trust for the British economy

\-No trust for the British economy means less demand for the British Gilts

\-Less trust for the British gilts means lower prices and higher interest rates for the British Gilts 

So how this affects the big pension funds in the Uk, how this affects the currency in the Uk and what the BoE is trying to do here by buying these gilts. They try to lower their interest rates?

* Collateralized loan obligation prices have been hit hard by a slump in the British pound and the unwinding of U.K. pension investments
* Weakness in the CLO market may also have a knock-on effect on leveraged buyouts, including the financing for Elon Musk’s planned purchase of Twitter.

Fallout from the crisis in U.K. financial markets has hit a faraway corner of Wall Street: the trillion-dollar market for collateralized loan obligations.

Once a niche product, [CLOs are now widely held](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hunt-for-yield-fuels-boom-in-clos-1508673601?mod=article_inline) by investors around the world, including the British pensions, insurers and funds that got caught by [the recent crash in U.K. currency](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-england-to-buy-bonds-to-stop-crisis-spread-11664360313?mod=article_inline) and government-bond markets. Many of them sold CLO bonds to meet margin calls, sending prices of the securities tumbling well below their intrinsic value, analysts and fund managers said.

Some U.S. investment funds rushed to snap up the bonds at what they considered incredible bargains.

“It was the heaviest selling pressure we’ve ever seen,” said Tom Majewski, a managing partner at Eagle Point Credit Management, a Greenwich, Conn.-based investment firm specializing in CLOs. Eagle Point purchased about $80 million of CLO securities in the seven trading days ended Oct. 5, double the amount it would normally buy in a seven-day period, he said.

In recent weeks, trading of the CLO bonds most commonly held by pensions and insurers hit its highest level since March and April of 2020, according to analysis by The Wall Street Journal of trading data reported to a U.S. regulator. CLO prices stabilized last week after falling to their lowest level since mid-2020, but the selling continued unabated. Average daily trading in the first week of October was around $1 billion, twice the daily average over the past 12 months, according to analysis by the Journal.

The surge of activity took place while global markets—with the exception of the U.K.—were far calmer than at the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The S&amp;P 500 lost **7%** in the past three weeks, compared with 16% in March 2020.

Rising turmoil in CLOs shows how [fluctuations of normally placid interest rates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/britains-financial-disaster-is-a-warning-to-the-world-11664596851?mod=article_inline) in developed economies are rattling financial markets in unexpected ways. Forced selling by U.K. investors has also hit corporate bonds, stocks, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, investors and analysts said.

CLOs are a sliver of assets held by U.K. pension funds that try to guard against changes in interest rates through so-called liability-driven investment strategies. Con Keating, head of research at Brighton Rock Group, said he estimated them to be a maximum of 5% of assets under management.

Pensions and others had invested £1.6 trillion ($1.8 trillion) in LDIs by 2021, data from trade group The Investment Association show. In the relatively small market for CLOs, sales a percentage of that size have the ability to shift prices, unlike in larger markets for government bonds and stocks.

Weakness in the CLO market may also have a knock-on effect on leveraged buyouts—a lucrative business for Wall Street—because the investment vehicles purchase about 60% of the loans backing the deals.

CLOs are investment vehicles primarily run by alternative-asset managers like [Blackstone](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BX) Inc. and [Carlyle Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CG) Inc. The firms sell bonds and stocks to outside investors, then use the money to buy junk-rated corporate loans, which pay interest that is redistributed to holders of the CLO bonds and shares. Investors piled into CLOs over the past decade, [sparking worry of excessive risk taking](https://www.wsj.com/articles/financial-engineering-made-risky-loans-seem-safe-now-they-face-a-huge-test-11584702000?mod=article_inline), but they held up in the 2020 market panic, [making them even more popular](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clos-wrap-up-record-year-11640637572?mod=article_inline).

Most CLOs issue bonds of different rank: Those with triple-A credit ratings get paid first, while junior bonds rated as low as double-B wait in line to receive payment. Insurers and pensions favor the higher-ranked CLO bonds because their credit ratings satisfy regulatory guidelines and because they pay higher yields than corporate and mortgage bonds with comparable investment-grade ratings.

Heavy selling of CLOs started the week ended Sept. 23, when the [pound hit a 37-year low](https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-the-u-k-really-depend-on-the-kindness-of-strangers-11663851588?mod=article_inline), forcing U.K. investors that use derivatives to hedge foreign-exchange risk to sell assets to cover losses, said Wayne Dahl, a managing director at Los Angeles-based Oaktree Capital. The deluge intensified the following week, when prices of U.K. government bonds tumbled, triggering margin calls on LDIs, held by pension funds.

“That generated a ton of emails internally,” Mr. Dahl said. “We’ve definitely been buyers.”

About $13 billion of investment-grade CLO bond trades were reported in the U.S. during the past three weeks, according to analysis by the Journal of a database maintained by Interactive Data Corp. and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That is the highest volume since a three-week stretch in March and April 2020 when about $15 billion changed hands.

CLO prices have dropped to their lowest levels since May of 2020, according to an index of the securities operated by Palmer Square Capital Management. The firm’s investment-grade CLO bond index traded at 88.7 last week, down 4% since the start of September.

Some bond prices slipped even further, particularly those of European CLOs that were heavily owned by U.K. investors. The double-A-rated bond of a euro-denominated CLO managed by Investcorp Credit Management dropped about 5% in late September to roughly 90 cents on the dollar, according to data from KopenTech LLC. A spokeswoman for Investcorp declined to comment.

Falling CLO bond prices make it more expensive for CLO managers to borrow money to launch investment pools, reducing new issuance. Fewer new CLOs means fewer buyers for the “leveraged loans” investment banks sell to help private-equity firms fund their takeovers at a time when debt investors are already worried about a potential recession. 

Banks that financed Vista Equity Partners and Elliott Management Corp.’s $16.5 billion buyout of Citrix Systems [took a roughly $500 million loss](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citrix-debt-deal-prices-with-large-losses-for-banks-11663769143?mod=article_inline) on related loans sold in September amid weak investor demand. The market will face an even bigger test when banks [try to place $6.5 billion of loans](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-revived-twitter-deal-could-saddle-banks-with-big-losses-11665069334?mod=article_inline) for Elon Musk’s planned $44 billion purchase of [Twitter](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TWTR) Inc.

“From a CLO manager’s perspective, the selloff isn’t helpful,” said Lauren Basmadjian, a partner at the [Carlyle Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CG), one of the world’s largest CLO operators. “What our market needs is stability to issue CLOs.” 

But Carlyle also invests in CLO bonds and from that standpoint, the forced selling by U.K. institutions is a windfall, Ms. Basmadjian said: “We’ve definitely been adding exposure over the last month.”",finance,1665485169

stocks,Fun fact: Men charged in stock fraud case involving a small-town NJ deli are set to appear in federal court.,"Two men accused of participating in a stock manipulation scheme involving a small-town New Jersey deli will appear Tuesday morning in federal court, about 20 minutes from the now-closed store at the center of the case.

&amp;#x200B;

Peter Kirk Sr. 80, and James Patten, 63, who were arrested by federal authorities in North Carolina last month, will appear in U.S. District Court in Camden, N.J., which is just across the bridge from Philadelphia.

&amp;#x200B;

The two men are charged with several federal crimes, including fraud, for allegedly inflating the value of a publicly traded company that had a market value of more than $100 million last year, despite having only the Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, N.J., under its name. The deli generates less than $40,000 in sales a year.

&amp;#x200B;

Federal prosecutors have described the case as a tale of international fraud and betrayal. 53-year-old Peter Coker Jr. is the son of Coker Sr. and is currently in Hong Kong, where he is considered a fugitive. Federal authorities had tried to imprison Coker Sr. before agreeing to a conditional release. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also indicted the men in a civil case over the alleged conspiracy.

&amp;#x200B;

The men are accused of participating in Hometown International and a similar shell company called E-Waste. Prosecutors say the men tried to enrich themselves by inflating the prices of Hometown International and E-Waste. At one point, their values soared 939 percent and 19,900 percent, respectively, on the so-called over-the-counter market.

&amp;#x200B;

Coker Sr. will be represented by Marc Agnifilo, who has previously defended fraudster and ""pharma bro"" Martin Shkreli, disgraced filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, NXIVM cult leader Keith Raniere and a Russian bank sanctioned for invading Ukraine.

&amp;#x200B;

Anifero did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The individuals are charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy to fix the price of securities. The fraud and manipulation charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years",finance,1665488868

MachineLearning,[D] Offloaded/remote backpropagation for federated learning,"One of the main overheads with federated learning is the communication cost, whether that's sending gradients or weights over a network, this involves regular, massive transfers between nodes and a central server - this is particularly troublesome when communication bandwidth is very limited, say for edge computing.

I have been looking into alternatives of what is communicated, one idea sending a list of loss values (per batch) to be sent at the end of an epoch, where the central server can use this to compute the gradients and backpropogate/update using just the loss values (no input data) for a copy of the model for each node, so in essence would result in the same situation of the central server having a copy of trained models from each node, but the computation (backprop/update) is done on the server.

Is this doable to compute gradients on just a loss value if there is an exact copy of the model for a given node? It would massively reduce upload bandwidth and reduce computation on edge nodes.",technology,1665489301
stocks,Why are companies raising prices even though both stocks are plummeting and interest rates increasing?,Fairly straightforward question.  If companies are beholden to the shareholders then why do companies keep raising prices and contributing to inflation if inflation is why stocks and the economic forecast is trash right now?  It’s clear that companies are pushing prices beyond the cost for supply chain disruptions or other issues.  I would think that if stocks are plummeting then companies would take that more than anything as a sign to back off.  It just seems like these companies are pushing the envelope for a few quarters of minor bumps in their profit while risking their long term stock health and multiple quarters of economic downturn.

personalfinance,Looking to move - should I sell my house?,"I am looking to move to a different city, and would like to sell my house to be able to facilitate that. I'll be able to sell my house and make a nice profit. The problem is that I have my house on a great interest rate, and to get a house for roughly the same amount as what my house would sell for, my mortgage payment would increase quite a bit. That's even with planning to make a larger down payment with the proceeds of my current house to not have to borrow as much money. It would be \~$1300 more per month just in terms of cash flow, not to mention decreased equity in a mortgage with a rate that is basically double. 

So basically, I'm wondering if I should sell my house as planned, buy in the new city, and bite the bullet of the increased cost (and decreased equity building)...Or, another idea, I can get a lesser house in the new city for a bit more than the $1300 my mortgage payment would go up by (plus certainly the cost of the down payment) and I can rent out my current house, letting someone else pay that mortgage and build equity, and have the higher interest rate on a lower loan amount.",finance,1665492783
CryptoCurrency,Ben Bernanke winning the Nobel Prize in Economics is yet another reason and reminder of why you should acquire Bitcoin/crypto,"Yup, Bernanke was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his ""work on financial crisis"" \[sic\].

If you haven't heard of him yet, you probably weren't around or much tuned in 2008. He was one of the persons responsible for (1) the government bailing out the banks and (2) the crash itself. Being FED's chair at the time, not only he knew what was coming but he also knew the government would bail out the banks.

More than $2 trillion dollars were lost, USA's GDP dropped 4.3%, almost 9 million people lost their jobs in USA alone. No banker was arrested and the man who participated in the creation of a huge crisis just got awarded money.

Bernanke was around in both Bush's and Obama's terms, so in that sense it doesn't matter who is running the White House: the hoarders will be around living there as usual while Presidents are temporary, and the idea that Republicans or Democrats have different economic agendas is shenanigans.

The Federal Reserve isn't Federal and doesn't have any reserves. It is a private company with undisclosed shareholders, which somehow managed to be the ones emitting the legal currency of the biggest economy on Earth. The game is rigged, folks.

Even though the prize is issued by the Central Bank of Sweden (yeah, bankers awarding bankers), its name holds prestige in the minds of people.

In any case, make sure you have a plan to escape the downhill trip these folks always get us in. For me, ultimately it is Bitcoin.

They create the crisis, but don't forget who pays the bill:

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were flat Tuesday after the Nasdaq Composite closed at its lowest in two years during the regular session.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded higher by 40 points, or 0.13%, rebounding from a slump that took the index down about 200 points in premarket trading. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.02% while Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 0.03%.
*****
&gt; Stocks closed lower Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite falling 1% following a drop in semiconductor stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed nearly 94 points, or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 declined about 0.8%.
*****
&gt; Bond prices also fell. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury rose about five basis points to 3.937% after nearing the key 4% level overnight. Bond yields are inverse to prices, and a basis point is one hundredth of one percent.
*****
&gt; The moves came as investors weighed comments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who warned that the U.S. would likely fall into a recession over the next “six to nine months,” and said the S&amp;P 500 could fall another 20% depending on whether the Federal Reserve engineers a soft or a hard landing for the economy.
*****
&gt; Those remarks came at the start of a big week for third quarter bank earnings, and ahead of Wednesday’s producer price report, Thursday’s consumer price index report for September and Friday’s retail sales numbers, also for last month.
*****
&gt; Investor reaction is focused solely on how the Federal Reserve will react to the economy as it works to dampen inflation.
*****
&gt; “There’s always this idea of a Fed pivot coming right around the corner, and they’re just going to tighten their belts to bring inflation down without affecting the economy more broadly,” Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist and economist at Solus Alternative Asset Management, said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “All of that was always hopes and dreams. And the most likely outcome was ... what history shows always happens, which is the Fed tightens, they tighten too much, they cause an economic dislocation, the market goes down. Full stop,” he added.

personalfinance,(US) Due to rising interest rates I'm pulling out of the house shopping market and want to invest my down-payment money.,"The title explains the situation. I've saved about 40k for a down-payment and would like to transition that money into my investment portfolio. My idea is to DCA it into an index fund like SPY. 

**My questions are:** 

1 - From what I have read recessions last from 10-24 months. My thinking was to invest 5-10% a month so I can invest my entire downpayment on the down turn of the index and hopefully capture the gains on the other side. What % of my money should I invest monthly to optimize towards investing all of my down-payment money during the recession? 

2 - What index fund would you all suggest? 

3 - My current expectation is to be back in the home shopping market in about 2-3 years. Would the above strategy work for that timeline?",finance,1665493957
vet,Questions about feeding canned food to cats?,"I have 3 cats, and I feed them a mixture of both canned and dry food (about half and half). They are meal fed set amounts, twice a day. I either feed Hill's Science Diet or Purina Pro Plan. I have no trouble with dry food. I feed the appropriate food for their ages, and just choose the regular formula, as my cats have no ongoing health problems.

My problem is with canned food. Canned food has been in short supply in my area, pretty much since the start of the pandemic. I often have to make due with what is available. I prefer to feed a variety of textures and flavors whenever possible, because I've found in the past, it's easier to get sick kitties eating again if they're used to variety, so it's basically a ""just in case"" thing. 

My first question is: 2 of my cats are 8 years old. I feed them mature adult/senior dry food. I try to feed them senior canned food when I can find it, but it is often out of stock, or when I can find it, there is often only one flavor. Will it hurt if they sometimes eat regular adult canned food, or do they specifically need senior food? 

My second question is: All 3 of my cats are relatively healthy, so I try to avoid canned (and dry) food formulated for specific needs. (Hairball management, sensitive stomach, urinary health, etc.) Is it harmful to feed them occasional cans of these other ""special needs"" foods when that is what I can find (especially the urinary health), or do I need to continue to search for regular formulas?

My third question is: Would it be better to switch to a regular formula, ""lower quality"" canned food (such as Friskies or Fancy Feast, both by Purina) if I can't find what I need in the higher quality lines? 

I realize that the answers depend in part on what their digestive systems tolerate, but in general, I try to slowly switch, and none of them seem to have any problems. Also, my vet hasn't given any specific feedings guidelines for the 3, other than to say to feed them sensible amounts of mostly canned and some dry from reputable brands such as Science Diet, Purina, or Eukanuba.

Thanks in advance for any insights!",cryptocurrency,1665496556
personalfinance,Mortgage company miss applied funds.,"I was in the hospital early this year with covid. I missed almost 3 months of income and wiped almost all my savings paying bills. I almost immediately put the mortgage in forbearance. At the end of August between an assistants fund and working like crazy I has saved a little over 8k to repay the mortgage and bring it all current. I made the payments and thought everything was good. Went to make another payment and found out they I was a month behind. I quickly saw they put almost a whole monthly payment into escrow and then what I had in a suspense account totaled the exact amount for a monthly payment. I’ve spent almost 5 hours over the last month on the phone trying to get this corrected but they either lie saying since it’s federal money they can’t touch it, or say sure thing, reapply the funds then a few days later they reverse it without explanation and I’m back to square one. Should I file a complaint with the state at this point? Is there any other option that I’m not aware of?

stocks,"Biden Proposal Could Lead to Employee Status for Gig Workers, UBER/LYFT crushed -13%","Biden Proposal Could Lead to Employee Status for Gig Workers
A proposed rule, long awaited by labor activists, would make it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors.

The Labor Department on Tuesday unveiled a proposal that would make it more likely for millions of janitors, home-care and construction workers and gig drivers to be classified as employees rather than independent contractors.

Companies are required to provide certain benefits and protections to employees but not to contractors, such as paying a minimum wage, overtime, a portion of a worker’s Social Security taxes and contributions to unemployment insurance.

The proposed rule is essentially a test that the Labor Department will apply to determine whether workers are contractors or employees for companies. The test considers factors such as how much control workers have over how they do their jobs and how much opportunity they have to increase their earnings by doing things like offering new services. Workers who have little of either are often considered employees.

The new version of the test lowers the bar for that employee classification from the current test, which the Trump administration’s Labor Department created.

The proposal is intended as a so-called interpretive rule that doesn’t have the legal force of a regulation specifically authorized by Congress, and it applies only to laws that the department enforces, such as the federal minimum wage. States and other federal agencies, like the Internal Revenue Service, set their own criteria for employment status, and the rule would not directly affect what they decided about the status of gig workers.

But many employers and regulators in other jurisdictions are likely to consider the department’s interpretation when making decisions about worker classification, and many judges are likely to use it as a guide.

As a result, the proposal is a potential blow to gig companies and other service providers that argue their workers are contractors, though it would not immediately affect the status of those workers.

“While independent contractors have an important role in our economy, we have seen in many cases that employers misclassify their employees as independent contractors,” the labor secretary, Martin J. Walsh, said in a statement. “Misclassification deprives workers of their federal labor protections, including their right to be paid their full, legally earned wages.”

Uber and Lyft have said in federal filings that having to treat drivers as employees could force them to alter their business models, and some gig economy officials have estimated that their labor costs would rise 20 to 30 percent.

The proposal also defuses growing pressure from activists supporting gig workers, who complained that the administration had been too slow to intervene to protect ride-hail drivers and other app-based workers.

In proposing its rule, the Biden administration is harking back to an approach adopted under President Barack Obama, though administration officials said in interviews that they were merely returning to a standard that federal courts have repeatedly upheld over the decades.

The Biden administration delayed and then scrapped the Trump rule before a federal judge reinstated it. The new proposal would formally rescind the Trump rule and replace it when the proposal is made final in the coming months. Opponents could ask a federal judge to block the rule temporarily or strike it down, but administration officials expressed confidence that it would withstand judicial scrutiny.

Under Mr. Trump, the department argued that two factors should predominate in determinations of whether a worker is an employee or a contractor, even if other factors are relevant: the degree of control a company has over the worker, and the extent to which a worker can increase his or her income by taking entrepreneurial initiative, like marketing his or her services.

The Trump Labor Department suggested that gig workers like Uber drivers would probably be considered contractors under these criteria. Proponents argued that the Trump approach was necessary so enforcement didn’t snuff out new ways of doing business, such as the gig economy.

But in an interview, Seema Nanda, the Biden Labor Department’s top lawyer, said the Trump rule “threatens to actually increase rather than decrease misclassification.”

The proposal by the Biden Labor Department argues that several factors must be weighed when assessing whether a worker is a contractor or an employee, and that none of them are necessarily more important than the others. Among the additional factors are whether the work being performed is central to a company’s business, and what kind of investments workers make to do their jobs, such as buying equipment.

Administration officials cautioned that determining whether or not gig workers like Uber drivers are employees would hinge on applying the test laid out in the proposal to individual cases and that they were not prejudging the outcome of any one of them. They also emphasized that the proposal did not target a particular industry.

“We make a determination based on the specific facts in any case that we look at,” Ms. Nanda said. “Misclassification harms workers across a wide range of industries.”

Gig companies like Uber and Lyft have sought for years to influence laws and regulations on worker classification. After the California Legislature passed a bill that effectively classified gig drivers as employees in 2019, gig companies spent roughly $200 million helping to pass a ballot measure that would exempt their workers from employee status while granting them limited benefits.

A state judge later ruled that the measure was unconstitutional. The decision is being appealed.

Gig companies have tried and failed to enact similar measures in other liberal states, like New York and Massachusetts, but did help pass a contractor measure in Washington State.

Uber and Lyft have often argued that drivers prefer the flexibility that independent contractor status affords them, such as the ability to work when, where and however long they choose to. They have cited polling data that appears to affirm this.

Legal scholars point out that there is nothing inherent about employment status that would forbid companies to grant workers similar flexibility.

Asked in an interview this summer whether he thought drivers would prefer to be independent contractors or employees if the trade-offs were made clear, Mr. Walsh, the labor secretary, argued that “95 percent of people would say yes” to being classified as employees.

Companies, unions, workers and other members of the public will have a month and a half to formally comment on the proposal before the department incorporates feedback into a final rule.

personalfinance,Financing car options with credit card,"I am a 35 year old Uber driver working in the DC area. I have been renting fleet cars a long time and want to go back into owning a car, I have already decided the model after much research, it will be a Toyota Camry LE hybrid. I want two major upgrades aftermarket, a full body xpel ppf/clearbra wrap (~5000) and a leather seat installation by Katzkins (2200). They are both worth it to me and my long term plans for the car. The equivalent options from the dealer are both more expensive and worse quality, a pet peeve of mine since I also detail cars (table that, I could go for days).

The financing of the car will be expensive since my credit is not great, I won't post specifics but I expect to pay double digit percentage over the purchase price by the end of the term, I have run the numbers and believe me as a business expense it will still be in my favor compared to my current setup. However the approximately 7500 in aftermarket add ons would be expensive to get financed this way. 

Some dealerships give refund checks by increasing the loan principal size and handing you the difference, I don't want all that money taxed and charged my high interest rate on if I can avoid it. What options do I have for putting this secondary expense on a credit card for less interest? I have never had a credit card for reference. I use capital one bank and already pre qualified for a car loan through them but I can't really find human help, at branches they refer me to the app, I'm small potatoes I guess.

stocks,Bank of England's Bailey to Pension Funds: 'You've Got Three Days Left; You've Got to Get This Done' -WSJ,"**In case you are wondering why the market too a sharp turn down around 2:40 PM ET**

Source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/boe-adds-index-linked-gilts-to-bond-purchase-program-11665470476  
  
LONDON—The Bank of England extended support targeted at pension funds for the second day in a row, the latest attempt to contain a bond-market selloff that has threatened U.K. financial stability.

The central bank on Tuesday said it would add inflation-linked government bonds to its program of long-dated bond purchases, after an attempt on Monday to help pension funds failed to calm markets.

“Dysfunction in this market, and the prospect of self-reinforcing ‘fire sale’ dynamics pose a material risk to U.K. financial stability,” the BOE said.

The yield on a 30-year U.K. inflation-linked bond has soared above 1.5% this week, up from 0.851% on Oct. 7, according to Tradeweb. Just weeks ago, the yield on the gilt, as U.K. government bonds are known, was negative. Because yields rise as prices fall, the effect has been punishing losses for bond investors.

On Tuesday, after the BOE expanded the purchases, the yield on inflation-linked gilts held mostly steady but at the new, elevated levels. The central bank said it bought roughly £2 billion, equivalent to about $2.21 billion, in inflation-linked gilts, out of a £5 billion daily capacity.

The bank’s bond purchases, however, are meant to run out on Friday. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, a trade body that represents the pension industry, urged the central bank on Tuesday to extend its purchases until the end of the month.

The near-daily expansion of the Bank of England’s rescue plan highlighted the challenges facing central banks in stamping out problems fueled by a once-in-a-generation increase in inflation and interest rates. It also raised questions about whether the BOE was providing the right medicine to address the problem.

The turmoil sparked fresh demands on Monday for pension funds to come up with cash to shore up LDIs, or liability-driven investments, derivative-based strategies that were meant to help match the money they owe to retirees over the long term.

LDIs were at the root of the bond selloff that prompted the BOE’s original intervention. Pension plans in late September saw a wave of margin calls after Prime Minister Liz Truss’s government announced large, debt-funded tax cuts that fueled an unprecedented bond-market selloff.

The BOE launched its original bond-purchase program on Sept. 28, but it only restored calm for a couple of days before selling resumed. An expansion of the program on Monday backfired, with yields again soaring higher.

The selloff on Monday was “very reminiscent of two weeks ago,” said Simeon Willis, chief investment officer of XPS, a company that advises pension plans.

LDI strategies use leveraged financial derivatives tied to interest rates to amplify returns. The outsize moves in U.K. bond markets last month led to huge collateral calls on pensions to back up the leveraged investments. The pension funds have sold other assets, including government and corporate bonds, to meet those calls, adding to pressure on yields to rise and creating a spiral effect on markets.

Pensions are typically big holders of inflation-linked government bonds, which help protect the plans from both inflation and interest-rate changes. But these weren’t eligible in the BOE’s bond-buying program until Tuesday.

The U.K. helped pioneer bonds with payouts linked to inflation, sometimes referred to as linkers, in the 1980s. Linkers were originally sold exclusively to pensions, but the U.K. opened them to other investors over the years.

Pensions remain a dominant force in the market because the bonds offer long-term protection against both inflation and interest-rate changes. Their outsize role left the market vulnerable to shifts in pension-fund demand like that seen in recent weeks.

Adam Skerry, a fund manager at Abrdn with a focus on inflation-linked government bonds, said his firm has struggled to trade those assets in recent days.

“We were trying to sell some bonds this morning, and it was virtually impossible to do that,” he said. “The LDI issue that’s facing the market, the fact that the market is moving to the degree that it did, particularly yesterday, suggests that there’s still an awful lot [of selling] there.”

Pensions have also appeared hesitant to sell their bonds to the BOE, reflecting a mismatch in what the central bank is offering and what the market needs.

“The way that the bank has structured this intervention is they can only buy assets if people put offers into them, but nobody is putting offers in,” said Craig Inches, head of rates and cash at Royal London Asset Management. He said the pension funds would rather sell their riskier assets, including corporate bonds or property.

Mr. Willis of XPS said many pensions want to hold on to their government bonds because it helps protect pensions against changes in interest rates, which impact the way their liabilities are valued.

“If they sell gilts now, they’re doing it in the likelihood that they’ll need to buy them back in the future at some point and they might be more expensive, and that’s unhelpful,” he said.

Also plaguing the program: Pension funds are traditionally slow-moving organizations that make decisions with multidecade horizons. The market turmoil has hurtled them into the warp-speed-style moves usually reserved for traders at swashbuckling hedge funds.

To make decisions about the sale of assets, industry players describe a game of telephone playing out among trustees, investment advisers, fund managers and banks. Pension funds spread their assets among multiple managers, which are in turn held by separate custodian banks. Calling everyone for the necessary signoffs is creating a lengthy and involved process.

To give themselves more time, pension funds are pushing the BOE to extend the bond-buying program at least to the end of the month. That is when the U.K.’s Treasury chief, Kwasi Kwarteng, is expected to lay out the government’s borrowing plans for the coming year.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on the budget, warned Tuesday that borrowing is likely to hit £200 billion in the financial year ending March, the third highest for a fiscal year since World War II and £100 billion higher than planned in March of this year. Increased borrowing increases the supply of bonds and generally causes bond yields to rise.

Mr. Kwarteng on Tuesday declared his confidence in BOE Gov. Andrew Bailey as he faced questions from lawmakers for the first time in his new job.

“I speak to the governor very frequently and he is someone who is absolutely independent and is managing what is a global situation very effectively,” he said.",finance,1665515321

personalfinance,Advice on investing my traditional 401k with Fidelity?,"**Background**: 

I got my first full-time job at 24 and I currently contribute 12% of my pre-tax income. My employer matches 100% up to 2%. It's early days, but I'm at ~$1,000 and it's invested in what Fidelity defaulted to when I opened the account (Fidelity Freedom 2065 Fund Class K (FFSDX)).

I went with a traditional 401k because I wasn't sure what my taxable income would look like in retirement and I assumed it would be the same or less than what it is now (currently at $80k/yr, 22% federal bracket, no state income tax with no plans to move to a state that has it) but I have no idea. I figure that even if it was more, it wouldn't go past the 24% bracket, but, again, no idea. And if I stayed in the same bracket that would just mean more money making interest for longer with traditional. Unless my income increases substantially, I might split between traditional and Roth, not sure.

**Anyway:**

So, I don't know if I should stay in the target date fund that Fidelity put me in or to try choosing investments myself. I also have the option of a managed account but many people on this subreddit, including the wiki, say that indexed outperforms actively managed. But, wouldn't that advice also apply to myself attempting to build a three-fund portfolio? And the other issue is that the target date fund I'm currently invested in isn't the one with ""index"" in the name, which the wiki also warns about, and I don't even seem to have that [option](https://i.imgur.com/3XfIpYO.png) [available.](https://i.imgur.com/rlnBY3r.png)

[This](https://i.imgur.com/ZJJYHPw.png) is what Fidelity wants to do with a managed account given all the info I put into their survey thing, but of course there are additional [fees](https://i.imgur.com/HuC21m6.png) (this doesn't include the planned credit amount which they don't give an estimate for). 

Given that I don't have the indexed target date fund available to me, would paying the additional fees for the managed account be worth considering? Especially because the other option would be to do it myself and clearly I don't have the expertise for that. Or should I just leave it on FFSDX, even though it's not the indexed version, and forget about it?",finance,1665518326
personalfinance,Should we rent our current place and rent a larger place to live? Should we move away from HCOL and current lifestyle? Help!,"Hello! I'm just looking for advice for how to go about our current situation, what steps to take first, how to plan, etc. since I feel like I'm sort of at a loss as to what to do next.

My husband and I currently own a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom condo in the Bay Area (very HCOL) with our toddler -- we currently share a room with our toddler and although it's tight (&lt;700 sq ft of space) it works. We drive a Tesla Model 3 (one-car household) that we charge at the supercharger, and our mortgage payments are just about $3300 (high, but within normal range for a 1 bed home for our area in the Bay Area). Husband and I work full time, and make around $300k (tech sector) together while putting away max for retirement. Daycare is about $2.5k/month for full-time care. We both work from home.

We will likely have to move in the very near future (within 6 months). Right now the housing market is a bit volatile, where it is a buyer's market but with an extremely high interest rate (our current interest rate is around 3%). We were considering buying a larger home with 2 bedrooms, but with the market as it is, the value of our home is currently lower than what we paid for it (3 years of ownership), and the cost of 2 bedroom homes in decent school areas are a little out of reach for our budget (around &gt;1.2 million + for our area). We were thinking that potentially we would want to rent out our current place and rent another 2 bedroom spot, but a reasonable rent will probably not cover the full mortgage, but we will be okay with managing the smaller loss with a lower monthly payment than what it would be to own (likely an extra $1k). Preferably, we would be in the same area to minimize disruption to our current lifestyle, but not 100% sure if this is the way to go.

My questions and concerns I would love to get insight from you guys are:

\- Is renting out our current place and renting out another place nearby a good temporary solution for now? Most 2 bedrooms rent out for about 3.6-5k depending on the area. We would aim for the lower end to minimize costs. Or should we just consider selling instead, and wait for the market to stabilize before purchasing again? We are hesitant on purchasing another home since we don't know what our 5 year outlook looks like, but also want to maximize our current home purchase. For the math, we could probably rent out our home for about $2700k, leaving just about $1k in extra we would be paying (probably towards equity?). Renting a 2bed in the current area would cost probably up to 4k, so looking at about up to $5k total cost per month.

\- Which should we do first? Find a property manager to manage the rental process first, or find a place to live first? We do not plan on doing the rental management ourselves. We have some fixes that we will need to do to the home to prepare it for someone else to live in it (i.e. paint, hardwood floor, storage closet needs repair, etc), so not sure if it is better to be out of the home and pay a month or two of mortgage+rent while we figure that out, or do that first then move.

\- We have thought about moving to a lower cost of living area, but this comes with lifestyle changes. We prioritize walkability and distance to nearby shops/downtown areas/grocery stores. Since we live in a very walkable area, we have been able to live a one-car household lifestyle and bike/walk/use public transit to places and just in general being near to people lol. We also have concerns about availability of charging infrastructure. This is what we prefer, and fear that the cheaper the cost of living, the higher the reliance on using two cars (and potentially going back to a gas car, which we would prefer not to) and less walkability and social interactions. Our salaries will probably be lowered to adjust to the local cost of living as well. Any advice or ideas as to how to balance that out? Suggestions on other areas to consider would be really helpful!  Our closest family lives in the New England area, but I honestly would prefer to have that as a last resort, although we do want to consider being closer to family.

\- Should we try to move sooner rather than later? The latest we can move will probably be around February, where we have a 3-week trip to Europe for the Christmas/early Jan season. How should we time moving?

Any info or insight or pieces of advice would be helpful! This is slightly stressing me out so some direction towards a path of clarity would be nice lol.",finance,1665521547

I plan to do just that, and purchase $20,000 of the bonds before the end of October.  I understand that interest is compounded semi-annually so then if my logic is sound, I should leave the 20K in the bonds for as long as I feel that the combined interest rate is better than what I could get in the market, correct?  And, of course, if we get to October of next year and that rate is still better than the return on the market, double down and buy 20K more.  

And, if I purchase the bonds on say, October 15th, does that set the date in stone where I can sell the bond and liquidate the investment?  Can you sell anytime or only at the 6 or 12 month anniversary date?

personalfinance,Are 401k withdrawals taxed based on the state rates of the current residence at the withdrawal time?,"Trying to enroll into one of my employer’s retirement plans and I have some questions regarding 401k’s.

1. So for a traditional 401k you are taxed the moment you withdraw money (assuming after 59.5). My understanding is that since it’s income, it’s taxed as such, under federal, state, and possibly city taxes. So the federal rate is the same wherever but the state rate differs. So how does that work? Do I get taxed based on my current residence at the moment I make the withdrawals? Or is it based on the residence of the employer or where I’ve made the contributions? If the former, could I move my residence from a high-income-tax state like CA to a lower-income-tax state, say TX, and then withdraw the money, in order to pay less taxes?
2. I am taxed for both the withdrawals and the marginal/capital gains - whichever is the one that applies to gains from interest over the years. Is this correct?
3. What is the point of a Roth 401k? Like is there an actual benefit to it? Your contributions are after tax so it doesn’t lower your taxable income. The only benefit is that earnings are tax free. So do we expect the savings in income tax from a traditional 401k to be less than the savings from not paying tax on capital gains? How do I figure out  paying less in income taxes but paying more in earnings when retiring VS paying more income tax vs not paying any taxes for earnings in retirement?
4. My company also offers converting after-tax contributions to Roth savings within the plan so I guess I could use that for my yearly bonus to avoid the risk of the bonus payout bumping me up into a higher income tax bracket. What’s the best strategy here? Do I max out my traditional 401k contributions and then contribute the rest like bonuses or whatever sum is needed to bump down to a lower bracket into a Roth account?

We will be back at vet in a few days and hoping for some opinions on what to ask for/about. 

Adopted as a rescue at 5 months old and from then until about 11 months old she had chronic recurrent diarrhea and intermittent vomiting. She was also an absolute vacuum which I’m sure contributed. During those 6 months, we did several fecals, she had hookworms once and tested positive for giardia twice. Symptoms resolved minimally if at all after deworming and subsequent negative fecals. Tried a couple different foods and many many bland diet “resets.”  The bland diets helped, but symptoms would return. Did bloodwork at one point, everything came back normal.

Finally the vet put her on prescription diet trial and probiotic powder which helped very quickly. Did a very slow transition to Purina Pro Plan sensitive skin and stomach lamb formula and started using an OTC probiotic powder after what the vet prescribed ran out. Symptoms stayed dramatically improved, but we still are cautious about introducing any new treats. She will get occasional soft stool after daycare days, but self resolves….

Until the last two weeks. The diarrhea is back much more regularly. Negative fecal. Diarrhea is not nearly as bad as it once was and no vomiting. Symptoms worse at night. Nothing has changed with her diet or routine. She is no longer a vacuum (thank goodness!). She is fed twice daily, morning and night, same amount at each meal, probiotic with each meal. Appetite and activity unaffected.

CryptoCurrency,Long-term inflation proofed gilts have now been outperformed by bitcoin,[deleted],cryptocurrency,1665534119
Bitcoin,It's interesting the variety of people who come to Bitcoin,"Bitcoin has cypherpunk / libertarian / anarchist roots. Over the years of growth and adoption, the variety of actors has grown and it is now being embraced by traditional financial institutions.

When I listen to people like Kevin O'Leary who say Bitcoin needs regulation, because of the sovereign wealth funds and whatnot need it, it admittedly makes me cringe. Sovereign wealth funds? WTF is that and who needs those?

He talks about auditors, regulators, compliance departments and all those things of the rotten legacy system I loathe and don't give two hoots about. I can't help but feel like some people view Bitcoin as yet another ticker - a symbol with a chart, like Amazon of Google stock that you trade and store on centralized exchanges or brokerages, without any regard for or understanding of what the underlying asset actually is, what values it represents, what lies behind it - the ingenious technology, the open-source community, the grassroots movement, the brave souls that fight for the most fundamental human right that is the sovereignty of the individual in the increasingly Orwellian world. He calls cypherpunks ""crypto cowboys"" and says ""we don't need their crap"".

If Bitcoin is to be yet another ticker, do we need it? We already have thousands of stocks, fiat currencies and commodities. You can trade them, long or short, all you want; adding one more doesn't make the world a better place.

Or does it? Maybe it does. For example, even regulated, it's still a hedge against inflation like no other, because its monetary policy is controlled by a decentralized protocol and unaffected by regulation. So there is this other part of me that's trying to see the positives of regulation.

Do I want Bitcoin to forever be this funny internet money that computer nerds use to buy pizza from one another, or do I want it to be more than that? The answer is: I want widespread adoption. I want to be able to use it everywhere and I want it to become the world's #1 currency/asset, because the more people use this freedom technology, the more people have freedom as an option. And yes, it will pump my bags, no shame in admitting that.

The good thing is, even if it's regulated for those who need or want regulation, it will never be regulated for those who use it the way it was originally intended to: on chain, p2p. Only centralized custodians can be regulated; the chain is decentralized and no regulation can change that. That's the beauty of Bitcoin: it can be a dual system, with centralized and decentralized parts, each serving its purpose and complementing each other to the degree that each individual actor desires (and centralization clearly has its uses; for one, it's efficient. I don't necessarily want to pollute the blockchain with every limit order I put in and pay tx fees for it; that's also the reason there are layer 2 solutions in crypto in general). Now, centralized doesn't necessarily mean regulated or KYC'd; the nature of Bitcoin as a 'sendable' asset (as opposed to an IOU) means I can send it to an offshore exchange where regulations are less strict or non-existent. This ability to send value freely creates a perfect environment for jurisdictional competition and arbitrage. Centralized coins go (over decentralized rails) where laws are what the users - and not the politicians - want them to be.

Institutions can hold their coins with regulated custodians, bringing tons of money into it and stabilizing the price. Traders can trade it on regulated exchanges providing liquidity and making the market more efficient. No harm in that. Maybe it's all meant to be part of Bitcoin's maturation. At the same time, I can send my coins permissionlessly to whoever I want - no one can take that freedom away from me - while benefiting from the adoption, stability and steady price growth.

Of course there is always the Tornado-type threat, whereby regulators declare the coins that have interacted with certain addresses tainted and prohibit exchanges within their jurisdiction from accepting them. But if they go too far, people can always move offshore or go 100% p2p. So it seems like a perfectly self-regulating system and on multiple levels; the closest to anarcho-capitalism mankind has ever seen.

economy,How the Federal Reserve Interest Rates Affect Our Economy,"Before we talk about **how Federal Reserve interest rate adjustments affect our economy**, let’s look at **why the Federal Reserve raises interest rates**. 

Because raising **interest rates** is something that must be talked about, then it’s easy to talk about and understand how interest rate adjustments **affect** the economy.

## Why Does the Federal Reserve Increase Interest Rates?

The **Federal Reserve** looks at various economic indicators to decide whether to **raise** or **lower** interest rates.

They may look at **inflation, unemployment numbers,** or **other indicators**. That is the most important thing. Do they want the economy to **speed up** or **slow down**?

A prime example is when central banks **lower interest rates** when the **economy** starts to **slow down**. They do this to stimulate the economy. [Read The Full Article.](https://powersformind.com/how-the-federal-reserve-interest-rates-affect-our-economy/)",finance,1665539522
stocks,"Are they lying, I wonder: U.S. economy is 'doing well' amid global economic uncertainty, says Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.","Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday that the U.S. economy is ""doing very well"" as rising energy prices, a Covid-19 variant and Russia's war with Ukraine have sent global markets into a tailspin.

&amp;#x200B;

""From a U.S. perspective, I think the U.S. is doing very well,"" Yellen told CNBC's Sara Eisen on Tuesday. The Treasury secretary is meeting with world financial leaders this week in Washington, D.C., at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

&amp;#x200B;

She said the economy is expected to slow after a very strong recovery, but the latest jobs report released last week shows the economy is ""very resilient."" The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that nonfarm payrolls rose by 263,000 in September, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent, tied for the lowest level since late 1969.

&amp;#x200B;

However, consumers are somewhat constrained by the fact that prices are rising at the fastest pace in nearly 40-plus years. The latest New York Fed Consumer Expectations Survey shows that consumers expect inflation to be at 5.4% a year from now, the lowest figure in a year and down from 5.75% in August.

&amp;#x200B;

This level peaked at 6.8% in June and has been declining since then, as the central bank has instituted a series of interest rate hikes totaling 3 percentage points. The market largely expects the Fed to continue raising rates until it brings inflation down to its long-term target of 2 percent.

&amp;#x200B;

Yellen acknowledged that inflation is too high and that lowering it is a priority for the Biden administration. But she said there are ways to do that while maintaining a healthy labor market.",finance,1665540097

I also did not receive my $750 TABOR refund from the state of Colorado.  I know everything went through since I received a letter from the IRS in May stating that I suck at math and did my taxes wrong (my claimed refund amount was less than what I was entitled to).  This letter said I would be receiving my refund as a check.  Everytime I attempt to call either the IRS or the taxpayer advocate service I get a message that they cannot take my call due to high volume and it hangs up.  

CDOR told me that they would mail me a form to fill out and send back -- the form was supposed to arrive in 3-5 weeks and my refund and TABOR check in 5-7 weeks after they receive my form back.  This was over a month ago and I haven't yet received the form.

I have always used my credit card like a deferred debit card, making sure to pay it off in full every time I get paid. However, I've been unemployed for a little while, I've run through most of my cash savings, and I have a credit card bill coming up that I don't have the cash to pay in full.

I have a fair amount of money in a standard brokerage account, which I've invested in index funds and target date funds. (I don't anticipate retirement for at least a decade at the very earliest.) Unfortunately, the market is down 25% from the start of the year, and so are my investments. I could sell enough shares of these funds to pay off my credit card bill, but it would be at a loss, and I'm loath to ""sell low."" (If it matters, I also have other investments in tax-advantaged retirement accounts.)

On the other hand, I could just make the minimum payment, and start accruing interest on the rest. My card has an interest rate of 16.99% APY. 

I have a few job leads that I hope pan out soon, but even if I got a job tomorrow, my first paycheck probably won't come for at least a month, as payments in arrears is standard in my industry. Realistically, I'll probably have at least two credit card bills due before I have regular cash flow again.

In normal circumstances, I'd hate to accrue debt while I had the resources to avoid it, but my investments are down so far I wonder if it might be better to take on the debt, accept the hit to my credit score, and pay it off once I have the cash to do so, in order to avoid selling at such a low point for the market.

# [Stock futures rise ahead of key inflation data, Fed minutes](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Wednesday as investors awaited the latest inflation numbers and the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 151 points, or 0.53%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.69% and 0.89%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The moves came after the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.65% and 1.1%, respectively, to post their fifth straight day of declines. The Dow ended the day on a higher note, up about 36 points, but gave back most of its gains from a rally earlier in the session.
*****
&gt; Stocks fell from their highs, and bond yields ticked up, when the Bank of England said its market intervention will be over soon and pension funds have just three days to rebalance positions.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking forward to the September producer price index, a gauge of final-demand wholesale prices, due to be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are expecting headline PPI to increase 0.2%, after declining 0.1% in the previous month.
*****
&gt; The minutes from the Federal Reserve’s September meeting will also be released Wednesday. While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has acknowledged that aggressive interest rate increases could be painful, the central bank will continue to charge forward in its fight to lower inflation.
*****
&gt; “Powell has repeated, in what has become his mantra, that without price stability we cannot have a strong economy or a strong labor market,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Investors are concerned that restrictive monetary policy, that is, tighter financial conditions, could lead to the kind of financial accident that dries up liquidity and delivers more harm to the global economy.”

investing,"Wholesale prices rose 0.4% in September, more than expected as inflation persists","Main points:

* The producer price index increased 0.4% for September, compared with the Dow Jones estimate for a 0.2% gain.

* Excluding food, energy and trade services, the index increased 0.4% for the month and 5.6% from a year ago.

From the article:

&gt; The Fed has responded by raising rates five times this year for a total of 3 percentage points and is widely expected to implement a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase when it meets again in three weeks.

&gt; However, Wednesday’s data shows the Fed still has work to do. Indeed, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester on Tuesday said “there has been no progress on inflation.” Following the PPI release, traders priced in an 81.3% chance of a three-quarter point hike, the same as a day ago.

personalfinance,Help with finances/savings for someone financially illiterate?,"Hi! I've been trying to become more financially responsible, but feel overwhelmed while trying to educate myself. I am trying to figure out the most responsible way to invest/save my money and future income. Some basic info:
- Make $75,000/year in my full time job. Contribute 5% to a 403b with employer match.
- Make an additional ~$45,000 from a part time job.
- Live in a very HCOL area, so monthly expenses are fairly high.
My current investments/savings include:
- $65,000 in a normal interest rate bank account
- $10,000 in a 403b, I just let them do the investing.
- $5,000 in a SEP-IRA through Vanguard (friend set it up, not sure what the investments mean but it's 60% stocks, 40% bonds).
- $10,000 in I Bonds.

I know I am not wise to have a large sum of money in savings and do not know how to proceed. I am  31, and just recently started my career, so I am concerned my retirement accounts are low. Would appreciate any and all advice on investing/how to better prepare financially.

investing,Sky-High I Bond Interest Rate Will Be Coming Down to Earth,"Annual inflation is still roaring, but the I Bond formula looks back six months; expect a drop of about 3 percentage points

Inflation-adjusted [Series I savings bonds](https://www.wsj.com/articles/series-i-savings-bonds-what-you-should-know-11652834560?mod=article_inline) have been the most enticing place to park your cash this year—[nearly 10% interest](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-safe-investment-that-will-soon-yield-almost-10-11649769505?mod=article_inline), backed by the U.S. government, the safest investment around. In a few weeks, a little of the luster will fade.

I Bonds would likely pay about 6.4% interest beginning Nov. 1 if the consumer-price index rises as economists expect by 0.2% monthly and 8.1% year-over-year. [Savers loaded up on I Bonds](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-flock-savings-bonds-for-protection-against-inflation-11643850044?mod=article_inline) when the rate leapt to 9.62% in May, the highest interest rate since I Bonds were introduced in 1998. 

September CPI figures, which are used to compute the I Bond rate for the six months beginning in November, are set to be released Thursday. Bonds bought from May through the end of October will earn 9.62% for six months before adjusting to reflect the new inflation data.

Even at a lower interest rate, I Bonds are likely to offer a yield that is at least 2 percentage points higher than a 30-year U.S. Treasury bond and more than 40 times the average U.S. savings-account interest rate.

I Bonds could pay more than 6.4%, even if inflation comes in as expected: The rate on I Bonds includes a fixed rate for the 30-year life of the bond and an inflation-adjusted rate that changes every six months. The fixed rate has been 0% since May 2020, and the last time it was above 1% was in 2007. The Treasury Department sets the fixed rate at the discretion of the treasury secretary.

personalfinance,Can’t determine the best route for housing,"Another housing post.

My Fiancé and I have been together 8 years, living together for 3. We’re both 28. We live in Northern NJ, right outside of Manhattan. We rent, love our city/area, but getting priced out/running out of space. 

Obviously, it seems like a bad time to be doing anything. Our wedding is Spring ‘24 and we pretty much have worked that into our budget/have funds saved. Buying a home seems like either a bad decision or completely unrealistic given that interest rates and home values would put us with a mortgage above our current rent ($2150) and that doesn’t include everything that comes with homeownership/closing costs/etc. In our area homes go between $400-$550k.

Should we just continue to rent or look into buying something cheaper like a townhouse to build equity? Seems like we can get a 2 bedroom for around $250-300K. 

Our finances: 

Combined pre tax income: $190k

I have no loans/debt. She has a low interest $300 car payment and some student loans left.

I have $25k in savings, $20k in my stock account, $50k in my 401k. 

She has $9k in her stock account, $46K in savings. 


The biggest factor in not continuing to rent is price, space, continuous moving, and we have two cats and a dog. Finding places with pets kinda sucks. We both feel pretty safe in our jobs and have kept emergency funds, but concerns with the enconomy do shake us a bit.",finance,1665585568
personalfinance,(USA) How do I start with real-estate investing with low capital and low annual income?,"We have cash sitting in the bank (around 200k) and would like to make good investments with it (or it'll keep depreciating with inflation). We were planning on acquiring a  property then renting it out. I am aware about the current housing drama, the FED, high interest rates, and the potential FED pivot or a continuation of their mandate to keep tightening the market to fight inflation. I try to keep up with economic news as best as I can. Current times may/may not be the right time to push with this endeavor so, we want to be prepared when the right time comes. I was wondering if someone could redirect us to good sources about real estate investing so we don't get hyped up by youtube investing gurus. Or, share their experiences about real-estate investing and how they got started. 

Is it even possible for us to acquire a house? we are a young couple so our annual incomes are in the low end of things.  We do have parents that offered to be guarantors or co-signers so that's a plus.

defi,Thoughts on defi concept?,"I have been building a protocol that is what i call a ""distribution primitive"".

The idea is to allow anyone, similar to yearn, to create pools, but much different.  Each pool can have multiple assets and each asset is connected to one or many protocols.

To keep things simple, I will give an example on a pool with only two assets, DAI and WETH

Assuming we launch onto Ethereum, USDC will be integrated into Aave V2, Aave, V3, and Compound.  WETH will have the same integrations.

Focusing on USDC, through our distribution optimization algorithm, we allocate USDC in perfect amounts between each integrated protocol to optimize income for the highest possible yield.

Skip to the  😀  to not have a look into the algorithms

The algorithm is a multi variable optimization algorithm that takes interest rate models into effect alongside amount.  What this means is, the formula will check the resulting APR AFTER we complete our supply to their pool.  We don't simply check APR only.

This formula isn't an accurate depiction and only takes into account a linear slope graph with no kinks.  Today, all interest rate models have kinks.  Showing this with kinks would take up too much time.

**Formula:**

Here, we are checking Aave V2 (59% LTV) and Aave V3  (40% LTV) against their current models to find how much we should supply 100 USDC to either or both to get the highest return

((((.04 \* (59/(100+x)) / .6) \* x) + ((.04 \* (40/(100+y)) / .6) \* y))) / 100 = x,y

Aave V2

.04 \* (59/(100+64.529)) / .6 = 0.023906 *\* 64.529 = 1.542630274*

Aave V3

.04 \* (40/(100+35.471)) / .6 = 0.019684 *\* 35.471 = 0.698211164*

*(1.542630274+0.698211164)/100*

weighted\_apr = 0.02240841438

&amp;#x200B;

You can test this and see, its the best possible distribution

😀

&amp;#x200B;

I think its cool, hope you do too.

&amp;#x200B;

It gets even cooler.  Each pool that we or users deploy can enable borrowing.  Therefore, users can use their optimized supply to borrow other assets in the pool (based on Aave V3/Euler like system, such as isolation, cross collateral, debt/supply ceilings, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

Why would I even borrow?

Our borrow rates are reactive off of our supply rates.  Meaning, if we are optimizing USDC to get the highest possible interest rate of 2.2%, users can borrow at 2.2%.  In other protocols, this is impossible for debt and supply rates to ever match.  Since we practice distribution, all we are doing is offsetting our borrow rates.  As long as the borrow rate is &gt;= supply rate, we only increase our supply rate.

Example time:

Assume Aave V3 has the highest USDC rate of 5% and we are matching that.

In Aave, to borrow USDC, it will cost 10% APR.

In this protocol, is will start at 5% APR, creating arbitrage opportunity.

Let's assume users borrow USDC up to the blockchains average borrow rate of 8% (made up) and that got our USDC loan to value ratio to 50%.  This means, not only are borrowers getting arb opportunities, optimized supply rates, and average borrow rates, suppliers are now receiving an interest rate of 6.5%, beating the absolute highest supply rate available by 30%!

&amp;#x200B;

While the previous focuses on supply side optimization for yield, the use cases are actually endless.  We can even create a pool that focuses on the lowest interest rates possible in order to allow borrowers to borrow at the LOWEST rates available.

&amp;#x200B;

We plan on building lending protocol optimization pools, Uniswap V3 pools (over arrakis) optimization, yield optimizer optimization, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

This is all possible due to the primitive nature.  From there, users can create arbitrage flash loan based strategies between protocols, stable arbitrage, liquidity arbitrage, asset class arbitrage, etc.

I recently made my first big purchase, a 2019 Tacoma, and I am wondering if I should just pay my loan off asap or ride it out? I originally placed 10k down on the truck and owe an additional 20k. I have 30k still in my savings and a net income of roughly 4k each month after all expenses (rent, bills, etc..). 

This is my first loan ever, so I am really just looking for advice. There is no penalty in my state for paying off early. 

My options are to pay my monthly payments over the 6 year loan period, pay more each month to pay it off sooner, or take from my savings and pay the loan off in full immediately. 

Interest rate is 5.99% over 72months. Over the 6 year period, the interest amounts to about 5k… so I’m really turned off to the idea of paying minimum payments but would love to hear advice

My credit score is a 780, which has been built on one credit card I’ve had for the last ten years which I use for small purchases like gas and groceries and pay off each month. I’ve never had any other loans, so I’m not sure how paying off early would impact my credit",finance,1665589383

# Some Briefing

I made adjustments and fixed some numbers from my last analysis. The Final Price is the average of all the evaluation methods listed.

* *Graham Fair Value Formula*
* *CFO Evaluation*
* *Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow*
* *Dividend Discount Model*
* *Total Payout Valuation Model*

**Changes from the previous post:**

* **Use of Annual Data**: In the last one I used quarterly data and forecasted it as it was annual lol (what an idiot)
* **Use of Unlevered Free Cash Flow**: I used Free Cash flow to do DCF in the last one
* **Use of Growth Rate calculated by me**
* **Tax of 8.46%** calculated by me, in the last one i just guessed one randomly loool
* **Fixed Unlevered Beta**: Used MCap and Long tern &amp; Short Term Debt to calculate Unlevered Beta instead of using Shareholders Equity

**Final Introductory Notes:**

* **I did not compare Intel to is competitors** nor the industry sector, i plan to, this is just a quick analysis
* **I didn't do the Scenario Analysis** to forecast the revenue from Intel's product segments, i factored all the possible variations in sales with a conservative estimate of the company growth of 0.71%, the number is based on its last year's net earnings. The growth rate of 0.71% is used in every valuation methods used. Note: Analysts growth rate for the next 5 years for Intel is: -0.16%
* To better calculate the growth rate, i need the percentage of earnings that are not distributed to investors. I calculated the retained one as 71.59% and the distributed portion of 28.41%. I am not sure if this is correct, thus i assumed a retention rate of 5% to be conservative, if you have some indication please do not restrain yourself thanks!
* In the Dividend Discount Model, i used the calculated company growth rate of **0.71%** and not the average of the last 9 years of 5.64%. This is due to the fact that i see it as an unreasonable growth rate for dividend for the next near future. This model is based of Gordon's Growth Model (with constant growth in dividend).
* **As Discount Rate, i used mainly CAPM** form most of the evaluation methods, even tho i calculated WACC, i used it only for the Total Payment Valuation Method.
* **I made also a Risk Analysis**, but i think it is fucked up, and thus it shall not be considered at all and skipped lol
* **Company has a cash burn rate of 0.50** and 6 months remaing, i dont know why, it seems odd not gonna lie but i still have to figure out what is wrong. It is calculated on FCF of 9,662,000 thousands and Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents of 4,827,000 thousands :/

# Ratios

*Quick Note: this is just indicative, i know i need more ratios and i need to compare them with industry and competitors to better have an adjusted commentary on Intel's ratios, in the next post i will add more ratios like: ROIC, Accounts Receivable Turnover, Inventory Turnover, Accounts Payable Turnover, Debt to Equity, Quick Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio, Price to Book ratio, P/E etc (this list is not biding, some ratio listed could be not included), i will try to compare some with its historical variations.*

|Ratio|Numbers|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Working Capital**|2.10|The company can cover its short term expenses with its current assets|
|**Acid Test**|0.18|The company cannot cover its short term expenses with only its cash and cash equivalents|

Note: The Ratios section can be skipped.

# Risk Analysis

Following are factors that can impact the company Free Cash Flow:

* **Inflation rate increases**: Last Month's inflation decreased just a little bit, but that doesn't indicate that it will plunge soon, high probability to see it increase in the near future.
* **Unanticipated effects of interest rate hikes**: We know that the FED is trying everything to fight inflation, even spending and injecting more cash in the economy! We expected the last rates hike, and we expect another one soon.
* **Geopolitical events**: one word: \*reads it with Trump's voice\* ***China!***
* **Sales forecast, cost estimates, and cash conversion cycle inaccuracy**: It is forecasted by Intel itself a decrease on sales for the next near future due to demand decrease.
* **New competitors entering the market or taking market share**: AMD is smashing it and Intel is stagnating.

**Risk in Numbers (a historical overview)**

By observing the yearly variation of its Free Cash Flow, we can extrapolate some statistics.

* Average variation of Free Cash Flow for the last 10y: **8.18%**
* Variance of the data set: **10.57%**
* Standard Deviation: **32.51%**

*You might have some visualisation problems if you are from mobile, just scroll right the table*

|Method|Comment|
|:-|:-|
|**Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula**|Used in Value Investing taking in count EPS, growth rate and AAA bond yield. As for Intel's current situation, its value shall be round $33.14 in normal market conditions.|
|**FCF Evaluation**|Taking in mind CFO for 29,991,000 thousands, CapEx of 20,329,000 thousands and Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents of 4,827,000 thousands, Fair Value is 38.98 in Normal market conditions. Some said that Cash &amp; Cash equivalents is around 50B, but in the balance sheet i see only the Total Current Assets around that number. This gives us a price of $38.98|
|**Discounted Unlevelead Free Cash Flow**|This model observe past Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Forecast the growth of it for the next 5 years. Growth rate is a conservative 0.71% putting Fair Value Price for the next year to $19.22. Note that the future is unpredictable and this model shall use different growth rate for each year forecasted. The value is calculated assuming that the current market condition persists for the next 5 years.|
|**Dividend Discount Model**|This model observes the historical variation of Yearly Dividends. It is based on the principle that a Company Value is due to the Present Value of all its future dividends. Gordon's Growth Model is the DDM assuming a constant growth of the dividend and this DDM is based on that assumption. The fact that 5% growth is not sustainable in current market condition, i sued the calculated growth rate that i made, 0.71%, giving us a Value of $24.09 assuming a constant growth of dividend by that rate. This is conservative estimate.|
|**Total Payout Valuation Model**|This method is an alternative to DDM and try to extrapolate the Fair Value from its dividend payout. This method is the only one where i used WACC as discount rate. Why? cause the formula i got raid WACC instead of a general ""discount rate"" loooool.|

# Conclusions

As i stated, **this is just a preliminary analysis**, *i still have to integrate some data, ratios and take in mind many other variables!*

Intel is surely lagging behind it competitors and falling in the ""***Too Big To Fail***"" mentality which makes them too complacent and lazy in doing things good. I can's comment on management cause i still have to check it. Short Term and Long Term Debts are increasing, surely due to this year shenanigans in the overall market. We can observe a small increase in Unleveread Free Cash Flow and PP&amp;E. The company so far has paid dividend regularly, so if it is in severe situation, we shall expect it to stop distributing earnings, until then, we shall not be alarmed.

We can expect Intel to stay undervalued for a while, macroeconomics sucks.

**In conclusion**, *Intel is following market movements and is in a geopolitical crossfire, which affects is competitors too. We shall not forget that it is in danger regarding lagging really hard behind competitors, they need to invest more in R&amp;D and Marketing, cut inventories and operational expenses, i sense some inefficiency in the Business Structure.*

* **I did not compare Intel to is competitors** nor the industry sector, i plan to, this is just a quick analysis
* **I didn't do the Scenario Analysis** to forecast the revenue from Intel's product segments, i factored all the possible variations in sales with a conservative estimate of the company growth of 0.71%, the number is based on its last year's net earnings. The growth rate of 0.71% is used in every valuation methods used. Note: Analysts growth rate for the next 5 years for Intel is: -0.16%
* To better calculate the growth rate, i need the percentage of earnings that are not distributed to investors. I calculated the retained one as 71.59% and the distributed portion of 28.41%. I am not sure if this is correct, thus i assumed a retention rate of 5% to be conservative, if you have some indication please do not restrain yourself thanks!
* In the Dividend Discount Model, i used the calculated company growth rate of **0.71%** and not the average of the last 9 years of 5.64%. This is due to the fact that i see it as an unreasonable growth rate for dividend for the next near future. This model is based of Gordon's Growth Model (with constant growth in dividend).
* **As Discount Rate, i used mainly CAPM** form most of the evaluation methods, even tho is calculated WACC, i used it only for the Total Payment Valuation Method.
* **I made also a Risk Analysis**, but i think it is fucked up, and thus it shall not be considered at all and skipped lol
* **Company has a cash burn rate of 0.50** and 6 months remaing, i dont know why, it seems odd not gonna lie but i still have to figure out what is wrong. Is is calculated on FCF of 9,662,000 thousands and Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents of 4,827,000 thousands :/

# Ratios

*Quick Note: this is just indicative, i know i need more ratios and i need to compare them with industry and competitors to better have an adjusted commentary on Intel's ratios, in the next post i will add more ratios like: ROIC, Accounts Receivable Turnover, Inventory Turnover, Accounts Payable Turnover, Debt to Equity, Quick Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio, Price to Book ratio, P/E etc (this list is not biding, some ratio listed could be not included), i will try to compare some with its historical variations.*

|Ratio|Numbers|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Working Capital**|2.10|The company can cover its short term expenses with its current assets|
|**Acid Test**|0.18|The company cannot cover its short term expenses with only its cash and cash equivalents|

Note: The Ratios section can be skipped.

# Risk Analysis

Following are factors that can impact the company Free Cash Flow:

* **Inflation rate increases**: Last Month's inflation decreased just a little bit, but that doesn't indicate that it will plunge soon, high probability to see it increase in the near future.
* **Unanticipated effects of interest rate hikes**: We know that the FED is trying everything to fight inflation, even spending and injecting more cash in the economy! We expected the last rates hike, and we expect another one soon.
* **Geopolitical events**: one word: \*reads it with Trump's voice\* ***China!***
* **Sales forecast, cost estimates, and cash conversion cycle inaccuracy**: It is forecasted by Intel itself a decrease on sales for the next near future due to demand decrease.
* **New competitors entering the market or taking market share**: AMD is smashing it and Intel is stagnating.

**Risk in Numbers (a historical overview)**

By observing the yearly variation of its Free Cash Flow, we can extrapolate some statistics.

* Average variation of Free Cash Flow for the last 10y: **8.18%**
* Variance of the data set: **10.57%**
* Standard Deviation: **32.51%**

# Comments on the Valuation Methods used

|Method|Comment|
|:-|:-|
|**Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula**|Used in Value Investing taking in count EPS, growth rate and AAA bond yield. As for Intel's current situation, its value shall be round $33.14 in normal market conditions.|
|**FCF Evaluation**|Taking in mind CFO for 29,991,000 thousands, CapEx of 20,329,000 thousands and Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents of 4,827,000 thousands, Fair Value is 38.98 in Normal market conditions. Some said that Cash &amp; Cash equivalents is around 50B, but in the balance sheet i see only the Total Current Assets around that number. This gives us a price of $38.98|
|**Discounted Unlevelead Free Cash Flow**|This model observe past Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Forecast the growth of it for the next 5 years. Growth rate is a conservative 0.71% putting Fair Value Price for the next year to $19.22. Note that the future is unpredictable and this model shall use different growth rate for each year forecasted. The value is calculated assuming that the current market condition persists for the next 5 years.|
|**Dividend Discount Model**|This model observes the historical variation of Yearly Dividends. It is based on the principle that a Company Value is due to the Present Value of all its future dividends. Gordon's Growth Model is the DDM assuming a constant growth of the dividend and this DDM is based on that assumption. The fact that 5% growth is not sustainable in current market condition, i sued the calculated growth rate that i made, 0.71%, giving us a Value of $24.09 assuming a constant growth of dividend by that rate. This is conservative estimate.|
|**Total Payout Valuation Model**|This method is an alternative to DDM and try to extrapolate the Fair Value from its dividend payout. This method is the only one where i used WACC as discount rate. Why? cause the formula i got raid WACC instead of a general ""discount rate"" loooool.|

# Conclusions

As i stated, **this is just a preliminary analysis**, *i still have to integrate some data, ratios and take in mind many other variables!*

Intel is surely lagging behind it competitors and falling in the ""***Too Big To Fail***"" mentality which makes them too complacent and lazy in doing things good. I can's comment on management cause i still have to check it. Short Term and Long Term Debts are increasing, surely due to this year shenanigans in the overall market. We can observe a small increase in Unleveread Free Cash Flow and PP&amp;E. The company so far has paid dividend regularly, so if it is in severe situation, we shall expect it to stop distributing earnings, until then, we shall not be alarmed.

**In conclusion**, *Intel is following market movements and is in a geopolitical crossfire, which affects is competitors too. We shall not forget that it is in danger regarding lagging really hard behind competitors, they need to invest more in R&amp;D and Marketing, cut inventories and operational expenses, i sense some inefficiency in the Business Structure.*

Also, I am just now starting my financial journey as a knowledgeable financial person, please don't judge or add opinions on my previous choices.

I will receive 10K from Biden's student debt relief, making my student debt total $60,981. This is between 9 different undergrad+grad loans under Nelnet (the new fed loan people) with various interest rates (3.8 to 6.8%). I also have 10K in credit card debt with a 4.2% APR through Capital One, my main bank. My current credit score is 780+ Now that I think we won't receive total loan forgiveness from govt., I'd like to consolidate my loans at a lower rate. My goal is to pay off my loans by 2023. I currently make 50k and expect to see a steady increase, but I don't expect to make more than 90k by 2023. 

I have heard I can also consolidate my credit card debt with student loans to one main bank like Sofi. However, being that my main bank is capital one, I get points and other credit for paying off the card. I have done some preliminary research and SoFi seems to have the lowest interest rates but would love advice on others' experiences with different loan providers.

My mortgage allows a PMI cancellation when you reach 78% LTV &amp; with a mortgage at least 2 years old. Since I was finally eligible to apply I had put my request in for a BPO.

The real estate agent who performed the BPO was being a medium PIA with me throughout the process. She rescheduled on me a few times, and then wanted to reschedule because it was raining. My 41-week pregnant wife was due any day so I told her no to the final reschedule request. Maybe this pissed her off.

Anyway after following up with Chase, they informed me that I actually LOST value on my home by about 10% of purchase price lol.  I know prices are starting to come down because of current rates, but you cannot convince me we are at pre-pandy levels. I already put in a dispute, not sure what this entails.

stocks,"Fed officials expect higher rates to stay in place, meeting minutes show","Federal Reserve officials have been surprised at the pace of inflation and indicated at their last meeting that they expect higher interest rates to remain in place until prices come down, according to minutes released Wednesday from the central bank’s September meeting.

In discussions leading up to a 0.75 percentage point rate hike, policymakers noted that inflation is especially taking its toll on lower-income Americans.

They reiterated rate hikes are likely to continue and higher rates prevail until the problem is showing signs of resolving.

“Participants judged that the Committee needed to move to, and then maintain, a more restrictive policy stance in order to meet the Committee’s legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability,” the meeting summary stated.

Officials further noted that with inflation “showing little sign so far of abating … they had raised their assessment of the path of the federal funds rate that would likely be needed to achieve the Committee’s goals.“

The meeting happened ahead of a recent flow of data showing that inflation pressures do remain elevated, though not at the pace they were earlier this year. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge of consumer price expenditures rose 6.2% from a year ago – 4.9% excluding food and energy – in August, according to data last week that was well above the central bank’s 2% target.

A report Wednesday showed producer prices rose 0.4% in September.

“Participants observed that inflation remained unacceptably high and well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent,” the minutes said. “Participants commented that recent inflation data generally had come in above expectations and that, correspondingly, inflation was declining more slowly than they had previously been anticipating.“

Members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted at the meeting that the economy needs to slow to get inflation to cool. They lowered their projections for the economy, expecting GDP to grow at just a 0.2% annualized pace in 2022 and just 1.2% in 2023, well below trend and big drop from 2021, which saw the strongest gains since 1984.

They said inflation was being driven by supply chain problems that were not limited to goods but also stressed to a shortage of labor.

However, officials also expressed optimism that policy would help loosen the labor market and bring down prices. Officials have said lately they don’t expect rates to stay high until inflation comes all the way down to 2%.

“Participants judged that inflation pressures would gradually recede in coming years,” the summary said.

The meeting concluded with the FOMC approving its third consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase, taking benchmark rates to a range of 3%-3.25%. Markets widely expect a similar-size increase to be approved at the next meeting in early November.

Officials did note that they see a point coming when the pace of rate hikes at least will decelerate, though they did not put a time frame on when that will happen.

The minutes said FOMC members noted it “would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation.“

They said that time would come after the fed funds rate had “reached a sufficiently restrictive level,” after which “it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time until there was compelling evidence that inflation was on course to return to the 2 percent objective.“

The summary of economic projections at the meeting pointed to a “terminal rate,” or end point of rate increases to be around 4.6%. Markets expect the Fed to hike into early 2023 then keep rates there through the year.

&amp;nbsp;

***Why?***

&amp;nbsp;

I originally built DCAStack as a tool to automate purchases on centralized exchanges. But now given the market conditions, general uneasiness and overall distrust with centralized entities; It became time to pivot and work on the next generation of DCAStack that would enable ***Trustless, Transparent, Trading***.

I built this web app because I was so fed up with the lack of options in Dollar Cost Averaging. The current situation with DCA is:

* Centralized exchange fees to DCA are too high
* Trading bot websites need your API keys
* Give up complete custody of your funds with no transparency

And so, DCAStack was reborn.  Built for the community, open sourced and hoping to restore your purchasing power :)


&amp;nbsp;

***How does it work?***

&amp;nbsp;

With the beauty of smart contracts, you no longer have to share your API keys with anyone to take advantage of dollar cost averaging tools. The best way to see DCA Stack is simply as an account you manage and fund to automate your dollar cost averaging schedules. 

To get started, you will need to deposit two things, gas and the token you want to sell to DCA into your desired token. So if you wanted to DCA into ETH every day with 1 DAI for 30 days, you would:

1.  Deposit 30 DAI (1 DAI x 30 trades)
2.  Deposit gas to cover 30 trades
3.  Let DCAStack do the rest! 


Here's what the dashboard looks like with an active schedule: https://i.imgur.com/XXJO7pf.png

Your funds are always liquid, so there are no lockups of any kind and you are free to withdraw any and all funds at your discretion. 

And here's the ability to manage your funds: https://i.imgur.com/3VnzREt.png

***Note on Bugs :O***

&amp;nbsp;

There will be bugs and due to this simple fact, we have decided to launch on the goerli testnet to address them. With the community's help, we'd love to gather feedback and help resolve all of them so that we can launch a bug free version on a L2. 

Anyone who submits feedback that helps resolve a bug or a critical issue, will get free trading for when we decide to add a fee schedule (TBD). We'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, improvements and anything else you have for DCAStack so please chime in on discord :)",cryptocurrency,1665598681

personalfinance,Best route out of the credit card hole I dug for myself,"I've badly mismanaged my money in general over the last decade, but previously I was able to avoid facing that problem due primarily to the fact that I was well-paid and had a strong support network. In the last several years I've become more isolated from that network, and my career has become increasingly unstable.

The result now is that I have several loans which I took out in order to eliminate my credit card debt, the most recent of which was near the beginning of this year. Immediately after the loan was set up, I lost my job with no severance. In the intervening time I paid my medical and house bills with credit cards.

I have now finally secured a much more stable job, but I now have the combined payments of several loans and multiple credit cards to deal with, which I'm aware is a five-alarm fire level emergency in terms of debt management.

I'd love some advice on the best route to try and lower my minimum monthly payments as much as possible, to free up as much cash flow as possible to provide both a buffer against disaster and as much discretionary cash as possible to put towards paying the debts off as quickly as possible.

Here are the numbers:

Income: $130,000/yr, probably about $7k/month after taxes.

Loans

* Wells Fargo Unsecured Personal Loan: $9680.68.
   * This is on a 5 year payment plan with a 1% APR and a $198 monthly payment.
* SoFi Unsecured Personal Loan: $54,360.24.
   * Monthly payment: $1,651.72
   * APR: 14.36%
   * I don't qualify for any sort of payment plan on this loan because it hasn't been open long enough, although I can call back and apply in January.
* USBank Car Loan: $23,266.57
   * Monthly payment: $474.77
   * APR: 4.2%
   * I don't qualify for a payment plan yet here either, although they told me to try back on November 3.

Credit Cards

* Wells Fargo: $15,556.75
   * APR: 11.65%
   * Min. Payment: $187
* Wells Fargo: $5,330.09
   * APR: 24.49%
   * Min. Payment: $168
* Apple Card: $6,239.55
   * APR: 24.24%
   * Min. payment: $400
* Best Buy Credit Card (Citibank): $1,362.04
   * APR: 26.74%
   * Min. payment: $36
* Alliant Credit Union: $14,480.09
   * APR: 10.49%
   * Min. payment: $446
   * Alliant has offered a payment plan which would close this account, while lowering the interest rate to 4% and the monthly payment to $274.
   * They also suggested I \*might\* qualify for a settlement, with a reduction in balance if I pay it off on a tight schedule (2-6 months?)
* Wells Fargo Line of Credit: $14,963.82 &lt;-- closed on a 1 year payment plan
   * APR: 1%
   * Payment: $305

&amp;#x200B;

I've spoken to Greenpath Financial, but from talking to them there are several of these companies (including Wells Fargo and SoFi) which they don't work with, so they wouldn't be able to offer assistance there. They can offer some reduction on some of the others--I told them I'd call back once I'd reached out to individual creditors, which I've now done.

The remaining option is that I have a balance transfer offer through Chase for up to $15,000. This would be a 5% transfer fee and a 0% APR through 12/2023, or a 4% transfer fee for a 0% APR through 11/2023.

Am I missing any other ways to look into lowering these payments so that I can apply as much money as possible to the debts with the highest APRs? Does it make sense to transfer a $15k balance away from the cards with the more punishing APRs (the Apple Card, the one WF Card, and the Best Buy Card) onto a new card through Chase, or am I missing something that will come back to bite me later?

Let's say, as married joint filers, our household income is 300k. That puts us in the federal bracket of 24% and state bracket of 6%, making our residual tax in this bracket 30% for the amount above the bottom of the bracket.

Is it correct to say that every dollar we are able to spend pre-tax (think hsa or insurance premiums, for example) actually costs us $0.70 of post tax income (provided we don't drop our taxable income below that bracket)?

investing,Won't higher interest rates make the housing component of the CPI basket increase dramatically?,"As I understand it, housing makes up around 30% of the total CPI figure. Also, from what I understand, the way housing is measured is via a survey of homeowners asking them how much they would ask in rent if they were going to rent their home. We have all heard how the monthly payments on mortgages are skyrocking thanks to higher interest rates which are now hovering around  7%. So if a person who bought a house in 2021 gets surveyed for the CPI and their mortgage payment is $1500 they would indicate in that survey that they need at least $1500/month in rent to cover that mortgage. If that same house was bought today and the payment is now around 100% higher than it was in 2021 that has got to show up in their response to the CPI survey question.  Wouldn't they need at least $3000 a month in rent to cover their mortgage expense? Thats a 100% increase in a 30% CPI component in 2 years. This seems huge to me.  

I realize they don't only survey **new** home buyers, but at some point people who are buying at these higher rates are going to become a bigger portion of the survey population and its going to have an impact.

We’re interested in getting a Honda SUV and saw that our dealership is offering 1.9-2.9% financing dependent on your loan term - this is significantly lower than any credit unions right now.

I typically would get preapproved from my credit union and go with my own financing, but seeing that no credit union is offering anything remotely close to that; I’m inclined to try dealership financing. 

Is this a dumb idea? I have no doubt that we would qualify for those rates because other than a mortgage, we have no debts and our credit is excellent.

personalfinance,Thinking of switching from 529 to I Bonds for college savings for my children,"I have three kids (8, 6, and 3 years old) with a fourth one due in December. For the past 3 years, I have been putting $45/week ($15 each account) into an 529 savings plan. In total, I've saved about $6,500 total for my kids to eventually use for college. 

Lately, I've been starting to have doubts about the utility of a 529. I think I'd rather save the money and give it to them to spend on something useful to better their lot in life instead of strictly for schooling purposes. Perhaps one of them would like to start a business instead of college, or use it to get some kind of certification. Plus, I'm not sure what the educational landscape will look like in 12-15 years and college might not even be as costly or needed to land good job. 

So, this has brought my attention to I Bonds. The current interest rate provided by them seems quite attractive. Since I plan to not need that money any time soon, it seems like they could potentially be a good investment. I have a few questions though:

1. Is it the worth the penalty I'll incur by moving the money out of the 529 accounts? What kind of penalty is usually involved? My understanding is that it's ~10%.

2. Would it be better to combine the money (~$6.5k) into one Treasury account and buy I Bonds with it that way? Or should I set up an account for each of my kids and buy I Bonds and gift it to their account?

3. Is it possible to automate the buying of I Bonds? If I keep spending $45 dollars a week, I can just invest it into I Bonds, right? How does that change my investment horizon and stuff?

4. Are there any other long term investment vehicles for education that I should look at? Does my current plan sound reasonable.

personalfinance,Buy out home mortgage at discount?,"Ok, this is my first time posting in this community and I am going to do my best to ""explain"" my question. I highly doubt it is a thing, but it would make sense to me if it was. 

Situation: My wife and I purchased our first condo in November 2020. Loan amount of $510,400. Interest rate 2.375% (no points). I realize this low interest rate is a HUGE asset over the next 30 years. 

During periods of high inflation, fixed-rate debtors (us) are in a great position. Lenders who lent at 2.375% (our mortgage company) are actually losing money to inflation. 

I would view our mortgage like a US government bond. The loan company gave us $510,000 cash to buy our condo for an agreed upon 2.375% interest over 30 years. Since interest rates have abruptly gone skyward, I would imagine our ""mortgage bond"" would have dropped in value hard. No lender is going to want to buy a 2.375% mortgage from our current lender, right? 

My question: would a mortgage lender be willing to ""sell"" the mortgage at below face value? Since there is a very good chance they are not going to come out on top or even close over 30 years. If inflation is 3% average over the next 25 years, the value of the dollar is cut by 50%. Wouldn't our mortgage company want let's say $400,000 right now rather than the \~$575,000 over the next 28 years? That's how a bond would work. No one would touch a 2.375% bond right now at its original price. 

I'm not even saying we should do it, but I would think the mortgage lender would essentially want to get our loan off their books as it will be a loss leader over time (most likely). Heck, they already ""lost"" more than 10% on it due to inflation over less than 2 years.",finance,1665629582

investing,Solvency Constraints -- Views from a senior trader of the Fed's open markets desk,"(Via [https://fedguy.com/solvency-constraints/](https://fedguy.com/solvency-constraints/))

The dollar rally may be set to continue as limits on quantitative  tightening bind other central banks before it binds the Fed. The [tail risks of QT](https://www.barrons.com/articles/federal-reserve-quantitative-tightening-stock-market-51662736146)  have first appeared in the gilt market, where significant price  volatility prompted official intervention. What appears to be a  liquidity issue will ultimately become a financial stability issue as  investors discover their “safe assets” are not safe. These concerns may  prompt a policy response similar to that seen in Japan, where the price  of sovereign debt is explicitly supported. Just as yield curve control  led to significant Yen weakness, so a similar move by other central  banks would also severely weaken their currencies. This post describes  the link between bonds and financial stability, notes the existence of a **central bank “put” on bonds**, and suggests other central banks would likely cave first.

## When “Safe Assets” are not Safe

A  steady upwards march of sovereign yields would likely lead to financial  instability by pushing some financial sector entities into insolvency. [Global regulations post-GFC](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm?m=2572) mandated many of these entities to hold sovereign debt as safe assets, but **sovereign debt is actually not safe**.  They are free of default risk but can still suffer equity like price  declines with volatility that approaches that of crypto. Recently, some  investors in longer dated gilts were pushed dangerously close to  insolvency and saved only by [emergency central bank intervention](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/30136/documents/174584/default/). Note that losses from bonds can be redistributed through the financial system using hedges, but **not eliminated**.

Financial crisis can arise when investors discover their safe assets are in fact not safe. The [GFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008)  arose in part because highly rated private label MBS securities that  were considered safe were actually risky. The sudden repricing of those  securities raised widespread solvency concerns that precipitated into a  run on the financial system. Similarly, the [European Sovereign Debt Crise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_debt_crisis)  arose in part because the debt of peripheral European sovereigns were  considered safe when they were actually not. The repricing of peripheral  debt raised solvency concerns of the European banking system and also  led to a run on the financial system. The setup today appears similar,  but this time may be different.

## From Periphery to Core

Financial  stability concerns will likely force all central banks to eventually  support the bond prices of their respective sovereigns. Policymakers  vividly remember the [collapse of Lehman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers) and will do whatever it takes to avoid a repeat. The prospect of a financial crisis led the BOE to immediately postpone QT and [roll out unlimited bond buying](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-28/boe-to-carry-out-purchases-of-long-dated-uk-bonds-to-calm-market),  with the promise that the purchases are temporary. Their actions pumped  up gilt prices and restored the solvency of some investors, but it is  not clear if the price declines were merely due to illiquidity.

Market  prices are ultimately determined by supply and demand, and these  factors continue to suggest higher global yields. Central banks, who  were large and price insensitive investors, are no longer buying. At the  same time, net issuance in developed markets remains high from fiscal  spending. The proximate causes of gilt market volatility was an  anticipated surge in issuance to fund energy subsidies and tax cuts, as  well as impending BOE gilt sales. But a similar event could easily take  place in other markets. For example – central banks have been the  overwhelming buyers of Spanish and Italian bonds but have now stepped  back. The higher yields we see may be the market clearing prices and  persist absent official intervention.

## From Rates to FX

A  central bank that rolls out support for its bond market is likely to see  their currency depreciate. The potential policy options range from  sterilized and limited QE to yield curve control, which is the policy of  the BOJ. The result of YCC in Japan was tremendous Yen depreciation as  investors moved out of Yen and into foreign currencies in pursuit of  higher returns. That is the predictable outcome of any form of bond  price support, which would mechanically widen interest rate  differentials. The last jurisdiction to restart asset purchases would  likely experience the most currency appreciation.

The Fed is likely to be the last major central bank to backstop bond  prices due to the relative strength of the U.S. financial system. After  the BOJ and BOE, the ECB looks poised to be the next central bank forced  to shore up its bond market. The financial sector is opaque, but [market pricing and commentary](https://asiatimes.com/2022/10/global-margin-call-hits-european-debt-markets/)  appears to be indicating growing concerns over the health of European  financial institutions. European banks and pension funds are large  investors in European sovereign debt, and likely nursing significant  losses. Once Eurozone yields are suppressed then a widening yield  differential to Treasuries suggests continued dollar strength.

The actions of foreign central banks will also be supportive of the  Treasury market, but eventually the same problem will appear in the U.S.  Global bond markets are tightly interconnected and stability in foreign  markets will help stabilize Treasury yields. However, the supply of  U.S. Treasuries from fiscal spending and QT is very large even as prior [marginal buyers are no longer buying](https://www.barrons.com/articles/federal-reserve-quantitative-tightening-stock-market-51662736146). Eventually, the Fed will also have to step in too.",finance,1665633266

stocks,BlackRock Profit Falls 16%,"Firm’s assets under management decreased to $8 trillion, from $8.5 trillion in the second quarter 

A souring market weighed on investing giant [BlackRock](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BLK) Inc. [BLK -0.01%▼](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BLK?mod=chiclets) in the third quarter, pushing profit down 16%. 

The world’s largest asset manager reported net income of $1.41 billion, down from $1.68 billion in the same period a year earlier.

Earnings amounted to $9.25 a share. That exceeded the $7.06 expected by analysts polled by FactSet. 

Revenue dipped 15% to $4.31 billion, above analysts’ estimates of $4.2 billion. 

Central banks including the Federal Reserve are raising interest rates to try to cool red-hot inflation, adding stress to a market that is increasingly jittery over a possible recession. Stocks started the third quarter relatively strong, but soon headed lower as the Fed made increasingly clear that its rate increases are here to stay. 

BlackRock is a top provider of exchange-traded funds and other low-cost alternatives that track market indexes, and demand for passive investing has helped fuel the firm’s growth. 

BlackRock is also a large provider of actively managed investments, which include businesses like stock-and bond-picking funds.

Investors’ faith in the market declined, evidenced by slowing inflows of $17 billion, down from $75 billion a year ago.

The firm’s assets under management were about $8 trillion, down from $8.5 trillion in the second quarter. That marks the third quarter-over-quarter decline in a row. BlackRock ended last year with $10.01 trillion in assets, the first time any money manager surpassed that milestone.

BlackRock’s base management fees—fees not tied to performance that the firm receives for administering fund holdings—dipped 10% from a year ago to $3.53 billion.

Performance fees from the firm’s actively managed funds fell 76% to $82 million. BlackRock said that partly reflected lower fees from a single hedge fund. 

Its technology remains the asset manager’s bright spot. Revenue from Aladdin, its proprietary software that helps investors manage their portfolios and assess risk, rose 6% to $338 million.

Personally, I think to really fix the CPI, it will take more than just a Fed rate hike to fix it, it will take the Biden administration to fix energy prices and food prices, as well as the international supply chain, otherwise the CPI will still be high by the end of 2023.",finance,1665665006

Current interest rate hikes have been priced in but not future ones that can arise if worse inflation numbers keep getting printed. Additionally, the recessionary impact on corporate earnings are not priced in yet. 
I feel Fed has to realise that significant inflationary pressures also come from supply side factors like high commodity prices and supply chain disruptions. They are not only caused by pandemic pent-up demand stimulus. 
If they keep aggressively hiking, we are potentially going to get a double whammy of an inflationary recession/stagflation whereby we get a recession but inflation doesn't go down because cost pressures are propping up inflation.

Text version:

Inflation is slowing, but how much is it slowing?

That’s the big question facing policy makers, investors and consumers.

Unfortunately, the way we talk about the inflation numbers — released Thursday — can confuse as much as it can clarify. If we focus our attention on how much inflation we’ve already endured, we may miss clues about how much inflation we have yet to endure, which is the most important question.

Instead of concentrating on the here and now, most reports put the year-on-year inflation rate in the headline.

Not to pick on anyone, but here’s how The New York Times reported Thursday’s report on the consumer price index: “Consumer prices rose 8.2 percent in the year through September, in a report that dashes hopes that inflation in the U.S. may be slowing down.”

That’s not wrong, but it’s seriously misleading. I’ll show you a more useful way to think about the numbers.

Making sense of economic data is often a matter of finding the right context, which means the first thing you should do is ask yourself how you want to make use of the data. There are several correct ways of displaying the data, but some are better than others at answering specific questions.

What’s inflation done over the longer run?
For instance, if we want to know how much inflation we’ve already endured, it might be best to look at the year-on-year increase in the CPI. (The same logic in this column applies to the Fed’s preferred measure, the personal consumption expenditure price index.) We would compare current prices with prices a year earlier. This may be the most common way the CPI is reported in the media right now, because it puts the intensity and persistence of inflation into a perspective that readers can relate to.

This method answers the question: How far have we come?

In this case, we would find that consumer prices have risen 8.2% since September 2021. That’s very high inflation, but it’s lower than the 9% year-on-year increase recorded in June, which was a 40-year high.

If we looked just at the year-on-year increase in the CPI, we might agree with the Federal Reserve’s assessment that there hasn’t been an “appreciable decline” in bringing inflation down to the 2% target.

The year-on-year perspective is good for seeing how far we’ve come, but it’s not so good at predicting where inflation is going, because it’s essentially a backward-looking measure. It gives equal weight to inflation in September 2021 and inflation in September 2022. Yet the inflation rate from a year ago has little bearing on what the inflation rate will be going forward.

The best predictor of this month’s inflation rate is last month’s inflation. The CPI is dominated by so-called sticky prices that don’t change very often. Inflation is pretty persistent from month to month.

What’s inflation doing lately?
So if we wanted to know how hot inflation has been running lately, we’d look at a shorter period of time, say, one month. The media frequently report the CPI this way, using the month-to-month percentage change rather than an annual rate.

In this case, the data would say that the CPI rose 0.4% in September after a 0.1% increase in August.

But using the monthly percentage change seems like a weird choice when we use annual rates for the year-on-year gain. It’s like talking about miles-per-hour and then switching to feet-per-second.

That’s why many analysts prefer to convert the monthly change into an annual rate so that it’s comparable to the year-on-year inflation rate. The data say that the CPI rose at an annual rate of 4.7% in September versus the 17.1% pace in June, which was a 17-year high.

The monthly data seem awfully noisy. So let’s find the underlying trend by taking a three-month average to smooth out the bumps. In this case, the data say that the CPI rose at a 2% annual rate from July through through September, down from 11% in June and 11.3% in March, which was a 41-year high.

This perspective answers the question: What’s happening with inflation yesterday, today and tomorrow?

If we look at the three-month smoothed annual rate, we might disagree with the Fed about how much progress they’ve made. Going from 11.3% in March when the Fed started raising interest rates to 2% now isn’t nothing. It looks like — dare we say it? — progress.

The Fed has actually hit its 2% target over the past three months, but of course the Fed is concerned that inflation could accelerate from here, especially in the hugely important shelter category, where hot inflation for the next year or so is baked into the cake.

What question do we want to answer?
All these measures of CPI are correct; they just come from a different perspective. Which one should we pay attention to? The one that says no appreciable progress has been made, or the one that says some-but-not-enough progress has been made? If we have a bias toward which story we want to tell, the answer is obvious.

But if we want an honest account, we’ll use the perspective that answers the question we are asking and let the chips fall where they may. (What you don’t do is start with the answer you want and then work backwards.)

That’s why I think the best way to think about the inflation we’re seeing now — and which is likely to persist in the near future — is to look at the three-month smoothed, seasonally adjusted annual rate.

That perspective is a lot more honest than the other way, and it’s a lot more hopeful, as well.",finance,1665677702

Feds seem to be hell bent on raising rates but will rate hikes actually help with the underlying issues that are causing the inflation. And do they only have this one tool in their arsenal to curb inflation no matter what the cause might be. I’m sure they’re much smarter than I am but my thoughts are that instead of curbing inflation they’re making things worse because we haven’t seen a dent in prices whatsoever.

Bitcoin,What if the fed doesn’t pivot?,"I apologize in advance for my lack of an economics background, just trying to wrap my head around all this and feel free to correct me if I’m totally off base.


So it makes a lot of sense to say that the fed will eventually pivot, since they are tightening into a perceived recession- raising interest rates while the economy is less than fully productive and there is much economic uncertainty around the world. 

The high interest rates are crushing all asset classes and clashing with other central bank monetary policies around the world, sending their currencies into chaos.

So if that’s the case, we always say that they will eventually have to reverse course and start QE and maybe even controlling the yield curve on bonds or “something will break” / “until they break something”

So then I have a few questions:

1) is it possible that inflation will be too persistent, forcing the fed into a long-term high interest rate scenario? 

2) is this really such a binary thing, or are there more tools in the feds toolkit? 
 
Is it possible that the fed chooses a creative path towards a long, slow decline over crashing the stock market or intensifying inflation any further. Could they possibly accomplish this and orchestrate a multi-decade relatively stable/ slow decline in the value of all things against the dollar? 

3) what is the “something” that macro bitcoiners keep implying will “break”?",cryptocurrency,1665680994

personalfinance,Excess longer-term cash in retirement that I don't want to do better than money market...,"I am retired, live off the cash in my portfolio, not touching the stock/bond funds I own.   I  luckily have enough cash for my foreseeable needs until I take SS in 3 years at 70.  In fact, I have an excess of cash of about $100K in money markets.  And, while rates have been rising, there seems to be a spread of about 2% between money market rates and 1 year treasuries you can buy today.  
I get that if I buy a 1 year treasury (or an existing treasury from the secondary market) and the fed raises it's rate by the anticipated 3/4 of a point, my treasury will be worth less in the secondary market should I sell it before maturity.  However, if I hold it to maturity, I would get the full amount the day I buy it (from the discounted yield at time I buy, rather than a coupon for a 1 year maturity).  
So, it seems to me, unless I believe we will have enough rate increases in a short enough time for money markets to outyield a 1 year bond at today's rate, I am better off investing in the treasuries and holding them to maturity than staying in the money market for money that I do not want to risk principal.  Am I correct in this thinking?   Further, I can de-risk inflation further, by laddering my purchases (perhaps after each Fed meeting)?  
Taking the timing question one step further... the CPI index has come out today and now it is reported the market widely  anticipates a 3/4 pt Fed rate rise.   The Fed doesn't meet until Nov 1st, so is it better to buy now, and start the clock or wait until after the Fed meets in case the rise is a surprise rate?

Should we hold off on a vehicle as long as possible? Or with potential impacts to credit, does it make more sense to purchase now and fix the ding to our credit so we can make a house purchase next summer? Can we even afford a $35k vehicle? 

My math says we can manage these numbers, but neither of us have ever managed this much income.",finance,1665683452

Economics,Inflation Report Seals Case for 0.75-Point Fed Rate Rise in November,,finance,1665684462
investing,Confused with what rates you get back with Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS),"I understand that there is a nominal interest rate you get back with TIPs. 5 year for instance is 1.8% currently. On top of that you get inflation protection. So does this mean if inflation is currently 8% you get 9.8% total return for the year?

Note I also understand the way the inflation protection works is that it's added to the base, and then the % yield is applied to that base. This has some income/tax implications.

Apologies if this has been answered elsewhere and I missed it.

Reference link to TIPs yields:

CryptoCurrency,China's CBDC the e-CNY Crosses a Milestone but Then Slams into a Wall,"Today it was announced that China's CBDC crossed a huge milestone with[$14 billion](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/13/chinas-cbdc-transactions-reach-14b-as-uptake-slows-report/) in transaction volume. Even with this arguable massive amount of money being transferred this way it does not show the whole picture. At the end of 2021, the amount that had been transacted in e-CNY was roughly $12 billion meaning that in 2022 only an additional $2 billion was transacted. This is a monumental slowdown and highlights that even with a government like China where they can more or less force people to use certain things it does not mean it will actually work. 

&amp;#x200B;

When China first piloted its CBDC they more or less set off a CBDC arms race around the world with many countries looking into the creation and implementation of their own CBDC. With what China shared about how its pilot projects were going it looked like they had created something that worked however this new data paints a different picture. Even with China expanding its trial into new cities only having a $2 billion bump is pretty bad which leads to the issue at hand in my eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

We currently live in a digital age where we order things online using credit or debit cards and because of this, there is already in a sense digital money. Cash has become less and less popular, especially when you factor in the COVID pandemic. Since cash usage is decreasing as we transition to a credit/debit card lifestyle there are not a lot of additional benefits that a CBDC can offer. In the US for example one of the things that it could have done was instantaneous settling of purchases instead of the two to three-day period settling period. The Federal Reserve though has announced and prepared to roll out a program called FedNow which banks and other financial institutions can opt into and FedNow provides that very service. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other things I have seen people use to argue in favor of like dispensing federal relief or other funds via this system is how much different is that than just having the government directly deposit your money into your bank account. Looking at the whole picture if a place like China cannot get a CBDC to catch on it is going to be a hard sell to have it catch on in Western countries like the U.S. where privacy is a huge thing. Factoring in the vast sums of money that would need to be invested in creating an entirely separate system it just does not make any practical sense for any government to invest money into a system like this as it will cost a small fortune.",cryptocurrency,1665688821

CryptoCurrency,Speculation around Fed rate hike.,"Inflation in September increased despite the continued rate hikes by the Fed. This coupled with the low unemployment and a strong job market probably means that we are going to get another 0.5% to 0.75% rate increase. 

Considering the macro outlook, war in Ukraine and approaching winter, a further rate hike is only going to make risky assets such as crypto currencies less desirable. 

I'm personally expecting BTC to fall below 19k if rates are hiked by 0.75%. I have been noticing that every time BTC touches 18k, it bounces back soon and has been accumulating in the 18k - 22k range. It would be interesting to sell it break this cycle, however, it's more likely to break below 18k and have a lower accumulation range if the Fed continues to be hawkish in the next year.

Job growth slowed in September, but not as much as market observers expected. Triggering a selloff across crypto. With the price of Bitcoin falling almost 4%.

When, with two hours to go before today’s CPI print, crypto prices started falling. Bitcoin price fell almost 4% in from 6 A.M. to 9 A.M. Since, Bitcoin price has recovered with no known catalyst triggering the recovery.

Bitcoin,Stop doing these 3 things if you want Bitcoin to succeed (rant),"Do you ever Bitcoin to become to become mainstream? Do you want it to become the world (reserve) currency? Then stop doing the following things.

**Disclaimer**: Rant time. Trigger warning.

**Reason for writing this:** With the world being on the brink of the next financial recession, and several parties jumping to implement their new system,  I'm going to respond to some of my observations of the BTC community from the past 5 years or so.

# 1. Stop measuring the value of Bitcoin to fiat currency!

 Stop measuring it to fiat, be it Dollars, Euros or whatever.

If you don't, governments, with the moral support of your nan, will simply launch the new Superfedcentralbankeuropeanunionandeunitednationscoin, which will be centralized and digital. Dystopian indeed.

Bitcoin will be useless if you keep measuring it to fiat because governments and banks will still control the price and what you can buy with it. 

Also, START ACTUALLY USING Bitcoin as money. Back in my day, people praised Bitcoin for its real-world potential.

# 2. Stop making the exchanges the new central banks!

Ever heard of Binance or whichever exchange locking, losing and removing funds? That's because you don't freaking own it if it's on an account of the exchange.

Let's say that central banks and regular banks disappear tomorrow. Who will control the vast majority of Bitcoin? Centralized exchanges. Because the majority of BTC owners don't have their own wallets.

Instead, buy it privately; peer-to-peer. Which brings me to the next point.

# 3. Stop using your government ID to register your Bitcoin!

Do you have a bank account? Imagine that their ledger (your transactions) is public and everyone can analyze your behavior. That's Bitcoin.

Your ID (person, which is not a living entity) is property of the government. It says it on the card. You are at best the beneficiary as the agent. If government wants, they can take your property without consequence. 

Instead, stop registering stuff on your person and start acting privately.

Start buying and using BTC privately. Full anonymity may not be possible, but it may be good enough if you use a wallet that sends and receives from multiple addresses. There are certain cryptocurrencies that solved this problem, which I cannot mention here. 

In extension of this, think of what happened during the lockdownpandemic.

If you cannot leave your house or enter public places without some kind of digital ID, QR code, or big pharma loyalty card, it doesn't matter what currency you use. 

If you don't use cryptocurrency/Bitcoin privately, the next currency could be carbon credits for what I care. The next financial system doesn't even have to be money-based if your currency is based on your energy consumption for example.

Completely life changing, I know. I bought my home with a 2.3% interest rate right before rates skyrocketed, and was able to afford my nearly $5k mortgage comfortably. With the influx of income, aside from charitable donations and additional retirement and stock investments, I’m going to pay off my rental property’s mortgage and then have no other payments, other than my current mortgage and utilities.

The 5k monthly payment is still pretty sizable, and even if I paid off 200-300k and refinanced at today’s interest rates of nearly 7%, I would only be saving about $1k/month in payments.

stocks,Be greedy when others are fearful? Only if others are selling like there is no tomorrow!,"There is a lot of fear in the market, the net bullish sentiment is very low, for example the AAII survey shows an investor almost as scared as in the months before 2008 bear market\`s bottom. 

I see too many guys talking about how you have to be greedy when others are fearful and how this is time to buy because of the terrible market sentiment. IMO this old (and good) advice only works when people **also** sell their riskier assets (stocks and junk bonds) to hold safer assets (cash, high quality bonds and some blue chips and passive ETFs). 

The problem is investors still hold huge amounts of stocks (60%+) , the junk  to AAA bonds spread is still very low and we keep having net cash **inflows** into the stock market. I hear about ""mid/low cap tech bargains"" all the time, investors keep seeking risky assets even if they are fearful...they are still trying to find the next Tesla! 

So, investors are scared but they are not looking for safe assets! Why? Maybe its all about inertia. In the last 15 years every time things looked bad the FED injected tons of money and bang! new ATH in a matter of months. Selling was always a mistake in the last 15 years, so investors are incredibly reluctant to sell even if they think the market will keep falling. 

In previous bear markets we see good buying opportunites happened when stock allocation levels fell below 50% (closer to 40%), a huge spike in AAA-to-junk bonds spread, massive outflows in the stock market and OC people talking about total collapse and the end of the western civilization instead of trying to find the next Apple. 

I feel like we are not nearly close to this point, I feel like we are not even close to the bottom yet! And I dont think there are good bargains right now.

Our medium term plan is to buy the house (minimum 5 years out, longer if the market is against us).

Repayments started October 2022 and interest rate has now shot up to 3.125% over the last 2 quarters, with it looking like it'll only go higher for the next year. The monthly expense is becoming unsustainable as we are on one income for the next 6 months.

We approached our bank manager about repaying 40k from the loan with savings and unused credit, and moving to a fixed rate and she has offered 4.625% which gives us a very reasonable monthly rate for 10 years (~500).

She has also presented an option where we repay €625 for 15 years. This second option works out at 15,000 in savings vs the 20 year loan.

#[Stock futures tick up on mixed earnings results from big banks](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Friday as investors turned their attention to big bank earnings after the major averages staged a historic turnaround rally.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 190 points, or 0.63%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.69%, and Nasdaq 100 futures ticked up 0.66%.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo gained after revenue topped expectations. Morgan Stanley reported a profit miss, sending shares down more than 2% in premarket trading. Citigroup also reported a miss in third-quarter profits.
*****
&gt; Dow member UnitedHealth also reported results that beat Wall Street expectations on Friday, sending shares higher.
*****
&gt; The outlook for this earnings season is not good. Profit for S&amp;P 500 companies increased a measly 2.4% in the third quarter, according to the latest analyst estimates collected by FactSet, the worst growth since third quarter 2020, the heart of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; When the third quarter began, earnings growth was expected to be 10% for the period, but rising costs and interest rates have eaten away at companies’ bottom lines. Leading up to the start of this reporting season, 65 S&amp;P companies have issued negative guidance, compared to just 41 giving positive outlooks, FactSet data shows.
*****
&gt; The reports come a day after the market staged a massive comeback. The Dow ended Thursday’s session up 827 points after being down more than 500 points at the intraday low. The S&amp;P 500 rose 2.6% to break a six-day losing streak, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.2%.
*****
&gt; The moves followed the release of the consumer price index, a key U.S. inflation reading that came in hotter than expected for the month of September. Initially, this weighed on markets as investors braced themselves for the Federal Reserve to continue with its aggressive rate-hiking plan. Later, however, they shrugged off those worries.
*****
&gt; Still, persistent inflation remains a problem for the Fed and for investors’ worries around the central bank’s policy tightening.
*****
&gt; “With core CPI still moving in the wrong direction and the labor market strong, the conditions are not in place for a Fed policy pivot, which would be one of the conditions for a sustained rally in the equity market,” wrote UBS global wealth management chief investment officer Mark Haefele in a Friday note. “Moreover, as inflation remains elevated for longer and the Fed hikes further, the risk increases that the cumulative effect of policy tightening pushes the US economy into recession, undermining the outlook for corporate earnings.”
*****
&gt; There’s still more economic data this week, too. September’s retail sales will come out at 8:30 a.m. ET. Later in the morning, investors are looking forward to the latest consumer sentiment figures from the University of Michigan.

stocks,Financial sector gets increase profit margins with interest rate jump but decrease revenue.,"The major banks such as  JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup all show significant increase in profit margins with federal funds rate at its highest since 2008.

This increase in profit margin has help big banks gain significant profit margins to beat the estimated earnings.

However, their revenues have significantly drop due to decrease amount of transactions in lending, business borrowing, and brokerage trading. The mortgage rates have reach 20-year high.

Morgan Stanley being heavily dependent on investment banking missed wall street expectation.

The interest rate hype is increasing bank profit margins but decreasing volume in business transactions with the overall market downturn causing a bigger drop in investment line of business.

Banks that have less exposure to investment banking should endure this market downswing significantly better and be in a better position to emerge from this bear market.",finance,1665753091
cybersecurity,Top cybersecurity stories for the week of 10-10-22 to 10-14-22,"Below are the top headlines we’ve been reporting this whole week on Cyber Security Headlines.

If you’d like to hear and participate in a discussion about them, the CISO Series does a live 20-minute show every Friday at 12:30pm PT/3:30pm ET. Each week we welcome a different cyber practitioner to offer some color to the week's stories. Our guest this week is Matt Honea, Head of Security, SmartNews.

If you want to get involved you can watch live and participate in the discussion on YouTube Live ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X5hHOTmNPE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X5hHOTmNPE)), or you can just [subscribe to the Cyber Security Headlines podcast](https://cisoseries.com/subscribe-podcast/) and get it into your feed.

Here are some of the stories we'll be covering:

**Security chiefs fear ‘CISO scapegoating’ following Uber-Sullivan verdict**  
CISOs are split on whether Wednesday’s conviction of Uber’s former security chief Joe Sullivan will have more wide-ranging consequences for people in their position. According to The Record, some fear the case will prompt more CISO whistleblowers in the future, while others feel that security chiefs should be prepared to be held responsible for incidents that they are involved in. A federal jury convicted Sullivan of two charges related to his attempted cover-up of a 2016 security incident at Uber, where hackers stole the personal details of 57 million customers and the personal information of 600,000 Uber drivers.

**Finger heat can leak your password**  
Researchers at the University of Glasgow’s School of Computing Sciences developed a system called ThermoSecure, designed to reveal a computer’s password with heat signatures. It uses cheap consumer thermal-imaging cameras with a machine-learning algorithm to look at a keyboard to reveal recent keypresses. The researchers previously found that humans were fairly accurate at guessing passwords based on thermal signatures, but using the algorithms could achieve up to 86% accuracy if captured within 20 seconds of input. This fell to 76% accuracy within 30 seconds and 62% after 60 seconds. Shorter passwords were even easier to guess. With six or less characters it guessed 100% of the time, making it an ideal way to steal a PIN. The researchers said longer passwords would be the most effective mitigation.

**US airport sites targeted by KillNet**  
The pro-Russian threat group claimed it orchestrated large scale DDoS attacks against the websites of several major US airports. This intermittently took several sites offline including those for Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, LAX, and Chicago O’Hare preventing travelers from accessing airport services or getting flight information. THe DDoS did not impact flights. This follows KillNet’s recent expansion into targeting US organizations. Last week it ran DDoS campaigns against government sites in Colorado, Kentucky, and Mississippi.

**Npm timing attack could impact supply chain**  
Security researchers at Aqua Security found a way to determine which private packages are present in a GitHub repository. This uses the small time difference in returning a 404 error based on whether the package is private or simply not there. The caching mechanism of npm’s API appears to cause the timing difference. This can vary by a few hundred milliseconds. This opens the door for attackers to create malicious clones or typosquatted versions of the packages. Ultimately these clones could make their way into production software, and then to consumers. Aqua contacted GitHub on March 8th. GitHub said it could not fix the issue, citing architectural limitations.

**Android leaks traffic even when ‘Always-on VPN’ is enabled**  
Mullvad VPN has discovered that Android leaks some traffic every time the device connects to a WiFi network, even with “Always-on VPN” features enabled. Data being leaked outside VPN tunnels includes source IP addresses, DNS lookups, HTTPS traffic, and also likely NTP traffic. The issue stems from a design choice in the Android operating system to allow special use cases such as identifying captive portals (like hotel WiFi) that must be checked before a user can log in or use split-tunnel features. Android users are likely unaware of the issue due to Android’s inaccurate documentation related to “VPN Lockdown” features. Mullvad has contacted Google, requesting them to add an option to disable connectivity checks.

**Digital license plates legalized in California**  
California has ended a pilot program and fully legalized digital license plates for private and commercial vehicles. The E Ink digital license plates known as the Rplate, are manufactured by California-based company Reviver. It can reportedly function in extreme temperatures, has some customization features, and is managed via Bluetooth using a smartphone app. Rplates are also equipped with an LTE antenna, which can be used to push updates, change the plate if the vehicle is reported stolen or lost, and notify vehicle owners if their car may have been stolen.

**RSA Conference reveals CISO-Board relationships**  
The RSA Conference Executive Security Action Forum (ESAF) released a research report on Wednesday, that describes how CISOs are communicating risk, accountability, security maturity and metrics to boards, and the challenges that this can sometimes entail. Among the findings:  
• CISOs and boards are generally well  aware of the legal ramifications of a data breach, and the need to document their efforts to adequately managed cyber risk  
• There is debate among the CISO community about the types of metrics used in board reports, specifically whether narratives or numbers are better.  
• CISOs who have evaluated building a capability to quantify cyber risk in dollar values found that the resources and talent, including actuaries, would be prohibitive for most security teams.  
• Security teams use risk scoring systems internally to prioritize their efforts but do not find it useful to share those numbers with the board.

**First exemption from US chip equipment ban**  
Earlier this month, the US Commerce Department announced further export bans on advanced chipmaking equipment to China. This impacted technology up to a decade old and would have made manufacturing DRAM difficult in the country. The memory-chip maker SK Hynix confirmed it received a one-year temporary exemption from new US rules. This will allow SK Hynix to supply its own China-based facilities without additional licensing requirements from the US Commerce Department. It’s expected for the US to grant further exemptions to other DRAM makers like Samsung.

stocks,Dow rises 200 points as stocks look to continue Thursday’s historic rebound？,"Stocks rose Friday, building on the historic turnaround rally a day earlier as investors bet that inflation has peaked.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 215 points, or 0.72%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.63%, and the Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.87%.

Stock futures wavered in premarket trading on mixed results from big banks. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo gained after revenue topped expectations, while Morgan Stanley and Citigroup both announced profit misses.

The outlook for this earnings season is not good. Profit for S&amp;P 500 companies increased a measly 2.4% in the third quarter, according to the latest analyst estimates collected by FactSet, the worst growth since third quarter 2020, the heart of the pandemic.

When the third quarter began, earnings growth was expected to be 10% for the period, but rising costs and interest rates have eaten away at companies' bottom lines. Leading up to the start of this reporting season, 65 S&amp;P companies have issued negative guidance, compared to just 41 giving positive outlooks, FactSet data shows.

The reports come a day after the market staged a massive comeback. The Dow ended Thursday’s session up 827 points after being down more than 500 points at the intraday low. The S&amp;P 500 rose 2.6% to break a six-day losing streak, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.2%.

Thursday marked the fifth largest intraday reversal from a low in the history of the S&amp;P 500, and it was the fourth largest for the Nasdaq, according to SentimenTrader.

The moves followed the release of [the consumer price index](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/13/consumer-price-index-september-2022-.html), a key U.S. inflation reading that came in hotter than expected for the month of September. Initially, this weighed on markets as investors braced themselves for the Federal Reserve to continue with its aggressive rate-hiking plan. Later, however, they shrugged off those worries.

Still, persistent inflation remains a problem for the Fed and for investors’ worries around the central bank’s policy tightening.

“With core CPI still moving in the wrong direction and the labor market strong, the conditions are not in place for a Fed policy pivot, which would be one of the conditions for a sustained rally in the equity market,” wrote UBS global wealth management chief investment officer Mark Haefele in a Friday note. “Moreover, as inflation remains elevated for longer and the Fed hikes further, the risk increases that the cumulative effect of policy tightening pushes the US economy into recession, undermining the outlook for corporate earnings.”",finance,1665754841
stocks,Are we looking at inflation all wrong?,"Yesterdays inflation report read another increase of 0.4% in September.

Within the CPI (Consumer Price Index) the housing sector, which is almost 50% of the core rate, showed an increase of 0.007%. 

Jeremy Siegel explains that this number is very misleading as, “housing prices by every indicator are going down, not up” 

According to Siegel, the true number should actually be negative at -0.7%.

This true housing number would wipe out core inflation completely for September.

From march of 2020 until this summer, housing prices were up 40%. However, the CPI housing number read up only 11%. This example helps to express the lagging nature of the CPI report.

This lagging effect also works the opposite way. So now, when housing is actually dropping meaningfully, it is not yet showing up in the numbers. 

“The fed exploded the money supply in 2020 by more than any other year in the last 150 years. We didn’t have inflation in 2020 or in the first half of of 2021. We did start to see some inflation in the second half, but the fed didn’t act until march of this year!”

If the fed waits for the core to go down to 2% year over year, it may literally take years, just like it did for inflation to show up as elevated. 

By that time, Jeremy believes, we will be driven into a depression.",finance,1665755159
personalfinance,Best Way to Allocate $1500/month,"I am responsible for managing my mother's money and have gotten her budget stabilized since I've taken over. She has a monthly income of just over $5300 between two pensions and social security. She has Parkinson's and had to live in assisted living for almost a year and then independent living in the same senior community for another year after. AL cost just about all of her monthly income while IL left just a little bit left over. Fortunately, her condition is very much improved and she was able to move out and rent a house close to me, so I can check in on her daily to make sure she doesn't relapse from skipping her medications, which is what caused her last health issue.

After all her expenses are covered, she has at minimum $1500 a month to play around with. In addition to her monthly income, I invested $185k from her house sale and part of an inheritance into VTSAX. Prior to that, she and my dad had no real savings or investments. The pensions are  federal (my dad's survivor benefits) and state (her teacher pension) income which I consider safe so I'm not worried about her losing income. With the $1500, I was looking to split it evenly three ways with 

\-$500 going to her savings account to cover taxes and continually increase her cash buffer

\-$500 going into VTSAX

\-$500 going into I Bonds

I'm hoping she can have at least another 5 years of living on her own, but if she ever has to go back to assisted living, I would like to be able to cash out the I Bonds to provide some extra money every month if needed before having to tap into the investment account. She is currently 67. Her mother died at 78 with similar health issues while her father made it to 93 with very few issues until the last few months. With that in mind, I'm trying to make sure she won't be in a position where money will be tight towards the end. Is this strategy for the $1500 a good one, or would you recommend a different way to allocate the extra monthly money?",finance,1665755498

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington’s most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC’s work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as Amazon. com Inc., MetaPlatforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp.

An FTC chairman owned Microsoft, Oracle and AT&amp;T Inc. while the agency was conducting sensitive reviews affecting the tech and telecom sectors.

The head of the FTC’s international division bought and sold Facebook stock through a financial adviser as his office coordinated with overseas enforcement officials on an investigation involving Facebook.

And an FTC consumer-protection official owned stock in more than 10 companies as the agency scrutinized mergers or acquisitions involving the firms.

I have a 6 figure job lined up when I graduate, starting in January. I'm currently working for the company part-time. I thought I had enough money to survive until my new job begins. Well, an unforeseen $4k expense came up and now I am unable to pay my bills For November and December. I was trying to think of the best way to get a $3-4k loan with a super low interest rate, and then it dawned on me I could get a credit card with a 0% intro rate. To me, that basically means the credit limit on the card is essentially a 12-18 month loan interest free. I am a little worried the Economy will worsen and my job will be rescinded before I start, but my thought is even if that happens, the 0% intro rate will give me at least a year to find a new job and pay off the credit card bill before the higher interest rate kicks in.

Based on my calculations, I need about $3,500-$4,500 to get me through to January. My hope is I can find a credit card that will give me a limit close to this amount with the aforementioned 0% intro APR. I currently have 4 credit cards, and a 745 credit score. Oldest card is 2.5 years old. Never missed a payment, never carried a balance on any of my cards.

I should also note I have &gt;$2k in a Roth-IRA and &gt;$8k in a taxable investment account. I am trying my hardest not to pull money out of there for obvious reasons. I understand I should not have invested money I couldn't afford to lose. If my job gets rescinded I will just take the L and sell my investments to pay off the CC once the intro rate expires.

Is this a stupid idea? What am I missing here?

TL;DR: got a 6 figure job lined up for January, can't pay bills in November and December. Thinking of getting a 0% intro rate CC to pay bills for next 2 months. Stupid, or brilliant?

Update: I ended up going with the Chase freedom unlimited card. 15 months 0% APR, plus $200 cash back if I spend $500 in the intro period. I spend almost $500/month on groceries so I will make that easy. I also get 5% cash back on groceries for the first 12 months, up to $600 total cash back. The biggest unknown I had with the card was what my credit line would be. If I only got a $1,500 credit line, I would not have enough to pay my bills.

I was also considering a private student loan through SoFi. $4k loan for 9.8%. No prepayment penalties, so if I did pay it back in 4 months, that would have cost me $85 in interest.

In the end I went with the card. I figured even if the credit limit was too low, I could still get the benefit of the $200 cash back + 5% on groceries, and that would make up for any interest I would have to pay for a student loan. I got an $8k credit line, so it ended up being a non issue.

In order to pay my rent and tuition with a credit card, it will end up costing me $140 in fees. But again, this is negated by the $200 cash back from the card. And I get 15 months to pay the 0% loan back, which is nice.",finance,1665766157

vet,New kitten might have a radial nerve damage/paralysis,"I got a kitten home yesterday morning. He is 5 weeks old but looks like a newborn. My older cat immediately took to him.

Problem was with the unspayed female cat (same age as my male older cat) who we were babysitting since her mother has left for a different city for 20 days. She has been suddenly very aggressive with my older cat the last few times they met, and we keep them separated when she is over since then. We have baby proofed doors in the house too.

We couldn’t say no to the kitten because his foster would have been forced to put him back on the street if we didn’t take him in.

Everything was fine till the female cat creeped up to the kitten this morning. She didn’t look like she was hunting (which she does with my older cat), and we didn’t want to scare her just in case she starts running and accidentally hits the kitten (she is laser fast).

In a split second she had grabbed the kitten by the neck and run away. We rescued the kitten and immediately rushed him to the hospital. All in all took us less than 30 mins to get him into an incubator, max 20 mins tops. He had stopped breathing and moving for a few seconds, but in the 5 min car drive had shown movement.

He has been given injectables, can now move his head slightly, can kick his legs, but can’t stand. It’s been just about 14 hours. But doctors suspect he could have radial nerve surgery. At 5 weeks of age, how can we help him to recover? Will he ever recover? No matter what we will love it and care for him like our baby. But it has been breaking our hearts and I just wanted to be able to do the best for him and also hear what the community feels. Maybe for support.

personalfinance,House buying - Mortgage offer expiry Vs Completion of chain,"Good evening Reddit,

I am in the process of purchasing a flat  in these interesting times and wanted to sound-out my situation with you. 

I agreed the purchase of the flat back in the summer and fortunately secured a mortgage offer @ 2%  for a 5 year fix, this offer expires in early ‘23. The property is in NW England, not that that has much bearing on the situation. . 

Whilst negotiating the sale I increased my original offer on the basis that the seller completed the sale prior to xmas 2022, regardless of their onward buying position, which was accepted. 

As we are nearing those dates they have written to me (via the estate agent) to state they are unable to move out.  They have had an offer accepted on a house but at the date of writing that seller hasn’t found a place, so no sight on the end of the chain. They have looked at renting but have said availability and cost aren’t great for them, plus they look like 12 months minimum these days which doesn’t work with their buying plans. 

My predicament is thus, I obviously want to complete on this part of the chain to lock-in my interest rate, otherwise I will be at current rates, some 4% higher, but the seller is not in that place at the moment. 

I would welcome any views on;

i)  are there any ways to overcone this that I haven’t considered?

Ii) Based on the info I have provided do ypu think the seller is being reasonable?

iii) how would you approach from this stage?

For further context I believe the agreed sale price was healthy at the time and I question whether they would still secure this in the current market. Also all legals etc..my end are done, so I am good to complete/exchange.

Thanks for taking the time to read and I look forward to hearing from you.

stocks,The case for Structural Inflation vs Cyclical Inflation,"I've seen some people compare the current inflationary environment to the 1970's (structural inflation), but I've also seen people compare it to the inflation of the 1940's (cyclical inflation).

To really know if this inflationary period is more like the 70's or the 40's, we have to look at how the world was vs how it is today.

Pre-2020, the Cathy Wood's of the world would argue that we're in a system of structural deflation. The argument for structural deflation was that Technology and demographics would keep inflation low, and the search for yields was high in a low rate environment which would ultimately keep a cap on bond yields.

So we've had 10+ years of a peace dividend, cheap labor, easy money, QE, and interest rates grinding down. This allowed companies to take moon shots creating deflationary technologies, using cheap labor, and cheap energy, in a globalized world with relative peace.

Post-Covid this has all reversed. We're now seeing deglobalization, labor is not so cheap anymore, and neither is energy. On top of this, environment friendly policies means we've under-invested in energy, and now that interest rates are higher, the rate of technological advancement will slow as companies are pressured to show profits today rather than take moon shots for tomorrow.

So the deflation argument pre-2020 was:

1. Technological advancement is a deflationary force
2. Cheap labor and cheap energy
3. Globalization (A cooperation game)

Now the argument for structural inflation:

1. Higher rates = slower growth of technological advancement, slowing the rate of deflation
2. Sticky wages as workers demand raises to keep up with the cost of living
3. Energy inflation due to decades of under-investment in the sector
4. Deglobalization (A competition game)

Beyond this, populism is on the rise, and when people demand relief from a difficult economic environment, the government will spend money to help people. We've already seen some of this with the ""Inflation Reduction Act"" and forgiving student loans, all of which is inflationary.

The deflationary situation we had pre-2020 is no longer the world we live in today, and the argument that this inflationary cycle will disappear within a few years is short sighted in my opinion. Everyone is anchored to the pre-covid world, but we're in a new regime now. The Fed has said it multiple times; ""Higher rates for longer"".

investing,(URW:AS) Unibail-Rodamco Westfield likely has 2-3x upside in the medium term,"* Unibail’s equity is priced as though the company does not have any terminal value; that is, the market is implying the value of its property portfolio is going to zero in the long term. As of the 30th of June, Unibail’s net asset value was €143 per share. With an equity price of €41 at yesterday’s close, the market is pricing Unibail’s net assets at a 71% discount. 

Unibail owns 82 malls across Europe and the US. At present, they are working through a disposal programme of €4bn of their European portfolio, which they are 80% of the way through. They are also selling their entire portfolio of American shopping centres, which were valued at €13bn at the end of June. As such, there are clear markers communicating to the market that the property portfolio does in fact have value. 

Poor capital allocation over the past few years has cast doubt across the market that management can manage their capital prudently. I believe this to be a key reason for the significant discount. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Unibail is not falling foul to the usual relaxed corporate boards that one tends to come across in Europe. With two high profile activist shareholders on board, Xavier Niel and Leon Bressler, who recently blocked a proposal by the company to issue a fresh €3.5bn in equity, the company is being steered down a path that should result in returns to these activist shareholders, with minorities in tow. 
* The company is heavily indebted with €31bn of debt on its books and a loan to value ratio of 41%. Promisingly, the complete disposal of their portfolio in the US, along with the European disposal programme, is part of a wider strategy put forward by Xavier Niel and Leon Bressler to reduce their debt levels. 

Rising interest rates should not impact Unibail materially with the group’s debt fully hedged for the next five years, along with cash and available securities of €12bn. A 2% increase in rates would only impact Unibail’s recurring earnings by €16.3mn.

&amp;#x200B;

* Unibail is targeting a return to pre-Covid net rental income and group EBITDA by the 2024 financial year. In the 2019 financial year, the company generated net rental income of €2.5bn, suggesting the company is currently trading at just 2.4x its expected 2024 NRI. Positive signs emerged in the first half of the 2022 financial year with net rental income of €912mn, and only a -€187mn movement in the value of their assets, suggesting property valuations have stabilized. 
* The company has announced it will be reinstating its dividend in the 2023 financial year. Assuming a conservative pay-out ratio of 75%, the board may elect to pay a dividend of €7. At the current share price of €41, this would equate to a dividend yield on cost of 16%. If we assign the long-term average dividend yield of 6% that Unibail has traded at over the past seven years, a dividend of €7 per share would equate to a share price of €112.

personalfinance,Equity Buyout of Home to STBXW - 401K Withdrawal vs. Cash out Refinance,"Hey Everyone,

My wife and I finally agreed to terms on the divorce last week.  We have 300K equity in our home and our current mortgage has 200K left on the loan at 4.25 interest rate.  I will be staying in the home with our child.  Unfortunately, I don't have enough non-retirement cash to buy her out...and she did not agree to letting my transfer over retirement funds as part of the buyout.  So, I have to come up with cash.  I have 3 options.

1. Combine my cash with borrowed money from family

2. Do a cash-out refinance and pull out the 150K (I'll have to do a standard re-finance anyways to get her off the loan)

3. Pull money out of my 401K (I have nearly 300K)

I'm leaning towards 3 even though at first thought, it doesn't make as much sense.  However, unless I'm missing something, it seems like 3 makes the most sense.

I'd be taking a 10% penalty on the early withdrawal and would be subject to income taxes this year.  I understand that, but since I'd be married filing jointly for this tax year, my income bracket would only change by 2 percent.  Plus, that money would eventually get taxed anyways...and probably at a higher rate at age 60ish (I'll still probably be working then).  More importantly, if I throw on another 150K onto my mortgage (with the cash out option), I'd be paying at least 7% interest on that extra 150K.  Even after 5 years, it'd be a lot of interest paid (over $48,000) - and I plan on staying in this home for at least 5 years.  The home is nearly 3 years old and a great value for when I bought it (3.5 years ago).

Am I missing something here...but it seems like withdrawing from the 401K seems like a good option that'll get money in my hands the quickest...and get my wife out of the home the quickest (she agreed to move out 30 days after receiving the buyout).

My plan is to max the Roth 401k, max the Roth IRA if possible, and then outside of home upgrades is to pay an extra mortgage payment a month, and invest the remaining.

Additionally I have 2 separate 401ks with the Federal Government as a TSP. Not sure the rules if I am able to contribute to those or if I should with the excess money. Total investments currently are \~50k outside of my houses equity, and 2 paid off new cars.

Thanks for any feedback.",finance,1665782007
personalfinance,No federally backed loans for hurricane repairs?,"Hi folks. Hope I can express this clearly as I don’t know or understand much about finance.

I am currently trying to get a line of credit to complete some roof, siding, and interior repairs on a home that was damaged during a hurricane. The repairs are not super extensive (likely $10-20k) and the house is habitable, but the damage is visible, especially inside (water spots, cracked plaster).

My bank (Chase) and several other lenders I spoke to today said a home equity loan is not possible because of this damage. Something about the house probably not passing an inspection/appraisal, and that appraisal being necessary because the loans are serviced through either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac?

Additional context is that the house currently has no mortgage. I’m not sure if that’s what is making a difference? I’ve seen other posts in this sun that say HELOC is a good choice for home repairs, so I’m confused why these lenders are saying it’s not possible. Surely a home worth 300k isn’t a liability for a bank if it requires only minimal repairs, and if the funds borrowed are to complete those repairs?

Edit: I am not really in need of other suggestions, I posted mostly because I am trying to understand the limitations of HELOC &amp; why it is that banks aren’t interested in funding necessary repairs, even when the value of the property (damaged or not) far exceeds the cost of those repairs. Hopefully I won’t wind up in this situation again, but I’m trying to learn how all this works and what people are supposed to do when they need to make necessary repairs (rather than aesthetic upgrades), but lack the cash on hand to do so.

I am insured, but insurance companies in Louisiana are garbage and many went bankrupt after Hurricane Ida. Even the assessor who most recently came out to look at my property said, and I quote, “wow you really got screwed.”",finance,1665782371

personalfinance,Is this a good car deal?,"Wife and I had a baby and we are needing a second car, she is wanting an SUV. 

We found a 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe with 71k miles. 

After all dealer fees and taxes Dealer is wanting 26,387.82 as the cash price. 

He worked it to about 360/mo for 84 months. My credit is north of 770 and I do not know an interest rate as they said “the sales man doesn’t see it” so basically forcing me to go into the dealership to talk to finance guy. 

I have already told them I do not want any warranties or gap insurance or vin etching anything like that. 

Is this a bad deal? Should I wait? Should I go look for cheaper vehicles. I can afford 350-360 payments but I also need to remember about full coverage insurance and I do not want to be upside down, will this loan likely make me go upside down? Convince me to not get this vehicle. 

We currently only have one car so a second car is a must for us, just hoping to get some advice. I don’t wanna be in debt forever but I want to make sure my wife and newborn are in a safe vehicle",finance,1665783098

# **Dow closes 400 points lower to end a wild week of trading - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks slumped Friday, capping off a volatile week of trading, a day after posting a historic turnaround rally as investors digested inflation expectations.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 403.89 points, or 1.34%, to end the day at 29,634.83. Still, the index was up 1.15% on the week. The S&amp;P 500 shed 2.37% to 3,583.07 and notched its seventh negative close in eight days. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.08%, ending the day at 10,321.39, weighed down by losses in Tesla and Lucid Motors, which declined 7.55% and 8.61%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the week lower, falling 1.55% and 3.11%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Stocks fell to session lows after a consumer survey from the University of Michigan showed inflation expectations were increasing, a sentiment that the Federal Reserve is likely watching closely. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led declines as growth companies are most sensitive to interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; At the same time, bond yields spiked, with the rate on the 10-year U.S. Treasury topping 4% for the second time in two days as investors react to higher inflation expectations.
*****
&gt; Markets whipsawed throughout the week as investors weighed new inflation data that will inform the Fed as it continues to hike interest rates to cool off price increases. On Thursday, stocks staged a major turnaround. The Dow ended Thursday’s session up 827 points after being down more than 500 points at the intraday low. The S&amp;P 500 rose 2.6% to break a six-day losing streak, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.2%.
*****
&gt; Thursday marked the fifth largest intraday reversal from a low in the history of the S&amp;P 500, and it was the fourth largest for the Nasdaq, according to SentimenTrader.
*****
&gt; The moves followed the release of the consumer price index, a key U.S. inflation reading that came in hotter than expected for the month of September. Initially, this weighed on markets as investors braced themselves for the Federal Reserve to continue with its aggressive rate-hiking plan. Later, however, they shrugged off those worries.
*****
&gt; Still, persistent inflation remains a problem for the Fed and for investors’ worries around the central bank’s policy tightening.
*****
&gt; “With core CPI still moving in the wrong direction and the labor market strong, the conditions are not in place for a Fed policy pivot, which would be one of the conditions for a sustained rally in the equity market,” wrote UBS global wealth management chief investment officer Mark Haefele in a Friday note.
*****
&gt; “Moreover, as inflation remains elevated for longer and the Fed hikes further, the risk increases that the cumulative effect of policy tightening pushes the US economy into recession, undermining the outlook for corporate earnings,” he added.

&gt; # 7 Remembering The 1987 Crash

&gt; October is known for many things, with incredible market crashes likely being at the top of the list. The Crashes of 1929 and 1987 stand out for many investors and who could forget the selling and volatility of October 2008?

&gt; In honor of the greatest drop in stock market history, we’ll take a closer look at the crash of 1987. On Monday, October 19, 1987, the Dow fell 22.6% for the largest one-day drop in the more than 126-year history of the Dow. To this day it is still the largest percentage drop ever, but it now ranks as the 97th largest point decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1987crash-chart-800x395.png))**

&gt; What caused it? The funny thing is that 35 years later I’m not sure everyone can officially agree. Here are some things to know about the Crash of 1987:

&gt; * For starters, stocks were in the midst of a huge run off the August 1982 lows, with the Dow up more than 40% for the year in early August 1987, amounting to one stretched rubber band.
&gt; * Then consider Alan Greenspan took over the Federal Reserve Bank in August and to cool things off, was hiking rates. Talk about a bad time to start a new job.
&gt; * Program trading was blamed as well, with Louis Rukeyser the Friday night before the crash pointing out issues with program trading. (Simply put, program trading meant stocks were liquidated as certain levels were hit. It worked fine until stocks began to fall more than ever expected, leading to more selling as prices dropped.)
&gt; * Currency markets were on edge as well, as the U.S. wanted Germany to weaken their currency due to the latest trade deficit numbers. The back and forth was all over the media, as recently as the Sunday before the crash.
&gt; * The selling started earlier actually, as the three days before the crash the Dow was down 3.8%, 2.4%, and 4.6%, making it safe to say investors were on edge all weekend for how things might open on Monday morning.
In the end, the Dow fell a then record 508 points for a 22.6% one-day decline, topping the previous largest one-day decline of 20.5% in December 1914, when the Dow began trading after being halted for nearly five months due to World War I.

&gt; Something most investors might not know is that stocks still finished the year in the green in 1987. Sure, they were well off their highs and the huge volatility was too much for many investors to handle, but if all you saw was the yearly gain of 2% in 1987, you’d think it was a boring year!

&gt; We might not know what caused the Crash of 1987, but we also still don’t know what caused the Flash Crash either. The Flash Crash occurred in May 2010 (when many stocks and ETFs lost huge values, only to regain the losses by the close for one wild few minutes of trading). The truth is with more and more computers involved, we are due to get big swings periodically. March 2020 saw some of the largest swings of all time (seven of the 10 largest point declines ever took place during this year), putting major stress on the system.

&gt; Today we do have circuit breakers in place to help calm nerves should we see another major decline in prices, but it’ll take a huge drop for those to kick in.

&gt; In the end, volatility is the price of admission and although we think we are much closer to a major low in stocks currently, should we all have the privilege to invest long enough, there will likely be another day stocks fall significantly. And when they do, just remember that the Dow started trading on May 24, 1896, and it has seen wars, famines, pandemics, inflation, deflation, booms and busts, and more. Yet, it has always eventually come back to new highs and we don’t think this time will be any different.

&gt; # More Bears End in October Than Any Other Month

&gt; Not all indices have bottomed on the same day for all bear markets, but the lion’s share, or bear’s share I should say, bottomed in October.

&gt; Of the 23 bear markets since WWII 8 have bottomed in October for DJIA and 7 for S&amp;P 500, 6 for NASDAQ, significantly more than any other month. Over all three indices, 7 were in midterm October: 1946, 1960, 1966, 1974, 1990, 1998 &amp; 2002.

&gt; DJIA October bottoms: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1966, 1987, 1990, 2002 &amp; 2011. S&amp;P October bottoms: 1957, 1960, 1966, 1974, 1990, 2002 &amp; 2011. NASDAQ October bottoms: 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2002 &amp; 2011.

&gt; The month with the next largest amount of bear market lows is March with 4 for S&amp;P 500 – mostly recently in 2009 and 2020, previously in 1978 &amp; 1980. So, odds are a bottom is near.

&gt; # Inflation and Labor Still A Problem

&gt; The NFIB released its latest small business survey this morning with data as of the month of September. As we discussed in today's Morning Lineup, the report showed sentiment rebounded in September although labor market indicators decelerated further. That was also reflected in the report's survey of what businesses consider to be their most important problem. While those reporting 'cost of labor' as the biggest problem went unchanged, the percentage of respondents reporting quality of labor as their biggest concern dropped four percentage points to 22%. While there was an even lower reading as recently as July, it was the biggest drop since last December, and the current level has fallen out of the top decile of historical readings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101122-NFIB-MIP-2.png))**

&gt; While the lower reading in labor market-related problems seems to reaffirm the slowing employment situation, inflation concerns ramped up modestly in September. 30% of businesses (versus 29% in August) reported inflation as their biggest concern. Additionally, another inflation-adjacent reading also rose with 5% reporting the cost or availability of insurance to be their biggest problem.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101122-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

 &gt; On a combined basis, government-related concerns saw a net lower reading last month as well. Concerns around requirements and red tape rose up to a 5% share of responses, but those gains were offset by a two percentage point drop in the share of respondents seeing taxes as their biggest issue. With inflation and labor concerns remaining front and center of small business problems, government-related concerns continue to be muted to a historic degree.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101122-NFIB-MIP-3.png))**

&gt; While the bulk of responses view labor or inflation as their biggest issues—62% of combined responses report one of these to be their biggest problem—there was a considerable pickup in those choosing ""other"" as their response last month. That reading rose from 5% to 8% bringing it from a 14th percentile reading all the way up to the 65th percentile. That is now the highest reading since May when it came in at an elevated 11%. Unfortunately, the report does not provide further detail as to what those ""other"" concerns specifically are but geo-political issues are likely part of the mix.

&gt; # Hurricane Claims Come In

&gt; Last week's jobless claims number went unrevised whereas the latest week's data rose by 9K up to 228K. That brings the seasonally adjusted number back up to the highest level since the end of August and was the first back-to-back increase since the first week of August.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101322-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims remain a hair below 200K and in line with the readings from the comparable weeks of the year in the few years before the pandemic. We would also note that the increase in claims at this point of the year is very much a regular occurrence.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101322-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**

&gt; Turning to continuing claims, the latest print for data through the end of September saw a modest 3K increase to 1.368 million. That is only the highest level in three weeks as the indicator remains well below pre-pandemic levels, unlike initial claims.


&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101322-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; On a national level, claims are moving higher but it is perhaps too early to say we are in a new trend as opposed to things like seasonality and one-off events like the weather. While 80% of states and territories saw claims move higher this week, a large share of the national move was concentrated in the Southeast likely as a result of Hurricane Ian. In the table below, we show the state-level readings for initial and continuing claims (NSA). Roughly a third of the national move in claims was thanks to claims in Florida more than tripling week over week. Now, initial claims in that state are at the highest level since May of last year. That was matched with a significant pickup in continuing claims as well. Although they have a smaller impact on national claims, other hurricane-impacted areas like Puerto Rico also saw a significant uptick in initial claims.

&gt; # So Much for the Positive Wealth Effect

&gt; As the weakness in equities continues, we wanted to provide an update on where the major averages stand relative to their pre-COVID highs in February 2020. In the case of the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, they're both still up, but the gains are quickly fading. It has now been just about two and a half years since the pre-COVID high for the S&amp;P 500, and from that peak to this morning, the S&amp;P 500 is up just 5.5% and the Nasdaq is up 5.6%. On an annualized basis, that works out to less than 2.5%. What's that phrase people kept saying about irrational moves in stock prices?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101122-SP-Nasdaq.png))**

&gt; As if equity market returns relative to the pre-COVID high weren't pedestrian enough, keep in mind that once you take the impact of inflation into account, investors are actually now solidly in the red. The charts below show the performance of the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on an inflation-adjusted basis by adjusting historical prices based on headline CPI. After adjustments, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are both down 7.7% from their February 2020 highs. As bad as the investing backdrop has been for equities, long-term US Treasuries have fared much worse than that. On a nominal basis, long-term US Treasuries have declined 28%, and after adjusting for inflation, the declines have been well over 30%.

&gt; # Best Six Months Up 18-0 Midterm Years

&gt; Going back to 1950 the Best Six Months has is best performance from November of the Midterm year to April of the Pre-Election year, by a factor of three. And none of the other years of the 4-year cycle had zero losses.

&gt; December and February have been the weak spots with January and April leading the charge. From the October close to the April close BSM beginning in Midterm years gains 15.2% on average, up 18 down 0.

&gt; Post-Election BSM: Average 3.1%, 11-8. Pre-Election BSM 4.6, 13-5. Election BSM: 5.3%, 14-4.

&gt; Adding in the MACD timing indicator only improves the results slightly. This is worth noting this year at MACD triggered early and the Fed, inflation, recession, oil, the midterm elections, and Ukraine have pushed stocks to dangerous technical support levels. Proceed with caution.

&gt; # 3 Charts to Watch

&gt; First, the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.7% the first two days of October, for the best two-day start to any quarter since the second quarter of 1938. Be aware, the S&amp;P 500 added more than 40% after that bounce into the end of the year back then. But what about other 5% gains that spanned two days? Simply put, they are rare but also have taken place near some major lows in recent memory. As the chart below shows, most recently we saw this rare show of strength in March/April 2020, December 2018, August 2015, August 2011, and March 2009. In other words, those weren’t the worst time to accumulate stocks, and this strength more often than not marked the end of weakness and stronger price action was up next.

&gt; Second, the calendar could be a major tailwind for investors going forward. Looking at years that ended in “2” showed the S&amp;P 500 bottomed on October 5 historically and opened the door to a big rally. Years like 1962, 1972, 1982, 2002, and 2012 all saw big year-end rallies and we wouldn’t bet against 2022 joining this list.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/years-that-end-in-2-800x317.png))**

&gt; Third, midterm years historically bottom on September 30 before a strong end-of-year rally. Wouldn’t you know it, the S&amp;P 500 bottomed on September 30 before the huge early October surge. Could history be repeating? Speaking of seasonality, be sure to read this blog on fourth-quarter seasonality.

economy,Why can't the FED just sell higher interest rate I-bonds instead of raising the FFR?,"Supposedly, the goal is to lower inflation. 

What is inflation? It's an increase in the aggregate price of goods and services, right? 

So the FED is raising interest rates because that's their main lever to set monetary policy, pull money out of the economy.

Why raise interest rates? Raising interest rates should make businesses less likely to borrow, which should make them also less likely to hire new employees, expand, or increase inventories. Will likely make some businesses lay staff off.

As businesses stop borrowing money and begin paying more interest to service existing debts, they should start cutting costs by firing employees. As they fire employees, those people will no longer be able to buy goods and services at the inflated prices, they will need to go into survival mode.

Once enough people lose their jobs and are in survival mode, prices for non-essential goods and services should decrease, which will be interpreted as lowering inflation. 

This is a round about way of decreasing prices by killing demand, by making people people too poor to pay the current prices.

But the issue at hand is just the prices. It's already the case that as supply chains get back to normal many prices could go back to pre-pandemic levels. But why would they? Why would the prices come down if people are paying them?

I think prices are sticky and when businesses start getting $5 for something that used to cost $3 it's hard to get them to reset their prices to anything less. I think businesses sticking to inflated prices is the real problem. Top to bottom the supply chain gets used to inflated prices and no one is willing to lower prices unless nothing sells.

So, after all of that, I think the problem the FED needs to solve is lowering prices. I think the tool they're using is to make consumers too poor to buy anything by making it too expensive for them to borrow and by making it more likely for them to get fired by shrinking businesses.

I think an alternative approach would be for the FED to offer bonds with really high interest rates for a 2 or 3 year maturity, up to $20k, in increments of $100, and create an easy way to do this in partnership with the IRS.

What we really need is consumers to not buy goods and services at the current prices, that would force the prices to be adjusted. The FED can raise rates, in order to make people poor or out of work so they can't buy things, to bring down the prices. Or, they could give people an easy alternative investment that would also prevent spending at these prices but encourage saving or debt payments until companies reduce prices.

Companies aren't going to reduce prices unless demand is quelled. This can be done by making everyone too poor to buy at these prices, or by giving them an alternative investment that's too good to pass up in the short-term.",finance,1665794350

JPMorgan stood out with profits declining much lower than expected and a net interest income rose by 34% as they took advantage of rising rates. Bank stocks still went up by 2% to 4% as their profit falls were not as deep as feared.

stocks,Cathie Wood's Main ETF Closes at Five-Year Low in 78% Drop From Record,"(Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood’s flagship fund on Friday closed at its lowest level in five years, after suffering a 78% plunge from last year’s highs.

The ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) dropped 5.7%, finishing the day at $33.99 per share. The fund fell roughly 9.4% over the five-day stretch, its fifth straight weekly decline. 

“Nothing has changed in the larger macro backdrop -- a strong dollar is pressuring risk assets, inflation keeps surprising on the upside, rates are sticky and the Fed has to keep tightening,” said Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas Securities. “All of that is a bad combo for high-growth stocks.”

The year hasn’t been kind to the $6.7 billion ETF, as top holdings like Tesla Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. were pummeled. Growth-oriented assets, like tech stocks or retail-trading favorite Tesla, have tanked as the Federal Reserve raises rates to knock down scorching levels of inflation. 

Wood took the central bank to task this week for its aggressive tightening campaign, penning an open letter to officials to express concern that they could be making a policy error. 

Speaking at a conference on Tuesday, Wood said the current risk-off environment means investors are looking for safety in passive benchmark-tracking products and failing to recognize that her fund’s investments are positioned for the long haul. Wood and her firm have often said they are focused on at least a five-year investment horizon.

Wood’s other funds have also been battered this year, with most dropping 40% or more. The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) dropped 5.1% on Friday and closed at a record low.

solar,Buying home with existing solar loan,"About to go into contract on a home with an existing 23.9kW system (estimated annual production for the first year listed as 24,472 kWh). Unfortunately the owner has an existing solar loan with a $500/month payment (6% interest for 25 yrs) and an original purchase price of $75.4K after an $8k “rebate” (I assume local utility or state) which was provided to the contractor when it was installed in 2019. I imagine the owner probably received at minimum the federal tax credit (~$19.5k if it was 26% at that time?), possibly also a NY state tax credit, and likely pocketed these because basically the initial $75k principal is still remaining on the loan. 

Unfortunately I don’t believe the owner is willing to pay off the loan and would only take $10k off the price of the home to compensate for this. We want the house (which is otherwise priced fairly without the value of the panels). 

I don’t know what the system is currently producing, but the solar loan from Sunnova guarantees 20,600 kWh/yr for this 3rd year of its operation or they make up the difference. If we assume 20,600 KwH and $6k in annual loan payments, the cost per kWh is about $0.293. Over the last year they paid about $0.185/kWh from the utility provider. This is actually a generous comparison if anything bc the “guaranteed” 20,600 kWh pays out the difference, naturally, at only $0.167/kWh. 

Why would anyone ever pay 58% more than the cost of just getting the energy from the utility? Does the math basically only work with the federal tax credit? Did these folks get ripped off on the initial install price in 2019 given the system capacity? Is something missing from my math above? Any way that I can make this make sense?

personalfinance,"Starting real savings for retirement late, are we on the right track?","Bit of a tl;dr sorry, also my first post here so I am nervous, also the formatting got wonky on this

Husband is 53, I am 45 we have two young kids.

Income:

154,000 base

40K 1st year/30k second year bonuses disbursed quarterly

RSUs are not factored in right now, but RSUs for about a little over base salary vesting over 4 years

Savings:

New 401k 7% with 4% match will increase with COLA/raises to max

50K trad IRA (Old 401K rollover)

500 new Roth IRA

1K liquid savings

Debt:

Mortgage \~350,000 left

45K HEL 5-year repayment- 5.5% around 875 a mo, plan on throwing more at it with bonus/RSU disbursements and hope to pay it off in 2 not 5 years

Student loan 7K  at 3% - not sure if will be eligible for PLSF forgiveness before it's paid off but need one more year qualifying payments, interest rate is so low and payment is minimal - I have always just kind of let this ride out.

First bonus disbursement we paid off our consumer debt, opened the Roth, caught up on some needed maintenance, started the savings fund.

Plan:

save - 2000K + mo to IRA and emergency fund (1000 to savings 1000 to IRA till maxed/ savings is funded)  also plan on opening a HYS soon) 500 to sinking funds

Question: should we save more aggressively on the emergency fund? should we just chill on paying down the HEL first and save more so we don't end up needing to borrow? I am not sure here if getting rid of debt first ti wiser than saving up the fund.

RSUs and bonus disbursements : 1st) max one IRA,  2nd) some to HEL some to savings 4) to pay for needed home projects that arise  4th) save for 'new' car, 5th) once HEL paid and Emergency fund are funded then other investments.

Question: first RSU vest should net us around 30K, by then we could pay off the HEL or pay outright for a good safe car, which is the best thing to do?

401K we will bump up yearly with raises, or max it when pay the HEL offFuture raises that increase take-home pay after we max the 401K ... index funds?

We aren't planning on saving for the kid's college funds until if/when we look secure. They have 529's -grandma and other family give gifts that go there. I think we can use the Roth for college if needed or home equity, yes?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of retirement, we plan on working in some capacity till we hit 65-68 and taking out SS at 70 so we can max it. Neither of us sort of mentally expects to be able to retire, since that was the reality for so long. We just kinda figure we'll work till we can't and quit if we can, but I'd like to plan as if we can.

I am not currently working, I am a SAHP but I will be going back to work in a year.  I hope to earn 50+k and my income will be all savings and investments. But we can't count on that yet.  Any work I do will go towards savings even if it's only at 20$ an hr. I am realizing I may have to go back part time for a bit before full time. I will likely have a 401K option in any industry I return to. I am just hoping for 50K min at entry when full time. I was earning 40K when I left the workforce.

We both had low/mid wage jobs most of our adulthoods, it's only within the last 5 that my husband's income took off. (Married 8 years ago) We thought buying a house was the first best thing to do and we are glad we did when we did, we are in a HCOL area that went nuts on housing cost. But the house was a money pit for about 4 years. We can now finally save! Our goal is ultimately 20% or more of our salaries.

I am not looking for a ""where to trim fat"" kind of help,  I know we \*can\* save more. We spend about 800 a mo on niceties this is where we'd cut stuff first, 5500 ish is expenses, which leaves around 2800 for savings and sinking funds ( for clothes birthdays, maintenance, etc).  I don't consider sinking fund things to be part of regular savings since it's more of a revolving fund for yearly expenses, I shoot for 500-800 a mo, but the 2800 is variable between where we sock it.

I am asking is this strategy good, are we on the right track?  Am I learning/understanding the right planning strategies?

I know the more conservative of you will say save more! But we also are aware of time as older parents, and these are the years we want to really enjoy now with our kids and our health. Nothing crazy or lavish, camping, national parks, road trips, seeing older family while they are still here (all are in other states), making sure the kids have good experiences and opportunities as well.  Maybe one trip to Europe with them at some point before they move out.

We hope to putter around to national parks as camp hosts if our old age allows, that's our retirement goals. Nothing too crazy there either.Thanks! I have really appreciated the knowledge while lurking here for a while. I hope I am learning the right things?",finance,1665814526

**Avoid:** Anything that isn’t memeable

**Avoid:** Anything that’s more than 3 months old

**Avoid:** Anything that has a tech nerd running it

&amp;nbsp;

**Buy:** Anything that has “Inu,” “Elon,” “Baby,” “Safe,” or “Moon” in the name. 

**Buy:** Anything related to food/animals

**Buy:** Anything related to recent events. 

**Buy:** Anything promoted by a celebrity

**Buy:** Anything promoted by your Discord group

#Ooze Factor

A user commented [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/y1ohvn/daily_general_discussion_october_12_2022_gmt0/is21dbu/) that “Gary Vee oozes the very definition of a scammer.” This statement made me consider the “ooze factor” on crypto investments as an indicator of future gains. 

For instance, from this [NYT Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/magazine/elon-musk-twitter-billionaire.html)

&gt; “Musk oozes with a desperation to be thought of as funny, an ailment no amount of money can fix and perhaps his most relatable quality.""

As many of you know, Elon Musk is one of my crypto/investing heroes and his ooze factor is high, so the value of his invention, Doge, will only continue to rise. 

A post from ""Block Magnates"" states that:

&gt; The Fed Chairman, [Jerome Powell] ""Oozes confidence in taming inflation.""

As we all have seen, Mr Powell has done an incredible job controlling inflation during the post-Covid era. At this point, I think I've proved that successful financial leaders generall ""ooze.""

&amp;nbsp;

By now, we’re all aware of the accusations leveled against the Sushi Swap *Head Chef* Jared Grey, wherein he allegedly “fingered a horse.” He has since denied these accusations, but if it is true, ***he may be covered in horse ooze.*** Even if the odds are only 10% that it did happen,  I believe that the upside potential of “ooze factor” such as this is is great both for Finger Horse Inu and also for Sushi Swap.

Has anyone taken this approach?  If so, what are the upsides/downsides?

I  have $25,000 in long term and short term capital gains this year, and I'm looking at a pretty hefty tax bill.  Between state and federal taxes, I estimate I'll owe 25%.

I'm under the impression the odds are in favor of me day trading.   Theoretically there is a 50/50 the markets will go up or down.  If I buy $100k of SPY, for example and only hold it for the day - I  theoretically have a 50% chance of making money.  However if it goes down 1% and I sell, I realize a $1,000 loss.  This would lower my capital gains to $24,000.

Instead of me paying the gov't $6,250 on $25,000  I'd pay $6,000 on $24,000.   Which means my 1% loss of $1,000 is essentially a loss of 0.75%, or $750.  And if it goes up, same thing.  I make $1,000 and have $750 left over after taxes.

As long as I have capital gains, is there any downside to this strategy?",finance,1665859764

personalfinance,Paying mortgage off early with CDs,"Hello, I am curious if there is a better approach to paying off our mortgage early than my current strategy.  We were lucky to refinance to a 15 year 2% interest rate a few years ago and want to pay our house off early.

I plan to roll those CDs each year until I forecast we will pay off the principal.  This strategy also allows us to use this money for an emergency fund if something were to happen and it’s netted me around 4% on average returns.

stocks,"2% inflation means 0.17% MoM for 12 months. Last 3 MoM numbers - 0.0, 0.1, and 0.4. for an average of 0.23%.","Actually the last 3 month average is 0.17%, I used the wrong number in the title.  We are pretty much already on pace for 2% inflation, or at least, closer than most people think.

People seem to be forgetting how inflation works, specifically the 2% target inflation rate set by the Fed.  This is a year over year target that measures change in growth, not an absolute value.

A lot of people think lowering inflation means prices need to drop, but that's not correct.  It's actually the rate of increase that needs to drop, which has already happened.  If the MoM figures stay around the same level as in the last three months, then in 9 more months inflation will be fairly close to the Fed's 2% target.

Obviously there are a lot of other factors impacting the markets now.  But specific to inflation, the end may not be as far as you think.  The Fed is likely not going to keep pumping interest rates much higher than expected if the MoM numbers stay where they are.  Their policy is already working as intended.  Inflation takes time to unwind, just like it took a year to get to where we are now.  We just need to give some time for the YoY to ""catch up"", which will happen as long as MoM numbers stay low.

And yes, I know the Fed focuses more on core CPI, but I wanted to focus on their 2% target which pertains to all items.

Edit: To everyone telling me to use PCE instead, the last 5 MoM data points average out to 0.22% which is about the same as my example.",finance,1665871566

I would like to know how to reward DAOs not on a task basis, but by calculating their contribution through data analysis.  
If we can create that method with high quality, I believe we can create a new system of economy that will be upward compatible with capitalism.  
We call it freeism.  


About freeism

We came up with the ""freeism"" system as an alternative economic mechanism to capitalism.

It gives a new alternative to economic mechanisms that have had only limited choices, such as capitalism and socialism.

I know that many people are already thinking about this kind of thing, but I would like to implement it as a part of the social structure, not as a theoretical theory, and eventually create a society in which the entire economy revolves around freeism instead of capitalism.

&amp;#x200B;

Basic Mechanism of Freeism

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The following is an explanation of the basic mechanism of FREELISM.

&amp;#x200B;

The supplier is asked to provide all types of goods and services for free, and non-transferable points (SBT?) (called contribution points) are given to those who provide them.

There will be multiple ways to calculate contribution points, and we will also create a mechanism to provide them.

The mechanism is described below.

For products or services that are not available to all who want them (hereinafter referred to as ""limited edition products""), the points (hereinafter referred to as ""quota"") will be set as the square root of contribution points, and those who offer to use the most quota will be given priority in using them.

Instead of consuming contribution points as compensation for obtaining goods or services, they should only be accounted for so that they cannot be used to obtain other limited items.

Therefore, contribution points do not decrease even if a limited item is obtained but accumulate (exceptions apply. See below)

Necessity

The necessity of the quota is described below.

The method of calculating the quota is also described below.

This type of economic mechanism is called ""freeism.

Freeism is an economic model that can be finally established by using technologies such as data analysis, blockchain, web apps, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Dig a little deeper into the mechanism of FREESISM

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This section explains each of the mechanisms that make up FREESISM.

&amp;#x200B;

Contribution rules

The rules of contribution are the laws that govern life in a freeism society.

Or the country in which the law is located.

At first, only one rule exists, but just as there are multiple countries, multiple rules of contribution can be created.

The contribution rules should be easy for anyone to create.

I want the rules of contribution to be divided by ideology and taste (only some people emigrate based on taxation, culture, and taste, but for the most part, the current country is determined by birth and upbringing, and there are people with different tastes, values, and ideology in the same country, which creates conflict).

That is why we create the right of non-interference as the right not to interfere with others.

Each contribution rule has an end goal.

The end goal is discussed below.

&amp;#x200B;

The FREEISM Platform

The freeism platform is a mechanism to manage the rules of contribution.

The rules of contribution play a legal role.

The freeism platform becomes a higher-level entity like the Constitution OR the UN OR the federal government.

The freeism platform also has rules, and within the scope of those rules, they get to make the rules of contribution.

There will be multiple freeism platforms, and people will be able to join any freeism platform they want.

A freeism platform may also have an end goal.

The end goal is described below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Final Goal

The end goal is the goal that each freeism platform, each contribution rule, and each project (like a company) is aiming for.

It can be set by vote, decided at the establishment stage, or left to the decision-makers to set.

Set goals that you want to achieve, not goals or KPIs to achieve subdivided goals.

For example, ""increase in happiness,"" ""degree of health,"" ""increase in productivity,"" ""increase in the number of rational decisions made,"" and ""crime rate.""

It is unclear if we would set ""lower crime rate"" as a goal since even ""lower crime rate"" might be a goal to achieve higher levels of happiness. We want to set a goal that we are ultimately aiming for.

For FREEISM, we should set a final goal for the FREEISM platform, a final goal for the contribution rule, and a final goal for the project, and then calculate the contributions based on how much they have helped to bring us closer to or achieve that final goal.

Examples of final goals

Increase in productivity (working hours required to obtain goods and services) within the limits of the law

Increase in happiness within the limits of the law

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Contribution points

Refers to points required to obtain priority for limited items.

Contribution points are non-transferable.

However, loans are possible under some contribution rules.

Can I use SBT as contribution points?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How to Calculate Contribution Points

Contribution points earned are calculated based on ""the degree of contribution to the final goal"" ✖︎ ""market principle"" ✖︎ ""different weighting/rules for each contribution rule.""

Until now, it was ""market principles"" ✖︎ ""different weighting/rules for each country or region rule"", but we will add ""degree of contribution to the final goal"" to it.

I think the market principle is encapsulated in the degree of contribution to the final goal. However, if you still want to make further use of the market principle, you can give contribution points based on ""market principle x degree of contribution to the final goal"" or ""market principle only"".

The degree of contribution to the final goal could be calculated using multiple regression analysis or other data analysis methods or methods to visualize DAO's task-based contribution.

See below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Quota

The quota is a mechanism to avoid monopolizing the service, and if the service can be provided to everyone, the quota is not used.

Each contribution rule has a different way of calculating the quota, and each person is given a quota weighted by contribution points (contribution points ✖️0.9 = amount of quota, etc.) or the square root of contribution points.

The amount of quota used will be the price.

There is a negative correlation: the lower the winning rate of a product or service, the more quota it occupies, and the closer the winning rate is to 100%, the less quota it occupies.

In FREESISM, the quota is always used while the limited item is in use, and the amount used always reflects the market value, not the amount used when it was acquired.

The structure of the quota differs for each contribution rule.

The period you occupy a quota should be the period you own that limited edition item.

If you give it away or throw it away, you can apply for it on the FREEMISM platform, or the service will automatically detect it and release the use of the quota.

To prevent ""false applications"" where people apply to give it away when they own it, make it necessary to give it away or throw it away at a predetermined location or app.

Create an incentive to have it detected through the app, since it should be detected from each app and if not through the app, it will occupy the frame all the time.

Make it impossible for people to report that they have given it up on their own, other than by having the app automatically detect it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FREEISM

In freeism, if other people refer to the products, services, source code, or other deliverables developed by each person, or to know-how and other things such as research findings, they will receive only a portion of the contribution points earned by the person they refer to, such as 0.5 times the contribution points earned by the person they refer to.

Thereby.

If someone only submits an idea and others implement it, the person who submitted the idea will also receive a portion of the contribution points earned by the person who implemented it.

If another company started a business and failed but was successful in running it by avoiding the strategies of the failed company, then allow the people who worked in the failed company to receive a portion of the contribution points earned by the successful company.

That way, where it was 0-1 to succeed or fail, maybe we could make it so that even if it fails, it is not 0-1 financially, but there is some benefit.

Since points are just points, unlike the currency, they don't have to be distributed and can be offered to both.

But it's hard to determine if that's what I was referring to.

I will discuss this later.

We want a society where everything is open source.

I want to create a society where every no-how, patent, and other thing is open source, by weighting the contribution points that can be earned if others use the no-how, and by weighting the contribution points that can be earned just by making it open source, such as 1.2 times the contribution points that can be earned by making it open source.

Everyone gets it without having to distribute, and being open source could lead to more compensation for sharing without monopolizing rather than monopolizing and competing.

But if the relative position without distribution determines whether you get a limited product, is it the same as when profits were shared?

It's more mentally stable because you don't have to fight for a piece of the pie.

The basic idea is to think in terms of rules of contribution, where the only rule is the degree of contribution to the liberal end goal, but when considering various rules of contribution, we can make a law that regulates each of them in a way that is characteristic to the sound of each rule of contribution.

Even if any action is the wrong action or not, we will stipulate that only actions that have a bad impact on the final goal contribution level are bad.

Even theft would not be a crime if it did not negatively impact anyone.

Somewhere the idea is like a woman who says it's not cheating if she doesn't get caught in a love story about whether or not she qualifies as cheating.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The position of each

In freeism, the system is divided into a freeism platform, contribution rules, projects, and other mechanisms.

The freeism platform is the role of the federal government, the contribution rule is the role of the state government, and the project is the role of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Project

The role of the company.

The idea of freeism is to make everything open, so all the data of companies that are currently hidden will be shared and made available to everyone so that the contribution points earned will be weighted 1.1 times more than before.

Or, by being more open, make the service more technical and reliable, so that it is seen as contributing to the well-being and other end goals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Price

The lower the winning rate (the percentage of people who apply who win), the more quota is occupied and the more the beneficiary pays.

The amount of quota used becomes the price, so if the winning rate increases, the price becomes ""completely free"" with zero quota use of zero yen.

In capitalism, even for products with high demand and high supply, the price is close to the cost, but the beneficiaries bear the burden.

In FREEMISM, the overall goods and services are cheaper because they are negatively correlated with the winning rate, regardless of cost.

Furthermore, since the added value cannot be added to the price, the price becomes cheaper by that amount, and the beneficiary burden of freeism is better than the beneficiary burden of capitalism.

The provider of goods and services receives nothing from the beneficiary for providing goods and services, and the beneficiary pays nothing to the provider for acquiring goods and services, which only increases the amount that occupies the quota managed by the freeism platform.

The provider can offer goods and services to those who cannot afford to pay for them, and if they do, the business will be compensated.

  
Life of FREEISM

Let's imagine and write about what society would be like in a society where FREESISM is realized.

&amp;#x200B;

Download or use any of the web apps, native apps, VR or AR apps of the freeism app (which also serves as the freeism platform) that manages all the functions of freeism, from a web app, native app, VR, or AR app, or a browser.

In the freeism app, choose the contribution rule to which you want to belong.

Enter various information about yourself and link it to the contribution rule you have chosen, and generate an account with the data for that contribution rule.

You can put the date of the contribution rule you belong to as a property in your wallet for Web3, or in your Google account for Web2, etc.

With the account containing that data, data is acquired from various applications and the contribution rules are calculated using that data.

Furthermore, according to each contribution rule, you can display 00 content on Twitter, but not 00. If the content is prohibited by each rule of each contribution level, such as ""00 content is allowed to be displayed on Twitter, but 00 is prohibited,"" each rule of each contribution level will be detected from the account and automatically hidden.

When you want to get a product or service on each platform of freeism services or existing services (Amazon, Spotify, etc.), you can get the person's contribution points from the API that can get the contribution points of each person managed by that freeism platform, and Then, we can set up an input field in the platform, such as Amazon, where people can input how many quotas they want to offer, and those who offer the highest amount will be given priority to receive?

Is it faster to create a new one?

Those who offer limited items in the above process will receive contribution points for the contribution rules to which they belong.

There is no such thing as an exchange rate between multiple contribution points, so the more contribution rules that contribute to the ultimate goal of the freeism platform, the larger the percentage to be offered (tentative idea).

Compatibility between freeism platforms is discussed below.",technology,1665880895
personalfinance,20K CC Debt. Consolidation/Payoff Options?,"I have approximately 20K in CC debt accumulated over a few cards. Interest is creeping up and giving me anxiety. Historically, I've been making more than the minimum payments, but I had a rough year, followed by a paycut over most of this year. I've had a few large expenditures lately across cards (vet, medical, other personal) and right now feel the pressure - I pay my debts and can't say I have 10% take home after all payments made to put away for myself. My savings is now gone.

I'm taming the autodraft stuff that had gotten out of hand, my habits on ordering delivery/shopping have largely improved as well. So I'm actively addressing the core problem that got me into this place. I'm working on learning new personal skills to hopefully take a better paying job in the not too distant future, but the restart of federal loan payments is looming and that's lit the fire of panic. 

I've already talked with my bank and they cannot extend the existing loan I have with them for the requested amount (I consolidated a few years ago, still paying off) - again, I've addressed the core problem - I just need to get out of this hole. 

I figure I'm looking at a debt consolidation loan, credit counseling (I genuinely hope they can be the middle man so I don't have to call the card companies myself), borrowing against my equity is an option (bank was okay with that), but I don't hope to stay in this condo another 5-10 years. That's risky, but it's definitely an option. 

Getting a second job right now is not feasible due to health reasons. I do hope to look for a flexible side hustle in future months once I've recovered a bit more to delegate my time more vigorously. 

Should I look into the equity and just pay them ASAP? Debt consolidation loan, which is probably looking at high APR, if approved? Trying again with my credit union with a good faith promise? Other option I might be overlooking? 

I'm not missing any payments at this time, but I do find myself having to use the cards still for life stuff after the debts are paid. I'm in the orange zone and need to get myself out before January. 

I live alone, I ""own"" my home. I have an old capitalized Sallie Mae loan I'm paying currently, bank loan, and 4 CC's I could attack with snowball once I get myself out of this hole. Fed loan payments will be around 250 once they resume payments. 

I'm mostly having a bit of trouble getting organized, and the bank wasn't very friendly to sit down and help me figure this out. I'm neurodivergent (autistic), not that it's an excuse. I live alone and my place is too small to take on a tenant, unfortunately. I am looking at the potential of changing jobs, but with the looming recession, I'm hesitant to make any drastic compromises to what little security I have at the moment.

EDIT: thank you all so much for the amazing feedback :) i really didn’t expect this many helpful people to come to my rescue. i’ll probably just sit back and save more money for a better down payment + cover any fees that come my way. instead of going to a dealership i’ll try to find a private seller and a mechanic who is willing to check out the vehicle before i purchase it. you guys are awesome!!",finance,1665886341

CryptoCurrency,We can perform any type of analysis we want. There's only one thing to look out for until recovery.,"And that's the start of the next credit cycle. 

I will try and keep this simple and brief. 

The economy works in [cycles](https://storage.googleapis.com/fe-storage/2022/02/0cf335a1-economic-cycle-diagram-01.png). It will have its highs and lows, the shits and the greats. The goal is to keep a **long term productivity trend**. That's it.

The fact is this: [We have been in a bull run since the 2010's](https://imgur.com/a/1l2R7tD). [GDP growth has been positive](https://imgur.com/a/YTomnzd) (except for the quarters affected by the pandemic), interest rates have been low, borrowing was fueling the economy, assets were booming. The party had to be stopped (or paused) at some point, but when the pandemic was announced, **we kicked the can down the road with money printing.** This was the smart choice, you can't have a pandemic and a recession, no matter how you slice it.

So what now? Inflation is high so rates are increasing right? Inflation should take about a year to drop from its peak (if all goes well). Its measured on a YoY basis, that's why it will take a while. For now, it's only **decelerating.**

What does that mean? 

**This means that interest rates will keep going up, borrowing will dry, asset prices will have to drop until inflation goes down.** It's simple. The fiat currency system is built on the basis of inflation. But it needs to be kept moderate. 

The truth is that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies never existed through a recession (which we are in one now). So, to provide an educated guess along with some mild hopium, here's what I think will happen:

1. Cryptocurrencies will follow the market for the next 9-12 months. 

2. Inflation cools down and starts dropping around mid 2023. *Depending on the war situation &amp; energy prices*

3. Interest rates will start going down by the end of 2023 **IF** inflation starts approaching the 2-4% mark. - *recovery period*

4. Economy starts going through it's expansion period again, business will begin to borrow more and grow. Risk on assets (tech &amp; growth stocks and cryptocurrencies) - *expansion period*

5. Bitcoin halves around March 2024. This will kick off the next bull run **IF** steps 2-3 go as planned.

Now you're probably thinking: *Why should I listen to you?*

financialindependence,Looking for help with FAFSA optimization for FIRE folks,"I searched a little, but didn't find anything that looks like any sort of consensus, definitive best practice for FIRE community to plan on optimizing FAFSA the way we optimize federal taxes. Is it Cunningham's law that says the fastest way to get the right answer is to post the wrong one oneline? Anyway, this post is sort of my attempt at that.

Apologies in advance for being long-winded. This started out as my own notes for myself (posted to my personal blog with readership of exactly 2 people), but once I realized how much I'm probably misunderstanding, I thought I'd post here. 

ETA: as u/Zphr points out in the comments here and in their post from a year ago, starting Fall of 2023 (Edit2: for FAFSA forms filled out in Fall 2023, for the 24-25 school year) there is a new path to auto-zero EFC. It'll be based on ~~2021~~ 2022 tax returns, but is much more generous than previous stuff, and probably is the primary thing that FIRE folks should optimize for. Rather than repeat the details here, please follow [this link](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/mn3d83/possible_fire_impacts_starting_immediately_from/) (also linked below, but I hadn't appreciated how big a deal it was).
----

I have recently become very interested in how FAFSA works, and college finances more generally. I had a general notion of things, but between my oldest kid (whom I'll call Sonny in this post, and I'll call the next oldest Sister, so that I can repost this to reddit if I want) actually applying to schools, and my friend asking me lots of question about *his* kids, I have recently spent time getting a better handle on it. This post is meant to capture what I've learned. I'll update it as I find errors or learn new things. Perhaps others find it useful, but as with most of this blog, it's for me more than anyone else. This is all written to parents, so students and grandparents need to adjust accordingly.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

### Executive Summary

If you want to fund your *grandchildren's* education expenses, set up a 529 with *you* as the beneficiary as soon as your last child is done filling out FAFSA forms. If you want to fund your *children's* education expenses, first make sure you are maxing out IRAs and 401ks, and only then should you fund a 529. If you will have ""low"" income during any of the years your kids will be in college or grad school, there might be some benefit to keeping non-retirement assets minimal. As with all things personal finance, optimization requires a little forecasting.

### ""Rich"" Schools vs ""Regular"" Schools

Some schools are very expensive, but also have large endowments. At these schools, FAFSA might still be used to calculate how much the school gives a student, but (a large portion of) the aid is coming from the school, not from the government. To quote [Stanford's page](https://financialaid.stanford.edu/undergrad/how/index.html) on why their net cost numbers differ from information published by the Federal Government (emphasis added):

&gt; The federal data is based only on federal aid recipients.  Because Stanford meets need for eligible students without expecting them to borrow, **only a small portion of our aid recipients receive federal aid** and are included in the federal report. 

I'm fuzzy about how things work at regular schools, but I think there is a big difference between federal aid in the form of subsidized student loans and direct aid in the form of reduced tuition (or ""need-based scholarship"" or similar). If you ""optimize"" your situation and that results in you qualifying for $50k of subsidized loans instead of $30k, sure, that saves you interest. But it's not nearly as relevant as qualifying for $50k of tuition reduction instead of $30k, which is worth the full $20k.

Sonny is applying to rich schools that are very expensive. Stanford's sticker price, for example, is $82k per year. I'm not totally sure that the same optimization tradeoffs apply to regular schools, and my thinking is mostly based on Stanford-like schools (for now).

### Expected Family Contribution (EFC) Heuristics

The aid calculation roughly follows a simple formula: (School Costs) - (Expected Family Contribution) = (Total Aid)

The EFC is divided by the number of students simultaneously enrolled in college. If Sonny goes to a very expensive school during the same year that Sister goes to a very cheap one, Sister might receive no aid even while Sonny receives a boatload. Since ""Total Aid"" can't be negative, this can only help the family as a whole.

EFC is based on 4 things, namely the assets and income of the parents and student. In each case, some of the category has an ""allowance"", so, for example the first $7k of student income has absolutely no affect on EFC. But at the margin, the categories' affects aid are as follows:

* Parent After-tax Income: 47%.
  * ""After tax"" gets tricky. The allowances for taxes are actual federal income tax, 9% for NY, and 7.65% for Social Security (up to $137,700).
  * If you are in the 12% federal bracket, then the 47% is really 33%. 
  * If you are in the 22% federal bracket, then the 47% is really 29%.
* Parent Assets: 5.64%, in two parts. Assets are converted at a 12% rate into ""adjusted available income"" and then the 47% applies to that. 12% x 47% = 5.64%.
* Student Income: 50%.
* Student Assets: 20%.

The allowances for each category are in the EFC Formula Guide (linked below) and depend on a few things such as family size, but for Sonny's situation, they are:

* Parent Income Allowance: All federal income taxes paid, plus 7.65% SS tax allowance, plus 9% for NY taxes, plus a value from Table 4 which for us is $41,670.
* Parent Asset Allowance: I can't believe it, but if I'm reading it right, just $3,300.
* Student Income Allowance: $7k.
* Student Asset Allowance: None.

### Optimization for Regular People

I don't know what ""regular"" means. If you're sending a kid to college at all, you're probably not early-career, and you're probably not working minimum wage. Probably you've saved for retirement, but maybe you don't have too much saved outside of retirement accounts. 

If you have income of $100k and relevant assets of $100k and four kids, your EFC is about $13k. ""Hiding"" those assets somehow would drop it to $7.5k. So paying off your mortgage early, or spending a few years maxing out 401k contributions and spending the regular savings is probably a good strategy. Just about any school is going to cost more than $13k, so this is all useful effort. If your kid is making bank and saving for college, saving in a 529 makes the money look like parental assets instead of student assets. $10k in a 529 compared to $10k in the student's bank account affects aid to the tune of about $1,400.

If you have income of $200k, no relevant assets, and only two kids, then your EFC is about $41k. In that situation, you probably won't get any aid for ""cheap"" schools, so the optimization only matters if your kid goes to an expensive school, or if you can easily hide a *lot* of income. **In other words, the best optimization for high-income folks is simply to send your kid to a cheap school.**

Although EFC is calculated based on all 4 categories, what you end up with is just a single number for computing aid, and no one forces you to draw on the 4 categories in the way the formula suggests. If you expect income to be constant through four years of college, then there is a benefit to using assets to pay for tuition instead of income. That is, if you have $100k in assets and you normally pay an extra $500/month on your mortgage, don't redirect the $500/month to tuition when your kid starts college. Instead, spend down that $100k on tuition (or better yet, spend *all* $100k on paying down the mortgage, since your home value doesn't count for FAFSA). Similarly, if your kid earns $5k their freshman year and has $5k in the bank, you (as a fiscally responsible, long-term thinker) might want them to spend the $5k of income on tuition, and graduate with $5k still in the bank. If, instead, your kid spends $5k on a toga party with their fraternity (or a car, or whatever), it affects EFC by $1k per year and therefore only costs them $1k. Money is fungible and this gets complicated, but the point is that the EFC formula incentivizes some weird behavior. I'm not a fan of crazy shenanigans to exploit the system, but the formula certainly pushes people in the direction of shenanigans, and we each draw our own line for what counts as crazy.

FAFSA looks at your tax returns from two years ago for the purposes of income (though it looks at your present assets). It would cost you an awful lot to have a taxable windfall that shows up in AGI occur two years before a kid goes to college. For example, if your siblings decide to cash out Mom and Dad's life insurance policy early, creating a large taxable event, and then two tax-years later your kid goes to an expensive school, that windfall increases EFC by roughly 37% (assuming no SS tax on it), on top of whatever taxes you paid at the time.

Because FAFSA estimates a percentage for state tax allowance based solely on your state, not your actual state income taxes paid, 529 plans (and other state tax deductible things) can be slightly more valuable than things that provide federal tax deductions, though federal taxes are so high that it's usually still better to get a federal deduction.

Here's a tip about 529s. Beneficiaries are easily changed to any member of the family, and the account value only shows up if the owner is the student or their parent (and in both cases it shows up as parental asset). If the owner is someone else, then distributions show up as student income. Since there is a delay on how income affects FAFSA, and since there is a lifetime max of $10k for using 529s to pay down student loans, the best strategy is usually to use up to $10k of 529 money to pay down student loans *after* college, and if there is more than $10k available, use it for tuition during the last two years that the student would otherwise be borrowing money. A grandparent can set up a 529 with themselves as beneficiary, and easily switch the beneficiary to their grandchild at the appropriate time. I'm not sure how this works for multiple grandkids of the same age, but it does seem like you can do transfers in a way that makes this workable. If an older sibling is the owner and beneficiary and has leftover money, wait to switch to the younger sibling until the younger sibling is almost done borrowing.

### Optimization for High-Asset, Low-Income People (ie, Early Retirees)

Suppose you are considering early retirement, which might drop your income dramatically. If your child will go to college in Fall of 2023, then you want your 2021 tax return to reflect that lower income. But also, you need to check whether your non-retirement assets already push you out of aid range. 

If you have no income (which you won't, but let's pretend) and $1M in relevant assets (meaning, $1M outside of IRAs and 401ks) and four kids, then your EFC is about $30k. Note that available income can go negative, so even though there is a $41k allowance for income, it is not the case that your first $41k of income has no effect. If the contribution from assets pushes your adjusted available income above $35k, then the 5.65% marginal rate still applies.

Anyway, $30k of EFC means cheap schools won't give you any aid, but it's close enough that if you can easily get it down a few hundred $k (paying off mortgage, buying that car, taking that huge vacation, whatever) it might help. And of course, expensive schools cost way more than $30k, so everything counts.

If you can spend money on something you were going to buy *anyway*, spend that money before you fill out FAFSA.

If you can delay/defer income until your (youngest) kid is a junior or senior (and they aren't planning on using FAFSA in grad school), delaying and deferring is very valuable.

If you plan on giving your kid money that will show up on FAFSA, giving it to them after college to help them pay down student loans is probably FAR more valuable than giving it to them before college to pay for tuition. This is especially true if your are a grandparent or aunt and don't have FAFSA stuff of your own at the time.

personalfinance,Looking for feedback and advice. I'm in deep financial trouble and need help deciding what to do next.,"*Posting using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I understand a lot of the feedback I get will be brutal, but there's not much anyone can say to me that will make me feel worse than I already do. I'm at rock bottom.*

I’m in trouble and not thinking clearly. I need help evaluating my options. My consumer debt is up to $65k now and has become overwhelming. Just found out I owe a $950 state tax payment that I have no cash to pay. I don’t even have $300 to pay my accountant for the damn tax filing. Thought I could charge the fee but just realized I can’t.

I’m so panicked and anxious I can’t sleep at night without sleeping pills anymore. I can’t even eat anything most days. I feel sick and worried all the time.

I f’ed up massively. I see now I can’t be trusted with any credit, full stop, ever. I’m a compulsive shopper and it has ruined me with shame and embarrassment. I understand from the bankruptcy forum that even if I filed, I don't have an extra $10k to pay an attorney and I'd have to do a 100% payback under Chapter 13. I'd escape the interest is all. Which is certainly a huge thing, I'm just trying to figure out if there's another way to do that without filing.

With my income (details below) I know I shouldn’t be in this mess. I’ve been carrying high balances for decades and intermittently paying them down, but my credit score stayed in the 800 range all my life. Now it’s dropped to 730 as APRs are rising and my utilization is rising. I’m paying $1000/mo in interest on cards alone and I’m drowning.

I have about $200k equity in my home, which has a current market value of about $450k. The 401k I started when I was 22 is currently worth $350k (down from $550k a year ago, thanks stock market!). Can’t sell the house and move because in my area, apartment rent would cost more than my mortgage, let alone another house.

I’ve saved about $20k for my kid’s college costs in a 529 account, but every dollar I’ve put into it in 2022 has been wiped out by market losses. I’m current on all my stupid cards but not making a dent in what I owe.

I've tried getting a better job, but my age is preventing me from even getting interviews. And medical expenses at my current job are so low (details below) I’m reluctant to lose that benefit.

Every month now I run out of cash by the 15th because I pay all my bills electronically to make sure they’re not late. Last month my Citi payment was auto-sent 3 days early, so they counted that as me not having made a payment in the current billing cycle. They reported it as 30 days late because I didn’t have another $450 to send to them. They instantly cut my available credit from $26k to $15k, which is only $500 more than my balance. My credit score dropped 11 points the next week. I expect my other cards will jack up their rates now too.

I don’t do anything event remotely fun anymore. I barely eat anything because I'm so anxious and because I don't have the money to buy much. I’ve started selling everything I own but I’m not making much from it. What little I have goes to some expense or other that always comes up. I can't get ahead and I can't dig out. I feel so hopeless and scared.

Should I stop contributing to my 401k even though I lose the match? Get a second job, like a part-time night job, to try to bring in more money, even though I'm so depressed and anxious it would be tough to motivate to do it? I just don't know what to do.

personalfinance,"Buying New Car - Car Loan, or other method?","I'm putting this out there to see if anybody has any ideas on things I haven't considered in my auto-purchasing decision.  Here's some context:

* My wife and I have no debt other than mortgage (&lt;270k, house valued about 440k)
* Purchase price: 35k (about 30k for car, 5k for warranty &amp; sales tax)
* Liquid assets:  17k (12k after-tax investment accounts; 5k savings &amp; checking)
* Available assets: 40k (20k life-insurance cash-value; 20k in Roth IRA contributions)

We are looking to move in the next 2 years (same area, different school district), so I'm cognizant both in wanting to be sure we can hit 20% down-payment on the new house (550k-615k range) and not damaging my credit score substantially (currently &gt; 800).

The car is actually my parents' car; they're buying a new one and selling this one.  If it weren't for the unique circumstances I wouldn't be buying a new car right now, but since this is a car that would ordinarily be out of range for me, but they're giving me a good deal on it, I want to seriously explore the option.  It's a 2019 Volvo with 80k miles on it, but I know it's had no issues and has been well maintained.

So here are my options to purchase, as far as I can tell:

* Traditional car loan:  Would likely be around 7% interest due to private-party (not dealer) sale
* Personal loan: I can get a personal loan for the same interest rate, which seems like a better deal because it avoids the  lien
* Cash: I have an offer from a credit card to borrow up to 25k at 0% APR until Feb '24.  My plan would be to borrow 15k (other 15k come from life insurance loan), pay off about 8k when we sell our existing car (that we're replacing), and then pay off the remaining by Jan 24.  Paying the $500 / month isn't difficult today, but if we were to get a new mortgage it may be challenging.  Worst-case scenario, I could sell some other investments, take out more money from life-insurance, or even draw down Roth contributions so I don't end up paying the 20% cc APR.

What I can't figure out is credit score impact, and/or how a mortgage UW would view these options.  Does anybody have any opinions about dos / don't's here?  Anything I'm not factoring?",finance,1665936156

This is my installation.  It was done by [A&amp;R Solar](https://www.a-rsolar.com).  (I have no affiliation with them aside from being a customer.)

My contract originally specified 410W Panasonic panels.  There were supply problems (also reported by at least one other poster here) so three weeks before installation we switched to 405W REC panels from their [Alpha-Pure line.](https://usa.recgroup.com/alpha)

I started talking to eight installers and whittled it down to three finalists.  I chose an installer that answered all of my questions, was higher up on the ""minimal service &lt;--&gt; full service"" scale, and was a [Certified ""B"" Corporation](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification/).

The installation took four days.

* SolarEdge
* Total cost, pre-Fed tax incentives: $40,862
* Power: 12.56 kW
* $ / Watt: $3.25
* Projected annual energy: 10,400 kWh in year one

I pushed the companies to maximize the panel count.  My roof has multiple faces and generally has a shallow slope.  There are five (!) different panel locations.  As a side-effect, the energy generation curve changes slope at regular points in time as the sun moves in the sky.  This is because each group has a different power curve based on their orientation relative to the sun's path.

Here's the panel layout.  Note, North is actually about 10 degrees counter-clockwise from what the compass rose indicates.

personalfinance,Financing a motorcycle at 0% interest rate?,"Hi, would you ever finance a motorcycle if the interest rate was 0% for 12 months? 

I am currently looking at purchasing a motorcycle and originally planned to buy it outright in cash. However one of the dealers I’m talking to offers financing at 0% interest rate for 12 months for those with good credit standing, which according to the tiered structure I apparently qualify for.

I am always looking to increase my credit score for larger purchases later down the line, and was thinking about how I might leverage this transaction to to do just that.

I hear a lot of people advising against financing toys, but in this instance, would it be an acceptable strategy to increase my credit score without paying interest?

I imagine my credit score will go down temporarily, but then boost back up to say 40-50 points (according to the guy I was talking to) by the end of the 12 months, which seems like a no brainer coming from an opportunistic mindset. Or not? Sounds like I’d be opening up a new line of credit with their financing program, but if I go this route I’d just close it after paying off within the 12 months (sorry if any of this is obvious, I am learning here).

I see a handful of posts about financing motorcycles with varying perspectives, but curious if anyone has any perspectives to share about this specific situation—also I am not as financially savvy so my apologies here, I am learning as I go.

personalfinance,Unsure what to do with incoming car accident settlement,"Thank you for reading, I am looking for advice on what to do with a lump sum settlement I am anticipating- to be anywhere from $60-100k in the next few months. 

My financial situation is a little strange, I am currently a 30 year old stay at home single mom (previously engineering though I doubt I can get back into that field at this point) but my net income is roughly $3000 per month due to social security benefits my children receive after the death of their father. I work part time when I can so I do bring in my own money but my children are young so it’s not much since I have to stay with them. I own my house with no mortgage, but I did take out a $30k HeLOC loan this year with roughly 6% interest. Other than that I have no debt, credit cards paid off every month and my car is paid off and in good condition. I budget every month and have about $5k in liquid savings, $35k in my retirement accounts (ira). 

I am trying to figure out how best to manage this incoming settlement. My ultimate goal is to buy an investment property I can rent on air bnb since I live near the beach and property management is my goal for my next career move. But to do so I would need to use most if not all of the settlement to put 20% down which feels risky to me. I’m also considering paying off my HELOC , maxing my retirement contribution for the year and keeping the rest in savings for the future. I’m torn about paying off my debt because right now I only pay $220 per month on it and even though it’s a high interest rate it’s not difficult for me to manage. 

I do not plan on working full time for another two years when my youngest is in school full time , but when I do my income will obviously be substantially increased. So I’m wondering if I should hold off buying an investment property for a few years and just hold onto the money, investing somehow but I don’t know where.

stocks,Tesla in the week ahead,"So… Tesla reports this week and the Twitter V. Musk trial begins tomorrow October 17. So it goes without any question that it’s a pretty important week for the stock. So let’s look at some scenarios.

A. Twitter: many lawyers and “twitter users have analyzed the deal and most of them agree that he’ll have to buy the company. Even he thinks he has to buy since he recently went back to his original bid of $54.20… so this is where it gets interesting, the past 15 days the company has plunged 30% and although there are other reasons for this (delivery miss &amp; general macro) a big portion of it is due to the anxiety created by him having to sell more shares since many financiers have expressed un interest. Many folks have said that he can’t sell any shares since he’s in a blackout period due to earnings u less he sells with the 10B5-1. Nonetheless as previously done, when he sells the stock plunges. 

B. Deliveries Miss and China outlook. After the delivery numbers, the stock has been on a downward trend. It’s no question that the amount of analyst that had to adjust their forecast was significant and (fear) of an earnings miss has caused hedging and trimming of the security. But, if you’re faced with a choice of missing deliveries, but preserving your margins for the upcoming earnings, you’d prefer the latter. Also, this delivery miss has lowered expectations which is a good thing… but has also pushed back those (on the way cars) to q4 which they can (GUIDEEE) in the upcoming earnings. So lower expectations, and since the bar is low you can guide upwards. Which imo is the most important. 

C. Exit liquidity. If Musk does indeed have ti sell shares, I bet he doesn’t want to do it at these levels so they’ll probably be inclined to give good news so that he can unload. Think about it… a negative guidance outlook, a miss in EPS and selling pressure from Elon… that’s catastrophic for the stock. 

D. This is all connected, perhaps the underwriters of the Twitter deal know that he is going to sell shares and they are “hedging” putting selling pressure on the stock. If they sold too much stock it would be suspicious… so they can hide behind the “we were hedging vale” 

E. Sometimes outside factors change so dramatically that courts look at contracts and conclude that since the variables have changed so much and it’s out of the parties hands there might be an ease in the enforcement. (Unlikely) since he’s the richest man and can indeed fund the purchase. But let’s say so… interest rates are UP significantly since the BID for the company was made. Some of the underwriters are rumored to not want to do the deal anymore because it doesn’t make sense for them… also the tool Elon was using to fund his purchase has been tesla stock and that’s down tremendously from when the deal was made… (again.. Unlikely).

There’s more but I’d make this post longer than it already is. This is not financial advice, this is my opinion. I’m just some random dude on the internet. I’m also not an attorney, the twitter stuff is things I’ve heard and read about.",finance,1665958539

stocks,Yet another stagflation post,"Okay everyone, I know there has been a lot of discussions regarding the bear market that we are in and that it will take forever to get back to ATH and so on, but I still see people writing “Should I sell now for a loss or sit it out?”, so obviously people are still deciding on what this is exactly.

My answer: **STAGFLATION** 

Why stagflation? There are several similarities to 1973 starting with a shortage in energy supply (oil and gas) continuing with inflation (hell yeah, Inflation is here after a looong time) and let’s not forget the falling GDP (GDP is in a straight decline, recession is here) and the rise in interest rates. All this is textbook stagflation. One more similarity is an ongoing war…

For those who are not familiar with stagflation, check out Investopedia: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagflation.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagflation.asp)

The most renowned stagflation period started 1973 when a shortage in oil supply led to spiking inflation. 1973 the inflation went up to almost 7.5 % and then slowly went back to 2,5% in 1978. So, 5 years before it came back down. It then spiked again and came back down to “normal” levels 1985, so 12 years after it all began. Here is the chart for Germany back then. 

Today Germany is hitting inflation numbers unseen since WWII. If we stay course the 1922/23 hyperinflation is the only period which had higher inflation than right now.

Now let’s look at the MSCI World: from it’s high in 1972 / 1973 it came down almost 60% in two years, finally bottoming in 1975. Today, 1973 would be 2022 and is behaving pretty similar. 1974 would be 2023 and 1975 would be 2024.

📷

Why I think this is a good comparison? Well now we are talking about earnings this year, while the vast majorities of businesses haven’t even been really hit by demand slowdown. You can read it in all of their earnings presentations: “The company's margins have suffered as a consequence of increases in the cost of logistics and energy, BUT revenues are up”. Now the companies have raised their prices to get their margins back up. What do you think happens next? Demand starts slowing down and then shit hits the fan. In my opinion, the real damage to the businesses, the real demand drawdown is yet to come. 

People are losing their jobs now, but this is just the beginning. A lot of people have to renew their mortgages and that’s when its really going to hurt. And soon companies will start struggling with paying the high interest rates on their short-term debt and paying the higher wages people will want and that will not be possible for many companies. The bankruptcies and the renewing of the mortgages are what really gets the ball rollin’ and that hasn’t even begun yet. 

Also, some bond people like Steven van Metre are talking about dollar shortages and a few other problems in the banking system (also see Credit Suisse). I do not understand much of that, but what I do know is that bond people are smart and you should listen to them. If they say there are some more problems with the defaults on car loans or whatever, then there is something going on there.

Okay, so back to stagflation in todays environment: if you look at the MSCI World graph in 1973 and you assume the macroeconomic forces will play out similar in todays environment, then we will likely to have the bottom sometime mid 2023 – beginning of 2024. The stock market will then start rising again in 2024. Inevitably it will start rising sooner or later, I think we can agree on that. I know, I know, we live in different times, we have different companies today, etc. but lets just assume it plays out similar to 1973-74. 

Now the questions are: What to do until it bottoms? What to invest in? Where to park the money? 

3 years of 7,5% to 5% inflation means almost 20% less value in cash. That doesn’t sound that good, so maybe invest in some good companies? But what companies do good in such an environment.

For that I asked myself, what would I do, if I were to lose my job during this stagflation? (and let’s assume I have no emergency fund). I came up with this and tried to relate that to companies with products for which there will be demand:

1) Sell stuff that I don’t need in order to get cash, including my portfolio / my car

Second hand dealers might do well during stagflation

Cardealers might do well (at least at some point)

Brokers should make a lot of money in 2022-2023 during the sell-offs

2) Cut all expenses for stuff not needed

No more Amazon Prime? No more overrated insurances? 

3) Try to lend money somewhere else

Lending companies might do well

4) Search for a new job / search for a new home (move somewhere cheaper)

Job Portals might do well; real estate agents won’t profit because it was way more lucrative to sell new built home then to do rentals 

5) A lot of free time means: Watch Tv 

Broadcasting and Streamers might do well during stagflation 

6) What else? Well, I would still have to eat and drink. And this is maybe my key point around the stagflation period: I would still have to buy groceries and essentials (like toilet paper, hygiene products, cleaning products, coffee, etc.) as well as communication services, energy and transportation…These are items people can't do without. 

Would I buy more of these products? Most probably not. So, on the one hand these companies will most likely do better than the rest of the companies because demand will stay up, but on the other hand their valuation can still go down from their sky-high PEs. And still because of inflation and pricing power they would profit from higher revenues and maybe better margins. 

Some extra thoughts on point 6)

\- Are there any plays with higher revenues but not necessarily higher costs? Are there any products out there which do not depend on energy or higher wages?

\- Of course, the company has to produce free cash flow. (CASH is king, also check some recent Burry tweets [https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/xwe97z/\_/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/xwe97z/_/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/xwewlw/\_/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/xwewlw/_/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3))

\- If a company has debt, especially termed out debt with a fixed yield, I consider this to be a good thing because they have already their yield secured and because they can buy back the bonds at a discount

\- Does anyone know where I can get data on which stocks performed well during 1973-1980?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR in a stagflation period buy companies which offer essential products and services which we need on the day to day basis, with pricing power, good free cash flow, termed out debt and are as least as possible depending on energy prices.

&amp;#x200B;

So, all of this being said, I have one final questions for you: What is YOUR stagflation bear market buy?

One possible answer, but not my favourite one, could be: Put the money in I-Bonds ([https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds))

Put $10K ($20K for married couples). Automatic 9.62% return for the next 6 months, followed by a 6.5% return for the following 6 months, amounting to around 8% return for the first year. You have to hold it there for a year. Minus 3 months interest if you withdraw before 5 years.

I’m trying to think of a way to help me manage my debt better. 

Back in 2019 I got approved by my bank for debt consolidation and gave me a fixed rate of 12.75% via personal loan. I’m almost close to paying it off with $3000 dollars left which I pay off 295 monthly. 

This year (2022) I got pre-approved for a Personal Line of Credit for $5,000 and I’m looking 11.45% interest.

Now, what I’m thinking, does it make sense to just take out funds from my PLC and pay off my personal loan? 

I know the difference of interest rate is obvious, but is this a good strategy?

If you need more info to analyze my situation please feel free to ask. 

My goal is to be completely debt free by 2023 and I’m trying to see what I can do better",finance,1665972300
Avax,Deploy a Gnosis Safe on Your Subnet-EVM,"# Deploy a Gnosis Safe on Your Subnet-EVM

## Introduction[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#introduction)

This article shows how to deploy and interact with a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) programmatically on any [Subnet-EVM](https://docs.avax.network/subnets).

If you are looking for more information regarding the Gnosis Safe protocol, please check out [these developer docs](https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/).

## Prerequisites[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#prerequisites)

This tutorial assumes that:

* A Subnet and EVM blockchain has been created. Avalanche tools allow users to do this on [Mainnet](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/subnet-cli), [Fuji](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/create-a-fuji-subnet) or a [Local network](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/create-a-local-subnet).
* Your node is currently validating your target Subnet.
* Your wallet has a balance of the Subnet native token (specified under *alloc* in your [Genesis File](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/customize-a-subnet#genesis)).

The entirety of this tutorial will require you to work with 3 projects (4 if running locally)

* [safe-contracts](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts.git)
* [safe-tasks](https://github.com/5afe/safe-tasks.git)
* [avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart)
* [avalanche-network-runner](https://docs.avax.network/quickstart/create-a-local-test-network#avalanche-network-runner) (Local Workflow)

## Custom Network Workflow[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#custom-network-workflow)

### Setup[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#setup)

Set up the safe-contracts repository by running the following Commands:

    git https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts.git
cd safe-contracts
yarn


Next, change .env.example  
 to .env  
 and set the variable,PK  
 to your wallet's *private key*. Here, we can also add our node's RPC endpoint as our NODE\_URL  
.

Example:

    PK=""&lt;YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY-HERE&gt;""
PK2=""""
INFURA_KEY=""""
# Used for custom network
NODE_URL=""&lt;YOUR-SUBNET-NODE-RPC-URL-HERE&gt;""


Next, add your Subnet Network parameters to [hardhat.config.ts](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts):

    networks: {
  subnet: {
    url: `${NODE_URL}`,
    chainId: 99999,
    gasPrice: ""auto"",
    accounts: [`${PK}`, ],
 },
}


NOTE

chainId  
 is set to 99999 for demonstration purposes only. Please be sure to use the correct chainId  
 when following this workflow.

### Deploy the Safe Contracts[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#deploy-the-safe-contracts)

At this point we have set up the Subnet and can make calls to the RPC endpoint. You can use the RPC URL value to define NODE\_URL  
 in your .env  
 file. We can execute the workflow on a local or remote node as long as we have the [proper IP address](https://docs.avax.network/apis/avalanchego/apis/issuing-api-calls#endpoints).

Finally, deploy the contracts by running:

    yarn hardhat --network subnet deploy


This will deploy the Safe contracts to your Subnet-EVM!

✨  Done in 26.90s.


NOTE

Please record your GnosisSafeL2 and GnosisSafeProxyFactory addresses to complete this tutorial

The deployment of the contracts is using a [proxy factory](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/blob/v1.3.0/contracts/proxies/GnosisSafeProxyFactory.sol), therefore the address is depending on the bytecode. If the address is the same then the deployment bytecode of the contract is also the same (assuming that the target chain follows the EVM specifications set in the Ethereum Yellowpaper).

## Interacting with the Safe[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#interacting-with-the-safe)

The [safe-deployments](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments) repository contains the ABI files for the different versions of the Safe that can be used with all common Ethereum tools to interact with the Safe.

The important part is how to create the signature to confirm a transaction. More information on this can be found in the [Safe docs](https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/contracts/signatures).

To make this easier the Safe team provides multiple CLIs ([safe-cli](https://github.com/5afe/safe-cli#safe-cli) and [safe-tasks](https://github.com/5afe/safe-tasks#gnosis-safe-tasks)) and the [safe-core-sdk](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/safe-core-sdk#safe-core-sdk).

### Using Safe Tasks[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#using-safe-tasks)

Let's take a look on how to create a Safe and propose transactions on a Subnet using Safe Tasks, a Hardhat task collection for the Safe contracts.

First, in a new directory, clone and navigate to the [safe-tasks repository](https://github.com/5afe/safe-tasks) by running the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/5afe/safe-tasks.git
cd safe-tasks
yarn


Implement the environment and network setup [above](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#setup) to prepare the Safe-Tasks project.

### Create a Safe[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#create-a-safe)

Now let's create a Safe using the previously deployed GnosisSafeL2  
 and GnosisSafeProxyFactory  
 addresses:

    yarn safe create --network subnet --singleton ""&lt;YOUR-GnosisSafeL2-ADDRESS-HERE&gt;"" --factory ""&lt;YOUR-GnosisSafeProxyFactory-ADDRESS-HERE&gt;""


Output:

Notice the line, ""*Deploy Safe to 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114*"", informs us that our safe contract lives at the address 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114  
. For demonstration purposes, we will utilize this address for this section of the article.

Let's inspect our Safe details by running the following:

    yarn safe info --network subnet 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114


Output:

    Checking Safe at 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114

The output above illustrates a few things:

* Singleton  
 \- This is the contract that holds the logic for our Safe to interact with. In this case, the Smart Contract we are using is [GnosisSafeL2.sol](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/blob/main/contracts/GnosisSafeL2.sol), A multisignature wallet with support for confirmations using signed messages based on [ERC191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191).
* Owners  
 \- The addresses that are allowed to sign and submit proposals. These can be can either be EOAs or other smart contract accounts.
* Threshold  
 \- The amount of signatures required to submit a proposal.

### Add an Owner[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#add-an-owner)

To add an owner we must first generate the data required to submit a proposal.

Navigate to the [add\_owner.json](https://github.com/5afe/safe-tasks/blob/master/examples/add_owner.json) file in the examples directory and an address that you control to params  
.

    [
 {
 ""to"": ""0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114"",
 ""value"": ""0"",
 ""method"": ""addOwnerWithThreshold(address,uint256)"",
 ""params"": [""0x82DdaF3f1fcd3c18F5664cD7fb12bD8C38D5d4ba"", ""2""],
 ""operation"": 0
 }
]


Next, we will call the propose-multi  
 task to create a transaction based on the sample tx input json that adds an owner to the Safe.

    yarn safe propose-multi --network subnet 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114 examples/add_owner.json --export example/addOwner.json


This will create a new file, addOwner.json  
, in the examples directory.

Notice the data  
 value has the parameters encoded as a single hexadecimal string.

* addOwnerWithThreshold  
 has the function signature 0d582f13
* address  
 appears in the data as 82ddaf3f1fcd3c18f5664cd7fb12bd8c38d5d4ba
* threshold  
 appears at the end of the data as 2

Now we can use the --data  
 flag and pass in the data  
 above as an argument for our proposal.

    yarn safe propose --network subnet 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114 --to 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114 --data 0x0d582f1300000000000000000000000082ddaf3f1fcd3c18f5664cd7fb12bd8c38d5d4ba0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002

As you can see, creating a proposal generates a Safe transaction hash  
 which we will use to complete this tutorial.

Next, we will sign and submit our proposal's tx hash, 0x2837eb329c41078c97e2450eabf0b73caae94d08db06a5d9fe2084d33ef3f4cc  
, with the tasks, sign-proposal  
 and submit-proposal  
.

#### Sign[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#sign)

    yarn safe sign-proposal 0x2837eb329c41078c97e2450eabf0b73caae94d08db06a5d9fe2084d33ef3f4cc

Now that we've successfully submitted a proposal, let's check the owners of our Safe by using the info  
 task:

    yarn safe info --network subnet 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114


Output:

It is worth noting that you can also check the owners of the Safe by using [Hardhat with your Custom EVM](https://docs.avax.network/dapps/smart-contracts/using-hardhat-with-the-avalanche-c-chain#interact-with-smart-contract).

As shown above, Owners  
 now includes a new address and threshold  
, the amount of signatures needed to execute a transaction, has increased to 2.

### Send Native Currency from Your Safe[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#send-native-currency-from-your-safe)

Let's apply the very same steps above to a workflow where we send the Native Currency of your Subnet to an EOA. This part of the tutorial requires that your Safe holds at least 1000 native tokens. You can send assets to your Safe the same way you would send Avax using [Metamask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488931-How-to-send-tokens-from-your-MetaMask-wallet). To add your Subnet to MetaMask, [please read this excerpt](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/create-a-fuji-subnet#connect-with-metamask).

Just as before, we will sign and submit the transaction hash. This example uses two signers due to an increased threshold  
 from our previous Safe transaction.

To include our second signer, we will have to import another *private key* into the project by adding it to .env  
 and hardhat.config.ts  
 in our safe-tasks  
 project.

Example .env  
:

    PK=""56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027""
PK2=""cd30aef1af167238c627593537e162ecf5aad1d4ab4ea98ed2f96ad4e47006dc""
INFURA_KEY=""""
# Used for custom network
NODE_URL=""http://127.0.0.1:49435/ext/bc/2Ek1MWR7jiEJr3o9tuJAH79JkuERzKqQDcR2s6R2e5Dyz54Wit/rpc""


Example hardhat.config.ts

    // Load environment variables.
dotenv.config();
const {
 NETWORK,
 NODE_URL,
 INFURA_KEY,
 MNEMONIC,
 PK,
 PK2,
 SOLIDITY_VERSION,
 SOLIDITY_SETTINGS,
} = process.env;

...
networks: {
  subnet: {
        url: `${NODE_URL}`,
        chainId: 99999,
        gasPrice: ""auto"",
        accounts: [`${PK}`, `${PK2}` ],
 },
 },


In this example, we're sending 1000 *LEVM* (which is the native token on the Subnet we are working with) from our Safe to the address 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC  
.

Let's ensure that our Safe has enough funds by using a simple curl request.

    curl -X POST localhost:49435/ext/bc/2Ek1MWR7jiEJr3o9tuJAH79JkuERzKqQDcR2s6R2e5Dyz54Wit/rpc -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" --data '
{
  ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
  ""method"": ""eth_getBalance"",
  ""params"": [""0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114"", ""latest""],
  ""id"": 1
}
'


Output:

    {""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":1,""result"":""0x3e8""}


Now that we've verified that our Safe has enough native tokens(1000), let's create a proposal to send some to an EOA.

    yarn safe propose  --network subnet 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114 --value 1000 --to 0x2d1d87fF3Ea2ba6E0576bCA4310fC057972F2559


Notice that we've added the value  
 flag and passed in our target amount. We've also changed our to  
 flag to be our our target address. You can find the other flags and parameters for this task [here](https://github.com/5afe/safe-tasks/blob/52067e3ac5b8a1db3a4ab54fec0ee628c0bd4f3a/src/execution/proposing.ts).

Output:

    Running on subnet
Using Safe at 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114
Safe transaction hash: 0x5134dc35909ff592c55a64c1a5947dd4844b1bca2a45df68ed9c3019133bf44d


#### Sign with Two Owners[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#sign-with-two-owners)

Follow the same workflow from before to sign a proposal.

    yarn safe sign-proposal 0x5134dc35909ff592c55a64c1a5947dd4844b1bca2a45df68ed9c3019133bf44d


Output:

    Using Safe at 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114 with 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
Signature: 0x636ba2a89023b1e81032a43dd1172743f7916e31647eb87ec95c541c091ebf1873605d39d8039431a7dceeeab691e48b96b50f93e91acde5e67295e9f051e7031f


By default, Hardhat uses *account 0* to sign transactions. Since we've imported another private key and added it to our *accounts* parameter in hardhat.config.ts  
 we can now specify which account we want to sign with by adding the flag --signer-index  
 to our sign-proposal  
 task

    yarn safe sign-proposal 0x5134dc35909ff592c55a64c1a5947dd4844b1bca2a45df68ed9c3019133bf44d --signer-index 1


Output:

Signature: 0x11d7e983417280bdf1c55da51359eb06262f0feadad1c6ebdf497a6e6db92c5e506536c1c2b6bd3ef726d163c710d5adcbe787a2440be5ad79cac52e950407b21f


#### Submit[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#submit-1)

Now that both owners have signed the proposal, the threshold  
 requirement has been met and we can now submit the proposal.

    yarn safe submit-proposal 0x5134dc35909ff592c55a64c1a5947dd4844b1bca2a45df68ed9c3019133bf44d


Output:

    Using Safe at 0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114 with 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
Ethereum transaction hash: 0x074d823b8d111af9e87d0e4374e3a5382a4de9952df4f49db5ee4b52f945760b


Now let's check the balances of the Safe and EOA addresses using curl.

**Safe balance(0)**

    curl -X POST localhost:49435/ext/bc/2Ek1MWR7jiEJr3o9tuJAH79JkuERzKqQDcR2s6R2e5Dyz54Wit/rpc -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" --data '
{
  ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
  ""method"": ""eth_getBalance"",
  ""params"": [""0x1DE5B48F80eC78Bf74644EFdCbB5750Cb7B25114"", ""latest""],
  ""id"": 1
}


Output:

    {""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":1,""result"":""0x0""}


**EOA Balance(1,000)**

    curl -X POST ""http://127.0.0.1:17773/ext/bc/8ttPWTKt2FEs256fJkV2Yj5nJS1JPSfhN2ghAr8aboZWF2gXF/rpc"" -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" --data '
{
  ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
  ""method"": ""eth_getBalance"",
  ""params"": [""0x2d1d87fF3Ea2ba6E0576bCA4310fC057972F2559"", ""latest""],
  ""id"": 1
}


Output

    {""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":1,""result"":""0x3635c9adc5dea00000""}


TIP

We can reformat BigNumber  
 values to human readable values by using hardhat console.

Example:

    npx hardhat console --network subnet
ethers.utils.formatUnits(await ethers.BigNumber.from('0x3635c9adc5dea00000'))


Output

    '1000.0'


And there you have it! We've transferred 1000 *LEVM* from our Safe to address, 0x2d1d87fF3Ea2ba6E0576bCA4310fC057972F2559  
.

### Other Functions[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#other-functions)

As long as you have the ABI for a contract, you can apply the workflow outlined above to call other functions.

For instance, if we wanted to approve a spend, we would create a transaction json file with the necessary data such as the example below.

[tx\_input.sample.json:](https://github.com/5afe/safe-tasks/blob/master/tx_input.sample.json)

    [
 {
 ""to"": ""0xc778417E063141139Fce010982780140Aa0cD5Ab"",
 ""value"": ""0.1"",
 ""operation"": 0
 },
 {
 ""to"": ""0xc778417E063141139Fce010982780140Aa0cD5Ab"",
 ""value"": ""0"",
 ""method"": ""approve(address,uint256)"",
 ""params"": [""0xd0Dab4E640D95E9E8A47545598c33e31bDb53C7c"", ""1000000000000""],
 ""operation"": 0
 }
]


Then we would use the same tasks from before:

1. Generate the txn data with yarn safe propose-multi

&amp;#8203;

    yarn safe propose-multi --network subnet &lt;SAFE-ADDRESS&gt; &lt;TX-FILE&gt; --export &lt;TX-DATA-FILE-NAME&gt;


1. Create a proposal with yarn safe propose

&amp;#8203;

    yarn safe propose --network subnet &lt;SAFE-ADDRESS&gt; --data &lt;TX-DATA&gt; --to &lt;TARGET-ADDRESS&gt;


1. Sign the proposal with yarn safe sign-proposal

&amp;#8203;

    yarn safe sign-proposal &lt;SAFE-TX-HASH&gt;


1. Submit the proposal with yarn safe submit-proposal

&amp;#8203;

    yarn submit &lt;SAFE-TX-HASH&gt;


## Managing a Proxy Using Gnosis Safe[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#managing-a-proxy-using-gnosis-safe)

CAUTION

This part of the tutorial is better suited for advanced users as the operations from each project work together asynchronously which may lead to errors if the user misses a step.

Please pay careful attention to which project and which step of the workflow you are in when following this part of the tutorial.

This part of the article aims to illustrate the use of a Multi-Signature Safe Protocol to manage an [Upgradeable Proxy Smart Contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy). For this tutorial we will use a [Transparent Upgradeable Proxy](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/). To learn more about proxy upgrade patterns, please review the Open Zeppelin docs [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/proxies) and see the diagram below.

📷

Some use cases may apply such as:

* Upgrading a Vault  
 \- Point the proxy implementation to a new treasury smart contract.
* Upgrading a Registry  
 \- Migrate a database of user addresses and privileges to a new smart contract. This may include Owners, Stakers, Validators, Token holders, Whitelists.

### Setup[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#setup-1)

For this part of the tutorial, we will need to clone the [Avalanche Smart Contract Quickstart repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/tree/proxy-contract-implementation) and switch to the proxy-contract-implementation  
 branch the by running the following Commands:

    git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart
cd avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart
git switch proxy-contract-implementation
yarn


Next, implement the environment and network setup [above](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#setup) to prepare the Proxy Smart Contract project.

### Deploy the Proxy[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#deploy-the-proxy)

Let's deploy the proxy contracts by running the following command:

    npx hardhat run --network subnet scripts/deployStorage.ts


Output:

    Deploying Storage...
Storage deployed to: 0x5dda6Fa725248D95d2086F4fcEb6bA6bdfEbc45b
{ number: '42' }


This command actually executed 3 operations:

* Deployed a Proxy Admin contract and assigned the deployer's address as the owner
* Deployed the Storage  
 contract and set the number  
 to 42
* Deployed a Transparent upgradeable proxy and added the Storage  
 contract's address as its implementation

Notice the line *Storage deployed to:* in our deployment output includes the address 0x5dda6Fa725248D95d2086F4fcEb6bA6bdfEbc45b

This is our proxy address which you can also find in .openzeppelin  
, a session file that includes all of the project's proxy contract information.

Example:

    {
 ""manifestVersion"": ""3.2"",
 ""admin"": {
 ""address"": ""0xd8215b138ef5eA0ecFc49fBaD1a30A18a109A06c"",
 ""txHash"": ""0xf0457a8ca950fe526cc9d60fb578761538d037ea2f939758c6810a3b1e6b95d4""
 },
 ""proxies"": [
 {
 ""address"": ""0x5dda6Fa725248D95d2086F4fcEb6bA6bdfEbc45b"",
 ""txHash"": ""0x10480134bfe1709277e4e03aeed2825355c87f6a35633c6ed06a114fc9ce06a6"",
 ""kind"": ""transparent""
 }
 ],
 ""impls"": {
 ""cba9f8cf52e3c449631a04ea218a6cedcaf7c366669cfc257c89a008266c768f"": {

 ""txHash"": ""0x6494655b779015d7cac8f32b7fa1d6437616de71e71312cbf17cf9cc1054ea35"",
 ""layout"": {
 ""storage"": [
 {
 ""label"": ""number"",

 }
 ],
 ""types"": {
 ""t_uint256"": {
 ""label"": ""uint256"",
 ""numberOfBytes"": ""32""
 }
 }
 }
 }
 }
}


### Transfer the Proxy Admin Role to a Safe[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#transfer-the-proxy-admin-role-to-a-safe)

Next, let's transfer proxy admin privileges to our Gnosis Safe by adding it's address to our [transferProxyOwnership.ts](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/proxy-contract-implementation/scripts/transferProxyOwnership.ts) script.

    // transferProxyOwnership.ts
const gnosisSafe = ""&lt;YOUR-SAFE-ADDRESS-HERE&gt;""


Next run the script to execute the transfer.

    npx hardhat run --network subnet scripts/transferProxyOwnership.ts


Output:

    Transferring ownership of ProxyAdmin...
✔ 0x1189D8E94cAD398612cc4638f80B18d421e74a31 (transparent) proxy ownership transfered through admin proxy
Transferred ownership of ProxyAdmin to: 0xCA2922E98339C359D818b8f7ad3c897C0e18a7ff


Now that we have transferred ownership to our Gnosis Safe, we can upgrade the proxy implementation.

### Upgrade the Contract[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#upgrade-the-contract)

#### Deploy a New Logic Contract[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#deploy-a-new-logic-contract)

For this step we will deploy a new implementation for the proxy contract to interact with.

Run the following command to deploy [StorageV2](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/076f191ca74cd1d15304f7fb945aa53e860ab506/contracts/StorageV2.sol), an upgraded version of our [Storage](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/076f191ca74cd1d15304f7fb945aa53e860ab506/contracts/Storage.sol) contract:

    npx hardhat run --network subnet scripts/deployStorageV2.ts


Output:

    Deploying Storage2...
StorageV2 deployed to: 0x32CaF0D54B0578a96A1aDc7269F19e7398358174


0x32CaF0D54B0578a96A1aDc7269F19e7398358174  
 will be our new implementation  
 address, the logic contract consumed by the proxy contract.

#### Use Hardhat to Interact with the Proxy[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#use-hardhat-to-interact-with-the-proxy)

Now is a good time for us to use Hardhat to interact with the proxy to ensure that we are on the right track.

First setup Hardhat console to run on your subnet.

    npx hardhat console --network subnet


Then connect to the contracts with the following steps:

Connect hardhat to an instance of the Storage  
 contract at the deployed address.

    &gt; const storage = await ethers.getContractAt('Storage','&lt;YOUR-PROXY-ADDRESS-HERE&gt;')


You can reference your proxy address from the Storage  
 contract deployment or .openzeppelin  
.

Retrieve the stored number set during deployment.

    &gt;(await storage.retrieve()).toString()
'42'


#### Create the Upgrade Tx[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#create-the-upgrade-tx)

Next we will use the propose-multi  
 task to create an upgrade tx.

Create a new file, upgrade.json  
, in the examples  
 directory of your safe-task  
 project.

    // examples/upgrade.json
[
 {
 ""to"": ""&lt;YOUR-PROXY-ADMIN-ADDRESS-HERE&gt;"",
 ""value"": ""0"",
 ""method"": ""upgrade(address,address)"",
 ""params"": [
 ""&lt;YOUR-PROXY-ADDRESS-HERE&gt;"",
 ""&lt;YOUR-IMPLEMENTATION-ADDRESS-HERE&gt;""
 ],
 ""operation"": 0
 }
]


Ensure that the following parameters are set correctly:

* to  
 \- Should be set to the proxy admin address found in avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/.openzeppelin/""&lt;YOUR-NETWORK-SESSION&gt;"".json  
.
* method  
 \- Ensure that you have the function name and argument types correct.
* params  
 \- An upgrade  
 call needs both a proxy address  
 and implementation address

Our transaction hash let's us know that the EVM has mined the transaction!

#### Use Hardhat to Interact With the Upgraded Proxy[​](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#use-hardhat-to-interact-with-the-upgraded-proxy)

Now we will use hardhat to ensure that our proxy was successfully upgraded.

First, navigate back to hardhat console in your avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart-project  
 and instantiate StorageV2  
 at our proxy address.

    &gt; const storageV2 = await ethers.getContractAt('StorageV2','YOUR-PROXY-ADDRESS-HERE')


Notice that we are now using StorageV2  
 at our original proxy address. Since, we've upgraded our implementation, our we can call the original address but interact with the new contract.

Let's check the stored value to ensure that we have retained the data from the previous implementation..

    &gt; (await storageV2.retrieve()).toString()
'42'


Great! We've successfully retrieved the previously stored value from the contract!

Now let's call our upgraded contract's new function [increment](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/964129dfb7cb9271b396927e9ea8b009e321cda1/contracts/StorageV2.sol#L24-L27) which adds 1 to the stored value:

    &gt; await storageV2.increment()
{
  hash: '0x2ed9dff3f909a50f191d41ff59ab423907fbc23b4cf7b3721907d933a710b848',

  v: 200034,
  creates: null,
  chainId: 99999,
  wait: [Function (anonymous)]
}


The transaction data shows us that the operation was successful!

Now, let's check the stored number.

    &gt; (await storageV2.retrieve()).toString()
'43'


And there you have it. We have successfully done the following:

* Deployed a [Transparent Upgradeable Proxy](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/).
* [Transferred proxy admin ownership](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable-transferOwnership-address-) to a Gnosis Safe.

personalfinance,Issues with my credit score,"Hi, I’m so confused why my credit score just dropped 38 points. I was sitting at 747 and now I’m at 709

For some background, I have 3 open accounts. 2 credit cards and 1 auto loan.
On credit card 1 I owe $324
On credit card 2 I owe $4411
On auto loan I owe $10645
I pay off $200 bi monthly on my credit cards for a total of $400 monthly and $157 bi monthly for $314 monthly total on my auto loan.

I have 0 late payments, a 12% credit usage, and credit age of 4 years 1 month

I’ve done this method of payment for almost a year now and have been slowly raising my credit score

I bank through navy fed and they offer a credit score dashboard where you can check your score and stimulate it. I just checked and saw the drop after no changes in payment or late payments. 

I had used the stimulator app awhile back and it had said it would drop if I paid off $400, that being my normal payment I didn’t believe it. Now I use the stimulator app and if I pay off $200 it raises it 3 points, but if I take on $200 it raises 41 points? 

This has me so frustrated. I’ve already long believed that credit scores are a scam to keep the poor in poverty. What am I suppose to do? Put 200 down and just pay it off immediately? Why did it drop so drastically in the first place?",finance,1665974732
personalfinance,"Getting ready to sell house in one town, and buy in a different town. Is this an awful time for it?","We're getting ready to relocate to a different city, probably sometime next year. We've owned our current house since a little before COVID, so we now have around $60k worth of equity in it, and a sweet 2.35% interest rate.

The town we're moving to has a noticeably higher housing cost; current median home price for a single family home is $372k in the new town versus $319k in the old town. So between the higher home cost in the new town, the price explosion of the past 3 years, and the current absurdly high interest rates, it would stretch us pretty thin to buy a house in the new town, but we just barely can if we sell our house in the old town first.

My biggest concern, however, is the timing of this purchase as it relates to the economic cycle. It seems like we're at or near the peak of home prices, and I really don't want to just barely be able to buy an overpriced house right before the housing market starts to crash. My worst case scenario is buying a house for $320k (probably our top number we could afford), only for it to be a $250k house in a couple years. 

Would it be a better financial decision to sell our current house while the market is still high, pocket the $60k~ cash in equity, and then just sit on it and rent a house in the new town for a couple years? Then hopefully buy a house in the new town for substantially less in the future than we would right now? Or is that making far too many predictions and assumptions? 

I'm pretty stressed out about this, so I'm hoping you guys can offer some sound advice here. Thanks in advance!",finance,1665977447
personalfinance,How much should employer be withholding for taxes?,"We’ve recently realized that my husbands employer is not withholding enough from his paychecks to cover federal income taxes. 

We fall within the 22% income tax bracket, and taking into consideration the step-system the effective tax rate is around 15-16% of gross income. 

His employer is only withholding 6-7% of his paychecks on average. Is this normal?

When we first realized, I assumed we had marked something incorrectly on his W-4, but when we reviewed it we confirmed that we claimed “0” across the board. My understanding was that they should be taking the max amount from his paychecks to withhold for taxes. 

When we contacted his HR dept, they said that everything looked right and that’s how much they were supposed to withhold, and said we need to specify additional withholdings if we want them to take more.

I’m so confused and frustrated. I know this is our fault and we should have caught it sooner, but I’ve never had this problem before with previous employers. I’m estimating that we’ll owe an additional $10k in taxes at the end of the year which we were not planning on and I’m kinda freaking out.",finance,1665978594

The issue is that it’s a very toxic environment for me and my mental health is deteriorating from living at home. This has been an ongoing issue that I have brushed off far too long but I need to take action to give myself a better life.

I make $65k a year in a relatively high CoL area in California. Average rent in my area is about $1700/month. (Very hard to find anything vacant for under $1500) 

After taxes, health insurance etc my monthly income is about $3600

My expenses are:

Student loans: $1100 (recently refinanced; previously my total monthly payment was $1400 on them) About $300 worth are federal so I don’t have to pay them now and a portion may get forgiven. The other $800 I have to pay currently. 

Car loan: $250

Car insurance: $100

Gas: $80 (only have to fill up once per month due to WFH)

Food/essentials: $300

Miscellaneous expenses: $150

As I see it this basically leaves me with very little room for error when it comes to finding a place to live. Examining data from my bank account; this past year I have been averaging $1857 in monthly expenses. 

What should I realistically target as money “left over” on a monthly basis to be financially stable? Based on my expenses and spending habits I have $1600-$2000 left each month….of course I can’t just put that all towards rent though. The good thing is that I have saved a very solid amount of money thanks to being able to work from home and not pay rent….I just wouldn’t want to have to regularly dip into that money to pay my monthly expenses.

I asked for a raise at work recently and my boss agreed that I deserved one based on performance so I’m hoping I’ll get a few thousand added to my annual salary which would certainly help.

investing,Inflation will remain elevated for a few more years,"**TLDR**: Companies will keep investing in redundant, diversified supply chains. Countries will force more localization due to national security risks. Energy prices will remain high. China will stick to its zero-covid policy. Rising rates will reduce demand and make credit more expensive. Reduced demand will hurt the economies of scale. Expensive credit will make ongoing investments more expensive to complete. Prices will keep going up for a few years, until these factors are mitigated. The market bottom will be when the companies cancel stock buybacks and start printing shares.

# Long read

The prevailing narrative today is that central banks will keep raising interest rates and sucking money out of the economy by other means, which will tame inflation sometime soon in 2023 due to reduced demand and economic slowdown. This is what the financial markets are pricing in, judging by bets on rates and bonds.

However, the global inflation we are experiencing today is not driven purely by monetary policies. That’s why inflation is global, spanning the whole world, even though different countries have vastly different monetary policies.

There are pockets of inflation, which are global, and were caused by relentless money printers, like real estate, travel, luxury goods, crypto, and various other assets. This is where the largest price reductions will continue. If you have any type of asset, it’s safe to say it will depreciate even more. Declines in housing and rent will drive down inflation metrics across the world, helping the central banks get closer to their inflation targets.

But the central banks cannot meet their 2% goals, because they cannot mitigate other factors causing global inflation. These are supply chain issues, caused first by COVID-19, then strict China zero-covid policies, then Russian invasion of Ukraine. We have an energy and food crises on top of that, also caused by the war in Ukraine. There’s nothing central banks can do about restructuring of supply chains, food scarcity, and energy shortage. They won’t be able to meet their inflation targets anytime soon and will have to keep higher rates in place for a few years.

# Just-in-time vs Redundancy

Up until COVID-19, just-in-time production was *the way* of manufacturing. Whoever was more efficient at doing this was winning the profits race. The approach first pioneered by Toyota eventually was applied across the global economy. Until the priorities changed.

First, the pandemic exacerbated problems of this model. Companies suddenly became unable to get the parts needed anymore and were dependent on various government policies regulating lockdowns. Production of everything, from bicycles to cars, was disrupted, often delayed by a single missing part. For example, Ford currently delays production of its most lucrative F-150 trucks, because its single supplier of company badges and logos is in trouble.

[Ford’s Latest Supply-Chain Problem: a Shortage of Blue Oval Badges](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fords-latest-supply-chain-snarl-not-enough-blue-oval-badges-11663944141)

Second, there was a strong belief that global trade and mutual benefits would prevent countries from starting large scale conflicts, because it would devastate the quality of life of everyone involved and beyond. This belief was shattered after Russia started a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the governments across the world are scared, and want to mitigate their national security risks. This includes everything, from food, to energy, to semiconductors, to commodities, etc.

Combined, this led to manufacturing being restructured from just-in-time into a redundancy model. Companies want to secure their own exclusive supply chains and have back-up options. Countries want to have localized manufacturing of various goods to mitigate national security risks.

The pandemic and the war are not the only factors they fear. Whether it’s an earthquake in Taiwan or a blockade from China, it’s the same risk to have all your chips manufactured there. The risks were always present but became much more prominent in a short period of time.

Coming back to Ford, and car manufacturers in general. They will have to source materials and produce the batteries locally to qualify for EV subsidies. This is a massive undertaking, which requires to build new mines, factories and duplicate numerous other elements of EV supply chain.

Restructuring of supply chains is a very expensive process on its own. This will keep driving prices higher over the next few years, until we see the first benefits coming to fruition. The prices won’t go down after that either because redundancy is more expensive. Combined with higher cost for local wages, more expensive locally sourced materials, higher environmental standards, etc., this will stick prices to a higher level. We are years away from reaching those levels.

First, they need to invest a lot in local manufacturing in the US. They do not have an option of not doing this. And we are talking about $150 billion over the next decade.

[Micron Announces Over $150 Billion in Global Manufacturing and R&amp;D Investments](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-over-150-billion-global-manufacturing-and-rd)

The company also must diversify its supply chains. For example, Ukraine used to supply 70% of neon gases used in semiconductors manufacturing. Micron is adding redundancies to avoid bottlenecks like this one in the future.

[Micron has diversified sourcing for its noble gases](https://evertiq.com/design/51415)

It will take years for Micron to see the first benefits of these investments. And many more years for these investments to pay off. At the same time, the PC market is going through the worst slowdown in 20 years, while their current supply chains are still damaged by the war and zero-covid policies in China.

[PC Shipments Plunge Nearly 20%, Steepest Drop in More Than 20 Years](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pc-shipments-plunge-nearly-20-steepest-drop-in-more-than-20-years-11665442764)

How would Micron pay for these investments? Micron does not have $150 billion to invest and will have to find a way to finance this endeavor. It cannot avoid or postpone the investments and would have to drive them to completion no matter the cost.

This is a weird situation, where the central banks are trying their best to reduce inflation, but making mandatory investments like these more expensive, which will drive prices higher, and keep inflation elevated. A conundrum, which is mostly ignored today.

Micron, as well as other global companies, would go through a path, which would force them to raise prices for their products, but still end up indebted, strapped for cash, going through periods of unprofitability, and having their stocks at depressed valuations.

# Buy High, Sell Low

Unfortunately, companies typically purchase a record amount of their stock at peak valuations when they have record profits. Last year the top companies spent their entire yearly profits on stock buybacks (Microsoft, Meta, Google, Nvidia, etc.). They bought the all-time high number of shares at the all-time high prices.

For example, last year Meta spent **$44.8 billion** on buybacks, which is roughly its yearly profit. And Meta spent almost $19 billion on buybacks in the last three months 2021 alone, at the top of the top of its stock price. What this means, is the company made no money last year. They spent all of their profits on buybacks, but the stock fell by 60% anyway.

[Meta Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Results](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2022/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Results/default.aspx)

Companies are reluctant to cancel buybacks because this would immediately tank their shares. Instead, they try to reduce costs, freeze hiring, do layoffs, issue debt, postpone investments, and when everything else is off the table, they finally cancel buybacks. And only after that do they reduce dividends.

Cost reduction, freeze hiring, small layoffs, and debt issuance are already ongoing across the US economy and increasing by the day. Investments, which would typically be postponed in this situation, are increasing, and financed through debt. Let's look at Meta again. Even though this company is not affected by supply chain issues, it's also in the process of going through the largest restructuring in its history and betting its future on it. This trend seems to be universal and encompassing even unrelated companies, probably due to record profits last year.

[Meta raises $10 billion in first-ever bond offering](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-raises-10-billion-first-ever-bond-offering-2022-08-09/)

The interest rates are rapidly rising, and it will soon become too expensive to issue more debt. The companies will then tap more into their cash reserves and future profits. At some point, this won’t be enough to cover the expenses and buybacks would have to go. This would crash their already depressed stocks. Then companies would have to go through a period of unprofitability and finance their needs through issuing shares at the very bottom of the market.

It's typical for companies to issue shares at the bottom of the market when they have no other options. For example, they almost unanimously printed shares during the bottom of 2020 pandemic crash. And next time, when stocks are at their most depressed levels, when companies are hammered in the news about their poor financial choices, and start printing shares again to stay afloat, would be a good time to buy in. This would be the bottom of the bottom.

Whether it's Micron, or Meta, or pretty much any other large public company, they all are going through a similar path. The next few years are going to be rough.

# Expensive Transition

This transition could have been easier if China or Russia did not change their constitutions to appease their leaders. But both of them did everything to let their leaders stay in power for life.

China is going to stick to its most damaging policies, because their supreme leader is not allowed to admit mistakes. Whatever choices were made must be the right ones. This means zero-covid policies and frequent lockdowns of hundreds of millions of people will continue. This will keep randomly damaging supply chains of any product imaginable, spiking prices and causing shortages, until redundancies are in place.

Similarly, the supreme leader of Russia can not admit his mistakes and would have to wage the war until the bitter end. Losing the war is the end for him and his inner circle. This will exclude Russia from the global economy for the foreseeable future and continue the energy and food crises.

The central banks will continue their fight against inflation. They know they messed up by printing too much money and inflating every asset price imaginable. They want to restore their credibility and cannot back down from this path, because otherwise there’s a risk of hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is much worse than a recession. But because inflation is partly caused by non-monetary factors, the central banks would make ongoing changes in the economy more expensive and inadvertently force inflation to remain higher than their typical 2% targets.

If the central banks had not printed as much money as they did over the last decade, and kept their interest rates reasonably higher, this would be the perfect time for them to reduce the rates and help companies finance their massive investments. Instead, the central banks will make this process more expensive, which will result in higher prices, and will make it harder to bring inflation below 2%.

The central banks will be able to reduce demand. However, reduced demand won’t always make prices cheaper either, because it will decrease the benefits of the economies of scale.

Consider an industry like travel. If fewer and fewer people can afford to travel, and energy prices remain high due to a shortage, then reduced demand only makes flying more expensive. If there’s not enough people to occupy all the seats in an airplane, then each ticket becomes more expensive. The economies of scale benefit from high utilization, once demand goes down, profitability is reduced everywhere, from cloud services to food delivery.",finance,1666002005

personalfinance,Stupid to Use Inheritance For Mortgage?,"My wife and I are considering purchasing a house for $385k. I inherited $135,000 or so (at current valuation) in stocks and bonds, of which we planned to use part for a down payment. It took a really long time to actually get access to the money, so though we had gotten pre-qualified in July for a decent rate, rates have shot up in the meanwhile. Now we have a house we would like to offer on, but even putting 20% down, the mortgage payments (P&amp;I, taxes and insurance) would be more than 50% of my salary. My wife doesn't work outside the home so she has no income. We could increase our down payment, but because stock prices are doing poorly right now, we don't want to sell off too many stocks right now to increase the down payment past 20%.

My field (actuarial) requires you to take professional exams, which I get fixed salary raises for (e.g $3500 when you pass this exam). With these exam raises, by the time I'm done with exams in 2-3 years, we would be making enough to bring our mortgage payments to a more reasonable ratio.

I am expecting an additional inheritance from the other side of the family that will be comparable - $130,000 more in financial assets (stocks, bonds, money market) and also a share of the sale of my relative's house ($60,000 at least.) This brings the total assets we would have on hand after a down payment and closing costs to about $200,000 at current valuation.

We do not want to be house poor, but it is important to us to have a home. We are having our second kid in late December, and our other child is getting close to kindergarten age. The increased interest rates have really hammered our affordability, and if we were to just put 20% down, we wouldn't be able to afford the house that we like. I have calculated that if withdraw $300 per month and use it to pay part of our mortgage, we would be able to afford it. Over the next 3 years, passing my exams would raise my yearly salary to more like $94,000, and the raises per exam are a set amount. Also, interest rates are quite high (although I understand not insanely high by historical standards) so I feel like there's a good chance we could refinance within the next 10 years or so. If we were to withdraw $300/mo for 5 years, and pay long-term gains taxes, that comes out to around $20,000, which doesn't exhaust our assets. Obviously we want money for maintenance as well.

Is this a totally dumb idea? I just feel like we have a lot of assets on hand, and we would benefit a lot from being in this house. I really love it but I am willing to give up on it if it's too risky.",finance,1666008481

algorand,"A message about why I've been shilling the AlgoSeas game so much, why I think it's revolutionary, and why I think more people need to be talking about it.","Hi Reddit, AlgonautBlog here.

If you follow me on twitter, you probably see me frequently making posts like this [one](https://twitter.com/algonautblog/status/1582050519417204739?s=20&amp;t=Z90NdezzpyHbpUW0Kda9vA) where I talk about how great AlgoSeas is. 

Do I get paid? No.  
Will the game make me rich? No.  
So why do I support them so much?

[AlgoSeas](https://algonaut.space/algoseas/) is the first Play to Earn game I have seen that is not, in any way, built like a Ponzi scheme. Most games pretend to be play to Earn, but in reality it is just the new players of the game funding the old players, and eventually the game dies.

AlgoSeas is built different. There are currently **three** revenue streams feeding the game, two of which have the capability to **outpace** the growth of the game.

The first is minting and buying new pirates. This is nothing new, and has the same base mechanism of the Ponzi scheme games of old.

Here's where it gets interesting. AlgoSeas created their own *fully functional* NFT marketplace, and it works seamlessly. It even has advanced sorting characteristics lacking in other (equally awesome) marketplaces on Algorand. 1/4th of the platform fees earned from the marketplace is fed back into the game, meaning that if the marketplace continues to be successful then it is theoretically possible for every player of the game to be profitable.

The third revenue stream is their soon-to-be-launched NFT Launchpad, where creators can launch and shuffle their own project. The first project launched on this was AlgoSeas' AlgoSkulls, which is resulting in 1,000 Algo being returned to the game. That might not sound like a lot, but consider that the game has already paid out 20,000 Algo to players. That means that 5% of the game's payout is being funded by one project launch.

To conclude, I've yet to see a game built with as much player-forward thought as AlgoSeas.

Here's a comparison to the last bear market bottom in 2018, and a list of all the bad news that still wasn't able to push Bitcoin to a new low.","This week it will be 4 months since since Bitcoin dropped to $17.7K, and there still hasn't been a new low.

Bitcoin has been stuck in crab land.

&amp;#x200B;

[The last 4 months since the dip to $17.7K.](https://preview.redd.it/twwua5rcfeu91.jpg?width=1774&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95664bb9c84eba2598431d8de837136eee422e0b)

# What happened in 2018?

After finally breaking below $6K, Bitcoin hit its lowest point in that market cycle at $3.2k. Then crabbed for over 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

[The 2018\/19 market bottom and breakout \(not visually on the same scale as the previous chart\)](https://preview.redd.it/x6k00i6pfeu91.jpg?width=1765&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fe015336cbd0f704b156e8de4cf7b03aaacc5c9)

It took 3 months and 18 days of crabbing before any significant reversal (the very first big green candle).

After 4 months and 27 days, the market had a full breakout, back above $6K (which would be the equivalent of returning above $30K in the current market) and ended its downward trend, had a sustained uptrend, thus ending the bear market.

Keep in mind, no two market cycles has ever been exactly the same. But trader behavior, and supply and demand, do have similar general patterns.

# What type of bad news still failed to bring Bitcoin lower, in the last 4 months?

&amp;#x200B;

1- Escalation of nuclear war threat in the war in Ukraine.

2- Worldwide recession going deeper.

3- Stock markets continuing to drop deeper into bear territory, with many tech stocks crashing hard.

4- High inflation worldwide, and higher CPI than expected last week.

5- China's economy imploding.

6- Energy crisis in Europe.

7- Rumors of looming Mt Gox payments of around 140,000 BTC (many people thought it would drop after August).

8- Fed ramping up their rate hike.

9- Gold dropping to an 18 months low.

10- DXY hitting a 20 year high.

11- The big Ethereum merge, creating uncertainty.

12- Monkey pox outbreak.

13- Threats of war between China and Taiwan during another escalation in the Sino-Taiwanese crisis.

14- Binance BNB smart chain hack.

&amp;#x200B;

None of that was able to bring the price lower.

What more would it take then?

# How has the price managed to hold up, here's my theory:

In short, supply and demand.

I think most of the people who would panic sell have panic sold during the Luna crash, and when Bitcoin crashed.

This took out an enormous chunk of the selling pressure.

We've had bad news since January (not to mention Covid, Brexit, killer wasps, etc from the previous year).

Traders may be getting bear fatigue and jaded by the same old bad news. And doomsday panic has already been in big part priced in.

I also think that the long term 4 year cycles are still a prevailing force in this market.

There's also been a lot of good news within the market in terms of adoption and tech development.

Just in the last 2 weeks, we had news of adoption from Google, Samsung, MasterCard, Societe General, etc...

investing,TLT and long-term rates question,"I have recently taken an interest in the longterm bond fund tlt. It's probably familiar to many readers of this post.

My thesis is buying in small portions every time interest rates goes higher (I suspect they will untill q1 23), then try to buy a bit more when rates start to fall. If inflation expectations and long rates fall from 5 to say around 2, we should see a large (and very safe) upswing in the value of tlt and other long-term bonds (funds). This tactic I've been practicing in the game WSR, and it's immensely effective and profitable, (if you have the time horizon and the funds for it).

However, there's one thing about this ETF I don't get, and that's the yield. I see from the official long bond rates that they are at around 4%, yet this fund yields only 2% (?). What exactly does that mean...will the yield catch up as the etf rolls over its positions? Or is it already 'priced down' because of its large holdings of low-yielding bonds (I think most are from 0.5-2.5 or around there).

personalfinance,"Mortgage, points, and right time to buy?","Hi all, 

Wanted to pick your brain on my current situation. My gf and I (both 29 years old) are looking to buy a home in the next 8 months. We don’t really want to sign another lease (living rent free until May but that’s another topic).

I have 60k saved up and she has 35k. I make 90k a year and she makes 80k. We are looking at putting 50k down (25k each) on a place that’s listed at 400k. My question is does it make sense to buy points at all or should we bite the bullet and accept the standard 7.38% interest rate? I can get down to 6.13% but it costs an extra 14k during close. I hesitant to eat into our emergency fund for this. 

It’s a 3 bedroom townhouse that I could see us staying in for 7-10 years until we have a family and kids that need to go to school. I don’t think i’d want my kids in this public school system. 

My gut is leaning towards the standard rate then refinancing when/if rates come down. 

Thanks in advance",finance,1666041313

personalfinance,Citibank Credit Cards - How do I get a supervisor on the line?,"I have an issue with one of my Citi credit cards. I was charged interest I should not have been charged during a 0% interest promotional period and I spoke to a supervisor back on September 30 and she acknowledge the error and submitted a request to get my interest refunded to me. I had a concern about going past the promotional period expiration date of October 3rd and asked if I should go ahead and pay off my balance. The supervisor advised if the interest is not showing refunded by then to go ahead and pay off the balance. 

So, I get a letter in the mail a couple weeks later telling me, ""Unfortunately, we are unable to reactivate the request offer because the offer has already been paid off."" I call in today to speak with a supervisor and for some reason they will not let me speak with one. The rep insisted for information, and I obliged. She puts me on hold and comes back telling me she entered an adjustment request for me which I didn't ask for. I asked for a supervisor. So now I have to explain everything to her that occurred. She puts me on hold for a few more minutes and comes back on the line stating she spoke with her supervisor, and he says the interest charges are valid. I'm getting irritated now and I ask for a supervisor again and she seriously puts me on hold for like 15 minutes. Then some guy picks up and I ask if he's a supervisor. He says he is not. I'm fed up and irritated at this point after being on the call for 45 minutes, mostly on hold, and I let my anger get the better of me. I tell him off and hang up on him.

investing,JEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF ) 10% yield...seems too good to be true.,"JEPI has a 10% yield . This is 2-4% better than junk bonds, 7% better than TLT/IEF, 6% better than LQD, yet the chart is much smoother, less downside. Seems almost too good to be true.

&gt;JEPI is an actively-managed fund which seeks to generate income by investing in US stocks which have low volatility and which appear undervalued, and through investments in equity-linked notes which provide the economic exposure of the US stock market and written (sold) call options. The fund is appropriate for investors seeking long-term income. JEPI is subject to equity market risk, and risk that its security selection process underperforms the broader market. Additionally, the options exposure of the equity-linked notes provides income, but limits the upside potential of the fund relative to the US stock market, and exposes investors to counterparty risk. JEPI may be tax-inefficient, as distributions from the fund may be taxed as income, and dividends from underlying stock holdings are not considered qualified because of the offsetting options positions.

stocks,Maybe BAC BK SCHW results triggered another sucker rally.,"When commercial bank reported profits today, and it seems suddenly there were huge gains in the price of stocks in the first hour of the October 17th session.

I don't understand why people think increased profits from lending is good news.  Of course when the 10 years U.S. treasury is below the 8 or so percent of inflation, you can expect people lending money to make a profit from the high interest rates borrowers are willing to pay.

But I worry about inflation. When the 10-year U.S. Treasuries are at a lower rate than inflation, you can expect the market to behave a lot like there is still stimulus by low prime interest rates.  I see the higher cost of borrowing as expensive and would reduce future profits companies earn and the higher cost of borrowing would cause consumers to spend less when they can't afford to borrow. This would cause stocks to continue to decline and we still are far from a market bottom.

If guess if the Fed wants to fight inflation, maybe they could raise the prime rate to 8 percent, equal to the rate of inflation. Having borrowers' attention, then clearly tell people that everyone can help fight inflation by trying to cut spending. Consumers should ask if you really need a new car this year or if you really need an another coat just to keep up with fashion every year. Also business investments can wait until rates and inflation come down. To borrow, build and have an economic slowdown isn't a good idea.

If you are bottom fishing, looking for bargain stocks at the lowest market low, please watch out that we may still see the price of stocks decline more when persistent stagflation cut into the stock's earnings. I've been looking for dividend as long term income. If you are a short term investor, maybe invest in 90 day T-bills to capture short term rates that sometimes can be closer to the rate of inflation, the the risk of price decline is minimal.",finance,1666049284

personalfinance,"Advice on Using Home Equity - House Rich, Cash Poor","Hi All -- Looking for some advice here across the board on my next steps and situation.

The shortest version is that I live in a high-cost area, and after a divorce, I'm house-rich, cash-poor, and struggling to figure out an ideal path forward. I could generally move within my city to a different area, but I'm pretty locked into the region. However, I'm thinking I just need to hardcore scale back on expenses until the inflation issue recedes if it ever does.

About me:

\- FI at 50 is a dream

\- Multiple degrees, a classic corporate gig with slow upward mobility.

Basic Income:

* Bi-weekly After-Tax + Deductions (Annual): $76,700 ($2,950 every two weeks)
* Annual After Tax Bonus of Approx.: $20,000 (ex. 2021: $19,424)

Fixed Debt Breakdown:

* Mortgage: $2,556
* Association Fees: $300
* Car Payment (Lease): $550/month (note: Leasing company doesn't allow transfer, so have to ride this one out until it ends or early turn-in without penalty is available: Dec 2023).
* Auto+Home Owners Insurance: $296

NOW, what I'm struggling with is that I have about $500,000 in equity in my house, and I need an assist in determining how to put that money to work. I can get a HELOC for $440,000. This is effectively the only potential capital to which I have access and can put to use.

Prior to the stark increase in interest rates, I was intending to go down the rental property path. However, that's proving difficult to make the numbers work at the level of property I can afford.

Moving doesn't make much sense to reduce costs as I can afford half of the house at current interest rates (and literally zero properties for a significant distance from my current one), and I'm just paying a crazy amount in interest.

stocks,"Scared me, says Yahoo Finance: Tesla could become a ""zombie stock"" as interest rates rise","A longtime pessimist about Tesla TSLA +7.01%  says the shares could be headed for what he calls “zombie stock” territory.

David Trainer, CEO of stock research firm New Constructs, who wrote in August 2013 that Tesla stock was “way overvalued” at $11 a share, said in a research note Monday that the shares have a long way to fall. The company’s spectacular sales growth could be the problem, he wrote.

Back in 2013, Trainer was worried about Tesla ’s low profitability, reliance on sales of zero-emission regulatory credits, and persistent cash burn. Tesla reported a small operating loss in 2013, but things have improved substantially.

The company is expected to report about $15 billion in operating profit for 2022. What’s more, Tesla has now generated positive free cash flow over its entire life and Wall Street projects another $6.5 billion during the second half of 2022. The total expected between 2023 and 2025 is roughly $55 billion.

Cheap growth capital and falling interest rates helped Tesla achieve those financial results. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury debt went from roughly 2.5% to 0.5% between mid-2013 and mid-2020, but interest rates are rising now. The 10-year Treasury yields almost 4%.

Rising rates are a new concern for Trainer. Higher interest rates tend to depress valuations for richly valued growth stocks the most. Growth companies, such as Tesla, generate most of their earnings and cash flow far in the future. Both are worth less in today’s dollars when discounted back at higher interest rates.

High valuations and rising rates help create the category of what Trainer refers to as “zombie stocks”—those that, roughly speaking, go nowhere, or fall, no matter what the underlying business produces. And Tesla is certainly highly valued, especially for a car company. Trainer notes that Tesla’s market capitalization at near $700 billion dwarfs the combined figure of nearly $400 billion for Toyota Motor (TM), General Motors (GM), Stellantis (STLA), Honda Motor (HMC), Tata Motors (TTM), and Nissan Motor (NSANY).

Growth, of course, is the reason for the gap. Tesla’s sales rose more than 110% between 2019 and 2021. Combined sales for the peer group dropped almost 10% over the same span.

Investors might think that growth would lift Tesla stock out of the zombie zone, but the reverse could be true. The larger Tesla’s car business gets, the more investors will treat the company like a car stock, giving it a valuation like those of other auto manufacturers, according to Trainer.

“If we assume Tesla sells 9% more vehicles than Toyota \[in 2031\] Tesla has 56%+ downside,” Trainer wrote. The logic is that for Tesla to get that big, its operating profit margins would have to fall to match those of its competitors. For Tesla, sales 9% higher than Toyota’s and comparable operating profit margins would yield roughly $44 billion in 2031 operating profit.

It’s a big number, but only 80% higher than what is now expected for 2023. According to Trainer’s financial model, that justifies a current share price of only $90 for Tesla stock, while the stock is comfortably above $200.

Concern over Tesla’s valuation isn’t new, and the stock remains controversial. Targets for the price on Wall Street range from about $24 to $530 a share. The so-called bull-bear spread of more than $500 is almost 250% of the recent stock price.

The bull-bear spread for GM stock is about 175%, while the figure for the industrial conglomerate 3M (MMM) is about 67%.

Trainer’s report didn’t hurt Tesla shares on Monday. The stock closed up 7%, at $219.35, while the S&amp;P 500SPX +2.65%  and Dow Jones Industrial AverageDJIA +1.86%  gained 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively.",finance,1666060064

Doesn't change my view, but whoever wrote this article, do you truly believe that this will affect Feds decision?

It might be rhetorical questions, I just don't understand this optimism, labor numbers came up, we went into red. Next day everything in green, and gets greener by the minute. Everyone expects the rate increase, which mostly will change the spectrum. So, how come everything and everyone is so positive at this very moment in time?

CryptoCurrency,The SEC just showed up in the Celsius Bankruptcy. Link in post,"This is some pretty big news for anyone involved in the Celsius case. I personally lost most of my crypto holdings in Celsius, so obviously I’m biased. 

Effectively what happened is that the SEC (American federal financial regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission) and Celsius (the “Debtor”) have reached a agreement extending the deadline that the SEC has to claim that certain debt is non-dischargeable. Which effectively means that the SEC is highly likely going to sue Celsius (potentially on behalf of those affected) and charge them with crimes. This is the end of the beginning, and the start of the end for the executives of Celsius and those involved in this fraud. The FTC did the same a few days ago.

Tweets from a lawyer involved in the case David Adler:

He also mentioned that the FTC (and now SEC) could use this to file charges, since one of the few exemptions to discharging debt is fraud/basically other criminal acts.

However, AG Mortgage (MITT) and MFA Financial (MFA) both posted portfolio updates after close today and had a lot of movement. 

It’s important to note mREITs generally trade at a small discount to book value. 

- MFA announced they have an estimated book value of $15.25 to $15.45 per share as of September 30,2022. Current share price is $9.15 after hours, presenting a potential ~68% upside. Current dividend yield is 20.58%. 

- Likewise, MITT announced a book value estimate of $10.97-$11.07 as of September 30, 2022. At the current price of $4.06 after hours, potential upside is 170%. Currently dividend yield is 22.16%. 

This sector can be ugly, but it’s incredibly oversold currently. They rely heavily on net interest income and Agency MBS, which are hot topics at the moment. Do your research and see if this is a play suited for you.

*Text behind paywall:*

Central bank expected to bow to investor calls for new pause to start of £838bn government bond selldown  
  
The Bank of England is likely to delay the sale of billions of pounds of government bonds in a bid to foster greater stability in gilt markets following the UK’s failed “mini” Budget.

The bank had already delayed the start of its sale of £838bn of gilts bought under its quantitative easing programme from October 6 to the end of this month. It is now expected to bow to investor pressure for a further pause until the market becomes calmer.

The Financial Times has learnt that the bank’s top officials have come to this view after judging the gilts market to be “very distressed” in recent weeks, a view backed by its Financial Policy Committee.

Investors have also warned that the central bank’s plans to begin selling bonds in its portfolio at the end of this month could destabilise markets.

Although 30-year gilt yields have fallen from their recent high of more than 5 per cent to 4.32 per cent on Monday, they remain well above the 3.75 per cent reached before the mini-Budget.

“I’m not sure it’s wise for them to go straight away, because the market’s so fragile at the moment,” said Jim Leaviss, chief investment officer for public fixed income at M&amp;G Investments.

Sandra Holdsworth, UK head of rates at Aegon Asset Management, added: “When they’ve had to support the market so recently, I’m not sure they can go ahead without risking more problems,”

The BoE’s shift is set to put on hold the start of the UK’s unwinding of QE — a process other central banks have begun so as to reduce their swollen balance sheets and increase their freedom of manoeuvre in any future monetary or financial crisis.

BoE officials maintain that inflation control can be implemented by changing interest rates, rather than so-called quantitative tightening, the inverse of QE. At the pace the bank has set, completing QT would take a decade or more.
  
In Washington on Saturday, Andrew Bailey, BoE governor, confirmed that the MPC would seek to use bank rates rather than asset sales as its main weapon in the inflation fight.

“The MPC is not using the stock of asset holdings as an active tool of monetary policy at present,” he told an audience of central bankers. “The intention was to unwind the stock of QE gradually and predictably, and in a way that wasn’t bound to underlying economic conditions,” he added.

Delaying the sale of bonds would not need a vote from the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. In making its previous postponement last month, the bank judged that turbulent market conditions met the “high bar” it had set to alter the timing without a vote.

The BoE still hopes to unwind £80bn of assets in the first year of running down its balance sheet through a combination of assets maturing and active sales.

The Bank is likely to stick to its policy of allowing maturing bonds to expire without reinvesting their proceeds in other securities. But active sales could provoke further market turmoil, hurting the economy and complicating plans to raise interest rates, ING rates strategist Antoine Bouvet said.

“You don’t want to let anything scupper your chances of hiking rates further, which is their only proven tool for getting inflation down,” Bouvet said. “I’m not sure this market can accommodate the BoE selling as well.”

Some analysts argue that the BoE may need to tweak its plans when it decides to begin quantitative tightening.

Instead of selling roughly equal quantities of short-, medium- and long-term gilts, the central bank should focus on short maturities, said Daniela Russell, HSBC’s head of UK rates strategy. That would allow the long end of the gilt market, which was the focus of the chaotic sell-off that triggered a liquidity crisis at pension funds, to “continue to recover”, she added.",finance,1666071205

stocks,Goldman CEO David Solomon says there's a good chance of a recession and so it's time to be cautious,"Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned Tuesday that the U.S. economy might be headed for a downturn that could make investing and business decisions more difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

""I think it's a time to be cautious, and I think that if you're running a risk-based business, it's a time to think more cautiously about your risk box, your risk appetite,"" Solomon said during a live interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I think you have to expect that there's more volatility on the horizon now. That doesn't mean for sure that we have a really difficult economic scenario. But on the distribution of outcomes, there's a good chance that we have a recession in the United States,"" he added.

&amp;#x200B;

Solomon spoke just minutes after this company released third-quarte results that topped analyst expectations for both profit and revenue. Those results come at an important time for the economy as it prepares another reorganization, this time combining the Wall Street giant's four main businesses into three.

&amp;#x200B;

Reorganizing the company and streamlining the businesses reflects ""the evolution of this one-Goldman Sachs ethos"" that he said will help the bank service clients better.

&amp;#x200B;

""The fundamentals really don't change,"" Solomon said. ""The leadership does move to different places, but it's the same leadership.""

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking on macro issues, Solomon repeatedly stressed the importance of caution, noting the tightening of financial conditions and rise of inflation in recent months.

&amp;#x200B;

The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates aggressively in an effort to calm inflation running at its highest levels in more than 40 years. Markets have reacted strongly, with stocks tumbling and Treasurys yields surging.

&amp;#x200B;

""That environment heading into 2023 is one that you've got to be cautious and prepared for,"" Solomon said.

financialindependence,"Two Year FIRE Update: Breakdown of my budget, expense, life updates, trading etc.","I hit FIRE and pulled the trigger two years ago from today in October of 2020. It's been quite an amazing two years filled with wonderful travels, new ventures, meeting loads of people, and just living the good life. I thought I'd just run down my finances for those interested in what FIRE finances actually look like and what i've been up to.

# Background

I hit FIRE in Oct 2020. I am from the US and worked my whole career in Financiail services. I moved to Europe in beginning of 2019 for a work opportunity and I decided to call it quits at the end of 2020 because it was time to move on to the next phase of life.

Prior to FIRE, I had always traveled every opportunity I got but it was only for a few weeks at a time since I had the pressures of a job to go back to. Post FIRE, my plan was always to travel the world full time and live in different places for a few months at a time. As well, I wanted to pursue other passions of mine like surfing, diving, blogging, and more.

# What have I been doing?

On to the fun part of the post. Since I hit FIRE in 2020, I've essentially lived out my dream of traveling full time and living in different parts of the world. Even before FIRE, I had been to 70 countries so this lifestyle was nothing new for me. I spent 3 months in Zanzibar after hitting FIRE. This was the beginning of the second wave of COVID so Tanzania was the only place really open. The rest of the world was in a perpetual lockdown so there was no reason to partake in any of that.

After Zanzibar, I went to Egypt for a few months and did more diving and kitesurfing while working on my blog. Egypt was mostly open with warm weather and wonderful people. After spending most of winter and spring in Egypt, Europe was finally reopening from their lockdowns so I flew back to Europe and traveled with friends through a dozen countries or so with a lot of new countries on the list (Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania etc.) and of course some timeless classics like Greece, Italy, Spain etc.

I spent most of the fall traveling through Turkey, Georgia, and Armenia which was incredible (love this part of the world). In December, Asia was FINALLY starting to reopen which always was where I really wanted to go. In fact, I wanted to go to Asia in 2020 but who knew it would be closed for the next year.

In December, I spent the month in Thailand which was incredible. I had visited the country many years before but it was a perpetual shitshow with the amount of tourists. This time around, I was able to visit Bangkok's beautiful temples with hardly anyone there. The beaches in the Andaman sea was so peaceful and calm it was probably what tourism in Thailand was like 30 years ago.

After THailand, I decided to go to Bali which is one of my favorite places in the world. I had to do a week long quarantine to actually enter the country because of their strict covid rules but afterwards it was heaven on Earth. I remember Bali as being this crazy busy and overpacked place but it was just an incredible place to be during COVID.

THere was no mass tourism during this time because no one would agree to a long quarantine but there were enough Digital nomad style people calling it home to make things interesting. I made loads of friends and absolutely loved the digital nomad style of life. I met some extremely interesting people during this time, far more interesting than 99% of the people I met during my time in finance. Crypto bros, fitness bros, regular bros, serial entrepreneurs, overly spiritual people (okay these were a bit weird but what can you do), anti-vaxxers/conspiracy theorists (See previous) real estate developers, loads of Russians who didn't like Putin, semi-pro influencers and everything in between. I didn't really do much in Bali besides just live in my villa, go to the gym, coconut sunsets, hiked around rice fields, work on my blog, and diving here and there. There are more beautiful cafes per square km than anywhere else in the world. Along with fantastic restaurants, chilled beach bars, and a vibrant expat scene, it was heaven on Earth.

I spent only $2k a month in Bali living the high life. I had a beautiful villa and pretty much did whatever I wanted to whenever I wanted. I was also in the best shape of my life since college as I just hit the gym and surfed everyday day.

I lived like this for the greater part of 5 months which was just incredible. Eventually however, Bali did reopen to tourism and the crowds started showing up. Obviously, I'm not naive enough to think I could just have Bali to myself but it was fantastic while it lasted. From May 2022, I started finally pursuing my dream of working as a dive instructor. Diving has always been a big passion of mine and this was always the post FIRE plan. Indonesia has the best diving in the world and I always knew I wanted to come back and teach in this part of the world. With COVID, 95% of the ""old guard"" of dive professionals quit and went back to their home countries. A lot of these people got ""normal"" jobs and few of them wanted to comeback to the world of diving when things reopened as they settled into their new lives. THis opened up countless opportunities for me and I was able to get a job at one of my favorite areas in the world.

I knew the owners of the resort and told them to just give my salary (not much about $900 a month) to the local staff. Most of the locals went back to their villages to their traditional professions like fishing or seaweed farming which pays almost nothing. My living accommodations and food are paid for at the resort which is standard since it's in the middle of nowhere. I've done this for the last few months and absolutely loved it. It's probably the most rewarding thing I've done in my entire life thus far.

I'm taking a 6 week break currently. I went to Greece to meet up some friends and then we all went to Oktoberfest which is a timeless classic. Now I am writing this post in Cyprus while visiting a friend I made while in Bali. Cyprus is one of the last countries in Europe for me and a nice  €60 Ryanair flight meant it just had to be done. Cyprus is a bit boring not gonna lie so I will probably go to Lebanon as I just discovered they have €35 flights to Beirut which is one of my favorite places in the world. I have another wedding in the South of France at the end of the month before going back to SE Asia.

# Finances

NW at Oct 2020 - $1.3m in stocks, not factoring in my real estate

NW at end of 2021 - $1.8m, no real estate

&amp;#x200B;

**Market Update**

As far as finances go, I've been doing alright in this bear market. THe markets are about what they were when I FIRE'd, perhaps a little lower which is never a good feeling but just the risk you take with your sequence of returns risk. The bear market of 2022 is definitely the worst market I've ever been a part of. I was too young for 08 with no money in the game and COVID was over before it started. 2022 is just a non stop slow bleed down 30% and doesn't look like it will end until the FED pivots. It really feels like an inflection point of sorts as the FED has left the markets. During my entire 14y stretch of being an adult, I've essentially invested in a FED market. In the end, no one can predict the future but it just feels like we are due for slow anemic appreciation in the future. For now, I just try not to look at the total portfolio value much (once every quarter) as really serves no purpose in the short term.

&amp;#x200B;

**Strong USD**

The one positive from the last year has been the extra strong dollar. This of course is bad for stocks but great for those living outside of the US. It's actually brunted the impact of inflation in many of the places I""ve been staying in. For example, a Mas of beer at Oktoberfest was 11.5 Euros in 2019 ($13ish) and this year, the mas was 13.5 Euros ($13ish).

Talking to my friends back home about the rapid rise in prices, I honestly couldn't imagine worrying about my finances in the US so props to those FIRE'd in the US in these times.

&amp;#x200B;

**Light Trading**

In 2021, I made some very successful trades at the beginning of the year capitalizing on some of the YOLO hype. Sorry FIRE purists, I just couldn't resist. In 2022, I haven't done much besides sell some far OTM options to generate a little bit of income. In addition, I've also purchased puts (only $1-$2k worth) around CPI and FED speeches just as a way to hedge my portfolio which has worked out well. Seems like every time Daddy Powell opens his mouth the market tanks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Selling my apartment in NYC**

I sold my apt in NYC Q2 of 2022 which was fantastically timed. Markets were doing very well in Q1 before rising rates crushed demand and now I don't even want to imagine how difficult it would be to sell there. All in all, I took away $200k from this sale which I have been slowly DCA'ing back into the markets.

With the money, I also purchased $20k ($10k personal and $10k on a sole prop) of i bonds. Not sure if this was the right move but I reckon a \~8% ROI over 15 months is quite alright if I wanted to sell early.

# Withdrawals from Portfolio

I've always planned for a variable withdrawal rate because I just don't know what my life holds and where I will be. The idea of staying in one place and just chilling was never my idea of the perfect FIRE life. Therefore, I knew that some periods I would spend much more and others I would spend almost nothing. That's been put into real life practice now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Withdrawals 2021**

I made multiple withdrawals in 2021 to the tune of about $45k which was just shy of 4%. I try not to time my withdrawals but I always reckoned withdrawing near ATHs is as good of a moment as you can make it. 2021 was the bull of all bulls so this was easy to time.

I also made about $15k from blogging during the year which helped supplement the lifestyle. Some of this money I spent but most of it I just reinvested.

I really did not hold back on anything during this year. I traveled to 15 countries or so and pretty much did whatever I wanted to.

&amp;#x200B;

**Withdrawals 2022 - Almost nothing**

In 2022, I took one withdrawal in Feb 2022 and I've essentially just paused all my future withdrawals until markets recover. While I spent a lot of money in 2021, I didn't need to spend nearly as much in 2022 as the lifestyle in Bali was so cheap. I covered most of my expenses just from my blogging income alone which really picked up this year. And now, I have little to no expenses for the foreseeable future but let's see how long I want to be an instructor!

&amp;#x200B;

**Blog Income**

I've had a blog for many years but really put some more effort into in recent years optimizing SEO and all that stuff. At the peak, it was getting about 2.5-3k sessions a day, and along with advertising, affiliate links and other things, it was generating $2k at its peak. Now I reckon it is generating between $1-1.5k a month which is definitely helps with lowering the withdrawal rate. Something about blogging really brings me joy and is soothing in a weird way. Whether I FIRE'd with $10m or $1m, I'd be doing the same thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Portfolio value Oct 2022**

As of writing this post, I have

$1.4m in stocks

$110k in cash

$20k in Ibonds

I don't need so much cash but I am just still DCA'ing it back into the markets. I've withdrawn almost no money this year as my expenses have been very manageable.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

\- FIRE'd in Oct 2020 with $1.3m in stocks

\- Traveled the world and back during that time

\- Lived in Bali for 2022 and became a dive instructor which was always the long term plan and passion

\- Blog income and being a dive instructor meant almost no withdrawals in 2022 to ride out the bear market

\- Bear market bad but still doing good

&amp;#x200B;

**2023 Goals:**

\- Work on a liveaboard, preferably in Raja Ampat

\- Travel to more of Asia, still need to go to Vietnam, Laos, Korea, and Sri Lanka

\-  Visit Australia and NZ

\- Get better at kitesurfing",finance,1666098052

36 years old
$30,000 checking
$6,000 savings
$21,000 personal investment account
$120,000 401k

I make about $3,000 a month take home and around $1300 per month after mortgage and all bills. I have $10,000 left on my mortgage at 4.5% with a payment of about $800 per month. 

I have no immediate needs, single,live alone, will need a car within the next 1-2 years but between my savings and checking buffer I’m not very worried about that affecting my situation. 

What do I do? I aggressively paid off my house during the pandemic but now I’ve just been floating without a plan and feel weird having so much in checking without any directions. 

I’ve thought about just using the monthly surplus to start paying down the mortgage, but unsure if it makes more sense to just pay it all at once, or even just to keep making the normal monthly payment. 

Or should I work towards being able to pay cash for a car to avoid the higher interest rate?

Should I be investing more?

stocks,"100% probability of U.S. recession in coming year, according to Bloomberg Economics forecast model","The U.S. economy falling into recession within the next 12 months is a virtual certainty, according to the latest Bloomberg Economics forecast model released on Monday.

The dire projection surfaced just weeks before national midterm elections that will determine control of Congress. Just a week ago, President Joe Biden said a recession in the U.S. was unlikely and said any such downturn would be “very slight” if it did occur.

Bloomberg Economics’ latest statistical projections showed a 100% probability of a recession within the next 12 months as the U.S. economy contends with decades-high inflation, Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes and mounting geopolitical tensions.

The likelihood of a recession was 65% in the Bloomberg model’s most recent previous update. Generated by economists Anna Wong and Eliza Winger, the model utilizes 13 macroeconomic and financial indicators to assess the odds of a downturn from one month to two years in the future.

A separate Bloomberg survey of 42 economists predicts the probability of a recession over the next 12 months now stands at 60%, up from 50% a month earlier.

The Bloomberg Economics model showed a 25% probability of a recession hitting even sooner — within the next 10 months — up from 0% in the previous release.

Fears of a deep recession have surged in recent months as the Fed hikes interest rates in a bid to cool inflation. Investors believe the Fed risks “overtightening” monetary policy in reaction to higher prices and driving the economy into a sustained downturn.

Segments of the U.S. economy, such as the housing market, have shown signs of struggle.

The Fed has implemented supersized three-quarter-point interest-rate hikes at each of its last three meetings, with a fourth major increase expected when monetary-policy makers hold a two-day meeting Nov. 1–2. Despite the rate hikes, inflation ran at a hotter-than-expected 8.2% in September.

Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and others have downplayed concerns about the economic outlook for months.

“I don’t think there will be a recession. If it is, it will be a very slight recession. That is, we’ll move down slightly,” Biden said during an interview with CNN last week.

“Look, it’s possible” he added. “I don’t anticipate it.”

Yellen has suggested the central bank, which she led in 2014–18, would need both skill and luck to pilot the economy toward something other than a hard landing.

U.S. GDP has declined for two straight quarters — a rule-of-thumb definition of a recession. But the National Bureau of Economic Research, a key economy tracker, has yet to formally declare one is underway.

A separate Bloomberg survey of 42 economists puts the probability of a recession over the next 12 months at 60%, up from 50% a month earlier

personalfinance,Going to close all my credit cards except the oldest - thoughts before I do it?,"Hey all, 

I used to have a high paying job but I'm back in school now, so I don't have as much money to throw around. My credit cards are screwing me up because I think I have more money than I really do, and I end up putting things on my CCs that I know I don't hav the money for.

I have one credit card that has about $130 of travel credits on it, and I have my Amazon card that's got about $80 of amazon credit on it. The other two cards are a chase freedom unlimited which just ives me 1.5% back and a chase freedom that I never use. 

Finally I have a low interest rate card (9%) that I currently am paying off a balance on. This card is my oldest, and I plan on keeping it even after the balance is gone. 

Does this all sound good? Is there anything I should do last-minute with my travel credits or amazon points?

stocks,Why most of your money doesn't really exist &amp; how money is created (educational post),"What if we told you that most money doesn't strictly exist, but we sometimes pretend it does based on what definition of money we are using at the time?  Today we will be discussing the different levels of money, and how they are created. 

 **Intro**  

Contrary to popular belief, in order to print money, you don't necessarily need to \*print money\*  In fact, most currency that exists doesn't physically exist. How much money exists depends on your definition of what you consider to be money. 

**Imaginary Money**  

Imagine you're on a desert island where you and your friend use 100 coconuts as currency. Your friend has control of all of them and can issue a loan that charges you an interest rate of 1 coconut. Hence, the economy works as if there were 101 coconuts. 

**Debt Creates Money**  

Whenever interest is charged on any asset, this creates paper claims which get treated as new versions of that asset. This is why you can have inflationary price effects on assets that are limited in quantity. 

**Debt Upon Debt**  

Your friend now has a right to 101 coconuts on paper. If someone new comes to the island, he can use his assets of 101 coconuts &amp; transform them into even more coconuts by lending against his capital. Real banks have legal limiters to how much they can do this.

**Close Substitutes**  

You might not have the extra coconut that you owe to your friend. But since you have a good reputation, you can create a contract valued at 1 coconut, which is redeemable for goods or services you produce. This claim can then be used as a coconut substitute. 

**Dirty Little Secret**  

The economy might have grown, and outstanding obligations might be over 1000 coconuts, but there are still only 100 REAL coconuts.  Depending on the velocity of money, it then becomes increasingly difficult to ever pay all debts without economic collapse. 

**Central Banks**  

People eventually harvest coconuts, which are then lent to others like your friend, with the intention that they will loan them out as well. These are central banks, which create money and decide the speed of the economy by affecting the availability of cash. 

**What is Money?**  

An economist then comes in a rowboat and a suit, asking how many coconuts your island economy has. What do you tell him?  ""It depends"" would be the honest answer, as your economy might still only have 100 coconuts, but has evolved past needing ""real"" ones. 

**Classifying Money**  

A similar situation happens in modern economies. Debt and financial instruments that can easily be converted into cash work almost as well as money, so any frank assessment of the economy should consider them as part of the money supply. 

**What is it?**  

Every country has a different way to measure money.  In the USA, the monetary base is measured in various levels: M0, MB, M1, M2, M3, MZM. These go all the way from narrow definitions, like physical notes, to broad definitions including airline miles. 

**Fiat**  

Nowadays money has value not because it’s tied to real-world utility, but because big scary men with guns will come after you if you disagree with this status quo.  Therefore, as opposed to coconut commodity money, we call our money “fiat” - from Latin “Let it be done”. 

[Financial Magic](https://www.city-journal.org/html/americas-missing-money-15725.html)

Such is our disconnect with what value represents, that modern economies like the USA can lose track of $21 trillion, as it doesn’t quite know or remember where the bureaucrats popped it into existence. 

**Conclusion**  

""Money"" is a broad term, meaning many things to various people. Once we assign ""paper claims"" to nonexistent assets, money becomes disconnected from physical reality &amp; evolves to become something different. Debt becomes money, so it is a claim on future benefits.

People  eventually harvest coconuts, which are then lent to others like your  friend, with the intention that they will loan them out as well. These  are central banks, which create money and decide the speed of the  economy by affecting the availability of cash.

**What is Money?**

An  economist then comes in a rowboat and a suit, asking how many coconuts  your island economy has. What do you tell him?  ""It depends"" would be  the honest answer, as your economy might still only have 100 coconuts,  but has evolved past needing ""real"" ones.

**Classifying Money**

A  similar situation happens in modern economies. Debt and financial  instruments that can easily be converted into cash work almost as well  as money, so any frank assessment of the economy should consider them as  part of the money supply.

**What is it?**

Every  country has a different way to measure money.  In the USA, the monetary  base is measured in various levels: M0, MB, M1, M2, M3, MZM. These go  all the way from narrow definitions, like physical notes, to broad  definitions including airline miles.

**Fiat**

Nowadays  money has value not because it’s tied to real-world utility, but  because big scary men with guns will come after you if you disagree with  this status quo.  Therefore, as opposed to coconut commodity money, we  call our money “fiat” - from Latin “Let it be done”.

[Financial Magic](https://www.city-journal.org/html/americas-missing-money-15725.html)

Such  is our disconnect with what value represents, that modern economies  like the USA can lose track of $21 trillion, as it doesn’t quite know or  remember where the bureaucrats popped it into existence.

**Bringing it Back to Crypto**  

After hundreds of years of paper money, we can still bicker about what ""real"" money even is. So it shouldn't surprise us that with a new financial instrument like digital assets, we're still trying to understand what exactly this new tech even is. 

**Conclusion**

""Money""  is a broad term, meaning many things to various people. Once we assign  ""paper claims"" to nonexistent assets, money becomes disconnected from  physical reality &amp; evolves to become something different. Debt  becomes money, so it is a claim on future benefits.

personalfinance,Capital One Savings Interest Rates,"Wanted to provide some feedback on Capital One banking, notably their old Money Market Savings and the new savings account, marketed as “Performance Savings”. I’ve had a money market saving account open with Capital One since at least 2018 and was recently receiving an interest rate of .08%. I noticed that they were advertising a rate of 2.25% (as of today it is 2.30%) and thought it was odd that I was still receiving only the .08. I reached out to Capital One and was told I need to open a new “Performance Savings” account to get the higher rate. After speaking with the representative on the phone, I was told that the Performance Savings is basically the exact same product as the old Money Market offering – no minimums, etc. Essentially what Capital One is doing is creating a ""new"" product/account rather than raising the rates on their existing accounts. Nice to see they are taking care of their existing customers.... I’d strongly recommend anyone who is baking with Capital One to check their account and open the new “Performance” account, or better yet, take your business elsewhere due to shady business practices.",finance,1666110290

...latest fund manager survey, investors are now holding about 6.3% of their portfolios in cash—the highest level since April 2001 as concerns over financial stability risks reach the highest level on record.

The concerns have weighed heavily on the domestic stock market, which has started to react more to global financial woes, the analysts wrote as volatility expectations measured by the Vix Index spiked to the highest level in nearly four months.

The survey, composed of 371 panelists managing $1.1 trillion, also found market liquidity has ""deteriorated significantly"" over the past month—with managers rating conditions at levels seen only during the Covid-induced crash in April 2020 and the Great Financial Crisis that started in 2007.

Amid the virtually universal bearishness, Bank of America's analysts predict stocks are poised for a ""big low"" and ""big rally"" in the first half of next year, when the majority of economists believe the Federal Reserve will stop hiking interest rates as it works to combat inflation.

They also note investors' economic outlooks remain close to max bearishness, with 72% of fund managers expecting the economy will weaken over the next 12 months—just below a record high print from July.

 Surprising Fact

The share of investors believing the economy is nearing the end of expansion this cycle has dropped to 67% in September since hitting a post-pandemic peak of 80% in June. Historically, a drop of this magnitude has coincided with a recession, Bank of America notes. 

 Key Background

 With prolonged inflation forcing central banks to hike interest rates aggressively this year, stocks have suffered immensely as investors brace for how much the hikes may slow the economy. After surging 27% in 2021, the S&amp;P has plummeted 23% this year, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 33%.

personalfinance,How dumb is it to finance a car currently?,"I know it’s a dumb move so I’m just wondering how dumb it is?  I’m interested in getting a used Camaro SS about 2014-2018 in Florida sometime soon.  I currently have a 2013 Cruze LT that I could sell or trade in to lower the price or increase the amount of down payment I can make on the car.  I’m interested in getting one around December of this year roughly.

I’m currently 22 years old, about a 730-740 credit score, in grad school, have about 4 years of credit history, and just started a new job making about $60,000 right now.  I don’t have many expenses currently and don’t expect that to change for the next year or two.  Hopefully within five years, I can get consistent raises and be to about six figures.  So how dumb is it to finance the Camaro SS right now?

I know I could just hold onto my current car for the foreseeable future but it’s starting to give my more problems recently and it’s at about 120,000 miles.  So it’s starting to take more time and money to fix up and maintain.  I’m getting a bit concerned and would like to get it fixed then shop around.  That’s why I’m interested in potentially getting a Camaro soon. 

Thank you!

Edit: With how interest rates are currently, would it be smart to try and make it work and wait a year, or are interest rates expected to keep increasing through next year and potentially longer?  My concern is that I may need a car sooner so I’m wondering if I should just do it now instead of waiting.

Also, sorry if I come up the wrong way with this post.  I’m not saying it’s dumb to finance a car and it’s probably the smarter thing to do rather than dropping $30000 all at once.

My salary, as of this afternoon, is 50k. (20k less than when I bought my house, but I changed industries and had to start over.) I work from home.

My taxes, city/state/federal, are 17.5% of that, leaving me with 41,250. My mortgage is $1460/month. Leaving me with $23,730 annually. Moving isn't practical right now.

I don't qualify for any health insurance assistance, so I pay $3828 for the year to have a high deductible plan, leaving me with $19,902.

I'm pregnant (Due Feb). My deductible is 5k before insurance pays anything (and starts over in January) and the max is 7k. So after paying the hospital bill, I'll have $12,902 to live off of. 

Childcare doesn't seem like an option with that. Average cost is $10k/year, leaving me with less than $3k to support my family on. I have a husband (31yo) who is in school full time and can be the primary caretaker for the baby's first year of life until his clinicals start. He does gigs to help out, such as tutoring and UberEATS, but I'm the primary breadwinner. Thankfully, he got a merit scholarship, so we don't have to pay for school other than textbooks as long as he aces his classes. He'll graduate in 3 years without loans.

None of this includes food, gas (for car and house), electricity, phone, internet, car insurance, etc. 

 I've been promised a promotion for 6 months now. I finally received it this afternoon. This is with the new pay. ($5k raise before taxes.) There's no room for negotiation - I tried and advocated, but they were clear they can't budge.

For as long as my husband can provide the childcare, we'll have about 1k/month to live on. Any advice on how to survive with that information?

stocks,Yahoo Finance says: This U.S. pension plan is facing a bigger crisis than the UK. Is this true?,"Could the U.S. pensions behemoth be hit by the kind of crisis that just swept across the U. K.?

Don’t bet on it, says ratings agency Fitch. This kind of turmoil is “unlikely,” it says.

We can only add: We had better hope they are right.

Naturally, as we remember that the ratings agencies totally missed the subprime fiasco that brought down the global economy 14 years ago, we are saying this with our fingers crossed.

The “defined benefit” pensions system in the U.S.A. is nearly 10 times the size of the one in Britain that just plunged the global financial system into turmoil and the British government into crisis.

So a similar problem in the U.S. would be on a vastly bigger scale. Think: 2008.

“U.S. state and local pensions are unlikely to face the sudden liquidity crisis that U.K. corporate pensions are confronting,” Fitch Ratings says in a statement. The reason? U.S. pension plans use “different approaches to valuing liabilities,” and as a result different investment strategies, it says.

But it adds: “While they do not appear to employ derivatives on the scale seen in U.K. pensions, U.S. state and local plan assets often have direct derivatives exposure, typically used for hedging foreign currency and interest rate risks and reported at fair value. While plans disclosure of asset allocations, derivatives exposure and related risks has improved in recent years, details on allocations vary widely.”

The crisis that has suddenly enveloped the British pensions system was partly caused by complex technical issues which caused a short-term cash crunch.

All “defined-benefit” pension plans, meaning traditional, old-fashioned pension plans that promise to pay retirees a certain income for the rest of their lives, are faced with the same set of problems: Namely, how do the plan operators calculate today’s value of liabilities that will not come due for years or decades, and how do they match them to their investment plans?

Fitch explains the U.K. crisis in this way: “State and local government pensions discount their liabilities using the same fixed long-term investment return rate that they assume for their assets, whereas U.K. corporate pensions discount their liabilities using variable, market-based rates. To avoid having market rate variability affect U.K. pension liabilities, and thus their parent corporations’ balance sheets, U.K. pensions engage in liability-driven investing (LDI) strategies that use leverage, an approach not commonly used by U.S. plans. LDI strategies typically rely on interest rate derivatives that involve long-dated U.K. bonds to match their long-term obligations.”

British pensions expert Tony Nangle has a good, more technical explainer for those who are really interested.

In a nutshell: Sudden turmoil in the market for British government bonds, known as gilts, meant that British pension funds had to raise cash very quickly to post as collateral for margin calls on their derivatives. The turmoil in government bonds did not necessarily threaten the long-term solvency of the funds, but did threaten their short-term liquidity. They were effectively in danger of being “stopped out” of long term positions.

To meet the margin call, they sold the assets that were easiest to sell: Namely, British government bonds. That caused further turmoil in the market and made the liquidity crisis even worse. In other words, the market was caught in a vicious spiral or “doom loop.” The Bank of England stepped in to backstop the market and end the spiral.

This, at least, is the bull case.

A quite different argument is offered by independent British pensions expert John Ralfe. He says many pensions have been using derivatives irresponsibly, to gamble.

Astonishingly, Britain’s own pension regulator admitted in 2019 that some pensions were levered up to 700%, meaning debts were as much as 7 times assets. This is a bit like owning a home with a mortgage worth 87.5% of the value.

But where does this leave U.S. pensions?

The APRA deflationary utility token will allow holders to participate in The gold redemption programme. The token will additionally be used for payments within the Apraemio ecosystem, give holders the possibility to acquire services and will further act as an incentive mechanism.

The world economy has been facing a series of considerable challenges for the past few years. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a halted economy with struggling supply chains and the necessity for additional currency to be issued by central banks.  
As a result of the struggling economy, as well as the efforts of governments to stabilize it through printing additional currency, the reported inflation levels have now surpassed 7%, setting new heights that are even above the financial crisis in 2007-2008 and most recent US recessions. The last Federal Reserve Board (FED) meeting has concluded that a series of raises of the interest rates are necessary to fight the inflation levels.

personalfinance,To buy or not to buy an investment property in New Zealand,"Hi, I’m just wanting some opinions on what I should do as I’ve been stuck for a couple weeks on this.

Long story short: was very lucky to inherit money ($162k) from my nan. I currently own a house. My current mortgage is $600k, with $925/ week repayments. 

Should I either: 

1. pay down the mortgage or;

2. buy an investment property?

If 1, I would also increase my repayments to $1250/week as I’m saving an additional $900/week after mortgage and food, general life etc (all) costs. This would bring my mortgage down to 8 years left and save $340,000 interest according to ANZ mortgage calculator.

If 2, my mortgage broker said to look for homes in the 450-500k mark to not be overly negatively geared. My repayments would be $450-500/week at the current 6% ish interest rates.

I’d like to pick the option where it’s best in the long term financially as I’m in my mid 20’s still. 

My worry about 1 is that I’ll miss out on potential capital gain as property market is lower at the moment. And that if I wait I’ll have to borrow more when I do buy an investment property someday.  

My worry about 2 is I would be servicing a larger debt which would cost a lot in interest - maybe more than any capital gain or rent gain? (Currently paying just over 2k/ month on my existing mortgage).

Trying to learn!

Thanks in advance for any help, opinions or advice given!

economy,Why would increasing the interest rate lower inflation?,"Hi. I have a masters degree on economics, but this is something I never managed to understand  


The way I see it  inflation happens when, for a given price level, there is too much money in the economy. This causes an inbalance in supply and demmand (too many people are willing and able to buy stuff at those prices), so prices rise. But when interest rates rise this means that, for a given amount of debt, the government would have to pay more in interest. Doesnt it increase the money supply, therefore creating inflation?  


Sure, if the increase in rates makes people lend money to the government instead of spending on consumption this would push inflation down. But even in this case only temporarily. Because they only would do it because this way they can spend even more on consumption a few years from now.  


And it seems far more likely that, instead of forgoing consumption to lend to the government, people would forgo investment. So what would fall is supply, not demmand. Which increases inflation instead of lowering it",finance,1666176628

personalfinance,Should I buy my family a house?,"Long story short, 

I am in my 30s, currently make $70k a year, live in a town where rents have gone up drastically. My mother, brother (13), and grandmother live together on a fixed income in a place that to be honest is falling apart and should be condemned. After years of hurricanes, the structural integrity of their place is weak, falling apart, and I am afraid it wouldn't sell for more than $10k (it is a trailer). I am starting to feel worse about their situation and want to get them into a better one. I currently rent an apartment that I have been renting for over a year now and have been interested in building equity for myself outside of this. I also have been wanting to get my family into a better situation. 

So I thought, why not finance a house (would be my first time mortgage) and have my family live in it and pay my mortgage down for me while I continue to live where I am. Grandmother makes $1500/mo via social security and my mother makes \~$800/mo via social security as well. I figure, if worse comes to worse, after two or so years, if the market is still baseline, I could sell and get my equity back. 

Typing this out, I realize how absolutely short sighted I sound right now, but I am almost desperate to find them a new living arrangement. I know I wouldn't be able to predict the future or whether home values stay the same or tank in the future. I realize the scenario is there that if there is a housing crash, I am SOL. I can't contribute much for the downpayment either. I realize the interest rates would be high too. My credit score is 750 right now, but I don't think this matters if fed keeps raising interest rates. My only hope is that hope prices start to come down a little bit to offset that raise in interest. I'd be trying to finance something less than $200k, and I have seen that 3 bedroom houses/condos exist in that range for sure in my city. 

Maybe someone can talk some sense into me?",finance,1666181729

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures gave up gains from earlier in the day Wednesday, even after the release of strong quarterly results from Netflix.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 121 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded lower by 0.5% each.
*****
&gt; Netflix shares rallied 13% after the streaming giant posted earnings and revenue that beat estimates as well as strong subscriber growth for the third quarter. Other tech-related names such as Meta, Amazon and Microsoft traded higher in the premarket.
*****
&gt; United Airlines, Intuitive Surgical and Procter &amp; Gamble were among the other names rising in premarket trading after strong quarterly reports.
*****
&gt; The solid start to earnings season comes as many on Wall Street have been resetting their earnings projections lower and investors are worried about a recession. Even though equities have rallied in the first two days of the week, Treasury yields remain high and were climbing on Wednesday, suggesting that recession fears are still intact.
*****
&gt; “On the plus side, corporate earnings season may help investor confidence somewhat, just given current oversold conditions and reduced expectations. That should help equities keep their footing, but until we see 2-year and 10-year yields start to decline we think traders and investors should remain wary of expecting too much from this rally,” said Nick Colas of DataTrek Research.
*****
&gt; Tech earnings will be in full swing next week, but IBM and Tesla are on deck to report Wednesday. Social media firm Snap will report later in the week.
*****
&gt; In economic data, investors are looking forward to housing starts on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve’s so-called Beige Book, the central bank’s report on the current state of economic conditions, will come out as well.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s moves came after another strong day for stocks, with the Dow rallying about 337 points Tuesday and the S&amp;P 500 gaining 1.1%.

personalfinance,Pay mortgage or invest,"I purchased a home with a 2.5% fixed interest rate mortgage of 30 years for a total of 450.000 EUR.

I have also around 500.000 EUR in savings. I was about to pay directly the mortgage and get rid of it. I would pay almost no penalty ( maybe a few thousand EUR ) as the penalty is tight to the interest rate differential between the interest rate of purchase and the current interest rate.

personalfinance,Advice for financing home repairs,"Hello everyone,

My partner and I are relatively new home owners and recently we’ve had to do some costly repairs. In total we’ve paid about 4K out of pocket for various things since the summer.  In addition recently we had to have our foundation repaired  for 10k which I was able to pay half off and finance the other half with no interest until 2024. With all of these expenses I’ve depleted our emergency/general savings fund down to 10k.

Unfortunately yet another thing has popped and it looks like we have a sewer leak somewhere and have to get it isolated. After doing some googling it seems like the potential cost of the sewer line repair could be very costly and it may be due to the foundation repair which is an inherent risk. 

My partner and I bring in about 8500 post tax each month. Our total expenses including our mortgage and utilities, 1 car note, insurance etc come to a total of around 3500. This does not include things like grocery or gas. Including those it may total to 4200. Before all of these expenses we had been trying to build up our savings after buying and furnishing our home but we obviously took a big hit with all of us this. At its highest we had about 20k in saving but now down to 10k. I have a total of 4k in various credit card debt that we have paid down from things like vacations and other random, but poor spending habits. However we were in the process of aggressively paying it down (about 1500-2000k per month as the totals had been more on our credit cards). I think foolishly tried doing both, paying down debt when I couldve put a hold on it and  tried to pay these repairs. 
 
In total we owe 
5k for our foundation
4k spread out over 5 different cards with various interest rates
Bring home 8500
Basic household expenses 4200
 
My question is though what might be the best way to tackle yet another potentially costly home repair, without further eating up credit cards or tapping out our savings? Or do I scorch earth and use my remaining savings. I have good credit and a sizable amount of equity and was thinking about a heloc that would give me about 65k to borrow from after I inquired with my bank. I think its clear I need to cut spending and lock down a better budget but I may need to fix this plumbing issue sooner rather than later and need a way to pay it.",finance,1666189061

I'm currently an international graduate student, and I am supported by my family full time at the moment. I have about $2,000-$3,000 in my checking account at any given time, and receive about $50,000 in annual income.

I'm planning to use the credit card mostly for expenses outside of the US; I'm going on a work trip for my university for over 2 months, and I need a way to pay for things in the foreign country without getting charged with foreign transaction fees. I don't plan on using the card much when I'm back in the US other than maybe for paying for my phone and/or internet bills purely to keep some money going through it so that I may build up my credit. I've never missed a payment for any bills I've had and monitor my checking account every other day.

I tried to apply for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card with a referral from someone who has that very card, however my application was denied. I have done some more research on other cards and it seems like the Capital One Quicksilver Rewards for Students is a good one to get, however I'm concerned with 2 things:

1. Whether or not I would get approved for the card - I don't want to get rejected and have it impact my credit history, especially since I haven't had any so far
2. Whether or not I would be able to get my card on time, my trip is less than a week away and I'd like to have the card expedited if possible. I would've applied for a credit card much sooner, however I had only recently learnt that using a credit card in the foreign country would be more financially beneficial than converting USD. There is a possibility of my roommate FedExing the card to me and having the charge billed to my university, however I'm not sure how secure this is and I'm not sure if my university will reimburse me for this particular expense.

Does anyone have any recommendations on what sort of card I should apply for? I would greatly appreciate any help!",finance,1666194330
CryptoCurrency,What mechanism makes new in Ethereum's proof of stake?,"I've been following crypto off and on since around 2012 or so. I'm familiar with how Bitcoin's ""proof of work"" system operates: the way to make a new Bitcoin relies on brute-forcing an increasingly hard calculation, where the difficulty is meant to scale roughly with Moore's law, preventing ""printing of money"" and anchoring value to a real world commodity (electricity). This has generally held, though it has disadvantages like carbon footprint, grid impact, consistent increase in coin supply, and a coin split every four years that miners have to absorb. 

However, after reading many articles and posts on proof of stake, I still don't understand how new coins get ""minted"" in this system. I've seen posts announcing the news that Ethereum coin supply has decreased overall since the merge to PoS, which I gather is due to a process called burn-off, but I have more questions now than answers. Perhaps some of you know the answers to these ?s:

1. By what mechanism do new Ethereum coins get created? Is it still done by mining? If so how is this mining different than PoW mining?
2. If tomorrow the Ethereum org's leadership decided  to create one million new Ethereum coins, could they simply do so by fiat similar to how the Federal Reserve can decide to print a million new dollars? If so, what mechanism do they use to do this? If not, what mechanism prevents them from doing this?
3. If tomorrow the Ethereum org's leadership decided  to destroy (""burn"") one million Ethereum, can they just do it by fiat, or is there some process they have to go through? If so, what mechanism do they use to do this? If not, what mechanism prevents them from doing this?
4. Suppose a three-letter agency tries to use USD to collect a majority stake in Ethereum amongst their blackshell corporations. Then lets say they use their majority to subtly manipulate the system—not enough to get noticed, but enough to steer some target trends. What could they accomplish with such a method that could not also be accomplished through setting up enough Bitcoin mining operations to control the majority of that network?

personalfinance,Should I realize a $2000 (15% ) loss on my investments to clear remaining debt?,"Hi everyone. I have a total of 10 federal student loans totaling approximately $29,000 that will go into repayment in January. The interest rates are anywhere between 4.5% and 6.5% depending on the loan. Monthly payment will be approximately $400 which I can easily absorb, but I want to pay everything off ASAP and get my net worth back in the green.

With the current proposition of $10,000 in forgivness, the total balance comes down to only $19,000. I have $10,000 in a savings account that I was preparing to lump sum and knock out two $5,000 loans before interest kicked in, but the deadline for repayment kept getting pushed, so I held on to the cash.

This leaves a total balance of $9,000 that I'd be left with after that's all said and done. I maxed out my Roth IRA in a lump sum for 2022 in January (lol) and had some other cash left over, so I just decided to toss it into a taxable brokerage at Schwab (80/20 $VTI and $VXUS). The initial balance is down almost $2000, but as it stands, it's enough to cover my remaining student loan balance and make me completely debt free.

Would you realize this loss if it meant completely wiping out that student loan balance? I'm tempted to do so in order to max out my work's Roth 401(k) for 2023, which I probably couldn't swing with this student loan payment on my shoulders.

First, I want to explain that I don't need warnings about the risks of not being converted.

## Comment Regarding Goldman CEO Solomon

 The billionaire commented on a short video interview with David Solomon, the CEO of investment bank Goldman Sachs  (**GS**) - Get Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (The) Report, on CNBC, which was broadcast the same day. In the clip Solomon says that there is a big chance that the economy will enter a recession.

""I think it's a time to be cautious,"" Solomon said. ""And I think that if you're running a risk-based business, it's a time to think more cautiously about your risk box, your risk appetite. I think you have to expect that there's more volatility on the horizon.""

The banker added: ""Now, that doesn't mean for sure that we have a really difficult economic scenario, but in the distribution of outcomes, there's good chance we could have a recession.""

The economy's health is currently a subject of concern to markets, households and politicians alike, particularly as the U.S. midterm elections are just weeks away.

Many economists blame the Federal Reserve's monetary policy as one of the causes of the current downturn. The central bank was initially slow to raise its interest rates, thus allowing the prices of goods and products to rise, they say.

When the Fed subsequently pivoted by raising rates, it did so aggressively, in an attempt to crush inflation, which today is at a 40-year high. The problem, the same economists have warned, is that this effort will cause a so-called hard landing in the economy, a recession. 

In addition to Solomon, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase,  (**JPM**) - Get JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Report said on Oct. 10 that the economy would enter a recession ""six to nine months from now.”

More than two-thirds (69%) of Americans are worried about the possibility of a recession by the end of 2023, according to a July survey by personal finance website Bankrate.com.",finance,1666202832

I am a loan officer where my page has significantly worsened due to interest rates, I also entered the business at the best of times two years ago so in February I bought a house having no idea how bad it could get.  Unfortunately I am now losing about $2,000-$3,000 a month.  I am going to find other avenues to try to also have another side job after my 40 hours.

However I am curious what is everyone’s thoughts on personal loans.  I get that you shouldn’t do personal loans if you can’t pay for them however this is why I’m wondering.  I have $15,000 in credit card debt.  About $9,000 in credit cards with high interest rates and another $6,000 in financing for an a/c unit which is 0% APR for three years so I pay $200 a month for that one.

I have total credit limit of $40,000 so I’m afraid I may continue using cards to get by at the moment which may make me eventually be paying more than what I would do with a personal loan to begin with.  At the moment it seems like I can do a personal loan I believe at $520 a month for 5 years.

CryptoCurrency,Cardano Criticisms,"I'll start by saying I used to love Cardano and think it was the future of everything decentralized.  I drank all the kool-aid.  However, as of late, I've started to really get fed up with the project.  Charles is awful. Development is slow. Criticism is lacking within the community. It still has a chance to do something moving forward, but I'm not putting all my eggs in that basket.  Here's a list of criticisms I've found that hold some merit

* Peer-review: If you look at the peer-reviewed papers listed on the IOHK site, you will find that most papers are actually just sent to online repositories which state in the fine print that submissions are not peer reviewed
* Cardano literally has to write Haskell coding libraries from scratch. This slows development dramatically. Additionally, it takes 10+ years to harden a code library, meaning there will be securities concerns on Cardano for years to come.
* Charles has never actually finished a project. He seems to be a serial entrepreneur that gets rich and then moves on.
* Charles acts like he is all for unity, then goes on to trash any project that takes a different approach than Cardano.  He literally highjacked the Ethereum Classic Twitter account and swapped it to ERGO, which has a relationship the Cardano. He is simply filling his own bags.
* Having an active community on github, in reality, means nothing when projects aren't completed. Progress isn't actually made.
* IOHK might be good at science, but they have not shown they are capable of delivering practically useful products
*  In twitter polls, the Cardano community has built bots to game the results.  There are numerous twitter polls that point blank ask ""I am a human"" and ""Cardano"" and Cardano wins by a landslide. 
* Catalyst, their governance model where they award ADA, has 0 follow-through. Some projects were awarded tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ADA, and never delivered on their promises. Basically a marketers dream
* Speed and TX fees are relatively high when compared to other smart contract chains, with the exception of Ethereum. Cardano pushes for global adoption and helping the impoverished, and then charge .17 ADA per TX, which is significantly higher than chains like ALGO, MATIC, AVAX, etc.
* Elitist community, with nothing to show to back up the elitism.

In conclusion, I hope Cardano does deliver on their promises, but the way the project is trending compared to the rest of the market and other platforms, I have  doubts about its longevity.",cryptocurrency,1666215989

Generally a 10y-2y inversion can be seen as a forward indicator of recession where as a 10y-3m inversion suggests recession is likely imminent. Both being inverted has been a very strong recession indicator historically, but my understanding is that the Fed watches the 10y-3m specifically to gauge the health of the US economy.

I don't think this is signalling anything we don't already know but it does perhaps suggest the bond market now sees the possibility of a soft-landing as very unlikely.

stocks,Here's what the Wells Fargo cross-selling scandal means for the bank's growth,"Wells Fargo is one of the oldest and most powerful banks in the United States. Its reputation today is in tatters, following a notorious scandal that is still unfolding.  


Reports of fraudulent activity in Wells Fargo's sales department first surfaced in 2013. The bank opened at least 3.5 million fraudulent accounts for unwitting customers, according to researchers at the [Harvard Business School](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=58343). This and other issues have led the government to fine the bank repeatedly.  


Regulators for [banking](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/wells-fargo-hit-with-another-fine-but-also-says-cfpb-order-from-2016-sales-practices-has-ended.html), [consumer protection](https://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-cfpb/wells-fargo-says-u-s-consumer-watchdog-has-opened-new-probe-on-mishandling-of-accounts-idUSL1N2MT2XU), [trading](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-85), and [workplace safety](https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/09012022) continue to keep a close watch on Wells Fargo. The bank says it's working to comply with a barrage of consent orders issued by the government dating back to 2016. In addition to fines, Wells Fargo has faced a cap on its assets, issued by the Federal Reserve in 2018.  


""We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an unprecedented asset cap that will stay in place until the firm has fixed its problems,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters at a press conference in late 2021.  


The issues at Wells Fargo are still unfolding. In September hearings before the House and Senate banking committees, lawmakers singled out Wells Fargo's newest CEO, Charles Scharf, for his company's corporate governance issues. Scharf, a protege of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, said he was brought in to make substantial changes at the bank. ""Seventy percent of our company's operating committee is new from when I joined,"" Scharf said in his [second day of hearings](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/22/watch-jamie-dimon-and-other-bank-ceos-get-grilled-by-congress-in-second-day-of-hearings.html).  


Experts said the government has wide authority to limit Wells Fargo, given the reputation senior management has earned for imposing demanding business goals on its workforce. These lofty goals may have led employees to engage in deceitful and at times allegedly illegal behavior.  


""The fact that a large institution of such importance was nevertheless able to engage in fraud and effectively illegal transactions on such a scale — that is staggering,"" said Saule T. Omarova, a professor at Cornell Law School.

In a statement to CNBC, Wells Fargo said the bank is revising its management, risk and control frameworks while changing the company's culture and policies. ""\[T\]here's more work we must do to rebuild trust, and we are committed to doing that work,"" the bank said.",finance,1666232207
vet,"Help please, dog with diabetes and cancer throws up everything she eats.","We've had Doll for about 5 years now and we're told she's around 8. She was given to us by a neighbor who couldn't keep her, we believe she is a border collie+Pitbull mix but we're unsure.

Then she developed a tumor in one of her nipples, after saving for a long time we got the tumor removed and she recovered pretty quickly.

I decided to buy the house and I’m the process of competing paperwork to assume the mortgage. I agreed to pay my sisters for their share of the house and to put the deed in my name only. 

With the money my mom left me, I have enough to pay my sisters completely, but I’m wondering if I should to that. After I pay my sisters, I’ll have at least $30k left over. I guess I can just put that into savings. 

My question is: should I pay my sisters outright (no gift tax in my state) or should I take out a personal loan and pay it out over three years with a 7.5% interest rate? 

Part of the money is in an inherited IRA, but I have to withdraw it within ten years, and withdrawing all $50k from the IRA will not put me in new tax bracket for 2023 - so I think there are no problems there.

personalfinance,Take An ARM loan now and Refinance Later? Looking to buy a Home.,"I've been looking to buy a home in NYC / LI area. I've been hearing stories about how home prices are ""plummeting"", but I feel like this doesn't apply to NYC for some reason. Home prices are still really high here and doesn't look like there any signs of home prices falling anytime soon. If it does, then the home's been on the market for more than 2-3 months and probably undesirable in the first place.


Recently I found a very nice property and I definitely would love to buy it. When I go to put in my offer, the agent tells me that someone else had a better offer and they went with theirs. Fastforward a week later and the home is back on market. 

My agent tells me that the owner is missing a Certificate of occupancy and that the original buyers were looking to sell their home and then purchase the property which is why they decided not to as they don't know when the CO would actually come in the mail and how long they'd have to wait before moving. One of the lenders I spoke with told me they'd charge me 9% interest rate if I want the property without a CO. 

My other lender tells me that if I'm serious on purchasing the property I should take an 5/1 ARM Loan now because the rates are at 5.25% and then refinance later on when 30 Yr Interest rates are better. I'm just wondering if this is a good idea. This is my first time buying a home so I'm not really sure what to do nor am I the most financially smart. The home is selling for 825k and the sellers don't seem to want to budge for that price. Interest rates for a 30 yr were 6.25% when I originally put the offer in. 

I was thinking of waiting and giving up on buying A Home this year because I've been searching for all year and starting to feel a bit burnt out. Buying a home early in the year was possible because of the low interest rates, but now that rates have gotten pretty high at 7.08% as of writing and I'm forseeing another increase, paying more every month isn't my ideal which is why i'm debating on the ARM option. 

The only problem with the ARM option is I hear a lot of bad things about it and that it's a high-risk gamble. I don't know anything about refinancing either other than just paying a new loan.",finance,1666238520

economy,What is your approach to outperforming inflation?,"Let’s take a look at different ways people are making money out of inflation.

**Hold Real Assets**

Last year, when the economy was on the brink of collapse, the fed decided to throw trillions of dollars into the economy to prevent a depression by distributing stimulus checks and buying corporate bonds. 22% of US dollars that are in the market currently have been printed in 2020. Anyone with a basic degree in economics understood that inflation is on its way.

That’s why whoever could afford a house back then immediately invested in real estate instead of holding cash, especially since interest rates were at their lowest point. It doesn’t matter what’s the real rate of inflation, whether it’s 2.4% or 3.4%. Because house prices grew by 15% and by some estimates even by 18% to 20%.

This means real estate investors didn’t just beat inflation but rather also profited enormously. But the smartest investor didn’t just buy houses but took mortgages because leverage turns good deals into great deals, especially since interest rates were at rock bottom.

**Gold**

What makes gold unique is that it has always been that asset that preserves wealth, especially during crises. Here it works. The moment the future seems unpredictable, gold prices rise.

In 2007, gold prices rose from around 600 dollars to 1K dollars because of the 2008 crash. Investors panicked and immediately started buying gold. The US dollar might lose its value and even become worthless one day but not the gold.

While the US dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 100 years, gold has kept its value since the beginning of civilization.

But I am not a big fan of gold because it’s a passive asset. It just sits there and shines while stocks or real estate produces something like rental income. It’s an active asset that actually provides a service or a product. Why do stocks keep rising? Because the companies behind them keep growing.

**Crypto**

I was skeptical about including it in this list. However, since a lot of people have profited from inflation by buying crypto including myself, I have to talk about it, but it’s very risky.

After buying stocks, and houses, investors were like, bitcoin is like digital gold, so let’s buy bitcoin as well. A lot of people who were not interested in bitcoin prior to the pandemic don’t really remember that the price of bitcoin was just around 8K dollars. While I continue to hold my crypto assets, I try to use all kinds of staking options to generate passive income like [7% APY on my Bitcoin and 8% on Ethereum](https://midas.investments/). I see crypto as a good option for long-term investing but like I said, it's quite risky one.

**Stocks**

This is my favorite option. Stock prices might not have risen as much as crypto by a few thousand percent, but they are much more stable and less risky. From July 2020 to July 2021, the S&amp;P 500 grew by 40%. That’s an astronomical return, especially since you are investing in the entire US economy.

The money is usually spent on basic needs and wants, which means businesses grow faster, so you are not just beating inflation but rather profiting from it. Just imagine for a moment how much of that stimulus checks were spent on amazon or apple products. If you also count the fact that, these companies have taken billions of dollars in loans for almost free and grew exponentially.

And now people are getting back to work, the economy is reopening, people are spending more, and these businesses are about to grow even faster. The key is to keep your money invested in assets that are hedged against inflation.",finance,1666257747

economy,Fed securities roll off,"Balance sheet normalization is a form of monetary tightening and will be achieved by letting maturing bonds  “rolloff” the Fed's balance sheet without being reinvested. As bonds  mature, the money the Fed receives as principal payments is removed from  the economy, shrinking the money supply

The Fed isn't auctioning off its portfolio; it will allow bonds to “roll off,” meaning that instead of reinvesting the proceeds of bonds as they mature, the Fed will pocket $10 billion worth of maturing bonds monthly, according to Bloomberg.

If QT was actually remotely doable at an effective level, if they could  slurp up a trillion in liquidity over a few months, then yeah they'd  crash the economy with no survivors but the way they do it with just  letting securities roll off their balance sheet while slowing the  purchase of bonds is so ineffective that its basically nothing

*****
&gt; Stock futures were mixed on Thursday as traders weighed several key earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 93 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures ticked up 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Several strong earnings reports were boosting the market, with AT&amp;T, American Airlines and IBM all moving higher in premarket trading after beating estimates on the top and bottom lines for their most recent quarter.
*****
&gt; On the downside, Tesla shares dropped 4% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle maker said Wednesday evening it expects to miss its 2022 deliveries target. The company also posted a quarterly revenue that missed analyst expectations.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 4.18% on Thursday, briefly trading at levels not seen since 2008. It was last flat for the session near 4.13%. Rising rates have been a headwind for stocks all year, as the Federal Reserve continues to try and cool off inflationary pressures not seen in decades.
*****
&gt; The surge in yields on Thursday contributed to the end of a two-day winning streak for stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite sliding 0.85%. The Dow declined 99.99 points, or 0.33%, and the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.67%.
*****
&gt; “Despite recent market volatility, central bank tightening expectations have only increased as inflation
readings around the world have continued to come in hot. While there are bound to be more big up &amp;
down days ahead, our intermediate-term bearish base case remains unchanged,” Chris Senyek of Wolfe Research said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey and the weekly jobless claims data are expected Thursday before the bell.

personalfinance,"Is this right? TurboTax says I owe almost $4,000 in taxes when my AGI was only $30,700","Hi all. Sorry I’m advance for the lengthy post. Not sure if this is the right forum for this questions but anyways, here we go. 

My husband and I filed our taxes jointly in March of this year. We received a pretty decent refund of a few thousand dollars, which was because I only received one stimulus payment during the pandemic and my husband never received any.

Flash forward to July of this year, we realized we forgot one of my husband’s W2s so we filed an amended tax return and received an additional refund of $85.

Now it’s October and we realized we missed something else: a 1099-c (cancellation of debt) from canceled credit card debt from Navy Fed that my husband settled at the beginning of last year. So yesterday I filed another amended tax return through TurboTax and the tool estimated we will owe $3,746.

Initially, our AGI on our original return was  about $24,100 since we were both students last year with part time jobs. After adding in the roughly $1,100 from my husband’s forgotten W2 and the $5,500 of canceled debt from the 1099-c, it brings our AGI up to about $30,700.

So my question is, given our income of $30,700 for 2021, does owing $3,746 sound right? I thought you only paid tax on any money you earned above the standard deduction, which is $25,100 for married couples filing jointly. This would mean we would owe taxes on $5,600 (30,700-25100= 5600). At the tax rate of 12% for our bracket, I predicted our tax bill at $672 (5600x.12=672). Did I miscalculate somehow or is TurboTax overestimating?

TL;DR Filed jointly with my husband + had to amend 2021 taxes twice due to forgotten W2 and 1099-c. Income went from $24,100 to $30,700. TurboTax says we will owe $3,746 now. Does this seem accurate?

I am a teacher and my husband is a federal employee. We have one child. I am pregnant with a 2023 due date (C-Section). Since getting married, we blindly assumed that my BCBS plan was better. Now, with open enrollment around the corner, I'm not so sure.

*My Plan*

* $4000 a year in premiums.
* $2000 deductible, $7,500 OOP limit.
* Most medical events have a 10% coinsurance.
* For pregnancy, the ""example cost estimator"" estimates $2,270.

*His Plan*

* $6,186 a year in premiums.
* No deductible, $13,000 OOP limit.
* Most medical events have a flat fee.
* For pregnancy, the ""example cost estimator"" estimates $260.

*Health Care Spending*

* 2022 (thus far): $1450.
* 2021: $1660.
* 2020 (includes birth of child): $2500-$3000 (I can't see older claims).

As I understand it, then, switching to his plan makes sense if we expect our 2023 health care costs to be more than \~$2000 (accounting for difference in premiums/deductible) and not sky high (accounting for difference in OOP limit). With my C-Section, it appears we should switch, but maybe I'm missing something.

I have one family member thats advised that after the $20,000 federal loan forgiveness that's coming in the near future, I can use my available savings to knock out the rest of the loans and be debt free. 

My other family member advised me that since the interest is relatively low (1-5%) on my student loans, that I shouldnt use all of my savings to knock them out. Instead, he says I should use the saving as a bigger down payment towards my car to reduce a possible higher interest on a car loan.

investing,Atkore Inc. ($ATKR) An attractive prospect for the future of Green Energy and Infrastructure,"Hi everyone! I wrote some DD on Atkore Inc. together with [u/captnamurica2](https://www.reddit.com/u/captnamurica2/)

**Intro**

* Atkore is a leading manufacturer of electrical products and safety products. Their product lines include electrical power systems, conduit, cable, installation accessories, metal framing, mechanical pipe, and perimeter security.
* Atkore holds leading positions within the market. Most of their products are number 1 or 2 in their specific business.
* Atkore supports its long-term growth by aggressively acquiring businesses, which helps with further product diversification.
* Atkore has a strong economic moat
* Continued investment in electrification of infrastructure and an increase in renewable energy infrastructure will benefit ATKR significantly.

**The Numbers**

* ATKR has a decent revenue 3-year annual growth rate of 15.2%.
* ATKR has an impressive ROIC of 95%, indicating that each $100 invested in the business results in an additional $95 of operating income.
* ATKR has an impressive gross margin of 41%, indicating that it has strong pricing power.
* ATKR has a solid FCF of 12.89%, which indicates that the company could buy itself back in about 8 years.
* Forward PE: At the current valuation ATKR has a forward PE of 4.19.

**Split up into two segments:**

In 2021 they split their company into two segments to focus on growing the value of each segment individually and have kept with that model since.

* **Electrical Segment:** Metal electrical conduit and fittings, plastic pipe and conduit, electrical cable and flexible conduit, and international cable management systems, which are critical components of the electrical infrastructure for new construction and maintenance, MR&amp;R markets  

   * **Competitors in this segment**: ABB Ltd., Eaton Corporation plc, nVent Electric plc, Hubbell Incorporated, Zekelman Industries, Inc., Nucor Corporation, Southwire Company, LLC, and Encore Wire Corporation plc
* **Safety and Infrastructure Segment:** Mechanical pipe, metal framing and fittings, and perimeter security. Their metal framing products are used in the installation of electrical systems and various support structures, and their mechanical tube products can commonly be found in solar applications  

   * **Competitors in this segment:** Zekelman Industries Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, ABB Ltd. and Haydon Corporation

**Foreign Exchange Risk and Customer Diversification**

Due to the massive changes in foreign exchange rates over the past couple of years, we figured it would be on your mind how vulnerable this stock is to changes in these rates. Currently, this is more important than ever in a time when Morgan Stanley estimates at least 10% earnings decline in the S&amp;P 500 due to exchange rate issues.

Furthermore, Atkore had an average of 89% customer concentration in the United States in the 2019-2021, which indicates that there isn’t much foreign exchange risk. Unfortunately, there is still some risk involved. Especially due to the dollars havoc on the global economy. Almost every single foreign buyer that Atkore deals with has currency that has sunk against the dollar. In addition, on the foreign exchange front, all suppliers are in North America, as well as most manufacturing is done in the US. Taking all of this in consideration, there is more than likely no foreign exchange advantage to this business, and possibly minor impact due to a small part of sales being dealt in other currencies.

**Strategies and Economic Headwinds**

According to their 2021 annual report (2022 ends this quarter so expect another annual report soon), they live and die by nonresidential construction. This also means that they live and die basically by United States GDP.

Now we might not be geniuses but, those 2 things sound like they are literally right around the corner so it sounds like Atkore might be up the creek without a paddle. The good news for us is, and let’s take a second look at that segments list again and we see that we are looking at a company who specializes in infrastructure, more specific, electric infrastructure. Now, this sounds like something very similar to the “Inflation Reduction Act”, which has specific plans for electric infrastructure (how else are we supposed to support all those EVs that we can’t support). This is where we get some lucky news!

Check out these comments from CEO Bill Waltz on the Q3 conference call:

""Yeah, it's definitely a great question, Victor. The infrastructure bill is going to absolutely help. I forgot the exact number, but I want to say there's $50 million, $60 billion of the $ 1.2-year marking exactly to putting fiber optical lines in across the country.

So as mentioned earlier, we've had outside consultants look at it and estimate the current capacity of the industry and how much should be needed over the next five to seven years to meet demand just of the infrastructure bill itself and it is very promising""

Now, this isn’t the clearest transcript of all time, but it sounds like our market leader in electric infrastructure and specifically fiber optic lines will have a great chance to capitalize on this “free money”. Furthermore, there is plenty of renewable energy infrastructure planning, which will lead to more spending in areas that they can capitalize on. In addition, this might stabilize some of the volume reduction and margin compression that should be expected leading into the future. The company stated in its Q3 report that they expect EBITDA to decline from $1200-$1300 for 2022 to $800-$900 for 2023. Clearly, management expects higher than that.

**Valuation**

Atkore originally popped up on our radar around the end of September (when it was in its early $70 range) and we just didn’t take the time to look into it until now, almost a month later, and boy was it a costly month. Meanwhile, the stock has ballooned close to 25%. As a market leader and decent margin candidate, we believe that it’s a pretty safe assumption (especially with the current management's ability to allocate capital) to give a longer-than-usual time horizon with a decent amount of growth. We also took a look at the normalized earnings to accommodate for an expected margin crunch. This would give them a 2023 EBIT of around $450 million (this is a safe estimate). By normalizing their earnings and giving them a slightly above-average growth rate. This can be justified due to a further increase in expected demand over the decade.

In addition, the company has a great management team. We believe a multiple around 12-15 is reasonable. Furthermore, their stock buybacks for the rest of the year will likely reduce the share amount to 41.5 million shares. This gives an approximate intrinsic value of around $120-$131/s. We believe this to be a relatively conservative estimate but at the current share price it isn’t a 100-bagger by any means we believe this to be a fairly decent investment deserving of a much higher-than-normal multiple.

**Capital Allocation and Management**

Atkore’s management has performed impeccably over the last 3 years. This is shown in their income statement over the last 3 years as well as a booming balance sheet due to a restructuring of loans in 2021 due to low interest rates and beautiful M&amp;A allocation that is already paying for itself.

ROIC for 2021 and 2020 respectively was 95% and 46% (no small feat). In addition, a 10% increase in EBITDA from IPO (which was in 2016) until covid. Safe to say that this management and Bill Waltz know exactly what they’re doing, and we haven’t even gotten to the best news yet. There has been $500 million worth of share buybacks and we expect this to continue in the future. Furthermore, they plan to do over $1 billion in acquisitions ($250 million thus far) and share buybacks (over 25% of their current market cap!). In our opinion, this sounds like a very exciting opportunity for a company that currently has a market cap of $3.76B.

“Mr. Waltz has served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Atkore since 2018. Prior to that, he served in several other Company executive roles, including Chief Operating Officer and Group President of its electrical business. From 2009 until joining Atkore in 2013, Mr. Waltz was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Strategic Materials, Inc., North America’s largest glass recycling company.

Mr. Johnson joined Atkore in August 2018 with more than 29 years’ of experience in strategic and financial planning, risk assessment, mergers &amp; acquisitions, global tax strategies, international operations, and internal controls. Most recently, Mr. Johnson was Vice President-Finance &amp; Operations for the Electrical Sector business at Eaton Corporation, where he was responsible for sector financial planning, analysis, and reporting; compliance, credit &amp; collections, government accounting as well as global purchasing, manufacturing strategies, logistics and distribution.”

**Insider Purchases**

Unfortunately, there haven’t been any insider purchases recently. We would like to see some insider action as this would further strengthen our thesis. As we know, insiders can sell for many reasons, but they only buy stock for one reason.

**The Charts**

ATKR currently has a YTD bottom of around $70.52. This is an important support to watch. If the market continues to deteriorate, we could see the price drop below this level. This would mean more downside is possible.

We can see the stock is falling together with the market as it is currently down close to 30% since its ATH in June of this year, which is similar to the SPX. Currently, we are fighting the $89 resistance, which is getting rejected. Ideally, we would like to see the stock stay above the crucial $70.52 support. We believe the stock provides a very enticing opportunity around that $70 support level.

Now let’s have a look at the long-term chart. We can clearly see the stock is having a rough time. The stock has fallen close to 30% since its all-time high, as we mentioned above. As the company only IPO’d in 2016, we don’t have that much technical data yet.

Atkore does have a strong business as we discussed in this article. Atkore is well-positioned in an industry, which will continue to grow in the future. Furthermore, the share buybacks will provide a cushion for the stock price in the next year. Although, the company will certainly struggle due to current macroeconomic headwinds, we believe this company is one to keep an eye on for the long term. We would like the stock to break above the current $89 resistance level, which has proven to be a tough nut to crack. If we break above, the $99 level seems likely.

**Conclusion**

We believe Atkore Inc. is a must-watch if it declines further as we believe this company is well-positioned to gain tremendously from further investments in infrastructure and green energy in the upcoming years.

We believe the share buybacks and further acquisitions will provide the stock price with a nice safety cushion. In addition, if management is able to continue their performance of the past, we believe ATKR is a rather safe investment with a lot of growth ahead.

I would love to hear some opinions on this DD.

investing,Trying to understand yield on specific bonds,"I'm trying to figure out the best bonds to purchase to park my excess capital for short term.  I'm sitting on quite a bit of cash, I do DCA about twice a month but in smaller chunks and at the rate I'm going, it'll be a while before I'm fully invested (if I ever even get to that point).  So in the meantime, I'm looking at parking my excess capitol into short term bonds, probably the 1-3 month range, and plan to keep rolling that.  

Anyhow, I'm having a hard time understanding the true yield for return since there are so many metrics \[yield to worst, yield to maturity, coupon rate, etc.\].  From my understanding, the coupon rate would be the interest rate paid at specific intervals.....however some of these bonds have 0% coupon rates, so I'm not understanding where the yield would come from.  Those same 0% coupon rate bills show a lets say 2.8% yield to maturity.  So my assumption would be that if I hold that bill to maturity, I should net 2.8% right? But then what is the purpose of the yield to worst? And then there's the offer price which the bill is bought at.  If I pay under the $100 which bills try to aim for (lets say $98.9), I understand I'm buying at a discount, but does that mean when the bill matures, I am paid out the principal amount at $100 and pocketing the difference?  

My broker has a fixed income calculator, which allows you to enter the CUSIP# and it tells you what your expected profit is.  But on these 0% coupon rate bills, it actually shows me losing money (due to fees) and not gaining any returns.  I mean what's the point of even buying that bill if that's the case, something either seems off about that or I'm not understanding it properly.",finance,1666294539

At 23 years old I found out I was having a child and bought a house, owned a new truck, and a new Harley. Upon having my child, I became more interested in ""long term success"" and not blowing my money, however I was tied to those monthly payments.   


At 26, I started my own business and took quite the paycut. The business grew rapidly the first (4) years, however I paid myself minimal to continuously reinvest and hire on employees. Due to paying myself minimal (just enough to cover my bills), I didn't have any money saved up at the age of 30.

I sold my house last January and pocketed about $50k. At the time I figured it would give me a ""cushion"" and I would explore buying a house 1-2 years later.

personalfinance,Taking an emergency personal loan with 600 credit score.,"As the title states… 

I’m in my mid-20s, making $60,000/yearly from working pt and disability pay. 

Long story short, about 5 years ago, I locked myself in my house and didn’t leave for about a year and a half, nor did I take care of any finances.

The only thing that got me out was a 3 month hospitalization, and moving back to my home city once the military decided to discharge me with a 100% disability rating. 

Since then, I’ve paid off about $25k credit card and personal loan debt, and I have about $4,000 to go, with a $250/month car loan and $2,000/rent trying to pay off my credit cards as fast as I can since I got my job. 

Unfortunately, there’s been an emergency and I have to take out a $6,000 loan that I need by tomorrow. I currently have $10 in my bank account after spending the $4,000 I had in my savings and checking on this emergency. 

Due to my bad credit history, it’s been near impossible to get a loan by any of the banks I’m associated with (Navy Federal, Chase and my small, local credit union I’ve been with my entire life). 


So I took to Credit Karma, and the only loans I’ve had offered were about 35% interest, $210 for 60 months by OneMain Financial. The “interests and fees” are $6,600 alone for a $6,000 loan.

I guess my question is, as someone who is obviously financially illiterate and at this point hanging on by a thread, is there anything I need to look out for before I take this loan? I’m also a little confused how a $6k loan, 35% interest rate for 60 months ends up = $12,600. 


It has “no early payment penalty fee”. Does that mean, if I pay off my loan by February, I’d just be paying for the interest accumulated by then?

edit: Just to clear up any concerns, the $4,000 was to cover a weekend-long hospital stay + CT scan for my dog, where they discovered a mass in her small intestine. 

They quoted me $15,000 for her surgery + recovery, while a local surgical center quoted me between $4-6k for it. I took her home, we tried medical management for a couple weeks, and while she did great, her condition wasn’t improving. Her quality of life is still there, she’s playing and eating and she’s otherwise healthy. Unfortunately, the mass is a ticking time bomb, and we won’t know what it is until they go in and take a look. 

I totally get the concern for going into crippling debt for a mutt, but to be honest, she’s fairly young, she’s still playing even now, and she saved me. Another 6 years with her is worth $10k. Unfortunately I did not qualify for CareCredit, so now I’m just going forth with trying to find the best way to pay for her surgery.

2nd edit:
I was able to borrow the money from a family member to have the surgery. Unfortunately, they found an aggressive spread of what was likely lymphoma. My dog is gone. 

I get that it was a lot of money and I lost my dog anyways. But in 2 years, I’m not going to regret spending the money. I would have regretted not trying. She was worth it. I love that mutt so much. I don’t know what I’m going to do.",finance,1666309330

My question is, since I bonds are at 9.68% until the end of the month, and then locked in for 6 months, and adjusting for inflation after that, would it make sense to park 10k in I bonds before the end of the month to earn back and offset some of the interest we’re paying on our balance? We would cash them out in 12 months and put all proceeds back into the HELOC. Would appreciate thoughts on how to minimize the impact of the prime rate increase and safely use the money to increase our financial security if possible.",finance,1666309462
personalfinance,I'm thinking about aggressively paying my credit card off. Also want to raise credit score. Is this a good idea?,"So, I have one single credit card that I maxed out and I'm officially in debt. To be more specific, it's about $5,000 worth and it's destroying my credit just making the minimum payments. My credit card is through Discover and after speaking with them, we worked out a plan to lower my interest rate by 9.5% as well as putting me on a payment plan for a year where my minimum payments are lowered without accruing interest.

The issue that I've ran into now is that my credit score went to shit. Before I maxed out my credit card, I had an excellent score (I was a few points away from having an 800). Now? It lowered to the mid 600s which I felt I could recover from, but my score has now went to the pits of hell. Because I paid my credit card payment late, my score dropped 174 points leaving me with an abysmal score and I burst into tears.

I've come up with a solution that is quite aggressive, but if I plan well enough and stay disciplined, I think I could pay my credit card off in about 3-4 months.

To do that, I'd use one paycheck for bills and making a large payment on this credit card and the other paycheck would go toward rent, savings, and a little play money (if possible).

To provide more context, I'm bringing home almost $4K every month, but my take home salary is going to decrease in the new year because of new benefits I've enrolled in, so I'll be bringing home a little over 3.5K monthly.

It's aggressive and requires a lot of discipline on my end, but I want to know, do y'all think this is a good idea? I'm open to any opinions and tips.",finance,1666311011

**BLUF:** Need advice on what to do with cash, how to invest, good financial strategies in our current market given our situation.

**Current Focus:** Trying to pay off 30yr mortgage by 2026 (15 years from purchase). I realize many people would rather invest than payoff a loan, esp. with rising interest rates and our locked in relatively low rate. Personally, we prefer to eliminate the stress of the debt and payoff the loan.

**Deficiencies:** We got a late start and are under-invested for our ages and want to fix that.

stocks,10-year Treasury yield tops 4.2% for first time since 2008,"Treasury yields rose again on Thursday, continuing to climb into territory not seen in more than a decade.

The benchmark [10-year Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y/) yield climbed 10 basis points 4.23%, at one point hitting 4.239% for its highest level since 2008. The yield on the policy-sensitive [2-year Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US2Y/) traded up five basis points to 4.608%.

Yields and prices move in opposite directions and one basis point equals 0.01%.

""I think 4% was reasonable,"" said Wells Fargo's Michael Schumacher. ""4.22% has become unanchored. We don't need the 10-year to act like a meme stock. That is not healthy.""

 

Many investors have been concerned about the economy contracting as the Federal Reserve has been hiking interest rates to fight persistent inflation. Another 75 basis point hike is expected from the central bank at its next meeting on Nov. 1 and 2.

On Thursday, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said that the Fed would continue raising rates.

""Given our frankly disappointing lack of progress on curtailing inflation, I expect we will be well above 4% by the end of the year,"" Harker said.

The 10-year yield moved to new highs after Harker's remarks. Fed funds futures for next May crossed 5% for the first time on Thursday.

On the economic front, initial jobless claims came in at 214,000, below the 230,000 expected by economists according to Dow Jones. However, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index showed a larger than expected decline.

U.S. housing starts and building permits data for September came in below expectations on Wednesday, which investors widely understood as a sign of recession in the housing sector.

personalfinance,Rolling negative equity into a lease.,"Rolling negative equity into a lease

So I know it’s been ask on here quite a bit, but is rolling negative equity into a lease in todays market the optimal way? 

I currently have a 2011 GLK that I signed for at $15k with an absolute shit interest rate(trying to rebuild credit). 
Now there’s nothing wrong with the vehicle but it is a bit on the older side (I should’ve thought about this before signing) and I’m afraid it could give out on me any day. 
So I looked into maybe trading it in for a newer vehicle but it’s now being appraised for $8k-$10k so it’s leaving me with a roughly $6k in negative equity. 
Now I know, typically a person can refinance, workout the interest rate, and be in a better position, but my problem is that the vehicle is over 10 years old. Nearly every bank and credit union that I’ve spoken to won’t refi anything over 10 years or 100k miles! 

So now here I am stuck with this vehicle, which again runs just fine but is a bit older, have a terrible 13% interest rate on it, and am now in negative equity. 
So my question is, would I be better off just rolling the negative equity into a lease? I understand that it’ll make my payments a bit higher but I’ll have a newer vehicle under warrant and hopefully a much better interest rate (MF). 
I know someone on here will say “ just wait until you’re closer to breaking even” or “pay the difference so you won’t be upside down” but what if I do either of those things and the vehicle decides to give out on me? Now I’m stuck with a immobile vehicle and a loan I’ll still have to make payments on. 

Someone please help! I know I’ve put myself in a bit of a tight spot but I’m certain somebody on here can suggest something!

Edit: forgot to mention that I’ve only had this vehicle for 5 months now so not much of the loan has been paid off.",finance,1666318881

I've been reading what feels like everything across the board, marry the house date the interest rate, refinance next time it drops, things will look better in 2023 for housing prices, interest rate may fall in the spring. Or is it most likely just useless and we should look elsewhere? We've been saving and planning the baby/relocation since before covid I just feel so deflated.

personalfinance,"Should we sell our newer 2nd vehicle for the equity, or keep it? The equity could help us buy a house.","My spouse and I are in the position where we have 2 vehicles but only rely on 1 of them, we have a lot of equity in our 2nd vehicle and are considering selling it.

We have a 2019 Honda and a 2014 BMW, the Honda is the car we’re considering selling. We owe $7k on the Honda and got an offer for $25k on it, selling to a dealership. Selling it means we pocket the equity and save on the car payment/insurance for $500/month. The 2019 Honda has an extended warranty for 7 years/100k miles, the 2014 BMW has no warranty.

We’re looking at buying a house, our monthly savings are $1700/month and we plan on saving $30k in the next 18 months to use for down payment, closing costs, furnishings, etc (Hopefully interest rates and prices come down by then). If we sell the 2019 Honda, we have an extra $18k in hand and save an extra $500/month; this means that in 18 months we’d have more than $55k saved. The benefit here is that selling the car means $18k immediately and in 6 months will have that $30k saved; if housing prices/interest rates come down, then in 6 months we’d have the money we needed for a house. This means either buying a house sooner or more purchasing power down the road.

Obviously there’s concerns about the constraints of 1 vehicle and keeping the older vehicle that could break down with out-of-pocket costs to repair. Having 2 vehicles means that if something happens to the 2014 BMW, we can put it by the wayside and solely use the Honda. Additionally, if 1 vehicle was in an accident and was a Total Loss then we don’t have to replace it immediately; going down to 1 vehicle means a Total Loss on that vehicle forces us to buy a replacement car in this car market.

The unique situation we’re in is that the 2019 Honda $25k offer is more than we paid for it new, the vehicle will never again be worth this much. Should we capitalize on this market and take the equity? It seems like a good idea. Is there too much risk going to 1 vehicle? Maybe. Are our concerns about breakdowns or Total Loss unlikely to happen? Probably. Do we stand to be better financially from this? Probably. Should we do it?

stocks,An often-overlooked economic measure is signaling serious trouble ahead,"* **The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators index indicated that conditions worsened in September.**
* **While not usually considered a major data point, the LEI, combined with Fed rate hikes, is signaling trouble for the economy.**
* **“We went from a Fed that was way too easy to being irresponsibly tight,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Capital Markets.**

&amp;#x200B;

The economy sent a low-key signal Thursday that a recession is looming — and that the Federal Reserve could be making a policy mistake by continuing to try to slow things down.

According to the Conference Board’s [Leading Economic Indicators](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators) index, conditions worsened in September, with the gauge down 0.4% from the month before and off 2.8% for the six-month period.

“The US LEI fell again in September and its persistent downward trajectory in recent months suggests a recession is increasingly likely before year end,” said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economics at the Conference Board. Ozyildrim noted that the weakness in the index was “widespread” as high inflation, a decelerating jobs picture and tighter credit conditions are pressuring the economy.

The index looks forward using 10 metrics that include manufacturing hours worked, jobless claims, building permits, stock market indexes and credit spreads.

Normally, the LEI is not considered a major data point. It’s not necessarily that the measure isn’t a good snapshot of the economy, but more that the data points that go into the index are already known, so there’s not much new information.

## A reverse trend for the Fed

However, in the present conditions, the index is of greater significance as it comes at a time when the Federal Reserve is looking to tighten the screws further on growth in an effort to bring down rampant inflation.

That bucks a general historical trend where the Fed is usually loosening policy when the outlook turns darker. However, Fed officials are stressing that they’re far from finished when it comes to raising rates.

“We went from a Fed that was way too easy to being irresponsibly tight,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Capital Markets and a former senior economic advisor to then-President Donald Trump. “When this basket is signaling the weakness that it’s showing, what the Fed typically does is not raise rates. But in this case, it’s not only raising rates aggressively, but with a commitment to continue raising rates aggressively.”

LaVorgna’s research shows that in previous downturns in the leading indicators, the Fed was always cutting rates or in pause at the same time. This was the case in early 2020, the financial crisis in 2008 and the recession in the early part of the 21st century — among multiple other economic contractions.

He is concerned that the Fed’s insistence on tightening policy will have even worse outcomes ahead.

“The lags in the policy mean the full effects of Fed actions have not yet been wholly felt. Worryingly, the Fed is not done,” LaVorgna said in a client note.

LaVorgna is not alone in his belief that the Fed is overdoing its efforts to tamp down inflation that continues to run around its highest levels since the early 1980s.

In a [recent CNBC interview](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/barry-sternlicht-says-unbelievable-calamities-ahead-if-the-fed-keeps-hiking-.html?&amp;amp;qsearchterm=sternlicht%20fed), Starwood Capital Group CEO Barry Sternlicht said the central bank is risking “unbelievable calamities if they keep up their action, and not just here, all over the globe.” [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) CEO David Solomon, [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/) CEO [Jamie Dimon](https://www.cnbc.com/jamie-dimon/) and Amazon founder [Jeff Bezos](https://www.cnbc.com/jeff-bezos/) in recent days [all have expressed concern](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-warns-its-time-to-batten-down-the-hatches.html) about a recession ahead, though they have not singled out the Fed’s actions.

## Disappointment on inflation

However, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Thursday he thinks [the central bank still has work to do](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/20/feds-harker-sees-lack-of-progress-on-inflation-expects-aggressive-rate-hikes-ahead.html) before it can relax as he said he’s seen a “disappointing lack of progress” in the inflation fight.

“What we really need to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening monetary policy,” said the central bank official, who is a nonvoting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.

Thus far, the inflation data indeed has not been on the Fed’s side.

In addition to the typical headline metrics such as the consumer price index and the Fed’s preferred personal consumption expenditures price index, the Cleveland Fed’s [“sticky price” CPI](https://www.atlantafed.org/research/inflationproject/stickyprice) rose 8.5% on an annualized basis in September, up from 7.7% in August. The measure looks at items such as rent, the price of food away from home and recreation costs.

Services inflation has been particularly nagging, rising 7.4% in September on a 12-month basis, up from 6.8% in August, according to Trading Economics. That has happened as the economy has transitioned back to services from high goods demand for much of the Covid era.

Critics, though, say the Fed is following too many backward-looking data points. But policymakers also are fighting a battle against inflation expectations that, [while drifting lower now](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/consumer-inflation-and-spending-expectations-show-sharp-decline-.html), could turn higher especially now that gasoline prices are rising again.

“The challenge for the Fed is we haven’t seen the true leading indicators be leading in the sense that inflation has still stayed persistently elevated in the face of these leading indicators that would suggest otherwise,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial.

In Roach’s view, the only bright spot is that financial markets could be close to pricing in all of the damage from higher rates and inflation. Also, the continued decline in the LEI at least could give the Fed reason to slow the pace of its rate hikes. Roach expects the Fed to hike by another 0.75 percentage point in November, then decelerate to a 0.5-point move in December, which is not the market expectation.

“In a nutshell, this report does not likely change anything for the November meeting,” Roach said. “However, you could argue that this does build a case for a downshift in December.”

stocks,'King Dollar' is making a royal feast of corporate earnings: Morning Brief,"My word-find function has been going into overdrive this earnings season, looking for a few key phrases in earnings-call transcripts: “Foreign exchange.” “Currencies.” “Dollar.”

Netflix ([NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/)) Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann summed it up succinctly in his company’s conference call: “The FX drag is significant.”

The rise of the U.S. dollar, spurred by the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases, among other factors, is triggering quite the knock-on effect to corporate profits. While investors might want to strip out currency impacts to get a better idea of fundamental demand, they should also prepare for these hits to last a while.

In a report this week titled, “King Dollar Has More Room to Gain,” Wells Fargo strategist Erik Nelson cited multiple drivers for continued dollar strength, including the currency’s traditional resilience at times of market stress.

 

 

“The dollar index can continue to rally here,” [Chris Vecchio, senior strategist at DailyFX](https://news.yahoo.com/u-dollar-become-bit-wrecking-135949290.html), told Yahoo Finance Live earlier this week. “To use an old axiom, the dollar remains the nicest house in a bad neighborhood.”

That is, while the U.S. economy may be slowing and even entering a recession, many other global economies are faring worse. In currencies, it’s all relative.

That dollar strength is costing companies. Citi strategists estimate that a 10% bump in the dollar index will cut $15 to $20 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) has rallied more than 17% this year versus a basket of currencies. The greenback is up 14% versus the [euro](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EURUSD=X?p=EURUSD=X&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch), and a whopping 30% against the Japanese [yen](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JPY=X?p=JPY=X&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).

This early earnings season is littered with examples of the ensuing costs. IBM [numbers beat estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ibm-tops-earnings-estimates-even-133748190.html), even as the company said currency translation cost it $1.1 billion last quarter. Netflix’s [operating margin dropped to 19.3% from 23.5% last quarter](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-posts-strong-q3-earnings-132543331.html) — a decline it blamed almost entirely on the dollar’s gain. And Procter and Gamble [will take a $3.9 billion, after-tax hit from currency effects this year](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PG?p=PG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).

Large companies do have the ability to hedge, or offset, the gains in the dollar in various ways, including covering expenses in local currencies. But the dollar’s move has been so big and so rapid this year that even the most seasoned hedgers have had difficulty adjusting.

It’s also tough for corporations to predict the dollar’s move six months to a year to even 18 months ahead, as they would need for hedging, Jefferies Managing Director and Head of Corporate Hedging and FX Solutions Joseph Lewis told Yahoo Finance Live recently: “The hardest part for companies right now to determine is, will this persist? You can take 10 economists — they’ll say slightly different things, have slightly different forecasts. I think that’s been really challenging for my clients; there isn’t a consistency in view.”

So, what are investors to do when it comes to factoring in the effect of the dollar? The bottom line for Citi’s Scott Chronert: “USD relevant for equities but not the main driver,” he wrote in a recent note. Rather, he said, investors should focus on “underlying business trends and conditions.”

Investors have another option, as Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre [pointed out in Wednesday’s Morning Brief](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-wall-street-is-warming-up-to-small-cap-stocks-100019747.html): They can invest in small-cap companies, which generally have less exposure to currency fluctuations than large cap companies.",finance,1666353959

I have a hopefully quick question on loan payment calculations. It might be something I don't understand about compounding? I can reproduce my new monthly loan amount prior to subtracting any payments with

P(1+r/12)

I would've thought it would be

P(1+r)\^(1/12)

I thought that since extending that 12 times to a year gives the actual annual rate.

P(1+r)\^(1/12)(1+r)\^(1/12)...(1+r)\^(1/12) = p(1+r)\^(12\*(1/12)) = p(1+r)

If you extend how the payment is calculated using the first method like I did with the second method, it actually gives a higher effective annual interest rate than I really have.

investing,Am I right in understanding what happened in Britain?,"So, I’m trying to understand why the last PM’s mini-budget triggered a sell-off in U.K. government bonds. Here are the main reasons:

1. Fear of the future insolvency. If someone who owes you money decides to borrow a huge amount of money you will become less certain about the prospect of this someone actually giving you your money back in the future.
2. Fear of the further inflation. When the government decides to borrow there are always fears of the Central bank monetizing the debt in one form or the other (for example, to prevent the rise of the interest rates, as BoE literally just did). Thus, you'd want a higher return which can protect you from inflation and which bonds that you currently hold can’t provide.
3. If the government promises to substantially increase the supply of bonds in the future, it's safe to assume that bond prices will fall in the future. Thus, if you are in the business of trading bonds, you will definitely want to get rid of your bonds while prices are still high.

All of that sparked an initial sell off that then motivated pension funds to sell bonds which exacerbated the crisis.

personalfinance,Sell Car or Loan to Finance IVF?,"Quick overview - my wife and I have one child currently and are trying for number 2. We're now having a hard time conceiving and have already done some fertility treatments ($$$) and will likely be doing more. We've got a few months reserves and don't want to leave ourselves no liquid cushion so exploring options to finance additional treatment. I expect we will need an additional \~$15k for fertility treatments in the next 4 months.

Not anticipating fertility issues, I purchased a new 2022 minivan with a significant down payment last year. Currently has 23k miles and I have trade in offers for $38k on it (paid $39k new). Have \~$21k remaining on the loan at 2.5 percent.

I'm considering selling the van to get something less expensive to use the equity to help fund IVF. I don't want a beater as I want to still have a reliable vehicle that would be big enough for road trips, hauling our stuff around, and hopefully two kids in the future. I'd probably be looking at a used vehicle (couple year old Equinox or similar) around $20-$22k based on what I see available. However, as I think through this, the rates on used cars are currently \~6% so I'm essentially refinancing $21k of debt at 2.5% to 6%, in order to free up $17k cash.

So, the difference in interest would be \~$2,500+ depending on exact terms, duration of loan, etc. In addition, transaction costs of purchasing a new car would be another \~$2k in taxes, doc fees, etc. Running these numbers, it feels like I'm essentially paying \~$4,500 to free up $17k cash (26%). This hurts but maybe that's just the price of learning my lesson not to put a bunch of money down on such a low interest rate.

The alternative would be to just take out a loan at 6-8% for IVF (haven't applied, but these are the rates that I'm seeing), but I don't really like the idea of the additional debt.

personalfinance,Can someone help me understand iBonds and if it's a good choice for me?,"Here is my financial situation.

* Income: I make about $60,000 after taxes.  
* Debt: Currently the only debt I have is a car payment with a 3.29% rate and a mortgage with a 2.625% rate.
* Emergency Fund: I have an income replacement fund setup as a CD ladder. 12 CDs that renew at the beginning of the month. If I were to lose my job, I'd change them to not renew. Each only only has about 60% of my current monthly income, but if I were to lose my job then expenses would be cut way back and it would probably be fine. At some point, I do want to add some to each CD as it renews to bolster it a bit, but I think it's fine for now.
* Check/Savings: Total has about $26,000. A good portion of it is already claimed in my budget for various categories. I use YNAB and budget money towards all my true expenses. Cars need new tires every 5ish years. Household appliances will need to be replaced. We will need a new washer and dryer probably sometime in the next couple of years. Stuff like that. Plus I have about $4,000 set aside for an ""I need money right now emergency"". There is an expression in the YNAB sub called ""YNAB poor"" because you might have a lot of money in your account, but not much you can spend because it's all tied up in your budget and you're planning ahead.

However, out of that $26,000, I currently have $12,000 set aside for some home improvement projects we need to undertake within the next few years. Our house is about 30 years old and the siding on our house needs replaced as does most of the trimming. We also might look into replacing all of our windows with energy efficient windows. We have no idea how much any of this will cost and were planning on looking into getting quotes sometime in the next few months.

But after reading about ibonds, I'm thinking of dumping the maximum of $10,000 into one and waiting at least a year before proceeding. The siding isn't in critical need of being replaced. I assume the maximum is per individual and my wife could purchase an ibond as well?

But I have to admit I know absolutely nothing about bonds or ibonds or what the difference is. I tried reading up on ibonds but got confused. I understand the rate changes every 6 months, but there are 2 interest rates? The money is currently in a HYSA with Ally, earning 2.35%.

To me, it seems like purchasing an ibond is a no-brainer if you have the money. Even if the interest rate were to change to 0% for the second 6 month period, that's still double what the HYSA would earn. The only downside is waiting at least a year before you can get the money back out. It just seems to good to be true. I feel like there is going to be some sort of gotcha or something.

EDIT: Oh, and how is the interest payed out? Is it paid directly to me or can it add to the value of the bond?",finance,1666365704

personalfinance,2.25% 5/6 ARM question - Pay extra or...?,"In April 2021 I made the... ~~foolish~~, ~~stupid,~~ ...questionable decision of getting a 5/6 ARM at 2.25% instead of locking a 30-yr fixed at 2.75%. The rationale behind that decision was that:

1. It is likely / possible that we are going to sell this house in 5 years
2. ARM was about $ 300 cheaper per month (I know...what was I thinking)

Anyway, here we are today: when the interest rate starts adjusting, the rate can go up to 7.25% per contract. My current monthly payment is $ 3,700.00 and it could go up to $ 6,050.00 in 4 years.

I have been paying $ 500.00 extra each month, because I like the idea of shortening the duration of the mortgage and 2.25% guaranteed return sounded reasonable in 2021. What should I do in this market? Additional info on my financial situation:

1. I live in CA, married, family of 4 (5yr old and 1yr old kids). 41 yr old male working in tech
2. Total income: 600k$ (35% marginal federal tax rate + 11.3% marginal CA tax rate)
3. NW \~ 2.5M (including 500k house equity), \~200k liquid. The rest is in RSU (that I can sell twice a year) and retirement accounts

My options:

1. Keep paying the extra $ 500. I could put the extra money in bonds at 4-4.5% but after taxes (46.3%) it still does not make much of a difference - when/if I refinance in 4 years, my total amount financed will be lower
2. Invest in Muni bonds
3. Invest in VTI/VOO

Unfortunately the whole 401k is 100% allocated to a 2020 target date fund which is holding 33% bonds (the rest are big cap equities (27%), international equities (10%), TIPs (12%), and some other small cap equities and government securities for the remainder).

I assume most of this has been driven by the fall in bond prices due to increasing interest rates over the past year, but the stock market falling has also contributed to it.

Since the whole thing is a target date fund, I assume there's no hope of recovery on the bonds. It's not like they can just hold them to maturity and receive the principal back since it's trapped within a target date fund, right?

Just trying to figure out the best course of action here. I don't want them to panic sell at the bottom of the market but I don't know how realistic a recovery in the price of bonds is over the next few years given the Fed's relentless rate hikes.

Let's say I have $110,000 to work with in two bank accounts. I could leave $10,000 in the bank as an emergency fund and then buy ten $10K ibonds.

**Purchasing strategy**

1. I buy one for myself
2. I buy one for my partner
3. partner buys one for herself 
4. partner buys one for me
5. I buy one for my mom
6. partner buys one for her mom
7. partner buys one for her kid
8. I buy one for my dad
9. partner buys one for her dad
10. I buy one for my sister

All ten of these ibonds would be purchased from two of my bank accounts.

**Calculating interest earned**

====================================================

1. Convert the annual rate from a percent to a decimal by dividing by 100:

9.62/100 = 0.0962

6.48/100 = 0.0648

====================================================

2. Now divide that number by 6 to get the monthly interest rate in decimal form for the 6 month periods: 

0.0962/12 = 0.00801666666667

0.0648/12 = 0.0054

====================================================

3. To calculate the monthly interest on $100,000, multiply that number by the total amount: 

0.00801666666667 x $100,000 = ~$801.67 per month (first 6 month period)

first 6 months interest: $4,810.02

0.0054 x $100,000 = $540 per month (second 6 month period)

last 6 months interest: $3,240

total annual interest: $8,050.02

====================================================

*If you withdraw before five years:*

first 6 months interest: $4,810.02  ($801.67*6)

0.0054 x $100,000 = $540 per month (second 6 month period)

next 3 months interest: $1,620 ($540*3)

last 3 months interest: $0

total annual interest: $4810.02 + $1620 = $6430.02 

====================================================

**Cashing ibonds**

I'm not sure how this goes, but I've read on other posts that to cash the ibonds after one year, you select the option on Treasure Direct to have the funds return to the bank account that was used to purchase the ibond. So, if I do all the purchasing of these ten ibonds on the TreasureDirect website, then only I would need to manually initiate the cashing out process for all the ibonds purchased for me, my partner, my mom, my dad, her mom, her dad, her kid and my sister. The funds would just return to the bank account used to purchase them, which would be my account. Is this correct?

I see that TreasureDirect has a new website, so I don't think I need to go over how to purchase ibonds. Hopefully, it will be clear when I attempt to do it today or tomorrow. I think that's it.

So, is everything I described 100% correct here? If not, please clarify below. Thank you!

**Edit #1**:

Can someone please elucidate how taxes would eat into interest earned? For instance, if I am unemployed or have very low income (less than $30K a year), what is the tax calculation that I need to add to the above numbers?

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 24th, 2022","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 24th, 2022.

# **Dow climbs more than 700 points on Friday as Wall Street clinches its best week since June - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/20/nasdaq-100-futures-slide-after-major-averages-register-two-days-of-losses.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks climbed on Friday as Wall Street closed a volatile week on a high note despite some disappointing earnings reports.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 748.97 points, or 2.47%, to close at 31,082.56. The S&amp;P 500 rose 2.37% to 3,752.75. The Nasdaq Composite added 2.31% to 10,859.72.
*****
&gt; Friday’s moves extended the market’s gains for the week. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow gained 4.7% and 4.9%, respectively, while the Nasdaq rose 5.2%. It was the best week since June for all three major averages.
*****
&gt; The advance came despite the 10-year Treasury yield surging to its highest level since 2008 and a mixed bag of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; “I think at the end of last week market’s got a little bit oversold technically. And as we’ve seen so many times in the past, when things get negative enough it becomes some sort of a contrarian indicator for a bounce,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
*****
&gt; “But like every other bounce we’ve had, it hasn’t been very well sustained. ... A bounce today doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to continue into next week. If it does, I suspect it won’t be more than a day or two,” Frederick added.
*****
&gt; Bank stocks were a bright spot on Friday, with Goldman Sachs gaining 4.6% and JPMorgan Chase adding 5.3%.
*****
&gt; Earnings reports limited gains for the market. Dow components American Express and Verizon fell about 1.6% and 4.5%, respectively, after their quarterly reports. In tech, social media company Snap fell 28% after reporting a quarterly revenue of $1.13 billion, below expectations.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields fell from their highs on Friday morning after a report from the Wall Street Journal that some Fed officials are concerned about overtightening with large rate hikes. That report appeared to boost equities as well.
*****
&gt; The central bank’s aggressive rate hikes have been a major factor in stocks falling into a bear market this year, and traders have continued raising their estimates of where the Fed will stop.
*****
&gt; “We really need a Fed pause. Not so much that they would just outright disavow future rate hikes, but that they would just say every meeting is live, and if the data go our way then after the first half of ’23 we don’t have to do more,” said Stifel chief equity strategist Barry Bannister on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.”

&gt; # Price and Breadth Blowout Into the Weekend

&gt; In today's Morning Lineup, we noted the consistency in which the S&amp;P 500 has finished the week with a decline of 1% or larger this year. Today is not looking to add to that count as the index rallies well over 2%, but it would make for the twelfth week this year and third in a row in which the index has gone into the weekend with a move of 2% or more in absolute terms. As shown below, the only years of the past 70 with a comparable number of weeks has been 2000 (11) and 2008 (12).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/102122-AoN-3a.png))**

&gt; In addition to moving over 2% in absolute terms, there has been breadth to boot. The last three Fridays have been ""all or nothing"" days (daily advance-decline reading of +/-400). In total on the year, there have now been 14 weeks to end with an ""all or nothing"" day. No other year since at least 1990 has seen as many with 2011 the closest at 12 weeks. Further, the only other times that there have been similar streaks to the current one were in 2011 and 2016.

&gt; We call it the Best Six Months. And as far as we know it was first discovered and published by Yale Hirsch, our late founder and creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7a56affbdda11e29d7caaf2e132f3b19/cdd4ca5bd512a894-1e/s500x750/1974e868202a632865f4758d96b4a9025e729e03.jpg))**

&gt; This seasonal strategy has been a bonanza for investors, capturing the bulk of the market’s gains that occur from November to April, while avoiding the volatility, penchant for downdrafts and sideways action that tends to materialize in the Worst Six Months May-October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/182d4cb008b1646f313a4f9e78fbe638/cdd4ca5bd512a894-36/s640x960/1262eb5a4177963e503a96f6cdc97aeab5c52229.jpg))**

&gt; It’s been called many things by a laundry list of analysts, managers, and strategists from all corners of the earth – probably outer space as well – and proven by academia in many papers. Just Google it.

&gt; On the 35 Anniversary of the ‘87 Crash, as the bear market searches for bottom in a midterm year October, with negative sentiment and headwinds abounding, we want to make sure you were fully aware the Best Six Months are about to begin on November 1.

&gt; Evidence-based technical analysis and a scientific method back-test found the results to sound, valuable, have predictive power and statistically significant. The seasonality has clear causation, driven by the recurring behavior of institutions around their financial calendars.

&gt; # Sentiment Streaks Press On

&gt; A small equity market bounce over the last week didn't cause any major changes in investor sentiment, at least based on the weekly AAII numbers released this morning. The latest data from AAII showed 22.6% of survey respondents reported as bullish versus 20.4% the week before.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/102022-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment also rose slightly to 56.2% for the highest reading since the end of September when there were back to back weeks of readings above 60%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/102022-Sentiment-2.png))**

 &gt; There is little precedent in the history of the AAII survey for over half of respondents to report as bearish for this many weeks in a row. As shown below, this week marked the fifth in a row that bearish sentiment came in above 50%. That is now the second longest such streak on record behind the seven week long streak in the fall of 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/102022-Sentiment-7.png))**

&gt; Given more than half of responses to the survey have reported bearish sentiment, the bull bear spread continues to show negative readings (meaning bears outnumber bulls). The reading remains at the low end of the past decade's range at -33.6.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/102022-Sentiment-3.png))**

&gt; Similar to five straight weeks of 50%+ bearish sentiment, the streak of weeks with a negative bull-bear spread has grown to become the second longest on record at 29 weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/102022-Sentiment-6.png))**

&gt; Turning to another reading on sentiment—the NAAIM Exposure Index—another notable streak has continued to press on this week. This index measures investment manager exposure to equities with readings ranging from -200 (leveraged short) to +200 (leveraged long) and readings of +/-100 representing responding managers are full long or short. The index has remained below 50 for eight weeks in a row now. That has tied the streak of sub-50 readings in the spring of 2020. Going back through the history of the index dating back to 2006, there have only been seven other periods in which equity exposure by active managers has been as muted for as long of a span as now. In other words, the AAII survey is not alone in showing persistent pessimism.

&gt; # Claims Take A Seasonal Dip

&gt; It was a good week for jobless claims as the seasonally adjusted number fell 12K to 214K versus last week's downward revision to 226K. That compares to forecasts that were expecting claims to rise further to 233K. At current levels, claims remain healthy and within similar levels to the pre-pandemic range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/102022-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims were also lower as might be expected for the current week of the year. Historically, the current week of the year has consistently seen a brief break in the Q4 seasonal uptrend in claims. With that occurring again this year, claims are impressively strong. The only two years in which the comparable week has seen a lower reading in the non-adjusted number were 1969 (155K) and 1968 (151K).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/102022-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; As we highlighted last week, roughly a third of the rise in national claims last week was thanks to Florida which was recently impacted by Hurricane Ian. One week later, claims in that state improved albeit they remain elevated and account for a disproportionally large drag on the national claims number. We would note, that the current hurricane-related spike is similar in size to the fall of 2017 when there was a historically damaging hurricane season (the year of Hurricanes: Harvey, Irma, and Maria).


&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/102022-Claims-2b.png))**

&gt; Turning to continuing claims, which are lagged an additional week to the initial claims number, the picture remains unchanged versus recent months. Claims are historically strong at 1.385 million and much lower than initial claims.

&gt; # Housing Continues to Roll...Over

&gt; The latest update on Housing Starts and Building Permits from the Census Bureau was released this morning, and the results continue to reflect a significant slowdown in the sector. On a y/y basis, both starts and permits saw declines of 7.7% and 3.2%. respectively. The real weakness, however, has been in single-family units where starts are down 18.5% and permits fell 17.3% even as multi-family units were both up by double-digit percentages y/y. On a regional basis, the west was the only region to register a m/m uptick (4.5%) while the northeast was the only region registering an increase relative to last year. For permits, every region except the northeast was up m/m while it was the only region to register an increase on a y/y basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101922-HS-BP-Breakdown.png))**

&gt; Housing Starts have historically done a good job predicting turns in the business cycle, so the fact that we have now seen five straight months of declines in this reading is just another indication of the risk of a recession on the horizon. We would note, however, that while recessions usually follow peaks in the 12-month average, they weren't always imminent.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101922-Starts-vs-Business-Cycle.png))**

&gt; Looking more closely at the last few years, in addition to the decline in Housing Starts, the 12-month average of Building Permits has also started to roll over.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101922-Permits-and-Starts-12-month-average.png))**

&gt; Single-family starts and permits have been even weaker. and both have now declined for five straight months. Also, the magnitude of the recent decline has been steeper than anything seen since the period from 2010 through 2012.

&gt; # Not All New Lows for Homebuilders

&gt; With mortgage rates running higher unabated and mortgage demand decimated, homebuilder sentiment has continued to tank. The latest reading on homebuilder sentiment from the NAHB hit a new post-pandemic low in October dropping from 46 down to 38. Outside of the weaker readings in May and April of 2020, August 2012 was the last time the index was as low as it is now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101822-NAHB-1.png))**

&gt; Not only is the index at a new cycle low, but the 8-point month-over-month drop also ranks in the bottom 1% of all monthly moves. The declines in the present and future sales indices rank by similar magnitudes.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101822-NAHB-2.png))**

&gt; Although the headline index as well as sub-indices like present sales and traffic have not yet taken out 2020 lows, the index for future sales dropped to its lowest level since June 2012. As shown above, it has the lowest reading within its respective range historically of each of the sub-indices.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101822-NAHB-3.png))**

&gt; The only other index in the report that is below 2020 levels is the sentiment in the West region. While the Midwest and South have also fallen precipitously, the Northeast actually experienced a modest rebound in sentiment. Relative to other indices in the report, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast is remarkably stronger with the index in the 62nd percentile relative to historical readings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101822-NAHB-4.png))**

&gt; As for the technical picture of homebuilder stocks, recent declines have been a bit healthier than the broader market. Whereas major indices set new 52-week lows as recently as last week, the lows for the S&amp;P 1500 Homebuilders Group at the end of September and the end of last week were between 7% and 8% above the June lows. Albeit the line is somewhat choppy, the relative strength line versus the broader market has also been generally trending upward since the spring as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101822-NAHB-5.png))**

&gt; While homebuilder stocks have been holding up surprisingly well, earnings season is on the horizon which has the potential to change that picture; especially if said earnings start to mirror macro housing data. Using data from our Earnings Explorer database, below we show each of the S&amp;P 1500 Homebuilder stocks as well as when they are expected to report earnings and what their historical Q3 earnings beat rates and stock price reactions have been.

&gt; Overall, Tri Pointe Homes (TPH) has been one of the strongest performers for Q3 with a positive reaction by the stock 78% of the time as it possesses the strongest beat rates as well. In fact, for TPH Q3 ranks as the best quarter of the year for stock price reactions. That is also the case for TopBuild (BLD) and KB Homes (KBH). Conversely, Q3 marks the weakest response to earnings for LGI Homes (LGIH), Cavco Industries (CVCO), Toll Brothers (TOL), and Lennar (LEN).

stocks,"The stock market is headed for a big win week. My Nflx is up $54 at up 22.99%, lol. how are your stocks doing?","U.S. stocks soared on Friday as investors parsed through a medley of corporate financial results and pondered the possibility Federal Reserve officials may ease aggressive rate increases sooner than anticipated.

&amp;#x200B;

The S&amp;P 500 (\^GSPC) marched up 2.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (\^DJI) rallied more than 700 points, or 2.5%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) gained 2.3%. Treasuries retreated after a relentless climb in recent days that saw the benchmark 10-year note temporarily rise above 4.3%, a level not seen since 2008.

&amp;#x200B;

In remarks at a meeting Friday, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said the U.S. central bank should avoid tipping the economy into an ""unforced downturn"" and that it was time to consider easing the pace of hikes.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors also assessed a Wall Street Journal report earlier in the day indicating Fed policymakers are poised to deliver another interest rate increase of 0.75% at their meeting Nov. 1-2 and but are expected to discuss the possibility of a smaller increase in December.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with the past two down days, equities closed the week out sharply higher thanks to mega rallies on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re closer to the end than we are to the beginning, and the more bear market rallies we see, the fewer are left before we finally flush it all out,” SoFi's Head of Investment Strategy Liz Young said in a note. “Still some more things to check off the list, but if or when earnings crack and just before economic data falls into contraction conditions, is when you start to pounce on market opportunities – that could be just around the corner.”

Third-quarter earnings season has so far held up better than many analysts have expected, with beats from companies like Netflix (NFLX), AT&amp;T (T), and IBM (IBM) countered by big misses from names such as Snap (SNAP), which tumbled 28% Friday after disappointing Wall Street with its results.

&amp;#x200B;

The social media platform reported a fifth-straight quarterly deceleration, along with lackluster profits and a warning that sales trends in the current three-month period may get worse.

&amp;#x200B;

“It's difficult to parse out how many of Snap's issues are transitory,” Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said in a note. “The weakening macro backdrop is partially to blame for soft results, but we question how much is due to the iOS privacy issues and competitive threats.”

&amp;#x200B;

Snap’s declines also extended to other social media and tech peers Friday, with shares of Meta (META) down 1.1% and Twitter (TWTR) shares off nearly 5%.",finance,1666405782

CryptoCurrency,You can make your own official MOONs Airdrop | Step by Step guide (long post),"Everybody likes airdrops of popular coins. And we on Reddit love free Moons. If you ever wanted to give love to your fellow redditors, there is an official and easy way how to do mass tipping.

[.](https://preview.redd.it/6iu08we9pav91.png?width=332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=978ab06a5bfa4be1508964f8f36f01f9f3970207)

**What you will need:**

1. MOONs - Most of you will earn Moons on reddit, or you can buy them. You are not FED or Tether, so you can't print from thin air.
2. Some ETH for gas
3. Importing/ creating the crypto address where you have your Moons + Eth in supported wallet.
4. Telegram app

Let's get into more details:

**Point 1.**
is obvious. You can't give what you don't have. Get some MOON on RCP Swap, MEXC, Sushiswap or earn directly on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com//r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki#wiki_earning_moons)

**Point 2.**
both Moons and Ethereum should be on Arbitrum Nova chain. Moons in your Reddit Vault are on that chain already, so no hassle here. Arbitrum Nova has very low gas fees. For the start, you will be doing one or two transactions of the moons so it will be \~0.0001 ETH in fees.Thanks to the u/hashzzz and u/prussia_dev you can get your arbitrum nova ETH on [novafaucet.com](https://novafaucet.com). If you're big fish, please donate some nova eth to the faucet so plankton users can live. You know, it's closed ecosystem. When plankton dies, so do the small fish and eventually the big ones too.

**Point 3.**
for now, we can't send Moons directly from our reddit vault outside. Let's say, you have all your Moons in Reddit Vault. *Copy your reddit vault seed phrase*. You will need wallet app that supports Arbitrum Nova chain. Metamask or Math Wallet are good options. I will use Math Wallet android app for this guide.

*- download the app, open, agree with terms- Choose Arbitrum Nova Blockchain*

[Choose Arbitrum Nova Blockchain](https://preview.redd.it/2m3u3dbau9v91.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cbe37708188ee3d5d07d72262fd18be7d767676)

*- Import wallet - Import by Mnemonic - paste your reddit vault seed phrase, Set Wallet Name and create password for it - click Import Wallet.*

[import your wallet](https://preview.redd.it/al0sbk6gu9v91.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4416d82f7c58716898b8a5b554cba6ce13d215f9)

Your ETH will appear in Assets.

*- Custom Asset - paste Moons contract address* 0x0057Ac2d777797d31CD3f8f13bF5e927571D6Ad0 (rest will be filled automatically in Mathwallet, else use Token name: Moons; Token symbol: MOON; Token precision/decimals:18) - *click Add*.

&amp;#x200B;

**Point 4.**
yes, there are many scammers on Telegram, but really, they are basically everywhere. So don't be afraid of it. If you're android user, download the .apk from official site telegram org. The app in Google Play Store and Apple Store is censored. No, this is not a joke or conspiracy, it is fact. If you are iOS user, you have only one native app option - that censored app. But there is a good news, you don't need to use app on mobile phone. You can download the PC program or use web.telegram org in any web browser. It will work fine for this purpose.

**In your Telegram profile, you need to set public username to do the airdrop by this method.**

\- *Join official rCryptoCurrency group*. Link to the group is here in [Useful links](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki#wiki_useful_links)

In Telegram app register for [Moon TipBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/nanooverbtc/comments/qgxvz3/how_to_register_for_moon_tipbot/). In our group find ""user"" Moon TipBot or do general search `@MoonTipBot`and go chat with it.

&amp;#x200B;

**You will be using predefined commands.**

1^(st) command is for registering your address where you hold your Moons for airdrop. This address can be used for withdrawing your Moons too. Write the command`/register YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS`

2^(nd) command is for adding Moons ""into"" bot so you can use them for tipping inside telegram group and for your \*\*awesome airdrops.\*\*`/deposit`

[deposit command](https://preview.redd.it/petynr8dy9v91.png?width=214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c2f59a10417372cd23f6ea559f868d5b1edb64e)

in return the bot will give you your deposit address.

[i redacted the addresses](https://preview.redd.it/q2uzd4owy9v91.png?width=226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ec106355087c59bfbfe8e69d1726c0a96d4712a)

Open your crypto wallet app and send Moons to that address as standard crypto transfer. You can send let's say 1 Moon first, to see, if it works. After a while of sending that 1 Moon go back in bot chat and use command /balance. It should be there. Now you deposit more.

[balance command](https://preview.redd.it/29skwwcjy9v91.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1849def286842a9fc63c6d7fde67e0c3bb9c2290)

# OK, now the fun part begins.

In rCryptoCurrency Telegram group use the command`/airdrop &lt;MOON amount&gt; &lt;number of collectors&gt;`e.g. you want to give 0.01 MOON to 5 users, you write in group chat`/airdrop 0.01 5`  = First 5 users in chat who press the gift button will get those sweet Moons from you!

Anytime you want to see your current Moon balance, just write the bot `/balance`. Using your Moons in telegram does not use any more gas fees. You spent eth just for initial Moons deposit(s).

There are other tipping commands for use in group:

`/randtip &lt;amount&gt; &lt;number of collectors&gt;` Tip MOON to random number of users in Telegram Group`/tip &lt;amount&gt; &lt;@user&gt;` Tip MOON to Telegram user with their username`/freetip &lt;amount&gt; &lt;duration&gt;` Split amount of MOON to all collectors within a duration in seconds

personalfinance,Terrible idea to buy a new car right?,"Given current high interest rates, would it be a terrible idea for me to buy a new car right now?

I've driven a 2000 Honda Accord for the last 10 years, bought used for 5k. It's been a pretty reliable car, but getting up there in years and I'm starting to worry about it breaking down or requiring major repairs soon. It's also getting to be a bit of an eyesore, with bad paint oxidation. The car is also currently in great driving shape, so would hopefully be able to sell it and make a bit to put towards a down payment. We also own a 2016 Mazda that is paid off that my wife drives. 

I've looked at plenty of new and used cars. 2-3 year old cars with 30k+ miles cost the same as brand new vehicles. Luckily most dealers near me are not charging above msrp anymore on new cars. But supply is still low and waitlists are long. I'm worried about waiting till my car breaks down and I need something right away. If I buy a new car, I'd plan on driving it for at least 10 years, maybe longer, so I'd like to get a car I really love. 

My main hangup is interest rates. I've gotten a couple pre-qualifications from online lenders (soft credit pulls only), and can't find any rates below 6% for a 48 month loan, even with excellent credit. 

My situation:
-Family income around $110k
-Mortgage at $2050/month
-No other debt
-paying 10% into 401k
-Emergency savings is a little low, around $13K. Had some large home repairs this year that depleted a good chunk of it. Working to build it back up right now. 

Here are the options as I see them:

* Keep driving my Honda since I have no payment on it. Try to save as much as I can towards a down payment/replenishing emergency fund. Hope that interest rates look better in 6 months or so. 

* Look at used cars, but to actually find cars cheaper than New cars, they would have to be several years old. I'd also still have to finance most of it and deal with high rates. 

* Buy new now. The cars I like are in the 26k - 35k range. Monthly payment would be around $600-700/month for a 48 month loan. 

* If cars aren't in stock, get on a wait list. Might have to put 500-1000 down.

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin miner capitulation could potentially be in sight should the Bitcoin price crash further, with miners already experiencing a tough Q3","**The current Q3 picture (not looking pretty for the miners)**

Low hash rate and soaring energy prices has made it a very tough Q3 for Bitcoin miners.

 The latest Q3 mining report from Hashrate Index has highlighted several factors that have led to a significantly lower hash price and higher cost to produce 1 BTC. 

\**Hash price is the measurement used to determine the market value per unit of hashing power, and is influenced by changes in mining difficulty and the price of BTC.* 

[Q3’s average hashprice was $92.70\/day vs. Q2’s average of $141.20\/day \(-34&amp;#37;\)](https://preview.redd.it/gznk5o60pav91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278b7c4767076dc9e15a99e0ad2718063b2fd2d2)

Besides the fall from Q2 to Q3, the average hashprice has been falling 5% through Q3.

**Soaring costs, declining profits**

American miners have had to contend with the average cost of industrial electricity increasing 25% from $75.20 a megawatt hour to $94.30 per megawatt hour. With power costs swelling and hashprice crumbling, the cost to produce 1 BTC has risen drastically since last year - heavily hitting the profits of mining companies.

**Mine High, Sell Low**

With debt becoming more expensive and harder to come by, cash-strapped miners continued liquidating BTC treasuries in Q3 to keep production going. However, for the first time since May, public miners sold fewer BTC than their monthly production in both August and September. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qulp92oerav91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62aee607d4c84c599ec92e1b34a0bbca92f7d4a3

**Is miner capitulation next?**

Hashrate Index cautioned that Q3 could be a precursor for more tough times for the mining industry with the potential for further distressed asset sales, bankruptcies and miner capitulation as the year comes to a close. 

With the combination of the geopolitical conflict in Russia, a hawkish Fed and a depressed market - it is certainly not outside the realms of possibility that a toxic combination of energy prices continuing to soar and Bitcoin price potentially dropping below its previous low could lead to miner capitulation.

The doomsday situation would be Bitcoin prices dropping even further, forcing miners off the network as it becomes no longer profitable to mine, and these miners selling the reserve bitcoins - leading to a race to the bottom and causing the price to drop further.  

*Author's note: This post might be a pessimistic read, but please note this is a doomsday/worst-case prediction which might very well not happen at all. If anything, I hope some people learnt something about miner capitulation from this post.*

gaming,PS5 Pro? Why? To Rub It In Our Face?,"So apparently mid-cycle console upgrade rumors are circulation as devs have allegedly received dev kits for the PS5 Pro much in the same nature as PS4 Pro in 2016. While I personally had absolutely no problem with the PS4 Pro back when I bought it in November 2016 - I unfortunately DO NOT share the same frame of mind for the PS5 for obvious reasons.

Reason 1: - ""Many People Still Can't Manage to Find a regular PS5.""
      It's no secret that demand for PS5 is still incredibly high. It's gotten easier to acquire one when made available compared to when they launched in 2020, but the matter of the fact is that many consumers are still struggling and supply still hasn't met demand even after two years of being on the market. So why, at this current juncture, is Sony making a PS5 Pro? Your prospective buyers can't even manage to buy the regular version, and now you want to open the floodgates of bots and scalpers AGAIN for a console that will (presumably) have an MSRP of $600? Wut?

Reason 2: - ""What Can We Possibly Gain Out of the PS5 Pro That We Don't Already Have in the OG PS5?""
      We already have 4k gaming. It might not be ""native"" 4K but the image is produced in a 4K image thanks to dynamic resolution-scaling and checkerboard rendering. We already have 120 fps/refresh rate for ultra-smooth gameplay. Even though 95% of games don't really benefit from anything above 60 fps (the average human eye can't distinguish anything above 90 fps, optometrists have gone on record proving this) but at least the option is there for those who want it despite it coming at the cost of the resolution being downgraded to 1080p. 240 fps is useless. 8K gaming is decades away - and that's assuming modern internet can even handle that kind of fidelity if/when it's a thing.
So where does the PS5 Pro come in? What can it offer that the PS5 can't? More RAM? Maybe. A 4k Blu Ray drive? PS5 already has one. A better GPU? Oh boy devs will love that, as if they already don't have enough optimizations to go through per contracts through Sony... (Companies HAVE to optimize whatever game they're releasing on their platforms and all of its graphics settings, which means they have to optimize for PS4, PS4 Pro, and PS5 AAAAAND optimize the ""graphics mode""/""frame rate mode"" that's in the settings for each of those consoles. And people wonder why AAA games come out as an unoptimized mess)

Reason 3: - ""PS5 Pro Will Have Embarrassingly Small Diminishing Returns""
      Remember when Console generations would herald a new era of fidelity and interactivity? When you tell clear as day that there is graphical improvement?

Those days are over. They have been for some time now. Sure, the difference between PS4 to PS5 is there - but not anywhere near as significant as, let's say, PS1 to PS2 or PSP to PS Vita, or PS2 to PS3. To make matters worse, Sony isn't even brave enough to cut off the PS4 from it's main development studios and embrace the PS5's future and potential - which makes the prospect of buying a PS5 bittersweet. And now Sony wants to bring a PS5 Pro into that mix? Why? All your AAA games are being held back by PS4 development tools/parameters. Why do you want consumers to play a beefed up PS4 game on PS5 Pro settings? I sure as hell don't.

There's a lot more I want to touch up on regarding this matter but I don't want to keep typing at the expense of everyone's time. But those are my main issues with an alleged PS5 Pro. I think it's dumb in the context of the current market and utterly useless considering Sony's hesitation to fully embrace the PS5's future.

Those are my thoughts.",technology,1666424219
personalfinance,Lower house price or lower mortgage rates? Good neighbourhoods +old house or new house + far neigbourhood?,"Hi all! We are looking to move houses and we are a bit unsure on what would be best from an investment perspective as most probably we will not find our dream house within the next 2-3 months or within our budget. 
We are looking to buy a house in Den Haag, the Netherlands. Currently the price trends are going down but the mortgage rates are going up. We have the opportunity to keep a low mortgage rate  from our previous house for the 1/3 of the price of the new one. This rate is 1.2 while the new rate would be 4.8 both for 10 years. The house prices are going down, but it looks like the more the house prices fall the bigger the interest rate with some predictions looking at 6,5% rate. The difference in price would be for approx. 25k.
What would be better to do wait for the prices to fall further even if mortgage rates will rise or buy now? Please consider that we also still have a house that would yield a profit at the moment another 1/5 of the price of the new house.

In addition, we found some old houses 1860 early 1900s in the best neighbourhoods in Den Haag that would cost the same with a newly built house at the outskirts of Den Haag. Both are including land. Which one would you buy? And what would be your rationale?

Back in active addiction I used loan apps and now I’m getting threatening emails","So I am currently in recovery from a severe drug addiction and now that im several months sober and finally standing on my two feet a little more stably I want to figure out my finances and the debt I owe. Now while in active addiction I was an idiot and used some of those cash advance apps or at least reached out to them. I think one of them went through and I received 900 dollars from one but the rest I’m not sure. This morning I was going through my spam folder and received an email from Cash Advance INC The Cash Advance Group from with info from Attorney Stacey Leyton Washington DC. The contact email from the email is from Attorney Erika Allen to attorney.Stacey.leyton@gmail.com and the emails are stating I have an outstanding loan amount of 724.63 and I dont recognize ever receiving that amount. I emailed them requesting paperwork before sending a single penny but when I googled Stacey Leyton and Stacey A. Leyton to look up the attorney nothing was popping up except for one lady and the pictures didnt match. 

My question is how do I figure out what loans got sent to collection agencies and how did I differentiate between scams and the legit ones I owe because again I was in active addiction at the time so my memory is fuzzy about which apps actually went through. I’m just trying to get my life in order now and this whole thing is stressing me out. 

Would they reach out threatening me with legal action like that? I usually thought when you can’t pay a loan it gets defaulted and sent to a third party collection agency. Before I start sending any money to anyone.

personalfinance,Pay Car down or invest?,"I think I know the answer already.   


I had terrible credit in 2019 but I really needed a car. I purchased a 2018 Fusion Hybrid for 17K at 23.5% interest. The payments were totally doable on my income at that time.   


My income has since increased by a factor of 2.2 so I have plenty of excess money. I also have since bought a house at 2.85% so my housing expense is pretty much fixed.   


The current car payment is $441 and what I would like to do is to start paying an additional $600/month against the car so it will be totally paid-off by next August.   


I do not have a large emergency fund (it's only 2K) but I have a lot of excess income each month as I don't have a family and I have been buying stuff like I-bonds the last year. I also have a defined benefit pension through my job plus VA Disability compensation. So I have a lot of stability many people don't have.   


The main question I'm asking you fine citizens is this, pay the extra to eliminate the horrible car loan interest rate or invest the $600 each month? I feel like it's unlikely I'll make 24% on any investment over the next year, so the car loan seems like the right play. Can anyone challenge me?",finance,1666452852

vet,Advice on injured and weak semi-feral cat. Funds are tight but she is in bad shape.,"Tldr; mom's semi-feral cat in bad shape, needs at least antibiotics and we need cheap options ASAP

My mom has an outdoor cat that showed up 11 years ago and has been outside and fed daily since. Even after 11 years, she wouldn't let anyone touch her but she lets us get close.

Well a year ago we noticed her mouth was really swollen and she has trouble eating but she still wouldn't let us get her. It's still bad but at least she could eat and drink daily. But it definitely made her mattted.

This week we noticed she had a wound in her stomach and wouldn't eat. She finally allowed us to catch her last night and she is in bad shape. She is eating and drinking a bit but terribly weak and shaking. Her wound had maggots and was swollen but the swelling has kind of gone down. It is the size of a quarter and seems not too deep. We bathed her and have been flushing it with peroxide. She is allowing us to handle her.

I've called 10+ vets and they all say that it's an emergency and needs to go to an emergency clinic. Those clinics are quoting 1k plus and we don't have that kind of money. We think she might make it if she gets an antibiotics shots but we can't afford the bloodwork and diagnostics they are quoting.

Any advice??",cryptocurrency,1666464861
personalfinance,FIL says the market is different this time. Is it?,"My partner and I have our investments in equity index funds. My father-in-law is trying to convince us that the market has changed—that this downturn is different from previous ones—and that we should move our investments to cash until the market starts to rebound. Specifically, he thinks we should keep our investments in cash until market value surpasses the 50-day moving average again, using charts like [this one](https://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/advchart/frames/frames.asp?show=&amp;insttype=Index&amp;symb=djia&amp;time=13&amp;startdate=1%2F4%2F1999&amp;enddate=10%2F16%2F2022&amp;freq=2&amp;compidx=aaaaa%3A0&amp;comptemptext=&amp;comp=none&amp;ma=3&amp;maval=50%2C200&amp;uf=0&amp;lf=1&amp;lf2=2&amp;lf3=0&amp;type=2&amp;style=320&amp;size=4&amp;x=56&amp;y=13&amp;timeFrameToggle=false&amp;compareToToggle=false&amp;indicatorsToggle=false&amp;chartStyleToggle=false&amp;state=11) from bigcharts.com. These are some of the reasons he says this downturn is different:

* Interest rates are going up instead of down.
* The Fed is taking money out of the banking system instead of throwing money in. He says the 60° angle in 2020 on the previously linked chart is explained by the Fed pumping money in and a big chunk of that going into the stock market.
* The Fed “put” is done—not sure what this means, but he elaborated by noting that since 2009, the Fed would lower interest rates or put money into the system any time the stock market was in trouble, but they no longer do so.
* The U.S. has $31 trillion in debt; with rising interest rates, we will soon be paying more in interest on the debt than on defense.

His main concern is that the stock market may not recover for 25 years, invoking earlier periods when the market took a long time to recover, such as after the 1929 crash and throughout the 1970s.

We don’t plan to change our investment strategy, but since we don’t know a lot about market history or investing beyond the basics of low-cost index investing à la JL Collins, I was curious, does anyone in this sub have similar concerns as my FIL that things are different now and going forward?

CryptoCurrency,Why were my coins sold at a lower price than the Stop-Loss order I entered?,"Hello. This thing happened a month ago, but I wanted to ask anyway.

On the morning of September 21, I opened a long trade at 18.900$ on Bitcoin. As I predicted, Bitcoin's price started to rise towards the time of the FED meeting. I'm not a person who uses Stop-Loss a lot, but since everyone I see said 'don't forget to use it', so just in case, I set a Stop-Loss order at 19.200$ while Bitcoin was around 19,450$. (On Binance btw)

After the interest rate was announced at the Fed meeting, as you know, within seconds, Bitcoin first went up to 20.000$ and then suddenly started to fall. My stop-Loss order didn't work at 19.200$ and it sold at 18.450$ and closed the position, almost the lowest point where Bitcoin fell.

In this case, I made a loss because of Stop-Loss. If Stop-Loss doesn't work on sudden drops, then why we should use it? If the order had never worked, I would still understand it. However, the fact that it worked at a level far below the Stop-Loss order I gave, that's a huge problem.

I mean it says our funds aren't at risk. So there is that. But I wonder if they are preparing to block the entire US like Binance did.

4) Why would anyone ever want to buy the 3 month bond it has the lowest interest rate it makes no sense for anyone to buy it.

CryptoCurrency,Why SWIFT is a PoS network and why a Blockchain system will replace it sooner than later,"When you send money from New York to someone in say Argentina, it usually goes through what is called a SWIFT transfer.

SWIFT - Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications is the world's largest financial network that moves the world's money. Last year SWIFT moved an insane $5 Trillion per day or 1.25 quadrillion per year 👀 - most of which is international payments.

### How does it work? The simple basics.
When you enter the details of your Argentinian friend in your bank account and authorize a wire transfer, A whole bunch of banks called correspondent banks get involved to make this go around. Your bank sends these details to a larger 'correspondent' bank which then sends this to another larger bank which has (finally) a relationship with an Argentine bank.

### Trust issues
Just the way you trust your bank to keep the funds safe, your bank trusts the larger correspondent bank to keep its funds safe during transit (which means this larger bank needs to keep a huge deposit safe with the federal reserve to maintain its credibility). In other words, they have to prove their network credibility by a huge stake of Dollars. A few big players are acting as kind of validators of worldwide interbank transactions. Since everyone needs to trust one another every step of the way, only select entities which have huge capital pledged with authorities can be part of this trust chain. As you can expect these trustworthy entities don't want to do the job for free, so they charge for this privilege (staking returns).

Even though transferring money in the modern world is simply moving numbers from one database to another, transfers between countries typically cost 5-10% (for most corridors) and take 1-5 days. That‘s ridiculously blatant.

### The Blockchain Solution
As Blockchain decentralizes trust and makes payments instantaneous using a blockchain-based token like Bitcoin even stable coins like USDC bring down the costs drastically to a few cents and time taken to minutes.

Now imagine that your bank didn't have to send money to another bank which sends money to another bank which sends to another bank, you get the point - Instead, your bank could simply purchase bitcoin in its own country from an exchange and send this bitcoin through bitcoin lightning (at speed of light) which gets converted from bitcoin to that local currency to your friend (all of this can happen in less than 5 secs).

The powerful thing about bitcoin is it's the world's first digital bearer asset which doesn't need a trusted counterparty to move funds from bank to bank. Even though bitcoin is volatile in a window of months over a 5-second window that volatility won't affect you much. Using this route you can basically zap money around the world in seconds and cost  l/1000 of typical SWIFT transfers.

### Conclusions
- No one likes to wait 5 days for payment clearance if they don't have to
- No one likes paying 1-10% of money transfers as transaction fees
- No one likes giving up their privacy to agencies in countries that they are mostly not even aware of.
- SWIFT is already today a PoS (Proof of Stake) network with trusted parties
- Therefore it is the perfect use-case to be replaced by a more efficient trustless blockchain system

investing,"To what extent are bonds valued (not priced) on a simple ""rules based"" basis?","QE started in 2008. Bond yields fell during all crises since then (European debt crisis 2011, 2015-16 economic slowdown, Brexit 2016, Trump trade war 2018 and 2019, COVID 2020).

Yields fell at those times because (a) return of capital was more appealing than return on capital (b) there was an assumption the global economy would shrink.

Inflation has increased rapidly because of two one-off global supply shocks. The Fed and other rate setters responded by hiking rates and promising to continue hiking aggressively, which goes against traditional theory (rate hikes work for demand led inflation).

It is widely expected the global economy cannot handle higher rates. Too much leverage, too much QE to unwind, companies issued bonds to do share buybacks, households buy cars on hire purchase and buy houses with low deposits.

There are currently two major crises, including a proxy world war. The pandemic could rear its head again over the flu period. China could invade Taiwan and cut off the world's major supplier of semiconductors. Did the European debt crisis stop being an issue? Do Greece and Spain have far better economies than ten years ago, following the pandemic and supply shortages? All of this should cause a human to think a reckoning is coming.

Yet instead sovereign bond yields have rocketed. 

Everything I've seen about the significant drops in bond values simply say ""Fixed income is a poor choice during periods of rising inflation"". 

But this feels like what a computer would say.

It ignores the return **of** capital element for sovereign debt, which should be invaluable during all these huge crises. This return of capital element was beneficial during all the relatively minor crises since 2008. So why not now? 

It also assumes that commodities, property and some equities will do well. Hypothetically, they all do well during periods of high inflation. People ditch bonds to buy property and commodities. But thats only during demand led inflation. Commodities have spiked in price, but that will only last until the economy slows. Property can't stay at these prices if the Fed (etc) follows through with the rate hikes the markets have already priced in. Bond values have priced in these future aggressive rate hikes, yet property hasn't (some areas are flat, some down slightly, some up slightly - none of which factors in a 5/6% Fed rate).

So, what gives? People see a headline inflation rate of 10% and think ""ditch bonds/buy commodities"" without factoring in all the very realistic negative implications of the world war? 

German 10 year bonds were negative a year ago. People were guaranteeing a loss of euro for 10 full years because they felt a return of capital was more important than a return on capital, because they thought the pandemic would wreck the global economy Now they're at 2.5%. In that time, the supplier of 40% of Germany's gas has started a war on Germany's doorstep.

CryptoCurrency,The Infinite Machine: a look into crypto origins.,"Price go up, then price go down. It’s almost as if the only reason the crypto community exist is to invest in a specific set of high-volatility assets, that most people consider too risky to try out. Or at least this is how it feels for a newcomer to this world: the only thing you should look for is the price movement of a coin, buy at the bottom and sell at the top, plus everything in between. I’m fairly new to crypto, less than two years into the journey, and I got in for the money. 

I want to tell you how my outlook on crypto has changed since.

Recently, I stumbled across one of the most widely famous books in the community: “The Infinite Machine”; The Infinite Machine is a book about the creation of Ethereum: now, if you are here now there is no need to explain the details Ethereum itself and is probably much more interesting to look at the bigger picture. Let's start with the origins of it all.

With Bitcoin, it was finally implemented a currency independent from governments, banks and capable of connecting financially anyone with a connection across the globe. Ethereum takes this process of decentralization a step further: not only it is now possible to run a currency on a blockchain, but now the blockchain has the goal of becoming the internet itself, independent and decentralized.

**Why do we need someone to reinvent something that already exists?**

In times of green candles and economical growth, like the last decade, is easy to forget how flawed the financial system is. Ours is a system relying on Banks that grant loans with money they do not have and the government bailing out banks that took too much of a risk. Mix this with questionable money printing tactics and the grand scheme of things is clear: we live in a rotten system that **structurally** needs cyclic periods of heavy crisis. At the same time, the main victims paying the price of economical recessions are not in the 1% that ignited the crisis. 

Decades of movements and political unrest to fix this (probably) broken system did not result in a revolutionary restructuring of the global economy, any attempt to bring an element of divergence to the establishment was met simply by absorbing the divergence. At some point around the 2008 crisis, fed up with it, some unknown developer(s) thought: “if the system is resistant to change, I might as well create an independent and **better** financial system that the world can rely upon. Unchangeable, incorruptible, and most importantly decentralized. Bitcoin was born to fill the demand for a currency not bound to anything apart from the basic rule of supply and demand, which was able to verify transactions between users independently from a central authority. 

With Bitcoin, there would be no such thing as decades of savings evaporated by raging hyperinflation. There would not be any arbitrary seizure of your money from banks. The blockchain became a way to give back control of their money to people. 

In the bigger picture, the price movement of bitcoin (lowercase, just refers to the coin itself and not to Bitcoin, the blockchain) is largely irrelevant. Right now we are in a phase of adoption, with an unstable price movement and a lot of speculation going on, but that does not change the fundamentals of the breakthrough: a way to escape the established financial system exists, for anyone with an internet connection.

**Now, why not scale this, from “just” a payment method, to the whole Internet?”**

That is the goal of Ethereum.

I hope to talk a bit about Ethereum in a follow-up post, this is already a pretty big one. Thanks for reading up here, here is a link for a PDF of The Infinite Machine for the people that want to know more.

my questions:

1. All things equal, why do I pay less interest with an amortizing loan than a simple interest loan (based on the numbers above)?
2. Since both loans are equal terms (300K, 30years, 3%), why isn't it equal total payments of interest?

personalfinance,How to avoid capital gains tax when converting homestead to rental,"Hi all, I bought a home I've been living in in 2019. I'm now moving out and would like to keep it as a rental, however, with the housing market appreciation I don't want to be on the hook for capital gains due to the increasing value. As I understand it, I have 3 options to avoid the tax:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Sell the home while still meeting the 2 in 5 rule - this isn't too attractive, if I can only rent it for the next 3 years I don't know if it's worth the hassle and money to get it ready to rent
2. Sell the home to a wholly owned S-corp, take a loan in the S-corp to pay for it - this likely won't work because the reason the finances work is due to the low interest rate I have on it. The margins won't be there if I have to take a market interest level rate 
3. 1031 it to a new rental property when I eventually sell it - likely not as attractive as if I sell it now I'd have no strings attached to the gains

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Is it time to buy a house?,"Hello, thank you in advance for your input. My wife and I are trying to decide if we pay off our student loans in full now, or, try to buy a house.

For reference, we live in the Bay Area and the housing market is still insane. Combined our yearly income is about ~450k, largest bulk of that is from my income (important below). Student loans debt is about 215k. We have been saving towards a house for some time and the student loan pause has helped. But, now, with interest rates up so high we are deciding what to do, re mortgage.

We don’t really want to stay in the area forever, if possible, however, my line of work makes that difficult so unknown if we really could move (more on that below). We could pay off the loans right now and still have a good amount of savings left over, though, not nearly at the level of 20% down payment on a home (in this area). Houses in our area are 1.2-1.5 million so if we bought now our loan would probably be about 1 million … which seems insane to me. We have no prior equity.

Cost of renting is very high - about $4,400 per month where we live and work - two bedrooms (which we need for childcare and home office). We live comfortably and modestly and most of our take home pay after rent, groceries, childcare, basic supplies.

In some respect getting rid of the loan debt feels like freedom because we could take on lower paying jobs, with less stress, and no obligation to continue working in a high paying, but high stress, field to be able to afford the debt required to do so, if that makes sense. But at the same time continuing to rent in such a high cost area just feels like money we are throwing away but could get back, via a house, but then we are stuck with a high student loan burden and high mortgage burden … So Reddit, what should we do and why?",finance,1666549121
investing,Buy-write fund like SPXX: what are the pluses and minuses?,"I saw a recommendation for [SPXX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPXX?p=SPXX), a fund that:

&gt; [is designed to offer regular distributions](https://www.nuveen.com/en-us/closed-end-funds/spxx-nuveen-s-p-500-dynamic-overwrite-fund) through a strategy that seeks attractive total return with less volatility than the S&amp;P 500 Index by investing in a U.S. equity portfolio that seeks to substantially replicate the price movements of the S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as selling call options on 35%-75% of the notional value of the Fund's equity portfolio (with a 55% long-term target) in an effort to enhance the Fund's risk-adjusted returns.

So it seems it holds the SP500, and writes covered calls on it, sacrificing upside in return for premiums.   There are probably lots of buy-write funds like this, and I own a little of another one.

The gushing recommendation was based on the idea that the market is oversold and a recession is priced in (flip a coin on this one; I say no).

SPXX  yields 7.3%.    It is usually less volatile than SP500, but when SP500 does something crazy, it follows it (it went from 19.75 to 9.23 from 2007 to 2009, and went from 16.47 to 11.58 in the 2020 panic).

The dividends since 2009 were rather flat, but solid at around today's 7%.      I'd argue that given the past decade's 2% inflation,  it has earned a real 5% because neither the value nor the dividend grew much.   Assuming federal plus state 20% taxation on dividends and capital gains, the real return drops to 4% if it isn't held in a retirement fund.  But for someone earning under $100K, total tax will be closer to 10%, and real yield is 4.75%.

So I'd say the following about this and similar funds

* they sacrifice market upside and dividend growth because of covered call losses

* they tend to yield a solid above-inflation return

* like covered calls, the downside has limited protection, and can suffer worse than the overall market, for some reason (eg 2009, 2020) - maybe it writes covered calls into a dip and loses upside, the equivalent of selling low.

Still, it looks like it it could be a relatively stable way of extracting  a real 5% rate of return from the market. 

Are there any upsides or downsides I don't see?  I read a 10 year old thread that said it's better to buy a junk-bond index but these yield about 5.6%, and are not taxed at cap gains / dividend rates, so they yield about 2.5% after taxes and inflation.",finance,1666550537

I was looking to put 3.5% down on a 150k 2-family property this year as a goal of mine (i planned on house hacking). However, I've been conflicted on making that move with the way interest rates are now. I invested $21k invested into VTI so far (although I am down about 7k—but no worries, I’m in it for the long term). I also have about $20k in my savings account.

personalfinance,Buying a house without getting burned (again),"My wife and I bought our first home in 2014. We were extremely diligent (we thought) about it. We had it inspected and had individual contractors out to assess some of what the inspector found to see how severe/expensive issues were. We visited the house at least 5 or 6 times, with all the inspections, before we closed.

It still turned into a money pit. Our inspector somehow missed major issues with the plumbing, multiple major appliances failed, and we had to replace the entire septic system with an extremely expensive unit due to groundwater issues. We’d set aside some money for regular home repair, but blew way past what we ever anticipated spending on that.

After we sold, I totaled it up. We spent nearly $200K on home repairs over the 5 years we owned it. 

We sold at the height of the housing market and made a little money over what we paid for it, but nowhere near what we spent on repairs. We’re currently renting, but eyeing buying again whenever interest rates start to fall.

Does anyone have tips on how to avoid a disaster like our first home? Are home warranties worth it? Are there any saving/budgeting strategies that make home repairs less painful?

personalfinance,Did I just make another financial mistake (auto loan refinancing),"So I purchased this vehicle in 2019 and my loan was for $18k, 11.3% interest. My monthly payment was $433, but I was paying $500 flat, to try to speed up the processes (even a little bit.) I had $11,500 left to pay off on this loan . My pay off date was set for June 2025.

Flash forward to now and I finally decide to give refinancing a shot for my loan. I wanted a lower interest rate to help me pay it of faster. Long story short, I refinance to a new loan which was 6.09% APR and 48 term length. I finally received the log in for the loan and the loan amount is $16,439. that’s almost $5,000 more then I had left to pay on my previous loan. 

Why did my loan amount go up so fucking much? did I just make another financial mistake right after the first (the first being purchasing a car with such bad APR). Can I do anything about this? Any advice is appreciated. Help!!",finance,1666569263

Hi there,

I adopted a female cat a week ago (1yo) and she's experiencing swelling, bruising, and hair loss under her eye that was not there at adoption.

I've brought her to two different vets and neither of them have seen anything like it. I adopted through a well-established local rescue organization. She was kept at a pet store 2 weeks prior to pick up and fostered in a home before that.

I have another appointment this week, but has anyone seen this before? Or experienced something similar?

*Please note – the photos in the links below increase in severity as you scroll and may be considered sensitive.*

**Here's how the week went:**

* **Saturday**  
Day of adoption, no symptoms

* **Sunday**  
No symptoms  

* **Monday**  
Tiny black mark under eye  

* **Tuesday**  
Noticed thin black tube-like shape under left eye about 1/4"" long, hard to see in photo  
*Photo 2:* [*https://imgur.com/a/YOY3T4E*](https://imgur.com/a/YOY3T4E)  

* **Wednesday**  
Thin tube-like shape grew about double in length to 1/2""  

* **Thursday (went to vet)**  
Swelling, bruising, and hair loss grew up to eyelid line and below the initial shape. About 1/2""H by 3/4""W total. Vet checked for worms, obstructions, ulcers – said nothing was present from initial observation. Vet recommended applying antibiotic cream 2x a day (Erythromycin Ophthalmic Ointment USP .5%) and following up.  
*Photo 3:* [*https://imgur.com/a/tgAN0fF*](https://imgur.com/a/tgAN0fF)  

* **Friday**  
Changed diet, continued to apply ointment. Swelling went down slightly but not significantly.  

* **Saturday (went to vet again)**  
Symptoms same as previous day, went to different vet since first was unavailable. Vet with 25 years of experience said they've never seen it before. They tested for ringworm, waiting for results. Continued to apply ointment.

personalfinance,How to invest $$ intended for down payment in 1.5-2 years,"I've got \~$150k that is intended for a down payment for a home purchase in \~1.5 - 2 years and no sooner. Given the short time frame, I have little tolerance for risk. I've got the money I need now and I don't want to lose it. I'm thinking of buying my 20k (wife and I) limit in I-bonds and putting the rest in a variety of 3 month, 6 month, and 1-year t-bills. Buying some of the shorter duration ones thinking they'll likely keep going up if interest rates rise later in the year and I can reinvest those at a higher rate. Figure I can't lose and getting 4-4.6% back is not bad.   


My advisor service is trying to convince me to put 65% in a money market fund and 35% in bond ETFs (which are down 16% over the past year). To me it doesn't make sense to put most in something that's at best going to get 1-2% and the rest in something that could likely keep losing.   


Any feedback, other ideas out there?",finance,1666575787
personalfinance,Anxiety over personal liquidity and finance ratios,"My wife and I are building a home in a community, construction should be completed in may of 2023. Luckily, the builder offers financing, my mortgage rate is locked in at 7%. 

Like anyone buying a house right now, there is a great deal of fear with the rising interest rate. Some of my fear has been eased as I locked my rate in, but now my monthly payment is higher than I was expecting. This psychological aspect is weighing heavy on my mind. 

Here’s some statistics that may help shed light into our situation, and some questions for each statistic:

Would you mind answering the questions with a scale (1 = terrible, 10 = fantastic) 

1. With my mortgage, our debt to income is 31%. (1-10, does this land?)   
   
 

2. Our overall savings rate ($ saved / net income) = 20%. When you factor in what my wife and I contribute to our 401k (not what the employer matches), we’re at 26%. If you factor in what the employer matches, we’re at 32% of net income being saved. (1-10, does this land?)   
   
 

3. As a household, we have 12 months of cash in the bank. This is defined as, if neither of us earned a penny, we could pay every single bill we have and not decrease our quality of life for 12 months before our account goes to zero. (1-10, does this land?)   
   
 

4. If we look at just my contribution to the overall household expenses, I have 24 months of cash saved up (again, if I didn’t earn a penny, I could tap into a bank account for 24 months before the account goes to zero). My wife is in the medical field, so her job is recession-proof. (1-10, does this land?)   
   
 

Note, with the existing savings we have, and the savings mentioned above, I realize that just putting money in a checking or savings account isn’t the smartest idea either and we should be investing that money. I’d like to keep this discussion more centered around financial solvency and liquidity, as that’s what I’m having high anxiety over.",finance,1666577062

It’s far from any on the list of the “Top 10 Companies to Work For” of the United States or even MY state, but there’s benefits, 401K (more on that later) and steady, dependable demand (and thus...job security? I dunno)

I make about 35K a year (I know, small beans compared to even the OTHER posters asking for advice on here I’ve seen...but I’m unmarried with no kids and live FAR beneath my means, which is by my own design) I have my pay set up already to where my net pay every paycheck is half deposited in my checking, half in a savings account (to basically add a barrier to me using it)

I have over $3,000 in this account and another $3,500 in my 401K (I’ve been at this company a year)

I want to FINALLY start taking advantage of compound interest, and this goddamn economy and the lack of action on my 401K (as everyone has been seeing with theirs I know) has had me looking at I-bonds with the (soon to be gone) 9.6% interest rate. 

It’s “do or die” for me with this I-bond situation this week... I can create and account at treasurydirect.com and dump both my savings accumulations and my 401K (minus the 20-odd percent tax gouge), roughly $6,500, into an I-bond and get that high return interest rate for the next 6 months

...OR I can just keep sitting and watching the pitiable rates of the garbage savings account interest and the comatose 401K do next to nothing for me instead. I want to know: the choice is clear, right? If I’m not gonna need the money for the next year at a minimum, I might as well get that money in there while I can, correct?

Is it too late? Is there some waiting period to seeing my 401K funds if I cash them out tomorrow on Monday, and I shouldn’t even bother?

I would like to purchase my first house but I'm not sure if the timing is right with the housing market.

The housing market is insane in central Florida ( probably definitely everywhere) and rent is asinine to say the least. I'd really prefer not to rent. My biggest fear is buying now and having the housing market tank like in 2008.

I currently make 80k a year in California, but I really don't like my job anymore and can't really stand another day. I have about 100k in the bank I've saved from staying with my parents. No debt. 700+ credit score.

I think I have a few good plans in order, but I would love some insight on my logic.

1. Leave tomorrow and live in a small trailer at my sister's house for a couple months while the housing market cools off and look for new employment. Purchase a house when the market is right.

2. Work on getting pre-approved while I have my current job and purchase a house at possibly the tip of the market with high interest rate and refinance later. Put 50k down for a ~200k-250k house and survive off the other 50k until I find a job.

3. Buy a cheap home (modular/ fixer upper) ~30k cash and sell it within a year or two.

4. Wait a bit longer at my employment 3-6 months for houses to come down. (Not ideal and stressful)

oil,"Biden Pitches Plan to Refill Oil Reserves, but Producers Are Skeptical","U.S. companies are wary of boosting output even though the government is offering to buy oil at fixed prices

https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-aims-to-spur-drilling-with-plan-to-refill-oil-reserves-but-producers-are-skeptical-11666467900?mod=hp_lead_pos4

After releasing the most oil ever from the U.S. emergency petroleum reserve, the Biden administration is signaling it will refill soon, a multibillion-dollar undertaking that it hopes will rouse sluggish domestic drilling activity.

The pitch is likely to be a hard sell for many domestic producers, say industry executives and analysts. “It’s a little bit more [complex] than this,” said Olivier Le Peuch, chief executive of oil-field services company Schlumberger Ltd.

On Wednesday, President Biden said for the first time that the Energy Department would begin purchasing oil to refill the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve when oil prices are $67 to $72 a barrel, or less. Officials also said the department has made a final rule that would allow it to purchase crude at a fixed future price, which they hope would encourage producers to drill more.

Energy executives and analysts expressed doubts the plan would spur a large increase in production in the short term. Many oil companies are wary of locking in sales when commodity markets have swung wildly. They hope to capture high oil prices while they are in place. Rising drilling costs and pressure from investors to limit production and return excess cash to shareholders are also dimming the outlook for production growth, they said.

As he said his administration would refill the reserve, Mr. Biden said an additional draw of 15 million barrels is to be delivered in December, completing a sale of 180 million barrels he ordered earlier this year to temper soaring oil prices. The Energy Department will further draw from the reserves after that if needed, he said. 

Mr. Biden’s oil releases, roughly equivalent to Libya’s daily oil production, have brought the inventories to a 38-year low. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve can hold about 714 million barrels of oil and was down to about 405 million barrels as of Oct. 14. Mr. Biden said the releases are meant to lower Americans’ energy bills and stabilize markets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

So far, the massive drawdowns have been matched by a timid increase in domestic production. Even with the benchmark for U.S. crude oil reaching $120 a barrel earlier this year, producers have kept a low profile, churning out about 12 million barrels a day, a 6% increase from January production, according to federal data for the week ended Oct. 14. 

One reason for the restraint is pressure from investors, who have been stung by years of the industry’s free spending and are demanding that oil companies keep production largely flat while increasing buybacks and dividends. That capital discipline has also allowed producers to clean up their balance sheets and put them on solid footing to weather market volatility, analysts said. 

Mr. Biden said Wednesday that oil companies shouldn’t be using their profits for investor payouts during the war in Ukraine and urged them to increase production. Administration officials say their plan to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve gives producers assurance of future demand, allowing them to increase drilling now.

Oil-industry groups have said Mr. Biden’s releases have been responsible for tepid production growth in recent months because drawing down reserves artificially lowers prices in the short term, dissuading investment in new oil production.

Linhua Guan, chief executive of driller Surge Energy Inc., said that Mr. Biden’s offer could see some takers but that his administration’s other policies pertaining to the oil-and-gas industry made new investments unattractive. A Wall Street Journal review of federal data found that new oil leases on federal lands have slowed greatly under Mr. Biden, a point of contention for the industry.

“The longer these bad policies last, probably the production increase will be much smaller,” Mr. Guan said. 

Mr. Biden pledged to stop drilling on federal lands as a candidate, saying the nation needs to transition to clean energy. 

Marshall Adkins, a managing director at investment bank Raymond James Financial Inc., said a view among producers that crude prices will remain elevated for the foreseeable future makes them less likely to presell oil. Shale companies have been letting their hedges—contracts to sell future production at a fixed price—roll off to maximize exposure to high commodity prices, he said. 

Mr. Adkins said production cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, combined with sanctions targeting Russia and potentially rebounding demand from China, could lead to a supply gap that would push crude prices back to $120 and even higher. “[If] I think oil is going to be a lot higher a year from now, I’m not going to hedge at $70,” he said. 

The possibility that the cost of materials, equipment and labor could keep rising also makes locking in prices unappealing to producers, said Robert McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group and a former energy adviser to President George W. Bush. “The shale-oil companies don’t know what their costs are going to be in a year or two,” he said. 

Shifting from releasing the reserves to refilling them could remove large amounts of oil from the global market, further tightening supplies and contributing to inflation, some analysts said. 

“The time to replenish is during times of economic slack, when there’s surplus oil to buy,” said Kevin Book, managing director at consulting firm ClearView Energy Partners LLC.",energy,1666586081

economy,Is South Korea confirmed to end up like Venezuela?,"There was this article:

&gt;**Korea readies emergency liquidity to contain ‘Legoland Crisis’**  
&gt;  
&gt;South Korea’s economic policy chiefs, led by Finance Minister Choo Kyung-ho, said Sunday the government would expand liquidity facilities to buy corporate bonds and commercial paper to stop a recent credit default from spilling over into the wider financial market.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The government will earmark 50 trillion won ($34 billion), at the least, to avoid a liquidity crunch,” Choo said, noting the fund will be used starting Monday to calm growing worries over the corporate debt markets. They were prompted by delinquency issues surrounding a local Legoland theme park in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, which opened to the public in May after yearslong delays over profitability concerns.  
&gt;  
&gt;Earlier this month, the local developer that built the park in partnership with Merlin Entertainments, a United Kingdom-based attractions operator, declared it had defaulted on the overdue payments worth $142.3 million. Investors were spooked because the top-rated short-term papers were backed by Gangwon Province in what many saw as a provincial guarantee against any insolvency.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kim Jin-tae, governor of Gangwon Province, fueled worries Friday, when he said he would still take the company into court receivership. The governor, however, moved to downplay concerns over a default spillover, saying his office would deliver on the liabilities using the provincial budget that he said would be finalized by year-end.  
&gt;  
&gt;“All of the outstanding debts will be cleared by Jan. 29 next year,” Kim told reporters, saying liquidating the company assets under court supervision was still necessary to pay off taxpayer money put into the park.  
&gt;  
&gt;Critics have questioned the timing Kim chose to walk back on his earlier decision that had left out the direct provincial help to pay off the debts owed to Legoland investors. Kim, a former two-term conservative lawmaker who came into office in July with eyes set on austerity, has described as ill-conceived the park that his liberal predecessor had put up. Benefits like job openings were inflated, according to Kim, who the critics say is keen to politicize the project to make a name for himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I see no room for political maneuvering when it comes to the park, and I don’t believe Gov. Kim had made his decision looking for some political gains,” Choo told a parliamentary audit Friday, the same day Kim reversed his decision and promised to tap into the provincial budget to soothe commercial paper holders. Ten local financial institutions, mostly securities firms, had packaged the instrument into wealth management products for retail investors.  
&gt;  
&gt;Choo, who at the time stressed “reliability” investors expect from the government, addressed the issue again at the Sunday meeting. “Guarantees made by the government and municipalities on every commercial paper will be made whole. I’m making that crystal clear again,” said the finance minister, who doubles as deputy prime minister.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Sunday gathering -- joined by President Yoon Suk-yeol’s economic adviser and the three chiefs from the central bank, top financial policymaker and financial watchdog -- also discussed efforts to communicate more clearly with investors.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Everything that’s doable through engaging markets in dialogue is on the table,” Gov. Kim Joo-hyun of the Financial Services Commission said, referring to measures to come. Soaring interest rates are one of the fundamental reasons behind growing volatility gripping the bond markets, according to the top financial policymaker.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Bank of Korea this month raised its policy rate to a 10-year high of 3 percent by 50 basis points -- an increase that is twice the usual size. Such a bigger-than-usual hike, first seen in July, is also expected at the November meeting. The central bank expects higher borrowing costs to cool demand and corral inflation over time.  
&gt;  
&gt;And recession worries over monetary tightening is discouraging companies from borrowing and investors are too wary of liquidity stress. Last week, a consortium of securities companies failed to find investors to refund what will be one of the biggest housing projects in downtown Seoul.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The support measures we’re making public today do not warrant a shift in our monetary policy,” BOK Gov. Rhee Chang-yong said, hinting that the current pace of aggressive tightening aimed at tackling unbridled borrowing will remain unchanged.  
&gt;  
&gt;The top banker declined to elaborate on what the bank would do about the requests from local financial institutions -- banks, brokerages and insurance firms -- that they be able to take out more loans using their commercial papers as collateral. The bank’s seven-member board that makes a rate decision will look into the issue shortly, Rhee said.

Trading,Will the market rally ahead of the Fed meeting next week?,"A WSJ report by suggesting that the Federal Reserve may consider slowing the pace of their rate hikes in December seems to have fuelled Friday’s surge higher on Wall Street. 

The S&amp;P500 broke its downward channel coming from the mid-August highs early last week, and held above the former trendline resistance despite paring gains ahead of the sharp reversal on Friday. 

From a technical standpoint, this break of trend may indicate an easing in some of the immense selling pressure the market has been under in recent months. However, the move at the beginning of the week, as well as Friday’s rally, both stalled just below the index’s monthly pivot point, possibly pointing to a lack of a longer-term bullish bias. 

With the Fed now in its blackout ahead of next week’s meeting, it will be interesting to see if market speculation on a possible pivot from the US central bank can fuel a significant push higher over the coming days. 

Of course, all trading carries risk, especially with mega tech and other big names reporting this week, which will likely play a key role in investor sentiment and market direction. But either way, it will be interesting to see if $SPX upside remains capped at last week’s highs, or if the market can break higher ahead of the FOMC meeting.",finance,1666601401

personalfinance,Paying off old debt.,"Hi all! I have a debt from 2007 from Navy Federal Credit Union. It has long ago dropped off my credit report and I have since built a great credit score. I moved to a city earlier this year and have a NFCU close by. I have an USAA account, and they have decent interest rates, but there are no branches near me. I opened a PenFed account because I've heard good things about them, but their interest rates are significantly higher than USAA for me. To re-open a NFCU checking, or to borrow from them, I have to pay off the collections even though they sold off the debt.

So, if I pay off the debt in full in a single payment, will it show on my credit report? If it does, will it show as ""recent"" collections? Having a dip in my credit score is the only thing stopping me from paying it off. I've read comments in here that imply it will, and some that imply it may not, but I've had a difficult time finding anything concrete confirming either.",finance,1666603703
stocks,"Jeremy Siegel: ""I think we're gonna have the second-biggest housing price decline since post WWII period over the next 12 months."" Agree?","# Worse than 2008?  Do you agree with Professor Siegel?  Where do you see U.S. real estate prices heading in the next 12-18 months?

Some other expert opinions including Professor Siegel:

# Jeremy Siegel, Wharton professor of finance

""I expect housing prices fall 10% to 15%, and the housing prices are accelerating on the downside,"" Siegel told CNBC in a recent interview, noting that housing prices by any indicator are going down.

In a separate interview with CNBC, he said: ""I think we're gonna have the second-biggest housing price decline since post WWII period over the next 12 months. That's a very, very significant factor for wealth \[and\] for equity in the housing market.""

# Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics

""Buckle in. Assuming rates remain near their current 6.5% and the economy skirts recession, then national house prices will fall almost 10% peak-to-trough,"" he said in a recent tweet. ""Most of those declines will happen sooner rather than later. And house prices will fall 20% if there is a typical recession.""

In a recent housing report, he said: ""The housing market is the most interest-rate-sensitive sector of the economy. It's on the front lines of the fallout from the Fed's efforts to bring down inflation.""

""There's going to be a coast-to-coast downturn in the housing market. It's going to be brutal. No part of the market is immune.""

# David Rosenberg, veteran economist and Rosenberg Research chief

""We have a massive housing bubble right now. Most of the household balance sheet is residential real estate, and it is equities,"" Rosenberg said in a RealVision interview released this week.

The economist pointed to the Fed's tightening efforts to bring inflation down from recent rates of 8-9% to its 2% target.

""They want the stock market to go down. They want home prices to go down. Why? Because there's not a snowball's chance in hell they're going to get to their 2% holy grail consumer inflation, without there being a period now of asset deflation. It is 100% necessary.""

# Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist

The veteran economist agrees there's a severe downturn coming — but he expects it will be a while before higher rates really hit home prices and demand. 

""The Fed's rate hikes have indeed led to a sharp fall in applications for building permits. However, construction employment hasn't yet even begun to decline, presumably because many workers are still busy finishing houses started when rates were lower,"" he said in a recent comment piece.

""And the wider economic effects of the coming housing slump are still many months away,"" he said.

Shepherdson believes the steep drop in home sales hasn't hit bottom yet, and even buyers who set their sights lower to cheaper houses will still face bigger mortgage payments.

""We expect a drop of 15-to-20% over the next year, in order to restore the pre-COVID price-to-income ratio,"" the strategist said in a note last week. 

""In short, housing is in free-fall. So far, most of the hit is in sales volumes, but prices are now falling too, and they have a long way to go.""

# Don Peebles, real estate developer and Peebles Corp. CEO

""I think the housing market is on its way into a recession. We're going to see price declines — price declines have already begun to take place,"" Peebles told Fox News last week.

""I look at this as though we have this freight train out of control, speeding up, speeding up with low interest rates, and no one looked to start slowing it down or stepping on the brakes. Now all of a sudden its going to come crashing into the station,"" he said. 

# Chen Zhao, economics research lead at real estate brokerage Redfin

""The housing market is going to get worse before it gets better,"" Chao said last week, alongside a report that found a record 22% of homes for sale had a price drop in September.

""With inflation still rampant, the Federal Reserve will likely continue hiking interest rates. That means we may not see high mortgage rates — the primary killer of housing demand — decline until early to mid-2023.""

CryptoCurrency,Hyperinflation - my experience,"Since inflation is hot topic now days, I thought it might be interesting to some people to share my experience of living through hyperinflation during my early teenage years. Now, I don't believe that something like this is going to happen (at least not in western countries), since this was an extreme scenario with a few factors outside of monetary policy (e.g. war) that led to economy collapsing.

I've used this Wikipedia article to lookup numbers, and yes they are as bad as I remember.  
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation\_in\_the\_Federal\_Republic\_of\_Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia)

Quote ""Daily inflation was 62%, with an inflation rate of 2.03% in 1 hour being higher than the annual inflation rate of many developed countries"". I know this sounds crazy, but it really was like that. Whatever amount of money you had one day, it would be worth half the next day.

Now, with hyperinflation like this, 3 main things have happened.

1. Everyone was converting local currency to another stable currency, in this instance German Marks (DM). As soon as you would get paid, you'd run to exchange the money - and with 2% hourly inflation you better be quick. Exchanges were done outside of the banking system, on the street, via shady characters who would do the exchange. And it was done this way because -
2. The banking system collapsed. All the banks had was worthless currency that no one wanted. The banks stopped doing foreign currency exchange, because they ran out of liquidity. More importantly, fair number of people had foreign currency savings accounts, and you can guess what happened - the banks stopped all foreign currency withdrawals. So any savings you had in foreign currency (e.g. DM, USD, CHF) you couldn't withdraw.
3. People resorted to bartering where possible. Some state owned companies resorted to paying their employees in good they were producing rather than money. My mother worked as a teacher at an agricultural college, and they paid part of the salary with food that college was producing on its farms (fruit, vegetables, meat). This wasn't too bad as the choice and amount of food you could buy in shops was very limited. Hyperinflation kills production.

So that is a short summary. Again, I don't believe something like this will happen in western countries, but it gives a great example why self custody of scarce asset (e.g. BTC) is important.",cryptocurrency,1666611709

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto Platform Freeway With Very Unsustainable Practices And Offering Up to 43% APY Halts Withdrawals and Transactions Citing ‘Unprecedented Volatility’ , Token is Down 80%","There is a crypto staking platform called Freeway that has now halted withdrawals on their platform. In this market hard times for crypto platforms are expected, but Freeway seemed to have many unsustainable business practices.

* Freeway's main offering was their ""Supercharger simulations"" that offered up to 43% Annual Rewards on stakes denominated in BTC, ETH, EURO, USD, CAD, AUD and **GBP.** *They really goofed on that last one.*
* They also offered up to 21.5% per year of their Superchargers of Binance, Cardano, Polkadot and Gold.
* Staking your Freeway Token (FWT) and 15-30% (estimated) Annual Rewards.
* Referrals to Freeway and would earn you 8% of the annual rewards they earn each year for the first two years.

What I *really* hate about the platform is that their is *extremely* little information in the website when attempting to learn more about their products. The best you get is a **very** basic overview of the products names, the fiat/crypto it's denominated in and the apparent APY only. There's also a several minute long video that doesn't explain anymore more. And that is all you get.

Freeway claimed it had somehow obtained $160 million in TVL. On the website currency a popup shows states that there is unprecedented market volatility and that Freeway would be allocating capital to their underlying portfolio and would temporarily not be being back Supercharger buy-backs. They also state that ""when"" they do restart buy-backs, they would start **partial** buybacks and *then*  **full** buy-backs. The buy-back just means that you buy the ""Supercharger"" asset from them when you deposit and they buy it back from you in exchange for your owed cash when you are ready to withdraw so that you can actually withdraw money.

Freeway token has fallen 80% from a market cap of less than $70 million before the crash and now $10 million at current trading prices.

stocks,"JPMorgan president says a recession may be price to pay to beat inflation, market bottom not in yet","[JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/) President [Daniel Pinto](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/our-leadership/daniel-pinto) has vivid memories of what life is like when a country loses control of inflation.

As a child growing up in Argentina, Pinto, 59, said that inflation was often so high, prices for food and other goods spiked on an hourly basis. Workers could lose 20% of their salary if they didn't rush to convert their paycheck into U.S. dollars, he said.

""Supermarkets had these armies of people using machines to relabel products, sometimes 10 to 15 times a day,"" Pinto said. ""At the end of the day, they had to remove all the labels and start over again the next day.""

The experiences of Pinto, a Wall Street veteran who runs the [world's biggest investment bank](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2022/3rd-quarter/c363d5ac-0a3e-483e-88ec-89767a8e266e.pdf) by revenue, informs his views at a key time for markets and the economy.

After unleashing trillions of dollars in support of households and businesses in 2020, the Federal Reserve is grappling with inflation at four-decade highs by raising rates and pulling back on its debt-buying programs. The moves have cratered stocks and bonds this year and rippled around the world as a surging dollar complicates other nations' own battles with inflation.

Living with pervasive inflation was ""very, very stressful"" and is especially hard on low-income families, Pinto said in a recent interview from JPMorgan's New York headquarters. Price increases averaged more than [300% a year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Argentina#cite_note-ucematgu-80) in Argentina from 1975 to 1991.

## Aggressive Fed

While there is a growing chorus of voices who say that the Federal Reserve should slow or halt its rate increases amid some signs of price moderation, Pinto is not in that camp.

""That's why when people say, \`the Fed is too hawkish,' I disagree,"" said Pinto, who became JPMorgan's sole president and chief operating officer earlier this year, solidifying his status as CEO [Jamie Dimon](https://www.cnbc.com/jamie-dimon/)'s top lieutenant and potential successor.

""I think putting inflation back in a box is very important,"" he said. ""If it causes a slightly deeper recession for a period of time, that is the price we have to pay.""

The Fed can't allow inflation to become ingrained in the economy, according to the executive. A premature return to easier monetary policy risks repeating the mistakes of the 70s and 80s, he said.

That's why he thinks it's more likely the Fed errs on the side of being aggressive on rates. The Fed funds rate will probably peak at around 5%; that, along with a rise in unemployment, will likely curb inflation, Pinto said. The rate is currently in a 3% to 3.25% range.

## Markets haven't bottomed

Like a [string of other executives](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-warns-its-time-to-batten-down-the-hatches.html) have said recently, including Dimon and [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) CEO D[avid Solomon](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/18/goldman-ceo-david-solomon-says-theres-a-good-chance-of-a-recession-and-so-its-time-to-be-cautious.html), the U.S. faces a recession because of the Fed's predicament, Pinto said.

We are watching interest rates into next summer with hopes to purchase a house and want to make sure we are doing the right thing withholding our cash as we continue to rent and making the minimum payments on the car. $20something thousand on a down payment for a house will go a lot further than paying off the car loan and maybe saving 1-2k on interest on the 4 year auto loan.

* The Fed is realizing inflation is a smaller ""black hole of pain"" than previously thought, Fundstrat said.
* The firm pointed to softer comments from Fed officials that suggested a pause in December.
* A pivot on rate hikes could lead stocks to rally 16% through the end of this year, Fundstrat said. 

The Federal Reserve is starting to realize that inflation is a smaller ""black hole of pain"" than previously thought, and a pivot or pause on rate hikes could lead stocks to rally more than 16% by the end of the year, according to Fundstrat's head of research Tom Lee.

In a note on Monday, Lee pointed to recent comments by Fed officials, which dialed back some of the hawkishness that has roiled markets this year and sent the S&amp;P 500 falling 25% since January. Though inflation remains high, the Fed's Loretta Mester, James Bullard, and Neel Kashkari have made comments suggesting the Fed could pause on rate hikes in December. That led stocks to rally last week despite mixed corporate earnings reports.

""Inflation is becoming less of a blackhole of pain and the Fed sees that,"" Lee said. ""While skeptics say this is because something is 'gonna break,' commentary by Fed members show it is arguably more due to acknowledging that monetary policy takes time.""

Other experts have also noted inflation is trending down, raising concerns that the Fed could overtighten financial conditions if it plows forward with more aggressive rate increases. Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel noted that there is a lag of about 18 months between what Consumer Price Index data shows and what inflation is ""on the ground,"" meaning the inflation picture could be far less bleak than the Fed initially believed. 

""A more nuanced dialogue is taking place regarding CPI as well. \[The\] Fed conditioned markets to only focus on 'hard' data,"" Lee said. ""Many investors are starting to see the fallacy of looking at lagged CPI versus leading \[CPI indicators\],"" he added. 

Labor market conditions are also showing signs of cooling, a key signal the Fed is watching for to understand if inflation is easing. 

""All of this, in our view, are reasons that any equity rally should exceed that seen in July, which was the 'false dawn of a Fed pivot,'"" Lee said, noting that the rally in July lasted for 23 days and resulted in stocks gaining 16%. Already, the S&amp;P 500 gained 3% in an impressive turnaround last week, boosted by hope the central bank will ease up on aggressive measures to control inflation. 

But other analysts remain skeptical. Ned Davis Research noted that a Fed pause in interest rate hikes wouldn't be enough to boost stocks, and any gains made would be fleeting until the Fed signals a true policy pivot. And a pivot likely won't happen until the Fed sees clearer inflation data, more softness in the labor market, or ""something breaks in the financial system,"" the research firm added, casting some doubt on any potential upside for stocks.",finance,1666623088

Realistically, the Fed is at an unprecedented cross-road: they can either continue hiking their rate hence technically collapsing the whole financial system, especially developing countries, OR they'll pivot (i.e. to stop rate hike or even lower to 50 or 25 bps).

Of-course they can go either way. But at this rate, I don't think the former one gets a good chance.

I explained to them my financial situation (not great) and they actually waived the whole thing, which was great. But late last year I started receiving bills from other practices/hospitals for the same service; I think what was explained eventually was that these places were the ones actually meeting with me at the ER, and they were billing for their portion. This was never explained to me during the visits, I only learnt this when multiple people were billing me for the same services.

At the beginning of the year I started getting hounded by calls and letters from different agencies - I've lost track of the different groups claiming I owe THEM this money now. The bills actually showed up on my credit reports. But it all went quiet after I sent a few of them a letter requesting written proof of the debt, along with written proof that I had authorized the hospital to release my information to them. The credit report cleared up, and I thought it had been dropped (it was only $1,400 x 2, I figured they had bigger game to hunt).

Until today, when I see the collections again on my TU and Experian reports. I've taken about a 70 point hit this weekend. And it's almost exactly over a year since the original visits, which I think I read something about how unpaid medical debt won't appear on your report for a year?

The thing is, besides some calls I ignored (ie. didn't answer because caller ID showed something about credit), I haven't received any communication from anyone claiming to be chasing this debt up now. I would have expected a formal letter or bill to have been sent out before it hit my report, because I thought I had read a while ago that it's illegal for companies to report a debt without giving you a chance to settle it. But would that not apply because this is technically the same debt that someone's been after for a year already? I don't believe I had any previous contact with the two companies mentioned in my report, First Fed Credit Control and Amerifinancial Solutions. I definitely haven't received any letters from them in the last six months.

So I'm just looking for suggestions on where to go next. Dispute with the credit bureaus, dispute with the collections, or just ignore it for 6 more years? Thanks all.",finance,1666626080

*  5k loan from aunt to finish schooling (pay 100 a month interest free once I started working)
* 3.2k credit card debt (generally low proportionally, but want to have these paid off as to not accrue too much interest)
* Generous health insurance from the employer (No Premium) debating on whether I should take it or stay with my parents insurance until i'm 26.
* 1k a month Bills (rent, utilities, groceries etc.)  (based out of Pittsburgh)
* Employer matches 401k 12% of gross pay (with the option for an additional 3% match)

I reached out to them and here is what they replied

 ***The interest rate changes monthly, as a function of the  overall interest rate environment. In September, the effective interest  rate was 1.37% (annual rate). When the new policy becomes effective on  19th November 2022, if the interest rate is the same, the user would  receive interest on their idle cash at a 0.34% annual rate.*** 

 ***Vested still supports commission-free trading. The reduction  in interest rate for the program, is to support an increase in  administrative clearing costs. DriveWealth currently only offers two  options for Vested users, where the user can either opt-out of the bank  sweep program interest, or opt-in at a reduced interest rate.***   
***Vested  does not have control over the money that is wired to your DriveWealth  brokerage account. DriveWealth manages order execution and bank sweeps  from your account, but only at your direction.*** 

TLDR- The interest rate is 1.37% annually, as of now, and come 19th November Vested will take a cut of 1.03% and if the user does not want Vested to take the cut then the user will have to let go of the 0.34% interest also.  They are taking 75% of the monthly interest amount. 

Is this even allowed by the SEC? I mean a user is wiring money to DriveWealth and DriveWealth is giving interest to the user. Now Vested is asking a cut out of it and if the user does not agree to that then the user will have to let go of the whole interest. Doesn't this sound weird to you? Also DriveWealth is supposed to credit interest to a user's account then how will Vested take their share out of it?  What if a user does not give permission to DriveWealth to give his/her interest to Vested, then can they still take the 75% share  that they are asking for?   


Reached out to DriveWealth and they are like go talk to Vested. Can apps like Vested/Robinhood etc. do this? Is there any nodal or appellate team in the SEC from where we can clarify this? Will they even reply to investors who are not based in the US?

personalfinance,Need help—taking out a loan for debt consolidation and a car without current proof of income,"I’m 30 and struggling. I just moved cross-country for mental health reasons and won’t be able to work full-time for a few months because I’ll be in a part-time outpatient program.

I’m moving from NYC, where I didn’t need a car, but I do here in Arizona. Understandably, it’s seeming impossible to lease or buy a used car when I can’t provide pay stubs. I also have about $20k in credit card debt, most of which is from therapy and other medical bills. With this move I’ve also had to purchase my own health insurance for the first time. I’ve accepted that I’ll be in debt for awhile but I have pretty good credit and I think the best way to go would be to take out some sort of personal loan for about $30k and get a lower interest rate than the ones on my credit cards. That way I’ll be able to purchase a car and consolidate my debt, paying it off at a lower interest rate. I do also have about $40k in a brokerage fund but I think it’s wise to leave it there and hopefully accrue interest over time. I will have to pull out of that for living expenses for the next few months, but that’ll be short-term. I have a masters degree and I’m a therapist so I’m hopeful that I’ll be able to pay this all off eventually with some restructuring and hard work.

Is taking out a loan wise? Where should I look for a loan—what companies are legitimate and what kinds of interest rates would be reasonable with a 730 credit score? I need to get this under control and figure out how to get a car. Any recommendations would be so helpful because I feel lost and have no idea where to start.",finance,1666633106
personalfinance,PLOC Interest Arbitrage?,"I have access to a Personal Line of Credit (PLOC) at a 2.5% interest rate since it was opened a year ago before rates soared. I have a little less than one year left in the 2 year draw period (I pay no interest during the draw period). I can get 3% on a high yield savings account from Citizens. Should I draw my full PLOC and stuff it in a high yield savings account for interest rate arbitrage?

Other than the high yield savings account interest rate moving lower than my PLOC rate at some point in the future, why else would this not make sense?",finance,1666637484
personalfinance,Should I take out an auto loan now or try to improve my credit first?,"My car broke down permanently, so I'm in the market for a new one. I applied for an auto loan (about $10k financed, pre-approved for 48 months at 4.35% though I'm still considering changing the length) with a credit union a while ago, but my credit score dropped a lot since then. Just over 700 down to 620ish. 

The main thing hurting my score is that my usage percentage is high because I'm still on a student card with a low $700 limit. I'm in my first year out of school, working full time, living alone, etc. So it's pretty easy to spend up to my limit. A couple days ago I applied for a new card with a higher limit and was accepted. I know it was another hard credit check, but I think the benefits should outweigh that soon. Wish I did that sooner though. Also, I didn't realize asking to raise the limit on my current card was even an option until after I applied, whoops. Maybe I should do that too?

The more minor factors lowering my credit are a short history and few lines of credit. Obviously I can't do much about the former, and the latter won't improve until I take out the loan. My payment history is great though, I have no late payments and usually pay off my whole balance at the end of the month.

Anyway, back to the auto loan. Would it be a better idea to buy now and maybe refinance later once my credit score improves, or wait for my score to improve first? If it wasn't for the low availability of new cars nowadays and federal rates increasing, I'd definitely wait. I've been making due so far between my work truck and getting rides from friends for personal things, but I don't want to do that long term. I would expect my credit score will probably be better than it's ever been in a few months; though then I'd have to re-apply for the auto loan and have yet another hard check.",finance,1666638669
personalfinance,"Girlfriend and I split up but both names are on mortgage. She's willing to give me 100%, but lender won't allow us to remove her name?","My ex and I were together for nearly a decade and owned our home together.  When I originally bought the house, I put both of our names on the mortgage, but paid for everything myself, and have continued making mortgage payments entirely on my own.    


Unfortunately, we've decided to split up, and because I paid for 100% of the house so far, she said she'll sign whatever she needs to in order to give me 100% equity in the home.    


I've spoken to our mortgage lender, who said that unfortunately, an FHA loan like ours only allows us to remove a name if we can provide a divorce decree, which we don't have due to us never being legally married. Our only other option would be to sell or refinance, which is an absolute last result right now due to how bad the market is doing. Finally, we could obviously stay as is, but that adds risk in the sense that she could eventually decide she wanted half the house, or at bare minimum she may have trouble renting her own place due to her name still legally being on the mortgage.    


Right now we owe \~400k and have a 3.5% interest rate.  Looking at the math for refinancing right now seems like it would be financial suicide to refinance.  Sale wise, I'd love to keep the home, but I'm not sure if I have any other real options.  The home has appreciated in value, Zillow estimates it's worth \~600k now, but I'm not sure what sort of tax implications I'd have if I sold the home and didn't immediately put the money into a new property.

stocks,On an infrastructure stock,"My father and I have a position on this small cap firm.

He has been holding a position for several years now, increased his holdings the previous year when the firm completed a capital raise to pay down debt and here we are. I bought a small position on this. 

But this year has been horrible to this stock and I don't understand why. 

So I would like your opinion on it, as my father is fed up with this (I am 99% sure he is not going to sell his holdings anytime soon but I am a bit startled) and I would like to recommend him to calm down but I don't know how.

Previous year and in 2020 two twin Mexican brothers bought a stake on it (in 2020 and 2021, 26%) with the intend on making it profitable again (they are in the board as president and vicepresident). Previous management, who basically owned it -60%- until very recently (now they have 7% of the shares), has been horrible and even involved the firm in several scandals, in my country and abroad as well, among other questionable practices I am not getting into now.

There has also been a thorough effort in reducing debt.

1H Sales have rosen 10% this year so did EBITDA and EBIT (34% and 834% respectively and the last number is right) but they made a loss on net income (due to: impairment on one building they half own on a big city, impairment on repurchased bonds and exchange rate impairments).

I regard the outcomes as positive. The company has enough cash to buy itself at current prices and there would even be cash left and it is trading at 0.33x of its book value.

On the previous week they had to cancel the sale of a stake in a hospital bestowal in Canada, as the terms for the sale hadn't been fulfilled by the other party... And since then the stock has slumped 25% (in just two days!). That money would haven used to further reduce debt. But that stake is still generating revenue for the firm and it is still on sale.

Previous Friday the firm had to release a statement reiterating their debt and profit targets, basically proving they don't have any idea of what's going on with the stock.

I am insisting my father to stop worrying for the business, stop looking at its quotation at every minute and to stop commenting on forums and chat groups about this stock because it is detrimental but he cannot help it. 

I have insisted on him there are several traits in this business (9 or 10) Peter Lynch looks for before investing in a business and I do believe this stock is heavily undervalued.

I am in grad school and currently unemployed because of it. I will graduate next year and start working in October/November where I’ll be making 235k a year. My husband is financially supporting us right now and makes around 125k 

We currently live in a unicorn of an apartment: great location, perfect size for us, and only $700 a month. We love living here and our plan was to live here for maybe a year or two after I graduate to allow us to invest more and also travel more (which we haven’t been able to do much of since I’ve been in school). 

A few days ago we came across a condo that is listed for 275k, in a great area, and would be the perfect property to rent out in a few years. So we started thinking, what if we ditch this $700/month apartment and bought this condo. The only maybe problem is that with the interest rates, HOA fee (includes all utilities and property maintenance), and taxes, the monthly mortgage comes out to about 50% of my husbands monthly net income, so we would be cutting it close until I am able to work (so for about a year). We don’t have a lot of other bills (maybe $500/month) but it would still be an adjustment. 

Is this a risky financial decision considering the mortgage compared to my husbands monthly income for the next year? And is now a good time to buy? I’ve heard conflicting information.

&gt;Helpful tips:

&gt;The limit is applied per social security number (SSN) of the first-named registrant or employer identification number (EIN) of an entity.

personalfinance,Federal Housing Finance Agency will require use of two new Credit Scores (FICO 10T and Vantagescore 4.0) for Fannie Mae &amp; Freddie Mac,"The public bureau credit scores used for US mortgages currently are very old models, called FICO Score 2, 4 and 5 (referring to the different credit bureaus used).  These formulas were generated literally decades ago.

There are more modern suites of scores, FICO 8 (2009), FICO 9 (2014) and FICO 10 (2020), but they have not be used in mortgage lending because of the dominance of Fannie Mae &amp; Freddie Mac in wholesale mortgage purchases &amp; securitization.

Their regulator has issued new guidance which will require the use of more modern scores FICO 10T and Vantagescore 4. 

I'm not as familiar with Vantagescore 4, but the changes from old FICO scores to 10T should generally be positive, in the sense of ""more fair"", to most people.  The biggest one to my mind is that the new score will consider medical collections as less disadvantageous than other collections, as often it is involuntary and a result of insurance or provider problems and not directly reflecting personal creditworthiness.  Fully paid off collections will also count much less as will small collections amounts.

The ""T"" in the 10T score means that it looks at trends through time unlike all previous credit bureau scores.  So someone who has been successful at paying back debt through time, or has an occasional high balance, will have that reflected as a better score. Conversely someone whose position is deteriorating and has been carrying high utilization for a long time will be seen, legitimately, as a worse risk.

economy,How to fix America: Unemployment,"Dr. Baker explains how the employment rate in the economy is a matter of the government's fiscal and monetary policy. Baker contrasts the macroeconomic insights of John Maynard Keynes vs. the more recent views of Milton Friedman when it comes to government spending, unemployment, and inflation. Baker goes on analyze the Federal Reserve's role with particular attention to the decision of recent board chairs (Volker, Greenspan, Bernanke, Yellen, and Powell) on setting interest rates (federal funds rate) and the policy goals they have targeted.

Baker explains how fiscal and monetary policy has lately focused more on limiting budget deficits and fighting inflation, rather than maintaining high levels of employment. Abandonment of post-war Keynesian full employment policy, and embrace of the Monetarist NAIRU fiction since 1980, has allowed the US government (and the Federal Reserve in particular) to engineer recessions and tolerate excessively high levels of unemployment.

What's the fix? Dean proposes to restore full employment as a macroeconomic policy goal and ensure that workers at the middle and bottom of the wage ladder have the bargaining power to secure wage gains. The Federal Reserves should be focused on maintaining full employment, rather than being obsessed with inflation and prematurely raising rates to the detriment of employment and labor markets.",finance,1666649902
Economics,"How to fix America: Intellectual Property, Unemployment, CEO pay, Finance, Employment, Inequality","Intellectual Property
&gt;Dean Baker tells the dirty secret of the great billionaires of the modern age: they wouldn’t exist without intellectual property (IP), that is the copyright and patent monopolies guaranteed to private actors by the government.

&gt;IP laws have been expanded and strengthened in recent years, making patent &amp; copyright monopolies longer and stronger and enabling the vast fortunes of billionaires in computers, software, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment etc. Baker diagnoses the role of intellectual property (IP) in the accumulation of wealth for pharmaceutical companies and how that translates to excessively high drug prices, and wasteful spending on marketing and lawsuits. IP laws were intended to subsidize innovation for social benefit, but they have been transformed into tools to accumulate and protect enormous private wealth. The modern protections of IP have become excessive and may not be the most fruitful producer of research and development beneficial for society.

&gt;What's the fix? Dean’s proposals include direct public funding of open research &amp; development, rather than rely on IP alone, which will allow the development of generics. He proposes the introduction of a Copyright Tax Credit to support innovation and creative work as a temporary alternative to copyright. Meaning creators and artists could sign for a tax credit to fund their projects but forego copyright for a set number of years.

Unemployment
&gt;Dr. Baker explains how the employment rate in the economy is a matter of the government's fiscal and monetary policy. Baker contrasts the macroeconomic insights of John Maynard Keynes vs. the more recent views of Milton Friedman when it comes to government spending, unemployment, and inflation. Baker goes on analyze the Federal Reserve's role with particular attention to the decision of recent board chairs (Volker, Greenspan, Bernanke, Yellen, and Powell) on setting interest rates (federal funds rate) and the policy goals they have targeted.

The Federal Reserves should be focused on maintaining full employment, rather than being obsessed with inflation and prematurely raising rates to the detriment of employment and labor markets.

CEO pay
&gt;Dean Baker explains how CEO pay has increased enormously over the past four decades while shareholder returns have remained low. Weak corporate governance has allowed management to 'capture' corporate boards – and push through massive executive pay increases.

&gt;Baker shows how in many cases their compensation has nothing to do with the return to shareholders. Baker breaks down the CEO pay scam into four parts: patterns of CEO pay, the alternative argument for CEO pay, evidence that CEOs are overpaid, and why it matters. He asks the simple question of what is the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio, why is it so high, and is a fair market or highway robbery? While providing a brief explanation of why CEO pay increases may be justified, he provides evidence CEOs do not earn their pay. Special emphasis is on the CEO and shareholder relationship and the lack of consequences for famous CEOs like Robert Nardelli, John Stumpf, Dennis Muilenburg.

&gt;Finally, Baker prescribes fixes to CEO pay such as using a ""say on pay"" legislation, giving minority shareholders more of a say, mutual fund proxy votes, and higher marginal tax rates.

Finance
&gt;The financial sector produces a lot of wealth... and waste. Dean Baker explains why it's bloated and broken.

&gt;Since the 1980s, the financial sector has been permitted to expand greatly, with deregulation and practically no taxes. This was all done in the hope of improving efficiency in the allocation of capital and the economy overall. But Dr. Baker shows that while the financial sector has grown, it has not fulfilled its promise - it has not improved productivity, it ties up and wastes a lot of resources, it produces periodic socially devastating crises and relies on government to bail out its poor decisions, it has generated vast individual fortunes at the top unjustified by its returns.

&gt;What's the fix? Dr. Baker recommends a financial transaction tax (FTT) to curb its reckless growth, improved competition in financial services, including government-provided retirement and bank accounts, better regulation of financial products, and ending the favorable tax treatment of hedge funds and private equity.

Employment
&gt;Competition isn't for everyone. The salaries of high-end professionals are often artificially protected by public policy, without benefit to the public.

&gt;Over the past forty years, US trade deals have been negotiated to expose manufacturing workers to international competition and put downward pressure on their wages, while protecting high end professionals from both domestic and foreign competition. This has increased wage disparity and inequality between low and highly educated workers in the US.

&gt;Dr. Baker compares the salaries for high end professionals (physicians, lawyers, dentists, etc.) on the income distribution. Barriers to entry like licensing regulations have been put in place to protect high-earning medical practitioners from both domestic and foreign competition. Insurance regulations allow specialists to set their own compensation. Lawyer incomes benefit from unnecessary complexity in legal processes, tax codes and intellectual property laws. These are all state policies that have protected the earnings of highly educated professionals.

&gt;By contrast, manufacturing jobs have declined in the US, and there has been downward pressure on the wages of less-educated workers. Much of it is due to the increased competition brought about by foreign trade deals negotiated over the past few decades. This was a conscious policy choice. The absolute decline in incomes in low-wage sectors was already predicted by the famous Stolper-Samuelson theorem in international trade theory.

Inequality
&gt;Dean Baker revisits the major policy implications of the series.

&gt;To Unf★ck America we need to lower the age for Medicare and expand Medicaid, add a public option to buy in, shrink the role of patents to bring competition back to the marketplace, and strengthen price controls on patented drugs. He also suggests policies at the state and local level like increasing minimum wage, providing unemployment insurance, creative work tax credits, and to increase corporate tax rates. He also urges more democratic decision making in private institutions. Finally, think like a Republican, but not in the way you think!

# Introduction

## Background

Intel used to be a giant in the microchip and semiconductor sector, but recently it found itself eclipsed by its competitor in matters of quality, strategic development and public perception. Those changes are due to its recent management team, which stagnated the company and slowed it with bad management decisions. With the new CEO Pat Gelsinger and his expertise, direct experience and know-how in the sector, the company is moving out from its slowdown and trying to catch up with its main rivals.

## Purpose

The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the development of Intel Corporation (INTC) during the past four years, from 2018 to 2021 and forecast its activity for the next five years. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration but also macroeconomics factors and its main competitor Advanced Micro Device (AMD).

All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?
* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

## Hypothesis

* INTC is not a dying company
* INTC downtrend is following the sector and the market movement
* INTC is a cyclical business, and we are in a down cycle
* INTC investments will boost its revenues in the next five years
* USA government will not allow one of its pivotal and strategic company to fail
* INTC will face more stress as AMD is eating market share
* INTC’s new products are the top-notch of the sector

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

## Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of 30 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.45% and its Growth Rate of 18.26% to determine a fair value of **$23.57** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|18.26|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$97.53**

&amp;#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|18.26%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,106,000,000|

## Dividend Discount Model

The dividend discount model (DDM) is a quantitative method used for predicting the price of a company's stock based on the theory that its present-day price is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments when discounted back to their present value.

The model gives a negative number when companies have a lower rate of return compared to the dividend growth rate. This may happen when a company continues to pay dividends even if it is incurring a loss or relatively lower earnings, as per Intel Case. This makes this model not good to be used alone when evaluating a business.

Knowing this, the model is still used here, mainly because the final price tag is determined by the average of all the methods. This choice is made by the necessity of conservative estimates and cautious predictions. The discounted rating used here is the CAPM of 7.01%.

The model gives the following result:

|Fair Value, taking in count a perpetual growth rate. Here we used the company growth rate of 18.26% and not the average growth rate of the dividends. This is due to the fact that the price given by the dividend growth is considered to be unrealistic for the next five years.|$-15.36|
|:-|:-|
|Fair Value assuming a zero growth in the dividends' growth. This price is not used to determine the final value due to the fact that the company has historically paid dividends with constant growth, and it is predicted to not stop this trend.|$24.62|

&amp;#x200B;

## Total Payout Model

It is a variation of the DDF that takes in count shares repurchases. With 5.64 Billion paid in dividend in 2021, discount rate of 7.01% (CAPM) and growth rate of 18.26%, this model gives us a price tag of -**$12.22**

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$23.57|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$97.53|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|$56.67|
|Dividend Discount Model|$-15.36|
|Total Payout Model|\-$12.22|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$30.04**|

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor’s sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|

# The Products

|**CGC – Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|
|:-|
|**NEX – Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|
|**DCAI – Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|
|**AXG – Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|
|**IFS – Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|
|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|

# Financials

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&amp;C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&amp;E

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product’s portfolio, where AMD doesn’t have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival’s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel’s perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend’s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $30.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

personalfinance,Would buying this car be stupid?,"I've gone back and forth over and over again on whether I should get another car and can't decide which would be the financially smart idea.

I'm starting a new job where I'll be making 45k, which isn't a bunch of money but it's more than I've made before by a decent bit and is a job in a field that was really hard to break into.

I currently have a 2006 Camry with 280k miles. I'm happy with my car, but it's far from perfect. I just had to put $1200 into repairs, the motor doesn't sound great, it needs a new valve cover gasket and is burning through oil like crazy, probably close to a quart every few hundred miles, maybe more, I'm sure there's plenty more repairs coming up behind that as well. 

My new job is going to be work from home, but that's after 4 months of training. For the first four months I need to go into the office and it's pretty important I don't miss time during training. 
With my current car I could see two issues arising: breaking down and needing to miss work while my car is in the shop, and I live in a neighborhood that's really hard to get in and out of in the snow. My biggest fear is I have mediocre credit, so I don't know if my bank will even give me a car loan with a new job, and if my Camry completely broke down, I'd be beyond screwed  and end up losing the new job I've spent a lot of time working towards.

I'm considering buying a Crosstrek for around $15k, payments would end up being around $300 a month since I have a shitty interest rate and nothing to put down. But having two cars, one of which does well in the snow will help make sure I get through training without issues, then I can sell my Camry after training.

My rent is $500 a month, which is around 20% of my take home income, this car would be around 10%, so between the two I'd be around 30% of my income after taxes, and before bonuses.

I PREDICT my I come will go up pretty well after a year or two based on the field I'm working in, and since I'm spending a massive anount if time learning the skills to gain more income, but that's a future hypothetical, not the situation I'm in now.

While both the car and my rent would only be 30% of my take home income, and most likely a smaller percentage in the future. It still feels incredibly stupid because I don't have money to put down, combine that with a pretty high interest rate and a terrible car market and it seems like a pretty stupid financial decision.

I'm incredibly unsure of what to do, if I had some crystal ball where I knew my Camry wouldn't have any issues I'd just slap some snow tires on it here in a month and call it a day. But if my Camry does break down, then I'm going to be super duper screwed.

personalfinance,l warning about Personal Capital Cash,"Just a heads up to anyone considering Personal Capital Cash:

Perhaps my experience is not typical but I have spent countless hours trying to withdraw funds over the past 3 week and still have not been successful. Support has been very friendly but unable to coordinate well enough to facilitate my withdrawal or linking of external accounts. I've called over and over again and always get told that they have made note of my request and will have the cash department send the forms needed, which never come or are unreplied to when filled out and submitted.  

I've sent mico deposits attempting to link my account to 3 plus major banks (Chase/Charles Schwab and Sofi) and their site always errors out when inputing the amounts. Beyond that, I've sent account statements, copies of my drivers license, selfies, and more, multiple times into a black hole and they never get responded to. 

I have an email chain with support a mile long and have made in excess of 10 calls to support trying to remedy this. No one has been able to assist enough to actually make the transfer happen to any of my other external accounts via ACH, wire or any other means despite me badgering them (nicely, I understand it's not the support people's fault) for 3 weeks. 

The incompetence of the company and its procedures  is nothing short of appalling. I'm not a banker but work in real estate and finance and have loads of experience with ACH and wire transfers. 

If you are considering placing funds with Personal Capital Cash, make damn sure you don't need them anytime soon and are willing to spend an unreasonable amount of time working through even them most basic of transfers. 

They may have a high interest rate but it hasn't been even close to worth the trouble.

personalfinance,Newlyweds May Have Made a Mistake on W-4's and Taxes Help,"Hi all,

I'll cut to the chase. 
We're newlyweds that are 22 years old. Apologies in advance for being very naive about the tax world.

I started a job in January for a 37k gross salary. In June I got a raise to about ~40k.
My wife has been working retail that pays about $14 hourly, only ~20 hours a week part time.

When I filled my W-4 in January, I put Married Filing Jointly. My wife doesn't know what forms she filled and I've never worked retail so I don't know what's typical. She just switched chains this month and I'm assuming filled another form, but she doesn't remember which one. She says she thinks she remembers putting Married Filing Separately but she's not sure. Apparently the chain has some kind of online system so she never even saw the form, meanwhile I did what I'm assuming is an old-school literally paper fill-out of the W-4?

All my taxes are withheld from my paycheck- Federal Income Tax, Connecticut Income Tax, Social Security, and Medicare. Almost exactly 25% of my paycheck goes to all my taxes.

My wife's first paycheck came in and only Social Security and Medicare are withheld.

Here's where things get a little complicated I think. We live with my wife's in-laws and my wife is still on their health insurance, and we don't pay rent. Thus, they claim her as a dependent, and last year we had had a big scramble when my in-laws' return was rejected because we filed Jointly even though they claimed her as a dependent, and we had to re-file Separately. When we got to April and we realized this, I should've changed the W-4 I filled in January to Filing Separately. But I didn't. And all this time it's been Filing Jointly.

No deductions or anything. No car payments. We don't pay any rent and do not have any 401k's. I opened a Roth IRA and contributed 3k this year so far.

My questions are:
1. How screwed am I? Am I going to owe a ton of taxes when I file because I didn't withhold correctly?
2. Should we have Step 2(c) checked on our W-4's, even if we're Filing Separately? What should my wife do about the W-4 filled at her old employer as she doesn't work there anymore? I honestly don't know but I'd bet that neither of us have had this checked. Is this also going to screw us when we file because we didn't withhold correctly? 
3. I'm assuming income taxes aren't being withheld on my wife's paychecks because she doesn't make enough? Just want to verify this is normal for her income.",finance,1666660683

stocks,Strategist David Rosenberg skewers the Federal Reserve as he sees a 30% hit to home prices and the S&amp;P 500 returning to an early 2020 low,"The last time David Rosenberg shared his outlook for the U.S. stock market and the economy with MarketWatch, in late May, it was depressing enough.

&amp;#x200B;

“I feel like I am reliving the summer of 2008,” Rosenberg wrote then. He speculated that the S&amp;P 500 SPX, +1.19% — then trading above 3,900 points — would ultimately flirt with 3,300.

&amp;#x200B;

Rosenberg is the widely followed president and chief economist and strategist of Toronto-based Rosenberg Research &amp; Associates Inc. His sobering outlook last May echoed his thinking from March 2022, when he called the Federal Reserve’s intention to hike U.S. interest rates “not a good idea” and predicted that the inflation-fighting move would trigger a painful economic recession.

&amp;#x200B;

Five rate hikes later, with more expected, Rosenberg is even more pessimistic about the stock market and the economy in 2023 — and to say he’s disappointed with the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell would put it mildly.

&amp;#x200B;

“The Fed’s job is to take the punch bowl away as the party gets started, but this version of the Fed took the punch bowl away at 4 a.m.,” Rosenberg said, “when everybody was pissed drunk.”

&amp;#x200B;

Many market experts and economists are now coming to Rosenberg’s side of the fence — criticizing the Fed for waiting too long to battle inflation and warning that the central bank now may be moving too fast and too far.

&amp;#x200B;

But Rosenberg is leaning even further over the railing. Here’s what he says investors, homeowners and workers can expect in the year ahead: The S&amp;P 500 tumbles to as low as 2,700 (the lowest since April 2020), U.S. home prices decline by 30%, and the unemployment rate rises. The U.S. economy sinks into a recession, for which the Fed — especially Powell — would be largely to blame.

&amp;#x200B;

“He went from Bambi to Godzilla,” Rosenberg says of Powell’s radical and rapid transformation from inflation skeptic to inflation slayer. Adds Rosenberg: “Powell was getting compared to \[disgraced 1970s Fed Chair\] Arthur Burns. Nobody in central banking wants to be compared to Arthur Burns. This is the reality.”

&amp;#x200B;

Reality admittedly isn’t something the financial markets have had much of a grip on in the past several years, with essentially free money and a hands-off Fed fueling a go-go investing climate. “Now that movie is running in reverse,” Rosenberg says, and the reality here is that the next scenes will be tough ones.

&amp;#x200B;

But since markets are cyclical, the Fed’s flushing inflation and dumping the punch bowl should lead to a new bull market for stocks, bonds and other risk assets, Rosenberg says. He sees this fresh start beginning in 2024, so don’t despair — that’s less than 15 months away.

In this mid-October interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, Rosenberg discussed the challenging conditions investors face now and offered his top ideas for their money over the next 12 months — including Treasury bonds, stock sectors that can profit from longer-term business trends and technology themes, and good old-fashioned cash.

&amp;#x200B;

MarketWatch: You’ve been skeptical of the Fed’s interest-rate hikes since they began last March. But it seems that your skepticism has morphed into a kind of disbelief. What is the Fed doing now that is so unprecedented?

&amp;#x200B;

Rosenberg: The Fed is ignoring market signals and chasing lagging indicators like the year-over-year in the CPI and the unemployment rate. I’ve never seen the Fed at any point before this version totally dismiss what’s happening on the supply side of the economy and totally ignore what’s happening from market signals. I’ve never seen the Fed tighten this aggressively into a raging bull market for the U.S. dollar DXY, -0.18%. I’ve never seen the Fed tighten this aggressively into a major decline, not just in the stock market but in the most economically sensitive stocks. I’ve never seen the Fed tighten this aggressively into an inverted yield curve or into a bear market in commodities.",finance,1666663532

I contribute to my company's 401k, HSA, as well as max out my Roth IRA each year, and we pay off our credit card in full each month. My car payment is **$550 per month** but I just set up another autopayment for **$500 towards the principal** to pay it off quicker instead of putting that money in my taxable brokerage.

 In my mind, I could sell my stocks in my brokerage account, pay off the loan, and free up **$1,100k / month** to contribute back into my brokerage to buy stocks while the market is down. This would guarantee me a 4.49% return on my money, and free up my monthly cash flow for more investing during this economic downturn. I know that nothing is ever certain, but when I saw that Michael Burry from the Big Short sold all of his stocks recently... makes me think the market is going to be in the red for quite some time.

personalfinance,"Screwed up 2019 state taxes, easiest way to file amended return?","I got a letter from the Massachusetts department of revenue that I owed tax money due to an internal audit.

In 2019 I was living in Massachusetts and worked two jobs

Job 1 in MA, $1,278 in taxes were withheld to MA.  
Job 2 in CT, $715 in taxes were withheld to CT.   


The CT W2 has two sheets, one that has the federal withholding info, and also lists MA in box 15, with the state ID info, and in box 16 for wages, has the wages the CT company paid me, but box 17 and so on are unfilled, so no taxes withheld to MA. The second W2 sheet for the CT has no federal info, just CT listed in box 15 with the ID info, and then the same wages in box 16, but then box 17 is filled with the tax withholding.

MA DOR is telling me that I owe that $715 for them as it was reported but they don't have a record of it. When I filed my 2019 taxes, I must have only done a federal return and one state return for MA, as on my MA return I put that there was $1,993 was withheld to MA. Not sure how I screwed this up; I used TaxAct that year and would've assumed I answered all the questions correctly. Clearly I did not.

I have until October 28th to file an appeal. Obviously I will file an appeal but I'm wondering the best way to go about it. I assume I need to file an amended MA tax return to show the proper amount of withholding that went to the MA DOR. I would think I also need to file a CT return to ensure I don't owe or am eligible for a refund. 

It doesn't seem like TaxAct will let me amend a tax return more than two years back online, so I will need to print out all the 2019 MA return forms, fill them in manually as an amended return, and make sure the numbers add up from my two W2s to only include the one job's withholding.

It seems that I can file a CT tax return online for 2019 in whichever way is easiest for me.

Basically my question comes down to: do I just fill out the amended MA return, fill out a CT return, and then send in copies of both returns + copies of my W2s to the Massachusetts DOR for the appeal? And they'll just look at it and say, okay, this guy just fucked up, all set to go? Or does that tax money have to go to MA somehow from CT because I lived in MA?

I've paid the tax, at this point I'm just not sure the best way to get the money to go to the right people and be cleared off my end. If anyone has any experience with this and can point me to the easiest way to get it all done (especially if there's any way I can fill out an amended MA return electronically. Can I just fill in all the info on like FreeTaxUSA, and then copy all that info over to a paper return/print it and mark it as amended?) that would be great.",finance,1666671483

It hasn't been this low since 2009. Does this mean that people are running out of money to spend? Hence, we could see inflation slow down now because people can't afford excessive purchases anymore. People have exhausted their covid money and then some.

The $4.8 trillion during covid was caused by people's fears of the economy collapsing so they saved, stimulus checks, and the lack of things to spend their money on due to stay-at-home orders.

Also, it's quite shocking to see how Americans are able to spend their money so fast. It's as if people thought the boom was going to last forever and that they weren't ever going to run out of money. The average American can't seem to see beyond the next 3 months. Personally, my savings have actually increased because I didn't believe this boom would last forever.

There is a theory on inflation that suggests inflation is partly psychological and not based in reality. People and businesses just expect inflation after a while so workers continuously ask for higher wages which in turn causes businesses to charge higher prices. Here, we can see that people actually have less money now to spend than in 2009. To break this cycle, the fed needs to provide an interest rate shock like what Volcker did. \[0\]\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]

**The main question is: is there a correlation between personal savings and inflation? Another question is if personal savings is now so low, why are people still spending so much? Is is because of their gain in home equity (which is still far above 2019) that is making people ""feel"" rich?**

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A surge in short-term options bets, rock-bottom equity allocations and tandem moves in individual stocks are exacerbating swings in U.S. equity markets that have surprised bulls and bears alike in recent weeks.

One-month daily volatility for the S&amp;P 500, which measures how much the index has moved over the past month, has climbed to its highest level since early July. The index has logged 40 moves of over 2% in either direction this year, a number only surpassed during the height of the pandemic selloff in 2020 and, before that, the depths of the financial crisis of 2008-2009.

The latest came on Friday, when fresh hopes that the Federal Reserve would slow its monetary policy tightening ignited a midday rally. The S&amp;P 500 gained more than 2% for the day, after being down as much as 0.5% earlier in the session.

""We are seeing large moves not just to the downside ... but surges to the upside as well, as investors appear to be chasing returns through year-end,"" said Anand Omprakash, head of derivatives quantitative strategy at Elevation Securities.

GRAPHIC: Big swings https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkplwmgdgvb/chart.png

Among factors fueling the swings is a flood of options trades, many of them short-term in nature. One-month average daily trading volume in the U.S. listed equity options market stands at 43 million contracts, just shy of a record, and about 20% higher than a year ago, according to Trade Alert data.

A surge in options trading tends to boost hedging by market makers - typically large banks or financial institutions that facilitate the trades and need to position in equity futures to reduce their risk from unexpected market moves.

Their furious buying and selling can heighten short-term swings in stocks, adding to broader volatility, market participants said.

""Dealer hedging in derivatives markets has absolutely become a factor in influencing market movement at short term horizons,"" said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics.

""I expect these hedging flows to likely exert the most influence during low liquidity periods, and following important macro news events,"" he said.

GRAPHIC: Options surge https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jnpwygyqdpw/chart.png

A rise in trading of options contracts that expire in less than a day further exacerbates the swings, as their proximity to the expiration date makes them particularly sensitive to stock fluctuations and necessitates increased hedging, market participants said.

Trading in S&amp;P 500 options with one day or less to expiry has grown to be 50%-60% of the volume, up from 10%-30% earlier this year, according to Brent Kochuba, founder of analytic service SpotGamma.

""I think this invokes 'jump risk' in markets ... hidden pockets of volatility that's very difficult to forecast,"" Kochuba said.

**LOW POSITIONING**

Meanwhile, many so-called ""real money"" investors such as pension funds and mutual funds have cut their stock allocations to the bone after months of equity volatility, another factor fueling stock swings.

""The recent volatility is ... a result of 'real money' sitting on their hands and not being there to either buy into weakness, nor sell into rallies,"" said Michael Lewis, head of U.S. equities cash trading at Barclays.

Deutsche Bank's measure of consolidated equity positioning has been lower only about 6% of the time since January 2010. Data from Goldman Sachs prime brokerage showed net leverage on hedge fund portfolios at its lowest level since March 2020 in the week of Oct 7.

At the same time, under-positioned investors have recently tended to jump aboard stock rallies, further extending the moves, market participants said.

""Some investors are looking to chase very short-term tactical bear market rallies even as more medium- to long-term conviction remains very, very bearish,"" said Maxwell Grinacoff, equity derivative strategist at BNP Paribas.

**MARCHING IN LOCKSTEP**

A pickup in correlations between individual stocks also has added to the abruptness of the moves. The Cboe 3-Month Implied Correlation Index, which measures the 3-month expected average correlation across the top 50 value-weighted S&amp;P 500 stocks, stands at 53.53, near a 2-year high, and 18 points above its 5-year median.

GRAPHIC: In lockstep https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkvlwmxmapb/Pasted%20image%201666627273301.png

When stocks all move in sync on the same catalysts there is less chance of one group of stocks offsetting moves elsewhere. Instead, higher correlation can lead to the market lurching one way or the other with heightened speed.

""It's become a macro market where individual catalysts themselves don't matter as much as macroeconomic themes,"" Elevation's Omprakash said.

As for the Fed, Republicans have in the past voiced opposition to its practice of paying interest on surplus bank reserves. Congress granted that authority back in 2008 to help the Fed control interest rates. With the Fed now incurring losses, and the Republicans potentially taking control of at least one chamber of Congress in the November midterm elections, the debate may resurface.

The Fed’s turnaround could be particularly notable. After paying as much as $100 billion to the Treasury in 2021, it could face losses of more than $80 billion on an annual basis if policymakers raise rates by 75 basis points in November and 50 basis points in December -- as markets anticipate -- estimates Stephen Stanley, chief economist for Amherst Pierpont.

Under 1099 I am subtracting the self employment taxes from my take home pay and calculating those based on this link.  [https://www.keepertax.com/1099-tax-calculator](https://www.keepertax.com/1099-tax-calculator).  Under W2 those are paid for in the employer tax column, is that correct?

I realize I need to factor in federal and state taxes as well but that is still applies to both models.  The difference is that under W2 my employer is taking out withholdings, under 1099 I will be responsible for my own withholdings.

There is a small difference in the company 401K match.

personalfinance,"Difference between taking Cash Out of investment plan, and Selling stocks?","Lets say I have like $75k in cash sitting in investment plan that was rolled over from a defunct retirement plan, deferred taxes.

And I have like $100k in random stocks that have been sitting for like 7 years, many of which I have no clue what they are(and many of which I know have a bunch of losses, and some probably have some gains).

If I'm trying to get like $25k-$100k somehow to put some money down on a variable mortgage to avoid high interest rates a bit, what is the difference between these two options.

1.) Taking the $75k cash out straight up, paying ~24% tax or whatever on it, and just putting it on the mortgage(kills 2 birds with 1 stone, gets rid of cash that is losing value to inflation, and saves me money on interest payments).

2.) Selling Stocks optimizing for capital gains tax losses/gains, and using that money to put toward mortgage(then do something like invest that $70k in Dow/S&amp;P/Nasdaq indexes). [This has the POTENTIAL benefit of being more tax efficient, if that is true, as well as getting out of some risky/unknown stocks, and still solves the problem of getting the $70k cash into SOME form of investment]

Not asking for actual advice if that's not allowed.  Simply trying to figure out what the general difference is, and if there is either option that on its face seems to make more sense than the other.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to invest inheritence,"Hey Reddit, I'm looking for suggestions/advice on what to do with some extra cash I have.  I know right now with the market the way it is there may be some opportunities, and I want to be sure I'm not overlooking something or making any big mistakes.  I'll try and keep this as short and to the point as I can.

In Oct. 2021 I sold my home and profited around $135k.   I put about 90k into the market at that time.

In May 2022 I gained about $200k from an inheritance.  I put about 130k into the market at that time.

This week I am selling a home I gained in the inheritance for about $485k, after fee's and splitting 50% with my sister who is also on the living will I will net around $230k.

My stock portfolio is majorly down and I'm at about $160k from the $220k.

My 401k is around $120k, but I am not touching that.

I have about 90k liquid free cash in my savings. Plus the $230k after I close on the sale of the home I inherited this week, making my total liquid cash around $310k.

I am a supply chain manager and my base income is $135k, plus up to 20k annual bonus.

I am currently renting a place with my girlfriend, and my plan is to wait for the housing market to settle before buying another home.  My interest is in finding a multifamily home, and so I have been scouting them in the Milwaukee area over the last 2-3 months and noticed prices are starting to fall.    

I am in a very serious relationship (non-binding at this time) and she wants to be on the deed for any new place we buy so she can feel that she's a contributor to our life.  At this time she can only contribute around $10k.  First question is does anyone have any advice on how to properly split the ownership of a home/duplex as a percentage of total ownership based on the amount each owner has put into the property?   

My plan is to buy and owner occupy a duplex for a short while 1-2 years max, and then possibly buy another single family home during that time for us to move into.  So I was thinking it would be wise to keep an extra 50-100k of liquid cash for if we hit a recession and the housing market see's a larger correction so I have the ability to jump on any single family housing opportunities.

With mortgage interest rates being around 6%, and the average price of a nice duplex in Milwaukee area being around $400k right now, I would probably want to put down around 50% (200k) to keep my  monthly loan payments under $2,000 tax incl.

With this plan, if I put down $200k on a multifamily home, that will leave me with around $110k.   My thought was to put as much of that into the market as I can with the major correction we are seeing right now it may be a good time.  I would likely DCA on the stocks I already own. 

Mostly looking for validation on this plan, or to get the opinions, feedback, and guidance of others who may have gone through a similar situation in their life.  

I'm 37 years old and looking to optimize my profits from the money I have, and the current market conditions to set myself up for early retirement if possible.

gaming,Enough is enough with videogames publisher - The Project,"So, I'm a no name, never farm karma so this post will surely end in the abyss of reddit, wasting my time writing this, but I think it is time to change what's happening to videogame industry. 

I'd like to participate on a project with many people (I'll explain it further) in order to recalibrate the videogame industry, something like a gamer honorcode which could isolate toxics publishers. 

My observation is always the same, when I explain why gaming industry is turning senseless, the answer is ""It's their game they do whatever they want"". Nope I clearly disagree.  
Many games sells a content to their respective community, and then ""because of business"" totally change their identity, delete some paid content because unmaintainable (hello destiny2), switch to greedy f2p (hello overwatch2), and for me it's not acceptable. You put money and time in a game, changing the whole mindset of the gaming without listening to the community or without providing a clear and concrete horizon of the game because of business is getting closer to a scam. 

# The project

I'd like to create a community, federated around game's quality, where we could raise red flags about an actual / incoming game. I'm a developer, and I'm able to create everything needed in terms of application. I can support the project with my own money even if it costs 1000's of $ in servers, I don't want any revenue by any type on this, I just want the industry to change.

The whole complexity is clearly not the development nor the cost of this application. The main difficulty is to establish a convention that is firmly respected between people in this community, where we would boycott for real games with red flags. Too many battle pass with 0 content, too many effort put in 30$ skins without adding any value to the real game, too many games release in alpha version (in my old days, games released in alpha / beta were free, but well, time changes). 

Some people will tell me ""steams reviews exists"" and they're right, it helps a lot, but it is not a reference and it doesn't stop people from buying unfinished or deadborn games. The target of this project is to constitute a truly solid and impactful community that gamepublishers could not ignore.

I know it clearly sounds utopist, but I'm tired to see all those beautiful indie companies making great games and then being bought  by AAA companies making them cash machines.  
If a community like this existed, it could act like ""strikes"" in real world, where if a gaming editor is abusing is community the player base could drop immediately.

What I imagine on the application is a list of red flags, coupled with the gamepublisher historic and the gather from data miners which would allow to put an indication for buying in t ""Do"" (green light) / ""Hold"" (orange flag) / ""Don't"" (red flag), in order to make finally game publishers to put an effort in their games.

# What type of games aren't targeted

I'm not saying that a game publisher should be punished everytime he doesn't follow his community recommendations. If explained well and logical, it is normal for a game creator to follow his ambitions. The target is only the battlepass scammers / F2P claimers / preorders abusers 

# Conclusion 

I know my post sounds salty (and honestly it is). I know I look like a whinny b\*tch (and I am). But I think it is not possible to see today such monstruosity as Diablo Immortal where big whales are fished with thousands dollars useless reward. Those whales are actually fueled by players with no revenue, because it gives them a superiority feeling. If those whales can't play anymore with those players that will not put a dollar in the game, it will become pointless to play the game anymore, and maybe games publisher will restart to make real games.

investing,"CSV Carriage Services, Inc. ($CSV): Death is knocking at Profit's doors","In this article, we go a bit more in-depth on CSV. The article contains quite a lot of visuals. Unfortunately, those aren't allowed here. So I wrote down the article without the visuals. The visuals can be found on my Substack.

That aside, let's dive deeper into this very interesting company.

**Intro**

For our Halloween celebration piece, we figured that Carriage Services would be a great choice (just kidding it was a coincidence). But today’s choice features the topic of death services including, burials, cremations, and all other funeral services. We believe that analyzing this company with a top-down approach will be the best way to approach the company.

**The Numbers**

* CSV has a decent revenue 3-year annual growth rate of 15%.
* CSV has a decent ROIC of 23%, indicating that each $100 invested in the business results in an additional $23 of operating income.
* CSV has a decent gross margin of 33%, indicating that it has strong pricing power.
* CSV has a solid FCF of 15%, which indicates that the company could buy itself back in about 8 years.
* Forward PE: At the current valuation CSV has a forward PE of 11.15.

**Starting from the Top**

First of all, we would like to begin with the macroeconomic perspective of the company. We will take a look at some of the headwinds that carriage will be facing in the coming days.

The first consequential trend in death rates. Since covid, I am sure you can imagine that death rates did in fact increase, and this will lead to an impact on topline revenue in the short run (there is already an impact, and it is mild in our opinion). Below you can see the obvious increase in death rates from covid and the flatlining post covid.

Clearly, there has been a large increase in deaths each year. We believe this trend will most likely continue through the next decade. Mainly due to the fact that the baby boomer population ages further and Americans continue to get much older. Below is the forecast for a 48% increase in older Americans over the next 20 years.

As you can understand, this has large implications for the industry. We believe this will allow for long-term growth over the coming decades. This isn’t insane growth (a CAGR of about 2%) but, this will help push the industry along. It is definitely a bullish outlook for the industry as a whole.

Due to the fact that an aging population means a higher number of deaths over the coming decades, with the death rate pre-covid flatlining at around 79 years old (showing no signs of improvement). So, love it or hate it, this is the reality that the death services industry is facing in the coming decades.

**Cremations are in demand**

This obviously is a good thing for the company, but, probably not good for the cremated.

For years, analysts and investors have been worried about the effect of cremations on the profits of death services companies and that is still a worry today. This would be a significant headwind but, we have great news for any would-be investors, just check out the charts below and you tell us if you notice an impact.

Clearly, revenues have increased (along with EBITDA) for years, so I don’t think there’s too much to worry about! My mindset is along the lines of the CEO, and that’s if they aren’t feeling any impacts with cremations being 57% of the market then I think the future bodes well. This ability to maintain growth is due to amazing acquisitions and good management, which is the overall theme of this company. In addition, it doesn’t hurt that gross margins are even higher on cremations.

**A Little History**

Carriage services has gone a long way in its 30 years of service. Ran by the same CEO, who is now 78, for those 30 years, they have experienced a wealth of change that has led them to become the high-functioning company that they are today.

In the 90s, the company almost went under like most companies in the industry due to overleveraging their way to massive growth. After that debacle the company had to try to fix the disaster, they had formed. They were able to do this in the following 7 years.

How you may ask? By getting rid of waste, deleveraging, and focusing on cash flow they were able to become a decent company in the mid-2000s and that’s when this CEO really turned this company into what they are today.

**Growth By Acquisition**

In this paragraph, we will be discussing the growth by acquisition of the company and we will be discussing the competition.

After the downfall, the CEO/Founder began to decentralize the company. He shredded middle management, then proceeded to focus and raise his standards for the quality of managers that he would have at the localized level. After finding top-notch local managers he was able to push more responsibility at a local level and allow these great managers to be more agile and adjust to the local needs. This corresponded to the company’s strategy of growth through acquisition, by utilizing these great managers to increase margins. The next goal was to develop a strong strategy of buying great companies that had strong upside potential. Starting in 2010 they began to build a new system of buying companies and these are still roughly the standards they operate with today.

Clearly, they look for price, but all these other standards they have created ensure that they are able to get great companies for a great price. Now, you might be thinking that they could run out of businesses to buy. But, according to carriage services the market is only getting better, as most of the industry is privately owned (and family). Furthermore, most owners are aging and are willing to sell their companies for cheap to a consolidator that will treat it well.

Their only public competitor, which grows in a similar fashion, is SCI. SCI operates similarly but at a much larger scale than what carriage services operates and is the industry’s biggest player. Overall, the companies only control less than 20% of the total market and this leads to plenty of room for both companies to grow so competition is not a problem from an acquisition standpoint for the foreseeable future.

When CSV acquires new companies, they immediately increase profitability and margins to get the most value out of their acquisitions. The company’s ability to allow their motivated and elite localized management systems to independently (and effectively) operate has enabled this great margin expansion in new acquisitions. Surprisingly, great managers, when left to their own vices, are great at managing things! This is why their decentralized approach is so important to future growth.

See the chart below for how well they do (same-store implies a store that they have had for at least 5 years):

**Management and Capital Allocation**

If you look at this company, there is no inherent moat, just like every other company in the industry. What carriage does have is a great CEO and a great management team who is ready to take the reins when he leaves.

If you read his letters, it is precisely the type of CEO that is written about in the book “The Outsiders”. He is constantly trying to innovate separately from his competitors and run a streamlined decentralized company. His ability to hop on cheap debt and turn that into value for shareholders cannot be praised enough as he has done throughout the last 20 years. We expect a clean transfer of power as he is already allowing other managers to control meetings and company direction with a hands-off approach, which sets up an easy transfer later to mitigate risk when he leaves.

They operate on a 5-year plan that is updated every 5 years to achieve their goals. This has been the case since 2005 and will most likely continue into future years. Their current strategy for capital allocation can be found in the listed points below:

* Acquiring a company that meets the standards of the list I shared before (they are planning on acquiring 2 companies this quarter)
* Debt Reduction (this is a current focus)
* If an adequate company is not available, then buying back shares is a preferred method.
   * Share prices must be 10% below their estimated intrinsic value of the company (which is currently $75 a share). They have retired 20% of dilutive shares since Q2 2021 (their 4th time buying back shares)

Management rarely holds boatloads of cash and is constantly looking for ways to allocate it. They also run a trust which operates at roughly the same amount of returns the last 10 years as the S&amp;P 500.

This will most likely improve through a downturn and could lead to an increase in their balance sheet. Management operates at beautiful ROICs, the first half of this year they operated at a 20% ROIC. This is consistent with what this management has been able to produce historically. Their FCF margins are simply incredible year after year and is due to blatant focus by management to increase and then allocate effectively. In the case, their stock crashes due to current macroeconomic conditions not pertaining to CSV's business model. We are confident that the company will buy back shares by the truckload. In addition, it should be mentioned that CSV refinanced their $400M in senior notes from May 2026 at 6.625% to May 2029 at 4.25%, which added significant value to the company (I also believe this is how they funded the mass amount of share buybacks).

**Insider Purchases**

As you can see in the table below, the insiders have been quite active lately. This is good to see and gives even more strength to our thesis. In particular, seeing the COO increase his stake by a significant amount is what we like to see.

**The Charts**

As can be seen on the chart below CSV currently has a YTD bottom of around $30. If the market continues to deteriorate, we could see the price drop toward the $29 support level. This would mean more downside is possible.

We can see the stock is falling together with the market as it is currently down close to 52% since its ATH of late December last year. Currently, the stock has found some support on the 200WMA, which you will be able to see in the chart below. Ideally, we would like to see the stock stay above the crucial $29 support level. If that support isn’t able to hold, we could see more downside and CSV would become an increasingly attractive opportunity. We believe the stock provides a very enticing buy opportunity on every dip below $30.

**CSV 1-year chart**

Now let’s have a look at the long-term chart. We can clearly see the stock is having a rough time. The stock has fallen close to 52% since its all-time high, as we mentioned above.

CSV does have a strong business as we discussed in this article. We believe the company is poised to grow further. Although, the company might struggle due to current macroeconomic headwinds, we believe this is a strong company is one to keep an eye on for the long-term. As you can see, the stock found some support on the 200WSMA as we already mentioned above. In addition, we got the up trending green support line, which should act as a very strong support level. We would like the stock to break above the current $84 resistance level. Afterward, we would like to see the stock break out of the steep downtrend that it has been in since last year.

**CSV 5-Year Chart**

**Valuation and Expectations**

To conclude this article, we would like to talk a little bit more about the valuations and expectations that we have for CSV.

CSV’s growth was expected to slouch this past quarter as they had stated, they increased overhead to update their facilities and technology since they needed to modernize everything. This was a planned event, but the market still seems to have missed the memo and they immediately fell off drastically.

We believe this creates one of the best opportunities in the market to get an undervalued company for an absolute steal. They are currently priced at $31.45 a share after undergoing some macroeconomic headwinds with covid ending, higher interest rates leading to a lower market, and a rougher than expected 2nd quarter/ I agree with management, and I get a value of about $72/share using a DCF with 15% CAGR and a 5% discount rate.

Furthermore, I expect that to be realized as revenue settles out over the next couple of quarters. They might not seem cheap with an 11x EV/EBIT but I believe due to numerous factors including being in an industry that is not heavily impacted by recessions along with second-to-none management, this company deserves a much higher stock price. If we take this management and the pretty stable industry into consideration, we don’t think we have to project any major impact from a large recession for this business. Taking this into consideration, we get a high multiple and a 50%+ margin of safety on a consistent business with consistent returns.

To us, that sounds pretty good. We believe that below $30 it is definitely a stock to keep an eye on.

These are the most important numbers from the report compared to what Wall Street was expecting of the company, as compiled by Bloomberg.

 The digital advertising market has been struck by a slowdown in spending in the past few quarters, as companies pull back their budgets amid rising inflation and interest rates.",finance,1666729292
personalfinance,Is taking money from retirement for a house down payment a good idea?,"Hi all! Many thanks for reading this. I am located in the US and my spouse and I are looking to purchase our first home in the next 6-9 months (we’re in our early 30s). Right now, we have about $25,000 for a down payment (and we’re hoping to get that near/at $30,000 by the time we actually purchase). My question is, is it worth it for one or both of us to take $10,000 from our retirement accounts to add to  the down payment? I say up to $10,000 each since, as I understand, you can take that without incurring the 10% penalty.

Additional information: 
-Spouse’s current salary is ~$60,000, but will drop to ~$50,000 in August 2023 (we’re moving states). Spouse has zero debt of any kind. Currently has ~$25,000 in retirement.
-My currently salary is ~$55,000 but will increase to ~$121,000 in January 2023 (new job). I do have student loan debt which is currently ~$90,000, however, this is guaranteed to drop by $6,000 every quarter (plus my regular payments) for the next two years due to an award that I received to pay student debt. I do also qualify for $10,000 in federal relief (if that does end up happening). My current retirement accounts total to ~$60,000.",finance,1666729681
stocks,The concept of “function of the market”,"In commodity trading  there’s a concept we call “the function of the market” meaning that we question what does the market/ prices need to do in order to solve a certain economic/financial imbalance… so bare with me for 3min more:

Call inflation 10%.

No company pays dividends above 10%… so in order to see companies raising dividends, we will need first to see stocks falling… if stocks will rally, the need to raise dividends go to shit
Why would you put your money in dividends that pay well well below inflation? (Not to mention how silly it may sound to own shares that historically haven’t paid any dividend at all, just for the sake of future expectations).

Bonds don’t pay you inflation

Housing market will go to shit with current interest rates… 

There is still a lot of “invaluable” capital created in 2020 and 2021 around, that came from stocks rally, crypto, nft, stimulus, etc. all backed by money printing and low interest rates.

With high inflation and low dividends and more uncertainties on interest rate, there is no good place for money to be parked… but with so much money, there only one way to solve this imbalance: burn/ destroy capital via melting bonds, shares and house prices… only then inflation will slow down and only then investments will become attractive again… but for that, several investors will need to be stopped out and forced to take losses.

Inflation is bad, consumes money… but what May come ahead will be a huge portfolio drawdown and on top of that we may lose inflation.

financialindependence,[4 year update] 38/m/single. $2.3 million. Submitted my resignation letter today. Thank you guys for the encouragement all these years.,"Hi, r/financialindependence. I posted about quitting my job in 2018 when I was 38 - I'm 42 now - to travel the world via air and the country via van after living frugally since I started working in my early 20s. Retired with about $2.3 million net worth. Here's the story so far ...

**Year 0**
https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8pv2yd/38msingle_23_million_submitted_my_resignation/

&gt; I started working in my early 20s after getting out of grad school. Salary varied anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000 during those 14 years or so. I live in a state with low cost of living and no state income tax, so I knew when I started that I could save a majority of my income if I stayed frugal and resisted lifestyle inflation. I live in the same starter home I bought around 2010 and drive an old Camry. I did a bunch of set-it-and-forget-it buying of large cap US index funds and Berkshire Hathaway and I did some individual buying of large cap bank and technology names before and after the Great Recession

**Year 1 update - I came home after volunteer work in SE Asia**
https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bk1rco/1_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

&gt;I FIREd and quit my job in the US last year, then moved to Thailand to volunteer at a non-profit teaching English to former prostitutes and low-level criminals for tourism industry jobs. I'm an American, ethnically Chinese.

&gt;My apartment and utilities were provided for free by the non-profit and I lived with my fellow expat volunteers. Some were older couples who wanted their privacy, so they booked their own apartments. Costs ranged from as low as $200 a month for a cheap, non-furnished studio apartment to $375 a month for a furnished studio in a newer building near a Skytrain station in the center of town with security. I was pleasantly surprised that because I was in the country on a sponsored work visa, I was eligible to buy health insurance there as a local. It came out to about $150 a month. Getting international expat health insurance here in America would have cost me up to $500 a month, so a huge savings. I also rarely ate at home and never cooked, since Bangkok is one of the great street food capitals of the world. All kinds of Thai, Chinese, Malay, Indian and Arab food served on the street for about 35 to 70 baht each entree (~1 to 2 bucks USD). I ended up not getting a local cell phone or local cell plan, my Sprint plan included international roaming and the 2G data was okay for Google Maps and web/email use when I was away from wifi, which was rare.
So monthly fixed expenses came out to

&gt; * $150 health insurance

&gt; * $200 eating out

&gt; * $100 7-Eleven (drinking tap water actively discouraged by authorities due to corroded pipes. Bottled water is substantially cheaper there than here, thankfully. My problem is that when I went into 7-Eleven every day to get the cheap water, I would get sidetracked by whatever tasty unfamiliar snack I would see at the hot food counter that I would then have to try, hence $100 a month blown. Seriously, 7-Eleven in Thailand is amazing, I highly recommend getting lost in one. All kinds of hot noodle soups and baos and sticky rice snacks and cakes.)

&gt; * $150 Skytrain and subway tickets, Uber/Grab app rides on the back of a motorcycle.

&gt; * $250 random spending money on cheap knock-off clothes or gifts to take home or a ladyboy cabaret show or a concert or pro kickboxing match, etc.

&gt; * =$850/month total. Let's say I had to get my own furnished apartment and pay for my utilities, add another $500 a month. $1,350 a month total is pretty good considering I lived like a king and didn't budget myself at all. I could get that below $1,000 a month if I was more frugal.

&gt; My non-fixed expenses were for airfare and lodging when I would leave town for the weekend to explore the rest of SE Asia. If I could book trips early enough, I could get round trip flights on Scoot or AirAsia to Chiang Rai or Singapore or Penang for as little as $40 round trip. Other than Singapore, Airbnbs and budget hotels were dirt cheap, so those weekend trips rarely cost more than $200 each.

&gt; Also - about three or four months after I moved to Thailand, my former boss called me to see how I was and offered me an online-only job, where I would spend about an hour to 90 minutes a day remotely reviewing other people's work, answering internal emails and listening to ideas he would bounce off of me. I wasn't interested, but he insisted it would not be my old job, that I would still be a digital nomad and never come into the office and I would be eligible for 401k matching and the company's health insurance when I came home. So I said yes and I've been doing the job for about half a year. It's been as advertised, I set aside an hour or so a night on my laptop in front of the TV and it hasn't grown into anything bigger yet. The salary is a small, small fraction of what I used to make but it's worth my time. We'll see how things stand after another year.

**Year 2 update - I was in COVID lockdown**
https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gwhxgh/2_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

&gt; 2020 comes and COVID-19 hits. My trip to Taiwan and Hong Kong was cancelled. A trip to Italy soon after, too. Then separate trips to Nevada and Boston, too. My net worth skyrocketed to over $3 million thanks to the post-China trade deal rally and the market assuming COVID-19 is contained. The abrupt, panicked selloff as the world went into lockdown knocked me back down to $2.1 million. Painful, but I rode the Great Recession all the way down and back ten years ago, so I had that experience to rely on to resist panic selling. I've since rode the April/May rally back up to $2.6 million. https://i.imgur.com/Wg7c74L.jpg

&gt; My current expenses ... I own the house outright so no rent is great. Health insurance is covered by my old employer (while still in SE Asia, I was offered a remote work job by my old boss, like set aside 60-90 minutes a day to answer email and have him bounce ideas off of me. I originally said no but was swayed when told I could get health insurance covered and my 401k matching when I moved back to the states, have done it since. A nice side hustle for a fraction of my old salary.)

&gt; * $480 a month for property taxes and home insurance. That's right, per month. Property taxes are high here, the joys of home ownership.

&gt; * $70 a month for auto insurance, two cars, two drivers.

&gt; * $130 gasoline and auto maintenance. They're Toyotas, maintenance is really easy and the engines will run forever.

&gt; * $220 water, internet and power.

&gt; * $120 a month for four smartphones on a Sprint family plan. Yes, Sprint sucks but it's a great price that I've been grandfathered into for several years. I get a free Hulu sub and a free AAA sub with it, too.

&gt; * $140 groceries. I shop mostly at Aldi and grow several greens and fruits in my backyard.

&gt; * $60 for random upkeep around the house. Replacing a broken sprinkler head, buying wood chips, replacing a broken weedeater guard, batteries, light bulbs, buy a bag of potting soil, stuff like that.

&gt; * = $1,220/month. I'm not including eating out or going to shows or movies because I'm inside the house all day every day. My $20 gym membership is suspended, I don't want to work out in an enclosed space until there's a vaccine or proven treatment.

**Year 3 update -**I didn't post an update because things had not changed much from the year before. Omicron had people home in Texas dropping dead left and right and I didn't feel comfortable flying domestically or internationally again. So I did a lot of camping trips at state parks in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arkansas. It was nice. Lots of exploring in towns like Taos and Durant and Turkey. Spent a lot of time with family.

**Today, Year 4 update** - I finally started flying again in the spring and picked up right where I left off in 2020. I went to a friend's wedding in New York City and I had such a great time that I later signed on as an unpaid volunteer with NY Cares. I'm currently based in Queens and I'll be here into December helping high schoolers and their Mandarin or Spanish-speaking families fill out their FAFSA applications. Enjoying myself very much. I'm basically a tourist all day and night. Eating lots of cheap $2 pork dumplings and $7 halal food in Astoria and Flushing and Sunset Park. Going to a lot of museums and art galleries in Manhattan.

**Net worth today -** I've been on a wild ass ride since 2018 that has been bewildering and head-spinning. $2.3 million at retirement, rallied to above $3 million at the pre-COVID peak. The lockdown selloff was brutal, I was back to $2.1 million pretty quickly by summer 2020. I then put my hoarded cash to work in more big bank, tech names and leveraged ETF plays hoping to claw back to over $3 million within three years. I was floored that it ballooned to over $10 million on the backs of those leveraged bank and tech plays going parabolic and leading the market as the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero (thanks ""transient inflation"") and QE going for substantially longer than anyone expected.

https://i.imgur.com/eJbG1Vx.jpeg

I was shocked by the huge move higher because I grossly misjudged just how many rounds of stimulus Congress was going to pass, misjudged how long the Fed was going to ignore spiking inflation and misjudged how much central banks and lawmakers in other countries would going along with similar measures, further juicing global financial markets. You are welcome to view my post history for the past two years, as I post about some specific bank and tech trades I made.

Well, that's all crashed and burned in 2022. The steady 75-basis point interest hikes beginning in the spring by the Fed to kill the +8% inflation we are enduring have torpedoed the bank and tech names in my portfolio. I'm currently at about $6.1 million, a $4 million loss from the peak. Yes, it has been exceptionally painful. I've done some selling on the rallies and other selling on stop-loss orders being triggered.

https://i.imgur.com/EjmMPz9.jpg

But, whatever. I knew these trades I entered into in 2020 were high risk, high reward. And I'm up over 100% on my net worth since I retired four years ago. If you would have told me then that my nest egg would balloon to over $6 million within five years, I would have done backflips. The fact that it spiked to over $10 million before losing $4 million in value doesn't bother me as much as it should. I'm pretty much over it, at this point. I'm happy with myself that I've always kept at least $400,000 in cash on hand because it gives me the luxury now of looking over my shopping list for new names to enter into 2023. No clue when the bottom will be, I have increased my 401k contributions to the $20,500 maximum in the meantime.

I am still bullish in the long term of the big US banks. Banks because we are in a sharp rate hike cycle, meaning retail banking is very profitable for the first time in over 15 years because interest rates are high and will honestly never go back to being near-zero for so long. Wells Fargo has the largest (proportion) retail banking operation out of them all and has lagged for over a decade because of it, it's been my top pick since the Fed started hiking in May-ish. Reasons to bet against big banks are if the recession is deeper and harder than expected. Obviously.

**Current cost of living -** I'm currently staying in Elmhurst, Queens. It's about $1,400/month for a private room and shared bathroom, I booked on Airbnb. I highly recommend Airbnb for monthly stays, many hosts slash their asking rate 40 to 60% if you commit for that long. Huge pluses are I'm right next to a station for the 7 train and there is washer/dryer in house.

* $200/month for transportation. I ride the subway with an unlimited weekly pass loaded on a MetroCard. And will take the occasional taxi or rideshare. Yes, I know about the spike in stabbings and platform pushers in the news constantly. Yes, there seems like fewer police and more mentally ill folks than before the pandemic. Luckily haven't witnessed anything yet, just need to stay mindful.

* $600/month for food. I am eating out every day, there's cheap ethnic food everywhere in Queens. I can save and diet when I go home.

* $250/month on attractions. I'm not spending much on attractions. There's so many free things to do in the city, it's pretty amazing. You can burn several days touring the free private art galleries in Chelsea or half a day walking the Brooklyn Bridge and back or walking in Coney Island or taking the free Staten Island ferry. The big pay museums have certain free hours blocked off every week. I did buy the occasional Mets tickets or pay to see a local band or pay the table minimum at the Comedy Cellar.

* $120/month for the same four-phone family plan.

* =$2,570/month. Health insurance still covered by part-time remote gig.

A [breakfast press day](https://gaia-x.eu/events/summit-2022-press-attendance-registration/) will launch the Summit on **16 November at 9:30 a.m.** The Summit landing page is available [here](https://gaia-x.eu/summit-2022/).

The two-days hybrid event will show the progress and the developments made over the last two years, bringing on stage representatives from the Association, business leaders, institutional authorities, and organisations worldwide – delivering a unique experience to more than **350 physical attendees and over 4,500 online attendees**. Check out the latest agenda, [here](https://gaia-x.eu/event/gaia-x-summit-2022/).

“This summit carries the evidence of the move of Gaia-X from an initial concept to the adoption phase, the overall growth and reach of Gaia-X” commented **Francesco Bonfiglio, CEO of Gaia-X** “It shows we are walking the talk and making the necessary steps to start a concrete market adoption from 2023” he concluded.

This year’s Summit will deliver an open and profound analysis into the most debated theme of these years: **data sharing economy**. Top leaders, market experts, visionaries and commentators will discuss on the ***Why*** and the ***how*** the **Gaia-X framework** presents a new perspective on the **need and purpose for digital sovereignty**.

Our motto this year is **‘Gaia-X is up and running’** showing the results of the Association’s second year of operations: the **Adoption year**. **Compliance, Federation and Data Exchange** define the Gaia-X framework and present the three key pillars necessary to create a solid data economy.

Gaia-X member organisations and partners truly show their commitment to develop a software framework of control and governance. The Gaia-X Summit is sponsored by **DAWEX, IONOS** and **DE-CIX.** Other important partners include **La Salle Wagram - Châteauform'**, **AC Mariott** and **La Villa Malliot**, **L’Alcazar**, and **Le Congrès Maillot**.

With additional sponsors and partners on the way, this year’s Summit will focus on technology and results – for the first time showing real business applications through our lighthouse projects and dataspaces in the domains of manufacturing, automotive, mobility, infrastructure, agriculture, tourism and more.

The summit agenda will touch upon, elaborate, and expand on the following key topics, amongst others:

· **The Gaia-X Framework:** Discuss What is Gaia-X; how it works and the market value it brings. We will showcase a hands-on guided tour on our technology, compliance rules, the trust-framework, and respective mechanisms to adopt digital services that are measurable, objective, and trustworthy to flourish the next generation of the data economy. Check [here](https://gaia-x.eu/gaia-x-framework/) for a taste of it.

· **European Data Spaces:** Showcase use cases in Health, Energy &amp; Sustainability, Banking &amp; Finance, Tourism, pushing for a data space driven economy and the digitalisation of value chains.

· **The Gaia-X Business Impact:** Present the first business projects applying the Gaia-X applicability and compliance and adopting its architecture to achieve concrete business outcomes. Further details about the lighthouse projects can be seen [here](https://gaia-x.eu/who-we-are/lighthouse-projects/). Watch the video [here](https://youtu.be/xNexZbLxTyU).

· **Gaia-X and Regulatory Compliance:** Elaborate on the importance of regulation and how can this be sided with technology to achieve the necessary balance between rules, their objective measurability and effective adoption and implementation. From tech-reg to reg-tech, and automated compliance as ‘a solution’, not ‘the solution’, in order to create an alignment between the industry ability, and the expanding regulations.

· **The Gaia-X Evolution**: Present next steps to extend the market adoption of Gaia-X, challenges, milestones, internationalisation, and expectations following our five years plan.

· **Gaia-X and the European priorities for Digital:** Conclude with the vision of institutions and Governments to support further understanding on why Gaia-X is important to them and how they can foster its presence to achieve resilience and transform our social and economic ecosystems for a stronger Europe.

The monthly difference of 2.6% is actually the largest in the history of the index which means price gains are dropping at a record pace. Mortgage rates jumping from 3% earlier this year to now at 7% has stopped many first-time buyers from entering the market. High home prices along with high interest rates also kept sellers from listing as they want to be locked in to their lower rates.

The FED meeting will be on **November 1st**, their core parameters to determine interest hikes yes or no are inflation and job numbers:

- Inflation is higher than expected

- more people have jobs than expected

So the datas says that the FED could/will be raising interests.

investing,Recent economic turmoil has been a blessing in disguise,"Disclaimer: I’m not happy about the atrocious war in Ukraine nor the increasing rise in authoritarianism through lockdowns and power grab in China 

I know I’m about to get crucified for this, but I believe that putting aside morality of the reasons for the economic downturn, the downturn has been a blessing in disguise. Before this we have had a 13 year bull market. By all objective cyclically adjusted ratios, whether that is [cape](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) or [excess cape](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/27100/us-shiller-ecy), we were just shy of reaching insanity levels akin to the late 1990s but were stopped in our tracks. From feb 2020 (pre-pandemic) to dec 2021 stock market rallied about 42%. The fed - counting inflation through a basket of goods has increased money supply a lot, and while the prices of consumer goods may not changed much, real estate prices worldwide have exploded, with [house price to median income higher than at the peak of the housing bubble](https://www.realestatewitch.com/house-price-to-income-ratio-2021/) in UK and US, although the factors at play for real estate seem to be different this time (not so much a bubble as a lack of supply)

The truth is that covid, rolling lockdowns in China, the war in Ukraine and the subsequent inflation and rate hikes have been caused by arbitrary geopolitical circumstances (from economic pov) rather than fundamental economic issues. Without these external factors there was no sign of economic slowdown and we would have been marching on, head straight into a mega-bubble the likes of the 90s if not much bigger.

The only worry I have right is now that people have been accustomed to the previous bull market and everyone is waiting for the fed pivot for another asset price boom to happen. You should hope to god that is not the case. We’re just barely starting to see more or less fair valuations on forward pe earnings (around 15x) while cyclical ratios still look overvalued and real estate prices are still high. Another asset price boom will lead us into the dangerous territories that post-covid supply chains issues and oil price shocks have prevented us going from. As young investors (as I think most of us are) we should be hoping for a protracted bear market and cheap valuations for long term capital appreciation rather than a quick buck in the next year or two",finance,1666775410

Forex,Can AUD/USD rally ahead of next week's central bank policy decisions?,"The US Dollar is extending losses with the greenback currently tumbling against a number of its FX peers. This has helped AUD/USD clear the wall of selling it had been probing just above 0.6400 so far this week, although it remains to be seen whether it can hold this break and sustain a move higher. 

The US Dollar Index is currently retesting a confluence of support around the major psych level of 110, and this may encourage USD bulls to re-enter the market, especially when traders in the US come back online shortly. This could see a number of currencies, including the Aussie, quickly pair their current gains. 

However, it is worth noting that both the Federal Reserve and Reserve Bank of Australia have interest rate decisions due next week. Although the Fed is widely expected to deliver another 75bps rate hike for November, traders once again appear to betting on the possibility of the tightening cycle easing by December. 

On the other hand, after today’s AU inflation figures were stronger-than-expected, the RBA may be inclined to return to a 50bps rate hike next week, after slowing their hiking cycle earlier this month. 

All trading carries risk, but if speculation on this shift in hawkishness from the two CB continues, AUD/USD may be able to hold above resistance around 0.6400 and potentially target a larger move higher over the near-term.

The [10-year Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y/) yield was last down by close to seven basis points to 4.0421%. The benchmark note has come off the 14 year highs it was trading around just last week, when it soared as high as 4.3%.

The yield on the policy sensitive [2-year Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US2Y/) was last at 4.4203%, having declined by 4.67 basis points.

Yields and price move in opposite directions and one basis point equals 0.01%.

 

Investors will be paying close attention to the release of U.S. new home sales data for September, which is due to be released on Wednesday. In August, the figure had hit a five-month high, coming in above market expectations.

However, data published last week showed existing home sales had declined in September. Talks about a housing recession have been spreading as the sector is highly sensitive to interest rates.

The Federal Reserve has consistently been hiking rates in an effort to push back against persistent inflation, with a further 75 basis point hike expected to be implemented at the central bank's next meeting on Nov. 1 and 2.

financialindependence,The Cheap Man vs. The Frugal Man (Thinking About The Paradox of The Cheap Rich Man and the Financial Path of One with a Cheap Lifestyle),"**Anyone consider how cheapness is a highly important part of making it?**

I have spoken to many people about how I am going to live in a shitty studio apt in a shitty part of town for 6 years, when I can easily afford much more with my income. I was in an AskWomen thread about how frugality is unattractive, where most women said, ""A frugal man can be attractive, but a cheap man is unattractive."" The distinction between a frugal man and a cheap man, in that thread, was that a frugal man always has finances in mind but is silent about spending hesitancy and is willing to make purchases that are reasonable based on his income; whereas a cheap man is always complaining when something is too expensive, such as $5 slice of pizza, and refuses to make any wasteful purchase his income easily affords. One poster specifically noted that cheap men who have high income jobs but live in shitty studios in shitty parts of town are NOT attractive, and I was thinking, ""HEY! THAT'S MY DREAM!""

Interestingly, studies have shown that frugality is a quality of a rich men...

[https://www.businessinsider.com/frugal-billionaires-millionaires-lifestyle-money-car-house-habits-net-worth-2019-2](https://www.businessinsider.com/frugal-billionaires-millionaires-lifestyle-money-car-house-habits-net-worth-2019-2)

...but the question is, ""Are they frugal, or are they cheap?""

**Based upon my above definition of frugal, I wouldn't think that the richest individuals are frugal. Let's form an extensive hypothetical scenario...**

Imagine you are making 75k a year working in Manhattan, NY. Let's say Times Square. If you are the frugal man, based on the above definition, you could live in Manhattan in a 1-bedroom apartment that is $2800 a year. Pretty good deal. But wait... if you are the cheap man, you can get a shitty studio in NJ for $1500 and commute to Times Square within around 45 mins (even if you live in Newark, you can PATH there in 1 hour). Let's think about where that puts us financially...

*In 1 year, the frugal man has spent 2800 \* 12 = $33,600 on housing. In 1 year, the cheap man has spent 1500 \* 12 = $18,000 on housing.*

(For simplicity, I have omitted electricity and water costs, but I think this gets us to a good starting place.)

Then there are non-housing expenses (food, clothing, laundry, health insurance, car insurance, car maintenance, renter's insurance, vacations, accessories, household goods, leisure, misc, etc.). Let's suppose the frugal man says, ""I don't need to spend 25k in non-housing expenses annually! What the heck are people doing!? Vacationing at New Zealand every year? Jeez! I am frugal! I can reduce that down to 15k a year."" The cheap man may respond, ""15k! What kind of toilet paper do you use? I can easily do 9k!""

*So the frugal man is spending only 48,600 a year on non-housing expenses. The cheap man is spending only 27k a year on the same.*

They have 75k income... What happens after taxes? Well, the frugal man has to pay that extra NYC city tax. So they only get $53,539 after taxes. The cheap man was hanging out in NJ, though, so cheap man is getting $56,011-$1000=$55,011 after taxes (assuming they both work in NY \[technically cheap man is taxed in both states, but NJ will credit him back most of the NY tax to soften double tax, hence why I took off $1000 just to be conservative against a dollar-dollar credit\]).

*So here is what frugal man's finances look like each year: $53,539  - $48,600 = $4,939 extra money. Nice!*

*Here is what cheap man's finances look like each year: $55,011 - $27,000 = $28,011 extra money. WOAH!*

But what is the point? Cheap man is living a horrible life! Here's where the kicker comes. Any and everyone in [r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) knows this... What do you do with extra money? INVEST IT!

Let's say that frugal man and cheap man have a friend/family member in a tax friendly state with 0% corporate tax and low franchise tax only taking away 0.5% of corporate income (total tax liability of 21.5% if you include federal corporate tax). Both frugal man and cheap man would want to to form an investment company in that state to invest their personal savings, as they know that they can make an average of 15% annually in profits (I guess I am assuming they are competent investors). It could even be a real estate company or any company where one expects good accrual.

Barring inflation and pay raises (which would technically be proportional to both the frugal man and cheap man if they are, indeed, the same person, just in alternate universes, just with different mindsets), let's do a calculation of investment growth.

It is typical to take 30% - 50% of profits from dividends. If you want to have more stable income, it might be better to pay based on holdings rather than profits. The frugal man will say, ""I will take the low end of the standard, 30%."" If profits are 15% each year, then a frugal man would take 30% of that which is 0.3\*0.15=0.045 taken dividends per dollar.

As for the cheap man, from the above, we can see that, generally, for every dollar that the cheap man spends, frugal man spends about $1.75 or somewhere in that ballpark. So, the cheap man will likely take 0.045/1.75 = 0.025 taken dividends per dollar  .

Here is what their investment growth looks like over 17 years...

(Math majors, please destroy me below for not making this a sum.)

*As you can see, now the frugal man has an investment portfolio of $149,142, and the cheap man has an investment portfolio of $1,089,945.*

**The cheap man is the millionaire.**

They can both quit their jobs at this point and make a living from their investments. The frugal man takes 0.045% of holdings, so he could be making $6,711 from his investment portfolio just by, mostly, sitting on his ass. Still not enough to live on. The frugal man can't quit his job. The cheap man, however... rather, the rich man... will be making $27,248 from his investment, even when taking only 0.025% of holdings each year. Coincidentally, the cheap man has already been living off 27k, so the cheap man can quit his job at this point (again, barring inflation), and that amount will still increase every year. Let's do a quick and rudimentary calculation to see where they are another 45 years later...

Frugal Man: 149,932 \* (\[1.15 - 0.15 \* 0.215\] - 0.045\*\[1.15 - 0.15 \* 0.215\]\^2)\^45 = $2,202,015

Cheap Man: 1,089,945 \* (\[1.15 - 0.15 \* 0.215\] - 0.025\*\[1.15 - 0.15 \* 0.215\]\^2)\^45 = $45,606,629

*After another 45 years, the frugal man has around 2 million dollars. The cheap man has 45 million dollars.*

*!(Even IF the frugal man had taken 2.5% of holdings in dividends like the cheap man, the frugal man is still only at 8 million, unable to even scratch 10 million after 62 years. The cheap man still has 45 million.)!*

**But there is a greater moral to this story.**

There is a reason being the cheap man may be very important. Frugality and cheapness are mindsets. Worrying about the $5 pizza, alone, isn't going to save you much money in the end. It is the mindset of that person. The cheap man says to his friends, ""Sorry. I can't buy that pizza to eat with you guys. It is $5 a slice. For me, that's just too much for a pizza slice. I'll still hang out with you guys though."" The frugal man, not wanting to annoy his friends, says, ""Okay, I make 100k a year; I'll buy the $5 pizza. Not a big deal."" But then the frugal man makes other ""not a big deal"" purchases with his friends: drinks, movies, games; and this especially becomes an issue on dates or when spending on his partner/spouse. Before long, may purchases that pale in comparison to the frugal man's income add up to be thousands, and hence why the frugal man spent 15k instead of 9k on non-housing expenses. This same mindset came into the frugal man's dividends from the company. Frugal man says, ""Most people would be taking 6-7% of the investment portfolio, and FOOLS would be taking any more than that. My 4.5% is a pretty frugal decision."" The cheap man, however, says, ""I can survive off 2.5%. It will be almost nothing for the first several years, but I don't care. I am a cheap bastard, and I am proud of it."" It is that cheap mindset that allows the cheap man to win in a race to the top.

I hope this post has explained something many people don't discuss as much as they should. We live in a heavy consumer society, and people think that, as soon as they land a good job, they should just spend and spend and spend. Interestingly, many of the richest people, though, are the ones who are highly picky on their spending. They are cheap. And, in being cheap, the cheap man finds that, 62 years later, spending 500k on his grandson's house is spending only 40% of his annual dividend, about 1% of his entire holdings. That is almost 1/4 of the frugal man's entire holdings, and the frugal man's annual dividend is not even near that amount.

The cheap man and the rich man do not form a dichotomy. Rather, they are often one person. As one, they are not a contradiction; they are a paradox.

**Final Returning Thought**

Returned to this post after a couple weeks. The comments below are representative of something... They explain EXACTLY why the rich are so few. Everyone needs to justify spending, and that is the problem with our consumer society... why the poor and middle class stay poor and middle class. It's why YOU won't ever make it big.

A couple of things to keep in mind to some confused replies down below. The income level is an overestimate of average NYC income. In reality, average NYC income is lower meaning that the gap in wealth would be LARGER. Also, the investment returns assumption of 15% is a lowball (assuming you are a good investor). I doubled my portfolio last year (100% return, rather than 15%). The 30% - 50% figure is for average dividends and would thus stay the same, so if the mindset between both individuals stays, disparity between end amounts should remain as great. In short, this is a representative hypothetical insofar as the actual disparity you are likely to see is much more extreme.

I know there will be a remnant of people who understand the mindset I am trying to convey. If you are of that remnant, I'll be sipping expensive wine with you when your 2.5% annual dividend is $1,000,000. See you at the top.",finance,1666793310

personalfinance,Would you buy a condo?,"I have 2 kids, 7 and 9. 
My ex husband and I moved to Michigan 4 years ago. It hasn’t been my cup of tea. We divorced and both work remote, in permanent remote roles. We both do some travel for our jobs, his is less flexible than mine and he needs more support than I can give him due to my own travel. I schedule my travel around the days he has custody, and he can’t pick his days as much as I can. A few times we’ve run into issues where I have travel planned and he has travel planned when he’s supposed to have the kids, and I’ve had to move my trips at the last minute to accommodate him. This makes me look unprofessional and eventually will impact my reputation. He asked me to move back to Ohio and I agreed. 

I offered 8 school districts and he only was willing to agree to 1 due to proximity to his family (who will be helping him when he travels for work). This is an elite district, homes are easily 600k+. Taxes are sky high. I Am concerned. My budget tops out at 400k, which would buy me a smaller, older home likely requiring work.

There is a new build condo I could buy that is in a different town but in that school district. It would be approx 400k. It is gorgeous. I think it would be a nice home for my and my kids. But I’m concerned because I have always been told condos don’t build value like homes do. I also worry that if I sign a contract to build now (and lock in this interest rate) rates will continue to rise and I’ll overpay. 

On the other hand, I think my odds of buying a home successfully in this school district next summer are low. My options are buy in a different town and drive the kids to school daily assuming their dad buys in that town, which I do now. It’s not the worst, but it certainly isn’t easy. And I’m nervous that interest rates will go up more and I’ll be priced out of any homes if prices don’t fall enough. We could also go to court over a school district… but that’s a nightmare I’m not ready to face right now.

This move means so much to my kids and I. My big concern is the lack of yard  and the condo losing value, and I keep telling myself kids live in cities without a yard… but I don’t know what to think about the condo piece. Reddit hive mind, what do you think?

Edit: I’m getting a lot of feedback on the ‘why that town’ and my ex’s general asshole-ness (dropping the kids on me and impacting my job)I have a long history of abuse with this man. I know I’m a door mat. That’s not the convo I want out of this post. I am really looking for feedback on the condo. I have a viable option, in my price range, in the target school district.

CryptoMarkets,Hidden bearish divergence on the daily btc chart.,"On monday september 12, 2022 the btc RSI hit 70.1 The price was 22675.

Today, the RSI hit 74.85. The price was 20866. 

This is a lower high on the price, with a higher high on the rsi. This qualifies as a hidden bearish divergence.

A hidden bearish divergence signifies a continuation of a downtrend, just like a hidden bullish divergence indicates a continuation of an uptrend. In order for the hidden divergence to be broken, bitcoin must rapidly appreciate above 22675 with no pullbacks. If bitcoin does pullback, expect the downtrend reversal to be swift and brutal. 

Also, the fed will be meeting soon, and a hike in interest rates is in the cards. So, if you have profits from the most recent pump, I think it might be a good call to book them.

I have two years left till it drops off my credit report), so I can't get bank loans with normal interest rates, so I foolishly got a high interest loan.  

The loan amount is $8565, paid back monthly over 48 months, and the total paid back amount is approximately $14,500.  The interest is - as you can see - stupid.  I believe it's 32% annually.

I can afford to pay more, and I want to pay it off quickly, and I can afford $900/month (total).  The regular payment is $295/month - should i increase the monthly payment to $900, or should i stay with the $295 monthly payment and make an additional lumpsum payment of $605 every month?

My last attempt, on October 20, I bonded my DOT and selected a few nominators, but when I check today it says I have no active nominations and also have not received any rewards.  When I look under ""No active nominations"", most of my validators say ""Unelected"", and there's 3 that say ""Inactive"", and only the Inactive ones have their total DOT stake listed.   
 What's going on and what am I missing?

For my validators, I checked how many nominators they had (less than 256), their commission (less than 100%), and their amount of self-bonded tokens, and I think I found ones that were sufficient. I know generally that validators don't have a guaranteed chance to be selected but it's been a few weeks since I originally started and I still haven't gotten anything so there must be something I'm missing.

I heard that you have to have more than 10 DOT to bond, and there's a floating dynamic minimum or something for rewards but haven't been able to find what that minimum is.

Bitcoin,Before the haterade,"Before the haterade: bitcoin continues to take more and more of my net worth. And not because the price is up-I continue to move assets such as real estate equity and extra income into it. I have been a vocal supporter. This post is about a real discussion.

1. I have heard a very constant remark as a rebuttal of bitcoin's volatile price swing: ""Bitcoin is the best performing asset of all time."" True. However, let’s compare it to housing.

Let’s say you had 200k in 2017.

Person a buys bitcoin let’s say at 10k. InVestment is now worth 400 K.

Person b Buys a $1 million house in Los Angeles -2017.  They put down that 200k as down payment. The day that house is worth 1.8 to 2,000,000. Even if we go on the low side/1.8, the 200 K is now worth a million.

Keep in mind this assumes that they bought the bitcoin at 10K. 

What I’m saying is that I think that saying “bitcoin is the best investment of all time"" needs some asterisks.

2. While I respect “fix the money, fix the world” My interaction with bitcoin Maximalists is becoming more unsettling. Am I the only one? Do we live in a world where the goal is to only have 1 thing of value? And if we only have one thing of value, who really benefits from that? Also, I saw many bitcoin promoters who were called out in the Celsius blowup.

3. From an investment point of view, I no longer believe that the halvings are truly correlated with price. I think there are a lot more data points-Dxy, fed balance sheet, inflation, etc.

4. Do you believe corporate adoption coming? Would really like some opinions on this. Besides Saylor, I don’t really see it.

5. Is there a year or price you would call it quits? For me the answer is no because I believe the federal government simply cannot run with rates going higher. The interest expense is too high.

The central bank said they are trying to balance the risk of raising rates too aggressively that may lead to a severe recession while containing inflation. They also said the tightening phase is getting close to an end but still need to raise rates further to bring inflation back to the 2% target. This is the sixth consecutive rate hike by the Bank of Canada for a total of 3.5%.

personalfinance,How do I afford to keep going to school?,"Hi everyone, I really didn’t want to make this post, but it finally hit me that I am in way over my head,and unless I start doing something now to right the ship, it’s going to crash. I will apologize in advance for the large amount of text, but to those that read through it all, you will never know how much I appreciate it. 

I am a second year in my degree program, but I am worried about my finances to be able to continue attending school, as well as affording my rent, paying my credit cards, etc. 

I originally got an associates degree right out of high school, and was able to find work with that degree. I was making pretty decent money, but I have never really been great with my finances, and we never really got taught anything about them in school, so I never saw it as becoming a problem. I worked at this job for a 2 years. Fast forward to Summer 2021, where I realize that I absolutely hate working every single day, and that I want to go back to school to get the degree that I actually wanted. 

Because I could find housing for cheaper than the dorms, and my school doesn’t require 1st years to live on campus, I got an apartment last year, and was barely able to pay for it on top of my credit card bills(remember, bad at all things money). Over last summer I was able to work and make some money to help pay for expenses for this school year, but we are just halfway through the semester and my funds have run dry. 

To give some numbers, my average payment for rent and utilities is around $425. My credit card payments are about another $425-450, and then there is any number of random things that I have had to pay for ie. gas, groceries, supplies for projects for school, etc.. 

I would love to be able to get a job, but I am not sure how feasible it is given our course workload. I am in the school of architecture, and our for our studio, we normally are putting in anywhere from 40-80 hours per week outside of class time, and that doesn’t include any of my other courses. 

I am applying to be an RA next year so I can have my room and board as well as meal plan paid for by the school, but I am more worried about being able to make it to next year at this point. 

I have obviously f*ed up a lot in the past with money, but I am finally on a path where I am pursuing exactly what I want, so I don’t want to have to give it up because of my inability to budget/be smart with my money. 

I apologize is post has been really rant-y, but I’ve just been trying to get everything out on the table.

I'm trying to figure out if this is a terrible idea or a risk appropriate decision for my age (31).


We currently own 2 houses, 1 is being rented out for ~$500 profit/month (valued at $450K, loan is $231K at 2.875% for $1500/month)) and the other is our primary residence (valued at $610K, loan is $463K at 2.99% for $2,700/month).


The properties that we are looking at are about $550K, and because I've used up my VA entitlement on the first 2 houses, I'd have to get a conventional loan with PMI ($50K downpayment). This would be about a $4,000/month mortgage payment with today's interest rates. We currently bring in around $135,000/year combined.


The options we've been considering (in preferred order) are:

1. Rent the place we live now for ~$1,000/month profit and pay $8,200/month in mortgages. This would be backed by a robust emergency fund in case one of the houses goes vacant for a while.

2. Sell the house we live in now for ~$100K profit as a contingency sale so that I can use a VA loan. No PMI, no funding fee (disabled), and less monthly outlay.; but I give up that sweet interest rate and earning potential.

investing,"Stocks vs Bonds vs Commodities, time to get more aggressive","With the recent sell-off, prices of all assets have gotten significantly more attractive, and my favorite forward indicators show that the time has come to start rotating into stocks. My analysis (which I keep updated) is here:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC\_izY14qAa7zdSm\_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC_izY14qAa7zdSm_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing)

If you have a different quantitative leading indicator that you prefer, I'd be interested in trying it out.

**I use the following predictors / valuation measures:**

*Stocks:*

Jesse Livermore's Average Investor Equity Allocation (AIEA) has the best performance that I’ve found.

Briefly, AIEA is (Stocks Owned) / (Stocks + Bonds + Cash Owned) by the entire market. It can be thought of as a slow-moving fear/greed indicator, where higher values are greedy and lower values are fearful.

AIEA is discussed here: [https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/](https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/), and the raw data is available here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis).

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.86 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 6.2 +/- 2.5%.

*Bonds:*

The mechanism used for the model is that the bonds held are traded each month for new bonds at the new interest rate. This takes into account the effect of changing interest rates on the value of bonds held, but not taxes or fees. Coupon payments are reinvested. The given interest rate for the current ten year bond is a good (though not perfect) predictor for what the ten year return will be. The data comes from [http://www.econ.yale.edu/\~shiller/data/ie\_data.xls](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls)

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.88 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 3.68 +/- 2.0%

*Commodities:*

The best predictor that I found was GSCI/GDP. GSCI is S&amp;P’s commodity index, with records back to 1970 here: [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci). GDP is the U.S. gross domestic product, with data here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP). This implies that there is a natural level of investment in commodities, compared to GDP.

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.64 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 14.6 +/- 10%. The high uncertainty here is largely because the correlation got markedly worse in 2005, around the time of global financial crisis. Commodities suffered a bubble and pop, with a peak in June of 2008. In addition to the demand fluctuation related to the global financial crisis, this was the time that massive oil and natural gas investment was occurring, which ended up crashing the prices until recently.

Even though commodities have the highest expected return, the high uncertainty make stocks more desirable. If I was only going to go with one, I would go with stocks. However, for now I intend to move bonds into stocks, and keep commodities.

**Back testing:**

I worked out an optimal back tested strategy ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC\_izY14qAa7zdSm\_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC_izY14qAa7zdSm_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing) \-&gt; Data sheet, toward the right). With this I find the following CAGRs, from January, 1970 to January, 2021.

Stocks only: 10.93%

Bonds only: 7.18%

Commodities only: 6.79%

Stock and Bonds: 13.42%

Stocks and Commodities and Bonds: 17.18%.

For each of these, I use the indicators from six months prior to the current date. This happens to give better results, as well as being possible without a time machine. I switch the entire portfolio to the best investment once a month, where the best investment has a fudge factor. That is, if expected stock return &gt; expected bond return + 0.8%, I go with stocks. Otherwise I go with bonds. If I wish to look at commodities, If find that it almost never a good idea to choose commodities over stocks. However, if expected bonds return &gt; expected commodity return + 0.5%, I stick with bonds. Otherwise, I stay go with commodities. As of November, 2022, this procedure recommends switching from commodities to stocks.

**Actual Results:**

I've been doing this long enough, and posting about it to reddit long enough, that I can start to have a verified track record, as opposed to back testing only. This only includes what I posted to reddit, not what I've actually done with my portfolio, which is significantly more complicated and impossible to prove.

March 2021, recommended stocks [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_not/)

This is the default case, so no comment

July 2021, recommended bonds [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_the/)

This performed much worse than I expected. I was correct that stocks were in danger. I made the faulty assumption that bonds are low risk. The combination of very low initial interest rates and the surprise (to me) very high inflation caused the worst bond sell off in US history. I did not see this coming.

April 2022, recommended commodities [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks\_vs\_bonds\_vs\_commodities/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks_vs_bonds_vs_commodities/)

This performed okay, I guess. But the recommendation was late (after Russian invaded Ukraine).

In the table ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC\_izY14qAa7zdSm\_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC_izY14qAa7zdSm_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing)  \-&gt; Reddit record), I'm shifting the dates one month later, to avoid any hint of look ahead bias.

Following my recommendations would have lead an account to fall from 100 to 83. Doing stocks alone would fall to 94. Bonds alone would fall to 86. Commodities alone would risen from 100 to 143. So my practical, actual return is poor, primarily because of how badly I whiffed on the bonds recommendation. There was also some chasing the last good thing, with commodities. Using my current rules in a back test, the account would have risen from 100 to 143 (and been commodities till now).

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* AIEA measures a natural level for stock vs bond ownership. This is not a fundamental parameter, with an underlying theory about why the natural level should be where it is, or will remain the same in the future.
* Though GSCI/GDP feels like it could be fundamental parameter, it leaves out important phenomena, like the changing structure of the economy, as well as paradigm shifts in commodity extraction technology.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* My analysis starts in 1970, because that is when the commodities data becomes available. This is a smaller data set than I ‘d like.
* I’m using the S&amp;P 500, 10 year US treasuries, and GSCI because they have long data sets, not because I consider them to be optimal investments.
* GSCI is dominated by the price of oil, like how the S&amp;P is dominated by a small number of mega tech companies, but even more so.
* My verifiable track record currently under performs VOO and chill.",finance,1666844923

personalfinance,I'd like to take out a 2nd mortgage but my first one is a Joint Mortgage,"I currently have about $20,000 of credit card debt, $13,000 of which is on 0 interest rate credit cards for the next 12-18 months. The other $7,000 is on a credit card with a really high interest rate, about 27%.

I'd like to try to use my current Joint mortgage to take out a 2nd mortgage and consolidate the debt on the high interest rate credit card, so I can slowly chip away at it without accumulating a massive amount of interest.

My question is how the Joint mortgage will effect the process of taking out a second one. We put my father's name on the mortgage in order to lock in a lower interest rate on the house, but I make all the payments. I'm wondering if he will find out about the second mortgage or if he needs to be involved in the process of obtaining one. I would prefer he not find out about it because he has a tendency to get extremely stressed out over even little things and he is currently going through a terminal illness, so I do not want him to take on any more stress as it will negatively effect his health.

TL;DR
Can I take out a second mortgage off a Joint mortgage without one of the borrowers being aware of it.",finance,1666849828
personalfinance,Am I stuck in a vicius debt cycle or is there something I can do? Will I end up homeless?,"I'm an adult woman in my early 20's who has been working and supporting myself since I graduated HS. I have a stable income from a job i love but it involves tips so my paychecks vary. I recently went through a tough life situation and now have more bills than I did before. I've been scrapping by so far, check to check, and haven't had any major financial issues until now. My credit was good and I got my credit limit bumped up to $3000 right before my life situation got worse (thank goodness, I really needed it). I would consider myself good with money and I don't drink, smoke, gamble, or have any expensive hobbies. However, due to my current situation, I have calculated that at the end of each month, after all bills, I'm still left with no money in my checking and $1000 or more on my credit card

I realized that, with my current income and bills, I cannot catch up with my credit card and have it paid off in full by the end of each month's billing cycle. I understand the general 30% rule and have never had any issues with keeping my credit under that, nor paying it off entirely on time. I'm in a financial situation I've never been in before and have no idea how screwed I am. I know the interest rates on credit cards will destroy me (anyone) and that's what I'm afraid of here. There's also the possibility that my situation gets worse and I'll have more bills AND that I may loose a $900 source of income if something else happens in my life.  

 I'm doing what I can to save and trying side options to gain more income but it's very difficult at this time. I still have to work full time and have other obligations that leave me with very little room for side hussles.

My credit card is stuck at a minium of $1000 used on it each month no matter what i do. Therefore i am always over 30% and will never be paid off in full. Im pretty sure this means ill be collecting credit card debt fees and interest and destroying my previously perfect credit score. I am certain I'm going to be in financial ruin soon. I might have more to pay and less income to pay it with if everything in my life doesn't go perfectly. I can't leave my job, I won't be able to get a higher paying one, and I can't do anything time consuming like insta cart. I have no idea what I'm gonna do. 

My rent is the cheapest I can get, I have a fully electric car that I'm making minimum payments on (I have to commute to work so must have a car and the electric car saves me so much on gas/oil/etc), I don't have any subscription services like Netflix, I'm selling any valuable I have ...

CryptoMarkets,What the Fed rate hike means for the crypto market?,"The Fed rates have been increased in the light of rise in inflation. The proposed raise in interest rates by 75 basis points third time in 2022 is an attempt to ease the peril of inflation but at the cost of volatility in the crypto market. Even with the news of the previous Fed meetings in March, May and June, Bitcoin slumped by at least 10%. 

The main reason for such a flux in token prices is the correlation of stock with the crypto market. The unison movement has led to the withdrawal of investors from the market, which in turn has resulted in a crypto dip. The reduced risk appetite in the face of likely recession has compelled investors to move towards less risky assets such as bonds. 

Therefore, with an increase in global inflation, there will most likely be an adjustment in interest rates. The higher the interest rates go, the more will be the probability of the recession, which will further cause a fall in the valuation of crypto tokens.",cryptocurrency,1666861718

* * *

Chamath Palihapitiya is reinventing himself as a chastened elder statesman of the tech community, Axios' Felix Salmon writes.

Why it matters: It’s an A+ illustration of how humbling these times are for Silicon Valley.

Between the lines: Chamath made his name as a boastful meme lord, leading a crowd of retail investor apes into SPACs and crypto. Now he's wearing a dark suit, talking about risk-adjusted returns and intellectual rigor, and remorsefully saying that he was blinded by zero interest rates.

""I have evolved as a human being,"" Chamath told Axios' Dan Primack at the BFD conference in New York yesterday. ""I've become a better, calmer, more focused person.""

""Silicon Valley desperately needs reasonably decent brand ambassadors,"" said Chamath, who as recently as last year was tweeting things like ""Im about to really [f@#$] some shit up.""

Know thyself: ""There are professional serious people there that understand how to interface in the rest of the world, and I think that that is part of my responsibility now,"" claims Chamath.

Flashback: In December 2020 he tweeted that ""when $BTC gets to $150K, I will buy The Hamptons and convert it to sleepaway camps for kids.""

**The big picture: ""I sort of blame Jay Powell,"" said Chamath, for slashing interest rates to zero and allowing him to reap the benefits of a broad speculative fervor.**

""The biggest thing that I learned was how much of my early success was probably not attributable to myself.""

""We have actually had a massive tailwind because we had a zero interest rate environment that allowed us to raise unbelievable amounts of money.""

""What it allowed us to do is crowd into companies. Many of those companies had unbelievable valuations. Eventually, these unprofitable businesses went public. Only now are we starting to sort out what are good and what are not-so-good businesses.""

The bottom line: Chamath is painting his excesses as being very much in the past. ""That dog doesn't hunt when you're 46,"" he said.

I agree it's unfair but in this economy I'll take whatever olive branch life wants to give me), and I have some catching up to do in terms of my finance.

My credit score is currently at a 587. Despite paying off debts on time for the last year and a half, and taking care of some items in collection, in that time span it's only increased by I believe 9 points? The account I use for checking/monitoring my credit is showing 9 missed payments which I have proof in my bank statements, were not missed, so I'll be reaching out to the two creditors I owe to to see if I can have that remediated.

Beyond paying off my debt (and is it beneficial, score wise, to pay it all off as a lump sum?) I know getting  a credit card is a good way to increase my score. I've also been advised that financing a car is the highest credit earner besides a mortgage- I'm just not sure if my credit score will get me an interest rate that would make the score gain worth it.

If anyone has any suggestions, feel free to post any. If I'm doing something wrong, tell me that too. I had a rough start with my early adult life and neither parents know or care at all about credit so its importance was never really something taught to me. I've really been trying to learn this all myself over the last couple years.

I have money right now in savings, and two debts. One I could pay off entirely with my savings, and the other I could pay probably half off with the remainder- But obviously I'd like to keep some savings as a safety net.

Thank you in advance for any advice- This period has been one of a lot of personal growth and learning and I hope to make 2023 the year I really start coming into my own. The reason credit is the pressing area, is that my score is making it almost impossible to find a place to rent, and I don't think $5000 a month in income will even help me convince a landlord I'm fine and reliable, thanks to that score.",finance,1666882127

personalfinance,"Buying a new car at MSRP, something is not adding up with the dealer’s printed monthly financing. Are my numbers wrong, or do I need to re-assess the Dealer's credibility?","Hi all, hopefully this post is allowed. I’m in the process of purchasing a new vehicle, which I have never done before (always bought pre-owned, last in 2017). Considering the current market, and my dealership inexperience, I wanted to run something by and see if my numbers are correct here. And if so, I have additional questions on best approach on dealing with the dealership. 

Went in to purchase a new car, and wanted it at MSRP plus tax and fees. The dealer had “standard market adjustment increase of +$3000 on top of MSRP”. After discussing with him that I wasn’t interested in that, he agreed to waive the total market adjustment, and came back with a sheet displaying total out the door cost of MSRP + tax + fees, totaling $34,650, which is what I wanted and was willing to agree to, great! The issue is that on this same sheet of paper, was a section of “financing options” with $12k down (my choice), which displayed a monthly payment of $467.85 at a 4.9% APR over 60 months. This figure doesn’t match my expected monthly payment from my excel sheet I prepared in advance of this meeting, but unfortunately in the moment I confused it with another figure I had when I was playing around with figures, and in the moment I thought it checked out my ballpark. So I agreed to the price, gave a $500 deposit for them to hold the car, and have a follow up tomorrow afternoon to finalize the financing I applied for. 

My spreadsheet shows a figure of a $426.40 monthly payment at home using a $22,650 principle amount at 4.9 interest rate over 60 months. Below is the formula I used.

=PMT(.049/12, 60, 22650)

Is my math wrong here? If not, I’m assuming they’re adding in a portion of the standard market adjustment outside of what we agreed upon, and hiding including it in the value? 

I’m wondering what you guys recommend I do? If my numbers are wrong then I’m fine with that, but $40 a month isn’t insubstantial and I don’t exactly know how to best handle the upcoming communication, considering they have my deposit and and have run my credit. Can I back out once I see the bank amortization on Friday if the principle amount isn’t what it should be? Idk what to do.

defi,"Can I borrow against my own ETH, while keeping exposure to market movements, for a low interest rate on a mortgage?","I'm going to make up some numbers here.

Let's say I have $120,000 of equity (down payment) on a $600,000 house. The house is now worth $700,000 due to market movements. I also have $600,000 worth of ETH. The loan has $480,000 left on it.

I don't want to pay for the house outright, because I want to maintain exposure to ETH.

Is there a way to re-finance the house using the ETH as collateral, but allowing me to maintain the exposure to ETH so I can keep the gains? 

At the current point, I would have $1,300,000 of equity between the house itself and the ETH, with a loan of $480,000 remaining.

CryptoCurrency,"DXY’s parabolic trend seems to break off. BTC is climbing back up to $20k or above. But, it all depends on the Fed.","Entering into November, many interesting developments are starting to take shape for both BTC and DXY. The greenback is struggling in the mid $110 territory. Bitcoin is finding its initial support after a leg down lower around $18,000. Markets are anticipating what the Fed might say after rumors abound about a Fed pivot or pause. While these may culminate into a disbelief rally of 2022, I would theorize a few possible catalysts as to why the shift took place the way it did: Midterm elections and the overall global economic sentiment with the Fed’s current Quantitative Tightening policy.

First, let’s focus on the midterms elections. It’s helpful to understand that the average trajectory of all global markets, including here in the U.S., follows on whether Congress either remain the same or remade under a new regime, thus impacting the incumbent president’s political agenda. And it’s not hard to understand why: midterm elections that results in the split between party lines render the direction for the markets to go the positive direction, whereas the other outcome when the incumbent party is predominant in both chamber of Congress, slightly less so, due to more political uncertainty even before any election. In this case, this political environment is shaping up to be more of a split, leaning towards a more conservative shift in Congress. It’s important to observe this how it affects all risk assets like Bitcoin in this regard for this simple reason. Political gridlocks more so hamper any legislation that the current administration encourages Congress to establish dialogue on to formulate concrete policy. Historically, when that happens, the markets will assume that the status-quo is somewhat changed, and the focus is shifted on either on market growth or recovery (barring on any black swan events, of course).

Which brings to my next point: Quantitative Tightening and the global market’s response to that policy. Right now, everyone’s concern is on how the FOMC meeting will see how recent economic numbers will convince not just Powell, but most of his Fed governors, to tamper on their aggressive stance against this stubborn inflationary trend. Against the backdrop, while immediately evident, is other central banks’ shift in tone to tap on high interest rates, while slowing down their levels of rate hikes into 2023. More importantly, this reason could arguably be a short-term bullish development for risk-on assets such as Bitcoin and the rest of crypto solely because it can create renewed confidence of the fact that all global economies will not suffer a deep recession most would fear. But it remains to be seen how close a soft landing that the Fed argued earlier this year would keep it that way. 

Therefore, I would focus in the weeks ahead on where the DXY and Bitcoin is going forward from here. Given these are my thoughts on what could cause a notable shift, it is not at all the most absolute. What it’s certain that it’s setting up to be a very sizable relief rally towards the end of 2022.

stocks,"Recession canceled? U.S. GDP accelerated at 2.6% pace in Q3, better than expected as growth turns positive","We have reached the bottom!? 

* Gross domestic product rose 2.6% in the third quarter versus the estimate of 2.3%.

* A narrowing trade deficit and increases in consumer spending and government outlays boosted the number.

* A sharp pullback in housing subtracted from the number, part of a broader decline in private investment.

* Consumer spending decelerated, increasing at just a 1.4% pace in the quarter, down from 2% in Q2.

The U.S. economy posted its first period of positive growth for 2022 in the third quarter, at least temporarily easing recession fears, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday.

GDP, a sum of all the goods and services produced from July through September, increased at a 2.6% annualized pace for the period, according to the advance estimate. That was above against the Dow Jones forecast for 2.3%.

That reading follows consecutive negative quarters to start the year, meeting a commonly accepted definition of recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research is generally considered the arbiter of downturns and expansions.

The growth came in large part due to a narrowing trade deficit, which economists expected and consider to be a one-off occurrence that won’t be repeated in future quarters.

GDP gains also came from increases in consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment and government spending. The report reflected an ongoing shift to services spending over goods, with spending on the former increasing 2.8% while goods spending dropped 1.2%.

Declines in residential fixed investment and private inventories offset the gains, the BEA said.

The chain-weighted price index, a cost-of-living measure that adjusts for consumer behavior, rose 4.1% for the quarter, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 5.3% gain, due in large part to falling energy prices. Also, the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation measure for the Federal Reserve, increased 4.2%, down sharply from 7.3% in the prior quarter. Core prices, excluding food and energy, increased 4.5%, about in line with Wall Street expectations.

Earlier this year, the Fed began a campaign of interest rate hikes aimed at taming inflation. Since March, the central bank has raised its benchmark borrowing rate by 3 percentage points, taking it to its highest level since just before the worst of the financial crisis.",finance,1666900706
stocks,Amazon sinks on weak fourth-quarter guidance,"* Earnings: 28 cents per share
* Revenue: $127.10 billion vs. $127.46 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has had a rocky year so far as it confronts macroeconomic headwinds, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Those challenges have coincided with a slowdown in Amazon’s core retail business, as consumers returned to shopping in stores.

Under CEO Andy Jassy, who took the helm from founder Jeff Bezos in July 2021, Amazon has responded to rising expenses by aggressively cutting costs across numerous divisions in recent months. It shed warehouse space, halted some experimental projects, shuttered its telehealth service and froze hiring for corporate roles in its retail business.

Still, analysts are expecting Amazon to report solid third-quarter results, thanks to easier comparisons with last year’s numbers and a potential sales boost from its annual Prime Day discount event, which was held in July.

Revenue growth is projected to come in at 15%, marking a return to double-digit expansion after three straight quarters of growth in the single digits.

Another bright spot could be Amazon’s advertising unit, which has been more resilient compared to peers including Meta, Alphabet and Snap, whose ads businesses have gotten whacked due to the economic environment and Apple’s iOS privacy changes last year.

On Tuesday, Alphabet missed expectations for the third quarter, and YouTube’s ad revenue declined for the first time since Google started breaking out results for the streaming video unit. Facebook parent Meta stumbled again on Wednesday, issuing disappointing earnings and a weaker-than-expected forecast for the fourth quarter.

“Besides allocation to TikTok, budget shift to lower funnel activities is the consistent point of feedback in our conversations with marketers this quarter,” said Rob Sanderson, a managing director at Loop Capital who recommends buying Amazon shares, in a recent note to clients. “Amazon is the lowest on the funnel.”

Wall Street will also be paying close attention to Amazon’s fourth-quarter guidance. The forecast could signal how much demand Amazon expects to see during the holiday shopping period. Analysts are already girding for a lackluster season, with online sales expected to grow just 2.5%, according to Adobe.

Earlier this month, Amazon hosted a 48-hour Prime Early Access Sale, which was the first time it has held two major discount events in the same year. The event jump-started the holiday shopping period early, and it could help juice Amazon’s sales in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv are projecting fourth-quarter revenue of $155.15 billion.

Analysts have taken different approaches to their per-share earnings estimates because of Amazon’s hefty investment in electric-vehicle maker Rivian, which went public late last year. The plunge in Rivian’s share price forced Amazon to take a combined $11.5 billion markdown in the first two quarters of 2022. However, Rivian shares rebounded a bit in the third quarter, climbing 28%, which could lead Amazon to mark up the investment.

Amazon shares have slid 34% so far this year, while the S&amp;P 500 index has dropped 20% over the same period.

# Introduction

## Background

Intel used to be a giant in the microchip and semiconductor sector, but recently it found itself eclipsed by its competitor in matters of quality, strategic development and public perception. Those changes are due to its recent management team, which stagnated the company and slowed it with bad management decisions. With the new CEO Pat Gelsinger and his expertise, direct experience and know-how in the sector, the company is moving out from its slowdown and trying to catch up with its main rivals.

## Purpose

The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the development of Intel Corporation (INTC) during the past four years, from 2018 to 2021 and forecast its activity for the next five years. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration but also macroeconomics factors and its main competitor Advanced Micro Device (AMD).

All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?
* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

## Hypothesis

* INTC is not a dying company
* INTC downtrend is following the sector and the market movement
* INTC is a cyclical business, and we are in a down cycle
* INTC investments will boost its revenues in the next five years
* USA government will not allow one of its pivotal and strategic company to fail
* INTC will face more stress as AMD is eating market share
* INTC’s new products are the top-notch of the sector

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

## Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of 30 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.45% and its Growth Rate of 18.26% to determine a fair value of **$23.57** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|18.26|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$97.53**

&amp;#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|18.26%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,106,000,000|

## Dividend Discount Model

The dividend discount model (DDM) is a quantitative method used for predicting the price of a company's stock based on the theory that its present-day price is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments when discounted back to their present value.

The model gives a negative number when companies have a lower rate of return compared to the dividend growth rate. This may happen when a company continues to pay dividends even if it is incurring a loss or relatively lower earnings, as per Intel Case. This makes this model not good to be used alone when evaluating a business.

Knowing this, the model is still used here, mainly because the final price tag is determined by the average of all the methods. This choice is made by the necessity of conservative estimates and cautious predictions. The discounted rating used here is the CAPM of 7.01%.

The model gives the following result:

|Fair Value, taking in count a perpetual growth rate. Here we used the company growth rate of 18.26% and not the average growth rate of the dividends. This is due to the fact that the price given by the dividend growth is considered to be unrealistic for the next five years.|$-15.36|
|:-|:-|
|Fair Value assuming a zero growth in the dividends' growth. This price is not used to determine the final value due to the fact that the company has historically paid dividends with constant growth, and it is predicted to not stop this trend.|$24.62|

&amp;#x200B;

## Total Payout Model

It is a variation of the DDF that takes in count shares repurchases. With 5.64 Billion paid in dividend in 2021, discount rate of 7.01% (CAPM) and growth rate of 18.26%, this model gives us a price tag of -**$12.22**

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$23.57|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$97.53|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|$56.67|
|Dividend Discount Model|$-15.36|
|Total Payout Model|\-$12.22|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$30.04**|

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor’s sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|

# The Products

|**CGC – Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|
|:-|
|**NEX – Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|
|**DCAI – Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|
|**AXG – Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|
|**IFS – Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|
|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|

# Financials

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&amp;C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&amp;E

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product’s portfolio, where AMD doesn’t have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival’s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel’s perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend’s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $30.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

CryptoCurrency,Crypto market summary in Q3 2022,"Thought this was a fairly helpful summary of the crypto market in the last few months.

Excerpted from https://ripple.com/insights/q3-2022-xrp-markets-report/

.

In Q3, the macroeconomic environment continued to experience considerable volatility in response to geopolitical and economic events ranging from further escalation in the Russia-Ukraine War to declining economic health in the Eurozone and the UK. In addition, a persistently strong U.S. labor market and stubborn headline inflation prompted what some perceive as a hardline stance towards bringing down inflation by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The U.S. dollar remained strong against all other paired assets, with the U.S. Dollar Index climbing above 114, a level not seen since 2002. This has been the primary contributor to tepid price action across crypto and FX markets (such as EUR, GBP, JPY and other emerging market currencies).  

That said, crypto markets showed signs of resilience by outperforming asset classes such as equities, bonds and FX. Over Q3, bitcoin (BTC) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by over 5%, and outperformed U.S. treasuries by over 8%. During September, which was a substantially red month for equities and bonds, crypto found strong support across tokens and projects, and managed to trade mostly range-bound. This led to a near term decoupling of correlations with BTC to S&amp;P at 0.5 and with XRP to S&amp;P at 0.21. At the beginning of Q3, these numbers were materially higher. 

Leverage in the system remained constant. While trading volumes and open interest lingered at median values for BTC over the last two years, there was a meaningful return to pre-crash levels in ether (ETH). Furthermore, concerted efforts to bring critical traditional markets leveraged infrastructure to crypto were visible. These ranged from prime brokers, clearing houses, OTC derivatives desks and uncollateralized lenders.  

Notably, Ethereum’s widely anticipated upgrade to Proof-of-Stake, referred to as the Merge, crossed the finish line after years of experimentation and testing. The Merge played a large role in anticipatory positioning and price action by participants but ultimately had little impact on the markets. That said, the effects of the dramatic shift in the tokenomics of ETH are still being realized by the market and will take time to materialize.

While equities continued to sell off, and crypto companies maintained hiring freezes and conducted layoffs, announcements of strong funding deals with respectable valuations were seen. FTX announced it had at least $1B to spend on acquisitions and bailouts and weeks later, the company won a bid to buy Voyager’s assets. In addition, FTX was also rumored to be buying Celsius and to be in talks with investors to raise another round at a valuation of $32B. Lastly, Animoca closed a $110M round led by Temasek and Pantera announced its plans to raise a second blockchain fund. While new money entering the industry remains at a 12 month low ($3.3B this year vs $7B last year according to Crunchbase), this still indicates that conviction, sources of capital and outlook for the future continue to be seen as positive.",cryptocurrency,1666923474

This is majorly because of a narrowing trade deficit and increase in consumer spending and government outlays. 

The markets seemed to have already reacted to this news. The next major event from the perspective of the markets is to be the Fed's meeting on 1-2 November. An increase of 0 75% in interest rate is expected and already priced in. However, there are rumours that the Fed may talk about possible [pivot](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-pivot-is-coming-in-december-heres-proof/) in the near future.

Considering the fact that inflation reduced last month, although minutely, we may see some relief, however, I'm not very hopeful. Personally, I would aim to continue to buy crypto when bitcoin is under 18.5K and sell once it crosses 21k.

The situation has changed recently. I used to pay a 500/month payment for a truck, it was 25k used, I paid for years until I owed 12k, but I had a bad choice in the early summer (when I make more money) and bought a new truck.
I turned in my used truck to cover for part of the down payment (they only gave 1k for the truck (their value was at 13k, debt 12k) and covered the debt) and bought a new truck for 70k. The monthly payment would be 900/month, and I was stupid to think I could pay it.

In a few months, in September, my wife finally got me to think about it and I returned the truck. I do not have a truck payment anymore, but I also do not have a work car.

I am commuting with coworker (paid for minivan) to get to work. But the work is temporary: he only needs a little help with his trade for this winter, and I am learning, but he does the main work.

I want to get a truck again and return to working for myself. I am getting paid much less these last months working for him, but I also have more money to pay credit.

I can save 2k in months until tax and allocate remaining 2k to amount to 4k for a down payment on a truck. This can get me a 30k truck.

I can ask for hardship interest rate on the home depot card to lower my accruing debt on the biggest card.

Bitcoin,The 3 fundamental philosophical differences between Bitcoin and the U.S. Dollar,"Contrary to what many people believe, the current monetary and financial system is very recent. This experiment, unilaterally decided by Richard Nixon in August 1971, has celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2021. The current system is therefore relatively young.

The least that can be said is that this system, which is not based on anything tangible, has completely failed in its mission to stabilize the world economy.

Worse still, inequalities of income and wealth have continued to increase since 1971. The current system is therefore clearly failing. It allows a minority of people to become enormously rich by imposing unfair decisions on a majority of people.

At the center of the current system is the U.S. dollar.

The U.S. dollar has been the world’s reserve currency since 1920 and has reached the average life expectancy for a world reserve currency. Many people question the possible end of the U.S. dollar’s hegemony in the years to come.

Many are aware of the limits of the U.S. dollar, but they point out that the U.S. dollar cannot lose its status because no credible competitor is emerging behind it.

These people think this way because they limit their field of vision to fiat currencies. You have to look beyond these fiat currencies to understand that hard money that has been growing for more than 13 years now can be a credible alternative to the hegemony of the U.S. dollar in the future.

This hard money is Bitcoin.

Neutral from a political point of view, Bitcoin is a currency with absolute scarcity. There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined. Bitcoin’s monetary policy highlights the virtues of quantitative hardening.

While central banks have the power to print endlessly fiat money out of thin air, Bitcoin cannot be manipulated in this way. It represents a total paradigm shift from the current system. Bitcoin is much more protective of its users.

Bitcoin belongs to its users. It gives them a power that belongs to them by right, and which the current monetary and financial system has deprived them of for too many years now.

Buying Bitcoin is to vote against the current system and, above all, for a fairer world in the future.

I think there are (at least) 3 fundamental philosophical differences between Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar that make all the difference:

1. Bitcoin gives you freedom, the U.S. dollar requires that you ask for permission.
2. Bitcoin represents progress, the U.S. dollar represents stagnation.
3. Bitcoin promotes fairness, the U.S. dollar promotes cronyism.

Bitcoin is a total paradigm shift from the current monetary and financial system where the U.S. dollar has reigned as the hegemonic king for 100 years. Bitcoin gives its users the freedom they should never have lost. The U.S. dollar has gotten you used to ask for permission when the power is in your hands.

Rather than continuing to stagnate in a flawed system, you need to open your eyes to the progress that Bitcoin represents.

The fairer world that Bitcoin builds will put an end to the cronyism that the current system has always fostered. By buying Bitcoin, you will be making the choice to take control of your destiny for good.",cryptocurrency,1666935721

Federal Reserve officials will maintain their resolutely hawkish stance next week, laying the groundwork for interest rates reaching 5% by March 2023, moves that seem likely to lead to a US and global recession, economists surveyed by Bloomberg said.

The Federal Open Market Committee will raise rates by 75 basis points for a fourth consecutive meeting when policymakers announce their decision at 2 p.m. in Washington Wednesday, the survey found.

Rates are projected in the survey to rise another half point in December, then by quarter points the following two meetings. Fed forecasts released at the September meeting showed rates reaching 4.4% this year and 4.6% next year, before cuts in 2024. 

Rates Heading to 5% in 2023
Economists see 75 basis-point hike, then downshifting.

Economists see the Fed as determined not to pivot too soon as it fights against an inflation rate at a 40-year high. The shift to a higher peak rate would reflect consumer-price growth, excluding food and energy, that came in hotter than expected for the past two months. The survey of 40 economists was conducted Oct. 21-26.

“Inflation pressures remain intense and the Fed is set to hike by 75 basis points in November,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Groep NV, said in a survey response “We are currently forecasting a more muted 50 basis-point hike in December given a weakening economic and market backdrop,” but the risks are skewed toward a fifth 75 basis-point hike, he said.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank is strongly committed to restoring price stability and he’s repeatedly invoked his predecessor, Paul Volcker, who boosted rates to unprecedented levels to counter inflation in the early 1980s. Powell has warned the process will be painful, because the goal is to engineer below-trend growth to reduce price pressures and unemployment will rise as a result.

Three-Quarters of Economists Expect a US Recession
Survey shows a new consensus for a downturn in next 24 months

Economists were asked if US would have a recession in the next 24 months. Hard landing is defined as zero or negative growth for a time but not an officially declared recession.

Powell and his colleagues have not given up hope that they can pull off a soft landing for the economy. But for the first time in the pre-FOMC meeting surveys, a majority of the economists -- three-quarters -- see a recession as likely over the next two years, and most of the rest see a hard landing with a period of zero or negative growth ahead.

What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“I think the most important thing to watch for is how Powell  communicates the potential downshift in the pace of rate hikes. He will want to avoid giving the impression that a pivot is imminent, especially not when core inflation is clearly still going strong. He would be preparing for the markets for a 50 basis-point hike in December but which will also be accompanied with a dot plot, which shows 5% terminal rate.”

-- Anna Wong, chief US economist

The economists see the Fed as potentially overtightening: The median economist would set a peak target rate at 4.75%, and 75% of the economists said there’s a greater risk that the central bank will raise rates too much and cause unnecessary pain as opposed to not raising enough and failing to contain inflation.

“Monetary-policy lags are still underestimated,” said Thomas Costerg, senior US economist at Pictet Wealth Management.  “The full effect of current tightening may not be felt until mid-2023. By then, it could be too late. The risk of a policy mistake is high.”

There could be economic spillover too to global markets, as two-thirds expect a global recession in the next two years.

I kept upping my budget to get something with AWD and low mileage. Ended up with a Toyota that fit the bill and a monthly payment of $500 with an interest rate under 1%. 

I’ve since changed jobs and while I make more money, I have the option to take the bus to work and one of the bus stops is close enough to walk.  However, I can, and do, catch the bus further down the route with a ten minute drive which ends up saving me time sitting on the bus. 

This means that I’m effectively driving an optional twenty minutes a day. On the weekends my husband and I use our cars interchangeably. 

I keep thinking that using that $500 per month to pay off debt/save for a down payment would be a much better use of that money. However, if we were to buy a house in the next year to year and a half there’s no guarantee that it would be on the bus route and I would potentially need to buy another car. 

Am I missing anything here? Would it be an extremely poor financial decision to sell the car now? I can’t tell if it is just a short term gain.",finance,1666962568

For this year, 16 startups were in the running for the golden ticket to the U.S, from which I selected 6 with the coolest projects:

CryptoCurrency,"CNBC called me the crypto godfather. I was SIM swapped, then robbed of $23.8M in crypto. I sued the cybercriminals, and won—now I'm battling AT&amp;T. AMA.","Hello, r/cryptocurrency! I’m Michael Terpin.

On January 7, 2018, an AT&amp;T contractor named Jahmil Smith took a bribe from a criminal gang (known variously as “The Community” or “The Pinsky Gang”) to have my digital identity turned over to the gang—in exchange for a few hundred dollars. This was accomplished through a form of identity theft called “SIM swap” wherein an unauthorized user (typically a criminal) takes over one’s digital identity to bypass second-factor security protections. I was then robbed, despite extensive security measures, of $24.7 million of altcoins, which could only have happened with the digital permissions given by the “fake me” aka the SIM Swappers.

After months of negotiation, AT&amp;T offered me $0.00, as they told my attorneys “we aren’t criminals”—but we allege they were certainly negligent in promising high security (I was given a “highest security” account because of a prior SIM Swap). My attorneys and I [filed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cryptocurrency-at-t-lawsuit/u-s-investor-sues-att-for-224-million-over-loss-of-cryptocurrency-idUSKBN1L01AA) a $224 million lawsuit against AT&amp;T in August 2018, and after $3 mm in legal fees over four years, we now have a trial date in May 2023 in federal court (more on AT&amp;T later).

In December 2018, I [filed a complaint](https://nypost.com/2019/04/13/hackers-are-stealing-millions-in-bitcoin-and-living-like-big-shots/) against one of the hackers, Nicholas Truglia, with the Los Angeles Superior court—and [won $75.8 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-lawsuit/u-s-investor-awarded-75-million-in-cryptocurrency-crime-case-idUSKCN1SG2CO) in a civil judgment against him in May 2019. In 2021, [Truglia plead guilty](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/12/ny-man-pleads-guilty-in-20-million-sim-swap-theft/) to $20 million in SIM Swap theft.

In May 2020, I [filed a civil suit against Ellis Pinsky](https://nypost.com/2020/05/23/baby-al-capone-ellis-pinsky-pulled-off-a-23-8-million-crypto-heist/) (who I dubbed “Baby Al Capone” to the NY Post and the name has stuck). He admitted guilt and will be held responsible for $22 million (the amount he and his fellow gang members stole, minus a $2 mm credit for paying us back a small portion in 2019), as [reported by Gizmodo earlier this month](https://gizmodo.com/ellis-pinsky-crypto-hack-michael-terpin-1849658068). Equally important is his [agreement to provide evidence and testimony against AT&amp;T](https://nypost.com/2022/10/20/ellis-pinsky-teams-with-alleged-victim-michael-terpin-to-take-on-att/) in our upcoming May 2023 trial in federal court in Los Angeles.

**What’s next:** This month I launched an NFT project, SIM Dogs, to support the ongoing legal battle with AT&amp;T and help bring awareness to SIM Swap. I created SIM Dogs a year ago, during which time no legal battle had ever enlisted NFTs (that I could find). My attorneys thought I had lost my mind. You can check out more information about SIM Dogs and join us at the following link:

My son has two 529 plans. One is in his grandpa's name and he is the beneficiary. The other is in his name.

  
He is currently in his third year of college, but we have not cashed out the 529s to pay for anything yet as since he has been in school, the loans he has have had 0% interest running on them. But that interest forbearance is coming to an end on Jan 1 2023 so we want to get these cashed out and loans paid down.  


We have two types of loans for my son's education:  
1) he has federal loans in his name (subsidized and unsubsidized)  
2) I took out Parents Plus loan in my name to pay for the remaining balances  


What we'd like to do now is to get these 529s cashed out ASAP before interest kicks in and (this is the important part) to use those funds to pay the Parents Plus loans first and foremost.  
But the trick is that the money will be dispersed directly to him. So how do we go about using that money to pay down the loans in my name and not incur tax penalties come tax time in 2023?  


I'm not sure what (if any) other information anyone will need, but I will be happy to share what I can.

investing,I Bond Processing and Rates,"Hello all,

I managed to wait out the long load times and scheduled a purchase for an I Bond today, and got a confirmation email stating my order will be executed 10/31. 

If this is the case, would I still receive the ~9% interest rate (assuming my order is processed with the potential delay warned about) or is the order execution too late and I would receive ~6%.

I made a cash deposit at an ATM yesterday for $255. Deposit didn't hit my account, I have a slip saying that my card can't be used at that ATM. But the machine never returned my money either. It's a PNC surcharge free ATM. I've called PNC numerous times, and spoken to a branch manager. They reached out to the ATM department at PNC. The department insists I need to file a dispute with my bank. My bank is Moves Financial, a fintech company. Debit card is issued by Blue Ridge Bank N.A. It's a Visa.

I've called Moves, Visa, and Visa transferred me to Blue Ridge. Nobody is saying they can help me. Visa said they needed to transfer me to Blue Ridge, but Blue Ridge said they have no access to Moves accounts, even though they issue the cards for their accounts.

Moves is saying that there is no record of the transaction, so they can't file a dispute. Branch manager at PNC told me to inform them that the dispute is for ""transaction not found"". I tried calling them again like 15 minutes ago with this knowledge. I called the number on my Moves Financial card. I pressed ""2"" to file a dispute. The lady on the phone was nice but told me for transactions that aren't showing up, I need to call a different number? OK, whatever. She gave me 2 numbers to try. First number is just an automated line that says I can't be helped, 2nd line is for American Home Shields???

I emailed Moves Financial again to tell them that a dispute must be filed as ""transaction not found"", but I doubt they will be doing anything of the sort. Everyone is pointing fingers at each other, saying someone else is responsible.

I'm so fed up. This was not a small amount of money. My family and I needed this money. I'm a full time gig worker which is why I signed up for Moves. They're made for gig workers. But they are so abysmal at handling issues, I never want to use them again after this.

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights

&gt;The core personal consumption expenditures price index increased 0.5% from the previous month and accelerated 5.1% over the past 12 months, the report showed. The monthly gain was in line with Dow Jones estimates, while the annual increase was slightly below the 5.2% forecast.

&gt;Including food and energy, PCE inflation rose 0.3% for the month and 6.2% on a yearly basis, the same as in August.

Labor market is still tight

&gt;A separate release Friday showed that employment costs rose 1.2% for the third quarter, in line with estimates, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On an annual basis, the employment cost index increased 5%, slightly lower than the 5.1% pace in the second quarter.

&gt;Fed officials watch Friday’s data points closely for clues about where costs are headed, particularly with a tight labor market in which there are 1.7 jobs per every available worker, according to recent BLS data.

Consumer spending still (unsustainably) strong

&gt;The BEA also reported that personal income increased 0.4% in September, one-tenth of a percentage point above the estimate. Spending as gauged through personal consumption expenditures increased 0.6%, more than the 0.4% estimate.

&gt;However, when adjusted for inflation, spending rose just 0.3%. Disposable personal income, or what is left after taxes and other charges, rose 0.4% on the month but was flat on an inflation-adjusted basis.

bonds,Long-Term Treasury ETFs,"Need a gut check on something.

I've been looking into various sources of analysis, and the consensus seems to be that while rates will continue to rise in the near term, going into late 2023 / early 2024 they are likely to drop as inflation lessens.  In reviewing this, it seems like a no brainer to start putting money into a long-term treasury ETF like SPTL beginning near the end of 2022.  There might be some short-term loss, but eventually interest rates will drop and the value of SPTL will go up a lot.  While we of course can't predict when this will happen, and I face some downside risk, it seems to me that interest rates eventually have to drop and have to drop by a lot, as they can't stay here forever, thus increasing SPTL's value.

bonds,"""Fed pivot"" hope trades may get blindsided by an overlooked risk","**""Fed Pivot"" hopes fueled asset market rebound**

""Fed Pivot"" briefly trended on Twitter yesterday as bond yields declined since last Friday's WSJ / Timirao article. It energized talks of the Fed slowing its pace of tightening in 2023, and dovish-leaning Bank of Canada and ECB policy meetings also reinforced such outlook.

Together with lower rates, dollar weakened, and equities rallied (S&amp;P 500 rose from 3,678 to 3,900). In short, asset price rebound softened Fed's constraints imposed on markets and the economy.

Investors aligned to the ""Fed Pivot"" trade expect asset prices to rise further, for they see the economy is in or near a recession, which would push down inflation and reduce a key pillar of Fed hawkishness. Some institutions even became hopeful of a recession: more severe the recession, bigger the bailout.

However, there is a key oversight to that thesis.

**Buying in anticipation of ""Fed Pivot"" has a pitfall**

If supply-led (and geopolitical-fueled) inflation pressure persists for longer (it doesn't have to rise but to decline slower than expected), then Fed's on-going balance sheet unwind would continue to drain bank reserves for longer. In 2019, the decline in bank reserves briefly triggered a liquidity shortage (""repo crisis"") when it fell below $1.4 trillion.

The financial system is more leveraged now than in 2019, thanks to the massive QE program. As U.K.'s recent pension crisis revealed, a liquidity drought and systemic margin calls can materialize quickly, forcing investors to sell government bonds for cash as ""haven assets"" and risk assets decline in tandem.

In a scenario of inflation not falling as quickly as expected, falling bank reserves (lifeblood of both markets and the economy) from Fed balance sheet unwind may trigger a cash crunch in markets before a severe recession takes root in the real economy. Therefore, all the investors that bought bonds and stocks in anticipation of bailout would be caught in their most vulnerable state.

Essentially there are three scenarios:

1. What policymakers expect: inflation declines below target, no recession, no financial crisis
2. ""Fed pivot"" hope trade: inflation declines due to severe recession, leading to more Fed QE
3. Stagflation forces the Fed to persist with QT. Liquidity crisis arrives before severe recession

Scenario #3 above is the overlooked outcome that can blindside investors positioned in #1 and #2.

The purpose of this post is not to argue stagflation is guaranteed. Instead, it is the exact opposite: many investors appear really sure on disinflation and a return to the past status quo (pre-2020). Worse, some institutions are latching on low-inflation-from-recession as the magic pathway to end their losses. I think it helps to be a bit more cautious.

personalfinance,(Sanity check) Am I understanding how taxes work for my somewhat rare case?,"I am a disabled veteran who has been granted TDIU (P &amp; T).

Basically, this means that while I do not meet the criteria of a 100% disabled vet, my disability renders me unemployable and I am compensated at the 100% rate. The P &amp; T indicate that the VA determined I am unlikely to ever improve and I am not subject to being re-evaluated.

The ~$3,300 I receive every month is my only source of income, but it is tax-free. I am permitted to participate in marginal employment, but earning wages greater than the federal poverty level has the potential to threaten my entitlement. Truthfully, my condition does make me a non-viable candidate for anything resembling a ""real job"", but at the same time, I hate the thought of laying around all day, letting my CS education go to waste and feeling useless.

When I read books about investing and personal finance, I find myself wondering if my understanding is flawed, or if the need to find ""tax-advantaged"" solutions (e.g. starting an LLC and working a few hours a week for myself to contribute to a solo 401k) is not as important to me as it is to the average citizen. If I'm not mistaken, this would create a so-called ""sheltered work environment"" and I could earn more if I wanted to, but I suspect it's overkill.

Buying up index funds is a no-brainer: I can buy and hold and only pay the long-term capital gains tax (which would be 0%, provided the sale did not exceed that year's threshold). Since my taxable income is effectively 0, do the dividends I would receive from certain stocks get the same treatment?

I am considering (after lots of research!) investing in traditionally volatile securities like small caps and emerging markets, because I am relatively young (late 30s) and I have the ""safety blanket"" of knowing my income is guaranteed by the U.S. government.

Am I missing something critical, or should I take every spare cent I have and throw it in different investments, without being so worried about taxes (at least for now, while the income will be negligible)?

(There are other matters I wonder about, such as how much of a cash reserve I really need if my income is as steady as receiving the same amount every month from the US Treasury, and I wonder if any financial education resources exist for people who are in my position.

Now here's the tricky part. I was given a range of options for financing with both lower and higher monthly costs, different interest rates and financing fees.

The lowest rate is 1.99% 25 year loan at around $180/mo (solar, fees, and roof included) where the added financing fee is about $15,000.

They advised I would be able to chose to repay the balance over time or tack the owed payments to the end of the loan.

Now that I have actually gotten the loan modification documents, that is not the case. The offer is to roll the owed balance into the loan, but my interest rate goes from about 3.5 to about 7.5....increasing the monthly payment from 1900 to 2600.

I have about 15k in cash. The past due amount is about 52k. Credit is about 720 if that matters. About 20k in retirement account from company that let me go back in 2020- not sure if this money is touchable.

The loan servicer said this is the only option they can give me. The first 3 payments are a trial, so if I can come up with the money to pay the balance in the next 3 months, I can bring the account current and keep my interest rate.

Wondering if it would be possible and if it would even be a good idea to take a personal loan for the 37k and bring account current to keep that lower interest rate.

Or am I SOL and just have to eat the newer higher payment? It will be at the top of my budget...what are the chances of being able to bring the interest down I the future?

I think my parents are looking to sell in about 5 years but have no firm plans at this moment. My thought is that this project might help begin the long process of preparing the house to be ready to sell and downsize, which means this would turn into a fairly quick return on investment.

investing,Charts and Graphs: US Corporate (Excess) Equity,"It's my opinion US stocks remain highly overvalued in relative terms versus their own debt (specifically, bonds).

This can be a very (very) lengthy post, but I plan to keep this concise, and will attempt to illustrate my view above using data from various sources. I won't spend too much writing providing explanation or definitions of these series and limit observations and opinions in order to minimalism this post.

Let's start by looking at [actual value of US stocks (market capitalization) relative to the estimated value of the market capitalization](https://imgur.com/a/6DGqsEZ) using their bonds as an input. Note: In almost all periods, US stocks are undervalued relative to corporate debt. (sources: Federal Reserve)

Second, if the pinnacle of stock overvaluation relative to its debt was 1999-2000 pre-TMT bubble, [we are back to that period](https://imgur.com/a/rEDDEjN); here is a [histogram graph](https://imgur.com/a/vLAtZxL) as well. (source: Federal Reserve). I do understand that spreads are not the same as they were in this time period, however, the return to these levels are more a function of the recent bond route in investment grade corporate bonds.

Third, the Federal Reserves actions, specifically with rate raises, has [triggered a value shift from US stocks to US corporate bonds](https://imgur.com/a/Td7qDCJ); this is nothing new. (source: Federal Reserve)

How might this manifest? Here are a few thoughts:

* Assuming investment grade corporate debt recoups 50% of its current losses from its peak, a re-calibration of historical performance between stocks and corporate bonds pins S&amp;P 500 around 3,225.
* Assuming investment grade corporate debt is stable at these levels, ie. yields are tightly range bound and volatility subsides, a re-calibration of historical performance between stocks and corporate bonds pins S&amp;P 500 around 2,800.
* Assuming US Stocks overshoot to the downside (similar to 2003) much like the did to the upside post-COVID and like they did in 2000, and assuming US corporate debt returns to the all-time high levels seen in late 2021, the S&amp;P 500 would trade around 2,500.
* It would be expected that further downside in US corporate debt (investment grade bonds) would see a rapidly declining S&amp;P 500.

**The above are not market calls, but simply observations of the past.**

The SEC does NOT want to risk any ruling that results in precedent going against them. 

They handed over the emails. 

So right now this lawsuit is wrapping up, final submissions are being made and the SEC’s argument is very weak. Multiple amicus briefs are being submitted in support of Ripple. Some of these completely destroy the SEC’s argument and highlight the fact they are not protecting investors.

So as we reach the pointy end, the SEC won’t leave this in the judges hands, even if they do then they have to deal with the fair notice defence. If those emails are as damaging as the Ripple team say, expect settlement.

# **Dow closes 800 points higher on Friday, registers fourth straight week of gains - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks rose on Friday despite a tumble in Amazon shares after economic data pointed to slowing inflation and a steady consumer.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 828.52 points, or about 2.6%, higher at 32,861.80. The S&amp;P 500 added nearly 2.5%, to close at 3,901.06. The Nasdaq Composite ended up about 2.9%, to close at 11,102.45.
*****
&gt; On a weekly basis, the major indexes made notable gains. It was the fourth positive week in a row for the Dow, a first since a five-week streak ending in November 2021. The 30-stock index is up 5.7% this week in its best performance since May. It’s also on track for its best month since January 1976.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are up 3.9% and 2.2%, respectively, for the week.
*****
&gt; The stock market has fractured this week as investors dumped technology shares following weak results and outlooks from Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta and rotated into economically sensitive stocks that will benefit if the U.S. economy can skirt a recession.
*****
&gt; At the same time, investors have found hope in data that came out over the course of the week indicating inflation may be easing, increasing optimism that the Federal Reserve could break from its trend of 75 basis point rate hikes after the November meeting.
*****
&gt; “Inflation data really wasn’t that bad. The earnings have been not great, but not awful,” said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence. “When you have that middle of the road, that helps equity markets.”
*****
&gt; Amazon plunged by 6.8% after the company posted weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue and issued disappointing fourth-quarter sales guidance Thursday. Apple shares ended Friday up 7.5%. The tech giant reported weaker-than-anticipated iPhone revenue on Thursday, but beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly earnings and revenue.
*****
&gt; Apple and other more positive performers, like Intel, have given investors footholds within what some see as a particularly tumultuous tech sector, subsequently providing upward pressure to the tech-heavy Nasdaq, said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Management. He said the market was also boosted by oil giants Chevron and Exxon Mobil, up about 1.2% and 2.9%, respectively, after both reported beating expectations before the bell.
*****
&gt; “Apple’s really the lone star, if you will, of the mega-cap tech stocks,” Hatfield said. “It’s just a unique market where bad is terrible, but OK is good, so, on a relative basis, it’s spectacular.”
*****
&gt; The market got a boost after the core personal consumption expenditures price index in September increased 0.5% from the previous month and 5.1% from a year ago, still high but mostly in-line with expectations. This is the preferred gauge of inflation for the Federal Reserve. Personal spending rose 0.6%, more than expected, the data showed.

&gt; # November is Top NASDAQ Month in Midterm Years

&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA, S&amp;P 500 (since 1950), and NASDAQ (since 1971) month. November is best for Russell 1000 (since 1979) and Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in all year ranges from 1.7% from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 to a solid 2.3% by Russell 2000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bf7f124e426aed95ecaf43ab170cefe2/bf37b50ec7fbe190-58/s400x600/386442ec3856f155e7a32b91b86aabeb73364d14.jpg))**

&gt; In midterm years, November’s market prowess is relatively unchanged. DJIA has advanced in 14 of the last 18 midterm years since 1950 with an average gain of 2.5%. S&amp;P 500 has also been up in 14 of the past 18 midterm years, gaining on average 2.6%. Small caps perform well with Russell 2000 climbing in 7 of the past 10 midterm years, averaging 3.3%. The only real blemish in the November midterm-year record is 1974 (DJIA –7.0%, the final DJIA bear market bottom was in December).

&gt; # Here Comes The Historically Best Six Months Of The Year For Stocks

&gt; “The farther back you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see.” Winston Churchill

&gt; The bounce off the October lows continues, with October living up to it’s reputation as both a potential bear market killer, but also the best month of a midterm year. Even more interesting is the past eight times the S&amp;P 500 closed green, stocks gained at least 1% as well. That could be another clue that buyers are aggressively adding and the good news is we’ve seen previous streaks like this take place near major bear market lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chart-1-102522.png))**

&gt; Here’s a chart we’ve shared a lot this year, but it still makes sense to share to make sure investors are aware of it. Looking at the first few quarters of a midterm year we find that stocks usually don’t do well. That’s sure happened this year. The good news is this quarter and the next two quarters have in previous years shown to be the strongest out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle. Better times could be coming and knowing history like Churchill told us means the bulls could be smiling soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chart-2-102522.png))**

&gt; Lastly, many investors are aware of “Sell in May and Go Away,” which shows that the historically worst six months of the year for stocks are from May through Halloween. The good news is we are about to leave those worst six months and enter into what has historically been some of the best times for stocks. In fact, looking at the November through April period shows that stocks have been higher every single time during a midterm year going back to 1950. That is 18 for 18 for those counting at home. Sure, six months from now this could be 18 for 19, but as we’ve been noting a lot on this blog lately, we are seeing many signs that a major market low could be taking place.

&gt; # Setting the Record Straight: Best Six Months, Halloween Indicator, Sell in May

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/1ced387dd2cb26dc6c0e897fb72080d8/652e260f9b9d1d41-c9/s500x750/0d34550a6986d9ac345e0496eef4dcf587a1ba00.jpg))**

&gt; It’s that time of year again. The Best Six Months November-April begin next week, and they are even better when they begin in midterm years. But there are the naysayers so here’s the proof. This bar chart from the about to be released 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac is led to Yale Hirsch’s discovery of this pattern and strategy.

&gt; Our Best Six Months Switching Strategy (aka “Halloween Indicator” or “Sell in May”) works. Any research to the contrary that goes back to 1900 on the DJIA (or even further back), is way too far back. Sell in May is an old British saw, soundly based on inherent behavioral finance patterns and the collective cultural behavior of the investment community, but it did not truly become a tradable investment strategy until after WWII.

&gt; The issue with starting way back then is the world is a much different place now than 100-plus years ago. Prior to about 1950, farming was a major portion of the U.S. economy and from 1901-1950, August was the best performing month of the year, up 36 times in 49 years (market closed in August 1914 due to World War I) with an average gain of 2.3%. July was the second-best month, up 31 of 50 with an average gain of 1.5%. June was fourth best, averaging 0.9%. Why, you may ask? Simply: planting, sowing, reaping, and harvesting. As crops were planted and then brought to market and sold, cash began to move and so did the stock market.

&gt; Agriculture’s share of GDP began to shrink post World War II as industrialization created a growing middle class that moved to the suburbs where hard-earned salaries would be spent filling new homes with all the modern conveniences we all take for granted now. Farming became more efficient and fewer and fewer people worked on the farm.

&gt; Suddenly, summer was less about the hard work of harvesting crops and more about vacations and relaxing. As the economy evolved and peoples’ lives changed, the market evolved. June and August went from being top performing months to bottom performing months. August went from #1 to #10 in 1950-2021 with an average DJIA gain of 0.1%. June went from #4 to #9 (0.1% average). The shift in DJIA’s seasonal pattern is clear in the following chart. “Sell in May” is a post WWII pattern, prior to then it would have been “Buy in May”.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c7f66628b752d034080d9e5c2c749064/652e260f9b9d1d41-55/s500x750/a7f2ff323dad4c7a00e5d66772375d9cc9e9793a.jpg))**

&gt; While many market participants are hip to the saying “Sell in May and go away,” most forget to get back into the market in the fall. We like to say, “Buy in October and get yourself sober.” Before folks were keen on the Halloween Indicator which calls for getting long stocks on Halloween and the end of October, we created our Best Six Months Switching Strategy in 1986 and first featured it in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac.

&gt; Back in 1986 we showed how most of the market’s gains were made in the “Best Six Months (BSM)” from November to April and that the market went sideways in the “Worst Six Months (WSM)” from May to October and is most susceptible to major declines during the Worst Six Months. From April 1950 to October, 21 2022 the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2721.33 points versus 1013.35 points in the WSM. These six months combined have produced an average DJIA gain of 7.3% since 1950 compared to an average gain of just 0.8% during the months May to October.

&gt; We have improved the results of the strategy using the MACD technical indicator. Back in 1999 the late Sy Harding enhanced the BSM strategy by employing the late Gerry Appel’s MACD to improve entries and exits and dubbed it, “the best mechanical system ever.” Over the years we have refined the strategy further by corroborating more than one MACD, looking for confirmation across major market indices and taking MACD triggers earlier in the month.

personalfinance,Employer not withholding federal taxes... why?,"Some background.... I had twins in October 2021. I had stopped working at my previous job September 2021. Full-time stay at home mom until I found a new, remote job in July 2022. Started August 1st, 2022 and have been working there, full time, ever since. So technically, I had no income earned from an employer from September 2021-July 2022.

I filled out my W4 when I started. I normally file head of household, I claim my kids as dependents. (My oldest child, his dad and I alternate years for claiming him, per our court ordered support agreement- but I do claim my twins.) I'm looking at my electronic paystubs. They have been taking out state taxes, Medicare, and Social Security. But I see no federal taxes withheld. I don't make much. $14 an hour, paid biweekly. So my gross YTD earnings right now are somewhere around $6,300 considering I just started in August. My gross annual YTD if I worked a 
full year would be somewhere around $29,120.

I don't understand why federal taxes are not being withheld. I know I can ask HR. But I'm thinking it has to do with the fact that I've only technically made $6,300 so far this year- then factoring in my dependents.. is it because I just haven't made enough this year for them to start withholding? Does that make sense at all? Just wondering if that could be the reason, before I go to HR. Thanks in advance.",finance,1667050456
personalfinance,Upgrade house or upgrade car first?,"My husband and I are looking to move into a bigger house within the next year or two.

I am looking for advice on buying both in the current expensive market and possible economic downturn. 

We both have stable jobs with a combined income of 140k. We currently own our house (owe 125k on it) and have a 17k home equity loan. Both our cars are paid off right now and we have no other debt. We were planning on waiting to get a new truck until we were in a new house, but it's looking like the old truck may force our hand. Anyone have any advice?

I was looking at the above sheet . It says that the 10 year bond interest rate is 4.02%. Does this mean that if I invest 1000$ today then I will have $1483(compounding interest) at the end of 10 years. I have read some websites where it is mentioned that annually the interest payments will be made so $40 will be given to me annually and hence the interest doesn't compound and I get $400 total income after 10 years?",finance,1667055305

Is there something else we should be seeking to get this accomplished? It's a pretty fair assumption that this already successful business will grow drastically under our ownership, but obviously can't be guaranteed. Is this overly risky?

I would really like to cover closer to 100% of my consumption, but cost is a factor. Some quotes I received in the past quoted around 12 kW systems that were covering 100%, but the cost was much higher too.

personalfinance,High-Yield Savings Account Rate Comparison Historical Chart?,"Is there a place where the various high-yield savings account bank rates are tracked over time to see which bank consistently maintains the highest average rate and is most responsive to rate changes? It would seem that someone out there tracks it and charts it to show which would generate the best return based on the rate that has been offered for the past year, two, etc.

This seems to be the most important factor to compare banks, but places like NerdWallet, Bankrate, etc only show whatever the current rates are for the limited number of banks that pay to play on their site. 

What I have found in paying attention to the various rates offered over the past few months is that they change positions on whose rate is highest, especially how they respond when the Fed fund rate increases. Selecting a bank to park money for a long term based on whichever bank is currently offering the highest rate on a particular day is deciding based on insufficient information.",finance,1667064178
personalfinance,"Asked Edward Jones to rollover my IRA to Charles Schwab, and they took out federal income tax, even though I made it perfectly clear it's a rollover, not a disbursal.","I wanted to move all my money out of Edward Jones into my personal Charles Schwab IRA because EJ sucks. I asked CS the best way to do it, and they said to liquidate all the assets (mostly shitty mutual funds I didn't want in anyway), and have EJ send me the check for my IRA which I then deposit into my Charles Schwab account. CS even said there is no way to do it all over the phone because they need paperwork, and I asked two different people to do it over the phone, so I had no choice but to do it this way.

I have done it this way prior with 401k rollovers, so I know it's not uncommon or difficult, but Edward Jones took out Federal Income tax on the check. It was supposed to be 44,000, and they took out 4,400 in tax. I made it very clear to EJ that it's a rollover. The guy even mistakenly told me taxes would be taken out, and I said, no, it's a rollover. But now the taxes were taken out anyway.

Is there an easy way to fix this? I'm not even sure if the tax penalty for early disbursal was included, because I think this will fuck me in tax season too.

What should I do to begin clearly up? I didn't want it taxed, as it's a rollover, not a disbursal.",finance,1667064412

He has a decent income, a paid off car worth 10k or so, and can put aside about 1k per month after required expenses with a 4k monthly take home, although that can fluctuate based on commisions. He has a decent income but its inconsistant which I think was part of the problem. His job is commision based and he budgeted assuming a certain amount of commission per month, but that was assuming he hit certain sales targets, which he didnt always hit. 

The bigger problem is that he somehow got himself into an eye watering $50k of unsecured credit card debt at a whopping 25% interest rate and he is drowning in the interest payments. He can only afford each month to pay the minimum with next to nothing going to principle. I was so upset with him when I found out because to accumulate this much debt, he was completly hiding his head in the sand until the problem became completly unmanagable. But what is done is done and it wont help him to berate him now. 

Besides his car, his only other assets are an undisclosed amount in 401k and ira, but he doesnt know how much. But Im assuming not much as he only started contributing last year. Even if he sold everything he owns, I think he can only come up with $13k or so. 

Im trying to work with him to get himself out of this situation, but I dont see many options. He has not missed payments yet, but at the end of the month he may miss rent and bills because he has no limit left on his cards to pay anything, and he put his paycheck into the interest before paying anything else. If he misses rent he will eventually get evicted. 

His credit is only 570 with 100% credit utilization so there are limited options for refinancing the debt with a personal loan with lower interest or getting on a payment plan. 

I suggested bankruptcy may be the only way forward. But he doesnt want to consider it, because he says if they take his car he cant get to work and doesnt want to lose his personal items. Im so frustrated with him because he doesnt seem to want to take any option that involves reducing expenses or any amount of self sacrifice. But pretty soon I dont think he will have a choice. 

Even worse he is having serious health concerns that require treatment. But he doesnt want to get it looked at because he cant afford the co pays and co insurance even though he has insurance through his employer. Ive told him to get these sorted first, because if he loses his health he cant solve any of his other problems. On top of that, he is suffering suicidal depression from these issues. 

He thinks the solution is just to hustle and make more money, and is looking for a second job. But thats unsustainable imo as he already works 6 days a week and he will take years to dig his way out. Any suggestions?",finance,1667071170

I’m putting $2,000 cash down and I got approved for a loan amount that’s the same as the out the door price with all the warranties. But where my parents are concerned (and I understand why) my Apr is 12.58%. I know this is a high rate, but I haven’t even had my credit card for a year and there’s nothing of substance on there really. I only use it for gas and groceries and pay it off in full every month. I know this doesn’t impress banks like having car payments on it and stuff does. I know this is what’s causing my apr to be high. I’m trying to explain this to my parents but they keep saying it should be lower but not giving me any really plausible options. My dad is saying to lease. But the down payment on a lease is more than I’m wanting to spend at the moment and my mom is saying I should get a brand new car because the apr is lower. I looked into that but no dealerships are offering that much lower and my monthly payment would be higher than I would like. They also all pushed me to have a co-signer (my parents are weird when it comes to their money so I’m not even asking them). My plan was to just deal with high apr and then refinance after 6months-1year and see if it would lower. I would wait to build my credit even more or see if interest rates are going to go down but I really need a car as soon as I can.

Dear Diary

So the 15th of December I started my journey into crypto.

Because I did not have the funds to go in lump sum, I will follow the strategy which I described in my original post.

So to sum it up:

\- Monthly deposit to exchanges;

\- DCA 80% of deposit weekly over top 5 Mcap;

\- Allocate 20% to Buy the Dip;

\- Stake holdings on exchange;

\- Investment horizon 5 years;

\- Dip defined as minimal 8% drop on 24H time frame.

\- For DCA I will also look into the Fear and Greed index. DCA more when the market is in fear, DCA less when in greed.

\- For the meme I also DCA a bit into DOGE... :)

\- ADJUSTMENT-

I have started to buy the dip a bit more aggressively. As we come deeper in the Bear market I decided it was time to push my average cost down a bit more. Also once I have started to buy a coin in the top five I keep DCA into it. I stop when they exit the top 10 excluding stable coins.

Now to update where do I stand and what are the results up till now

So to measure performance, I will look at what this strategy has done compared to a lump sum investment at my starting point on the 15th of December.

UPDATE

Must admit I had FOMO...made a gamble on Luna....probably a stupid one.....I'll keep it and take it as a lesson learned.....Stick to the F$#@%$\* plan!!!

I have adjusted my strategy a bit. I am upping my investment in BTC and ETH compared to alts.

UPDATE 19-9-2022

Heavy on BTC and ETH.

UPDATE 28-9-2022

Implement flexible DCA day and time. When pump postpone DCA in bear market.

UPDATE 7-10-2022

Starting to look like a very good time to accumulate. Still wondering if there is going to be another drop. Hold off on DCA this week, due to unemployment rates release in the US today and FOMC minutes next week.

UPDATE 29-10-2022

As Elon bought Twitter I acquired some additional DOGE....Small bet hoping to pay off.

So as you all can see some have worked out better then the others.

But IMO it is very interesting that we are in a downtrend combined with this strategy.

Will try to keep you all updated once in a while on how it is performing.",cryptocurrency,1667078400
investing,How money are (actually) created?,"First of all, I m not talking about bank multiplication, because i don’t consider it “actual” money creation - but rather balance creation. In no way people could ever withdraw more money than they put in banks, so banks can’t multiply “real” money (currency or such money that can be used to buy treasuries - details below). 

There used to be gold standard that, that would suggest amount of money in circulation should match us gold reserves, which at 1971 were around $100 bil (7.5 kton gold *$35/oz). 

Nowadays, only in currency, there is about 2.3T usd. As mentioned above, bank multiplication can’t have anything to do with it because 2.3T can simultaneously be withdrawn and at hands of population. 

One thing comes to mind is US treasury and treasury bonds. 

Correct me if i m wrong, but i believe treasury accounts exist outside banking system, in a way that money in a possession of us treasury can not be counted as bank “assets” and therefore can not be multiplied. Money in a possession of treasury effectively dont exist from perspective of the rest of economy or banking system, until reintroduced when government pays to public sector in one way or another. 

When treasury needs money, they issue bonds that can be purchased with money but since that money effectively disappearing from banking system, all previously multiplied money are disappearing too and treasury is purchased with “real” money. 

Thus, we can draw parallel between treasuries and real money (money actually created by government, not balances multiplied by banks). 

This appears to be the reason why fed is very quick to temporary exchange treasuries to money, or money for treasuries - because in doing do fed neither create nor destroys real money. 

Fair enough, but there is still no answer how such money are being created. 

One way is perhaps through treasury bonds as described above: 

Population had $100bil, us treasury issues $100bil worth of bonds that population buys. Next, government transacts with population and buys $100bil worth of services, so population now has $100bil again and $100bil worth of treasuries. After that us treasury can issue another $100bil worth of bonds, and repeat the cycle, so in the end population will hold 30T worth of bonds (current us debt) and $100bil of original money. 

Some of those treasuries were purchased by fed, and as we know their balance sheet is now almost $9T, which means population holds 21T worth of treasuries and 9.1T worth of real-ish money (that fed can pull back by selling assets) 

Btw, i think when fed buys non-treasury assets is a only time fed actually creates “real” money (and not money mirrored by treasuries). 

Then there is interest that government has to pay, and taxes government collects. 

Is it really something like 

Money supply = $100bil of “original gold-backed money” + treasuries issued + interest paid on treasuries + government spendings (inc interest) - taxes collected + whatever fed is doing with non-treasury assets

? 

Or am i way far off? Anyone knows exactly how it works? 

And how was it working before abandoning gold standard? Since technically nobody stops treasury to do all of it while gold standard exists (as long as money is us debt, obligations + gold = money supply formula would hold)",finance,1667078794

Same goes for Twitter ""crypto experts"" and Telegram groups. A year ago everyone was a Wyckoff expert, and now it seems they have switched their expertise to macroeconomy. So, do all of them know what they're talking about? No, the big majority don't, they just like how smart they feel when they say or write the word ""macroeconomy"". In November, at the top, everyone was screaming about $100k. Now, everyone is screaming about the bottom not being in until the FED actually pivots. Can you see the pattern here?

As I said, there is a general opinion among these ""macro experts"" that the markets won't bottom before the FED actually pivots. If you think the markets will behave as straight forward as this, you'll most likely be in for a bad ride. Let me explain why.

There's a fundamental difference in how the FED approaches the macro and how the markets do. **FED is backwards looking**. This means that they look at the past data and then they adjust the measures they are taking to control inflation accordingly. **Markets are forward looking**. This means they are going to anticipate the pivot and position themselves before the FED actually pivots. As soon as the markets see the light at the end of the tunnel, they will react. When this happens the majority will remain sidelined, confused and still talking about macro.

Why am I saying this? Well, I'm seeing a lot of people spreading really bad TA and saying: ""Bottom will at $14k, $10k, $8k, historical moves, muh macro, blah blah"". As someone who's been trading crypto a long time I can guarantee you that even the best traders have a really hard time recognizing where the bottom is. 

Am I saying this is the bottom? No, I don't know that. But do I want crypto exposure at these prices? Absolutely. I know we are likely to have bounces which will be good opportunities to take some profits and de-risk positions. If the range resolves to the downside, I'm happy with continuing to build my positions at lower prices, if it breaks upwards, well, good thing I have exposure.",cryptocurrency,1667135177

stocks,Does raising interest rates contribute to inflation?,"The guy on the podcast said something about this for about 2 seconds and didn't explain anything. I thought it was an interesting idea. But i'm not sure about it.

The general thinking is higher interest rates help reduce inflation. But this may be wrong in the short term.

What happens when interest rates on T-bills go from 0 to 5%? At 0% the government doesn't have any interest payments going out into the money system. At 5% they are pouring a huge amount of interest payments into the system. The more money in the system the more upward pressure there is on inflation.

Eventually businesses and individuals are hurt with higher borrowing costs. Which would slow the economy and demand reducing inflation pressure.

There would be a time lag here, for the first months or year (some unknown length of time) higher interest rates would contribute to inflation.

I have never heard any of the experts discuss this. Obviously there are many factors but government interest payments are a very large amount of money.

After a few green days many investors are wondering if we could be seeing the bottom of the market right now. I would argue that we are just getting started.

Currently the federal reserve continues to hike interest rates and offload their balance sheet aggressively. I think many people believe inflation is peaking but I’m not completely sold on that idea. Oil reserves are being depleted to keep diesel prices low leading into mid term elections and this will eventually lead to higher prices in coming months if we don’t increase production (which will negatively impact CPI down the line). 

The housing market is softening all over the country and the majority of most people’s net worth is on their home equity.

We are starting to see lay offs which I think will likely get worse before it gets better.

And the most important point which I believe is not priced in? Student loans coming due for Americans in January. Everyone talks about how “this time is different” and how the American consumer is so strong. Set loan forgiveness aside, as soon Americans start paying student loans again in January we will immediately see household savings dry up. Consumer credit will sky rocket higher than it already has, and I believe crypto and equites will then hit all time lows. Add in the uncertainty of the geopolitical climate and possible food and/or gas shortages around this time in January.

1) Take out a car loan, stop investing, that $400 is now a car payment

2) Pay off the car, stop investing, that $400 needs to build up my emergency savings back to 6 months

3) Pay off the car, KEEP investing or split it between investing and cash savings?

I'm not totally sure what impact this car will have on our monthly expenses, how much taxes and insurance will go up. I know maintenance costs will go down, that's why we bought it! We traded in a clunker that was cost us $6000K last year in repairs and just kept breaking in various places, I'm happy to be out of that for sure!",finance,1667143035
personalfinance,Would I be stupid to turn down this home offer?,"My uncle is trying to retire and wants to sell one of his houses. It's a 4 bedroom, 2 bath 1978 brick home with 2300 sqft. I would be closer to work and it would give me room to grow. It also has a small shop on it that I could use for hobbies or to run a business. He said because he is retiring and that since I'm his nephew he would sell it to me for 100k.

It needs some work, nothing major but is very livable, basically minor maintenance has been neglected for the past 10 years. It's dated inside so I would probably do some updating. Most homes in this area, around this size, in worse shape start at 250k.

So here's the kicker, I just refinanced my house last year. I got a really good rate. (3.25%) My current home is a measly 850 sqft, 2br 1 bath. (starter home), bought before Covid home prices. It was renovated before I bought it so the only major thing I replaced was the central A/C. It is very comfortable and affordable. I live in the city, close to everything. I really like my home. Since it's small, it is very easy to maintain and utilities are very low. My mortgage is so low that if I somehow lost my job I could still afford it working minimum wage. (\~$500 with mortgage and escrow) So a very safe place.

In a nutshell, I am almost positive I could sell my current house and make more than enough to afford my uncle's house. (possibly with some left over to start renovations). The issue is the work that needs to be done, and current interest rates, and I would lose the very comfortable mortgage payment. If I sold my old house, used the excess as a downpayment and took out a 90k mortgage I would theoretically have roughly 10k left. My mortgage and escrow would go to around $800 being less comfortable.

I make 38k a year and live in GA. The car is paid off, and only have one personal loan that I have 4k on. (could go ahead and pay that off if I bought this house). No major debts other than that.

So is it crazy for me to turn this down?

EDIT:So I'm going to see about renting out my current house and getting a mortgage on the uncle's house. I did not know I could use the income from the rental for the debt to income calculation. With that in mind I can probably afford both if I get a good renter. I will probably finance an extra 20k to kickstart the repairs.",finance,1667145489
personalfinance,Immediate annuity with rising payments,"There exist immediate annuities where you give the insurance company $X and they pay you $Y annually as long as you live. Inflation gradually but steadily reduces the value of the annual payment. Which insurance companies sell graduated immediate annuities with payments that rise at say 2% annually?

personalfinance,Extra Monthly Mortgage Payment with Refinance in 1-2 years?,"Hi there,

I've scoured Google, and haven't found an answer to my exact question yet. I just bought a house in August with a 5.5% fixed interest rate. If the rates go down in 2023 or 2024 as forecasters are expecting, then I plan to refinance at that time. I'm currently paying $48.42/month over my mortgage payment to make this an even number for ease of accounting and I've read that making extra payments when possible can help with paying the mortgage off sooner. Now to my question... is it silly of me to be making extra monthly payments when I know that I will be refinancing or is it always a good idea to pay extra on a loan when you can regardless of future refinance possibilities?",finance,1667149321
personalfinance,Advice on 0% int. balance tranfers,"Okay, bear with me. I'm gonna lay out a few things:

My wife and I have about 55k on an equity line of credit with an interest rate of around 6%. We pay far too much per year in interest. Last year I think we paid 4k. The total balance fluctuates because Life, so we pay a different amount of interest each year. 

We also have a credit card that had 26k but recently did a 12k balance transfer to an existing card that was paid off for 0% for 14months, leaving about 14k on the first card. The interest rate on the first card is about 10%. 

In addition to those, we have a few other open accounts totaling around 14k with interest rates between 5-9%. 

I was recently looking more into 0% balance transfers and found some seemingly outstanding deals. Some are as long 21 months. 

Is it worth it/advisable to open a few other cards and transfer a bunch of debt over for the 0%? In my mind, I feel if we move stuff around enough we could potentially save a lot of money, but then again, I don't wanna do anything that'll negatively impact our credit too much.

CryptoCurrency,"The instant you see that the Market sentiment is approaching peak greed or peak fear in a given cycle, watch out.","This post is not just about stating facts regarding the constant reminders of today's bad news -- albeit in any case where either euphoria or depression took place. It's also about having an open mind, in that knowing that the currents in the markets could suddenly change on a dime with the investors getting caught off-guard. And it seems like so far, it is showing an indication that the bears are enjoying this downturn too much that as long as there are constant reports on the global economy shitting the bed, it is without any doubt that all risk assets are going lower.

Now why do I feel this way? Take a moment to reflect back last November, especially at a time where everyone was expecting a blow-off top after a Spot Bitcoin ETF was going to be approved in the U.S. Guess what happened then? It failed after the SEC axed all possible applications for a single one. The bull cycle ended soon after when more long positions liquidated, several firms sunk after many major bank runs (Celsius, anyone?) and a notable stablecoin became insolvent. All of this couldn't be any worse without Fed's Powell spoiling the party.

Understandably, it is not to suggest that this bear cycle is almost over. In fact, no one has a clue.

Forex,Prop funding insanity,"Hey, I observe this industry from the sidelines and even tried to pass prop firm challenges a couple of times. Did it twice - passed the first stage, and blew the accounts during the second.

What's different in my situation is that I earn money writing about trading, as a financial journalist, so for the last two years, I've had plenty of time to do research and learn. I did the work people with normal 9-5 jobs do in decades (that's no joke, I've seen plenty examples like this), because I was, more or less, forced to. And here is the thing: the more I know, the less realistic gaining an edge in the markets is. I don't take seriously people that say that ""they are profitable"", because the company I work for tries to find scams on the daily basis. We hear that someone made money, yet there is no never any reliable proof. If there is a proof, it is fabricated (there is a simple way to produce fake results on one of the popular platforms - if someone is not knowledgeable, that's the way to go, he will fall for it and buy your course).

You may ask - why won't you become Forex guru then? Well, that is obvious - I am not a thief.

But the funny thing is, most of the people seem to believe it. Everyday I see someone claiming that making 10% in 30 days during the prop challenge, is ""really easy"" or ""not easy, yet achievable"", while in reality, that's pure insanity. Majority of pro fund managers don't beat the market, and we are talking about Ivy League guys. If it comes to actively managed funds, they lose most of the times. If you do make 10% per months and can sustain it, you would trade for Goldman in no time.

But if it comes to prop challenges, you have to make 100%. Yes - 100% of your drawdown, then, if you risk ""only 1% per trade"", in reality, you are risking 10% of your account per single trade and 10 losses in a row is not something that happens rarely. Actually, you need to lose only 5% of your ""account"" and 50% (!) of your drawdown, to find yourself in a terrible situation. Now, you have to make 100% to go back to square one and then - make another 100% of that to pass the challenge. It has nothing to do with real prop trading. It is gambling and people, who pass, do it by sheer luck. I know it, because I've passed phase I two times.

Therefore, I am starting to lose hope that it is really possible at all.

Some claim that they've passed and sustained the accounts with ""Smart Money Concepts"", yet I am not stupid enough to believe in what ICT is saying. His setups are re-named, retail technical analysis and IPDA is one, big conspiracy theory. There is no proof that the decentralized Forex works like this. Financial illiteracy and not giving a shit about market structure (I'm not talking price structure here) makes people think, that they ""trade with the banks"". They don't know what real Market Marking is. They don't know how HFTs work and that majority of institution's trades are not directional and have so called ""delta neutral"".

I would just like to know if there are people who think like me, yet they are actually trading with these props. Gained an edge and somehow, they make a living out of it for some time. I'm writing this because markets always fascinated me and I love doing research, trying to understand them. Yet knowing how they work and having an edge are two, separate things and sometimes I think, that it is just not possible at all, and we are all nothing but fools.

PART II

I've decided to write a quick part II of the original post, because I think that it might be complementary.

As you may know or not, financial journaling is full of failed/developing traders or investors (from what I remember, Tom Dante was a journalist back in the days and he might be some kind of exception here). It's not about me, I am fresh there and achieved nothing special so far. It's about the other people. Almost all of them have really big experience with trading/investing. While I was entering this space, I was almost sure, that I will find many profitable traders here. Yet I've found no one trading for a living or no one that could provide any reliable proof.

And here is my point - if these are the people that live and breathe the markets - writing news articles, doing macro researches and constantly learning and so on, yet they could not make it as traders, what are the chances, that a normal guy will achieve this? Living a normal life and treating trading as a hobby?

Do you think that these guys don't know SM Concepts? That they never used Fibonacci? That you have some secret that they don't know? They educate traders, teaching them about the interest rates and central bank policies. Some of them take these ICT teachings, repack it and write about it, and they learn it during the process. Do you think they are mentally retarded and can't use it themselves? Can't backtest? Can't draw order block or apply simple logic to the chart? Most of you will dislike it, because it is challenging your dream, but I don't mean to be negative. If all of this is negative, it's negative for me first and foremost, because after all this work, I am exhausted and I've learned many useless things, just to end up nowhere so far.

At first, I thought that I am better than anyone else. As I said, I've made my first money on the betting exchange and I was pretty good at it. Mechanics was basically similar to the Futures market. 90% of the people there were losing traders as well, and I was one of the few, so I thought that it will be the same on the financial market. Yet it was not. It is different kind of market. As close to efficiency, as it is possible, and I am simply not sure, if there is any inefficiency that can be exploited by humans in the short term. And that is really sad, because I wasn't there for money, but for the game. I've seen charts as some kind of complicated puzzles and still try to see them that way, but there is the risk I can't ignore anymore - that there is no mystery in this. Just chaos, that to the imperfect, human eye, seems orderly. ""Fugazi!"", as Mark Hanna said. Fairy dust.

**THE TOP 3 HACKS/SCAMS/EXPLOITS**

[**The Bitcoin Sheik Scam**](https://forkast.news/brazil-police-bust-crypto-group-led-by-bitcoin-sheikh/) **– 766M$ Lost**

In this case, an individual (now doxed) organized a Ponzi scheme, targeting people in Brazil and 10 other countries.

He promised monthly 20% returns to his victims and claimed to have a large team of crypto experts that would work tirelessly to bring returns to investors.

Even [some Brazil celebrities fell for this scam](https://g1.globo.com/pr/parana/noticia/2022/10/06/pf-apreende-ouro-carros-e-relogios-de-luxo-em-casas-do-sheik-dos-bitcoins-e-de-outros-investigados-por-fraudes-de-ate-r-4-bilhoes-com-criptomoedas.ghtml).

After an International investigation, Federal brazilian police in cooperation with Interpol raided his house on the 6th of October, where they found multiple luxury goods.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Mango Markets**](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/12/how-market-manipulation-led-to-a-100m-exploit-on-solana-defi-exchange-mango/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_campaign=headlines) **– 116M$ Lost**

In this case, one individual pumped the Mango, a token on the Solana blockchain used as a governance token on the Mango trading platform. His pump was very successful (token from 0.02$ to 0.90$ since the token was very illiquid).

If he sold, probably he would have ended with the same amount he invested (as the pairing on the liquidity pool adapts as tokens are boing sold), but he decided to do something different.

He used the tokens he bough to collateralize a loan of 116M of USDC, a loan that he never intended to repay, of course. After the pump, the price of Mango went back to 0.02$, but the exploiter got to keep all the borrowed USDC.

&amp;#x200B;

[**BSC Token Hub**](https://blog.quillhash.com/2022/10/11/the-million-dollars-bsc-token-hub-bridge-hack-analysis/) **– 89.5M – 100M$ lost**

BSC token Hub is the native bridge between the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and the BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2).

The hacker exploited a bug in the code that allowed him to withdraw 2 million BNB from the bridge’s pool of funds.

Thanks to the expertise of Binance blockchain experts and chain validators, most of the funds remain under control of Binance and a governance vote will be held to determine the following actions.

**OTHER INTERESTING HACKS/SCAMS/EXPLOITS HIS MONTH**

**Freeway – 20M$ Lost**

Freeway is a platform that advertises itself as combining the best of traditional finance with the best of DEFI (smh).

https://preview.redd.it/fiixdqdxpzw91.png?width=567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbe09cd8f97dc9e3f4c426959f78f28f09e78d7f

Users can stake their crypto to obtain up to a claimed 43% APY. The truth is that Freeway utilizes user’s funds to trade using overleveraged accounts, which this time led to 20M$ in losses.

personalfinance,Excel Sheet to track Income tied to tax bracket. (US),"As the title states, i am looking for a spread sheet or google document to be preferred so i can track remotely. Its easiest to explain my specific situation and maybe someone out there knows what I'm looking for or can help.

I will be receiving many, possibly hundreds of ""gifts"". These gifts count as ""income"" and i am going to get a 1099 on them at the end of the year. I have been lead to believe that i am ultimately just taxed federally on the total sum at the end of the year. These items can range wildly, few dollars to a few hundred.

I am looking for a spread sheet or preferably a good document that i can add dollar amounts and it tracks. Adding to my already expected tax bracket. (So ill take my already known salary and bonus from job 1, and then add all these items up for a final total, but also a total on just the gifts, with what taxes i would owe on just the gift section)

Is there anything out there like this, or can anyone shed some sudologic behind what i should do to get it started. I am not the greatest at excel beyond basic addition and subtraction within a single page in a single document. Im not versed beyond that.

If you made it this far into my post, i genuinely appreciate it. I want to do right by the taxes, and don't want to be surprised by the bill at the end of the year.  


EDIT:

To save time, i am a reviewer. I receive items that are ""gifted"" To me that i review. I keep these Items and do not return them. Its my understanding that, it is counted as ""income"" and i am taxed my federal tax rate on these items. Since they can range between a few dollars for socks, or a few hundred for electronics or what ever... i can see going over the (what i believe) $600 limit and ill have to report them, thus being taxed.

personalfinance,[UPDATE] Am I screwing myself by taking a job in a high cost of living (HCOL) area? I’ll be closer to family but the current housing market will consume most of the pay difference,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/yh4wdp/am_i_screwing_myself_by_taking_a_job_in_a_high/)

TL;DR: Great job in HCOL area close to family. Current housing market and interest rates will double our monthly payments for a similar house in  this HCOL area. Need help.

Updates on numbers:

1. Looked thoroughly at the houses in the area. Seems like we will be OK with a $650k house instead of a $800k house.
2. HCOL house at $650k will cost us a total of $855k with interest (15 year mortgage, APR 5.8%, monthly $3835)
3. The remaining payments on our current LCOL house is $160k with interest (15 year mortgage, APR 3.45%, 6 years left, monthly $2200 \[we've been paying extra\])
4. The cost of private school in my current area should be $415k for our children through 12th grade. This is roughly $2166 per month.

Breakdown:

1. $160k (remaining house balance) + $415k (private school) = $575k (cost over next 15 years for not moving)
2. $855k (HCOL house) - $575k (cost for not moving) = $280k (extra money we'll spend over 15 years with the move)

Considerations:

* We could send our kids to public schools in our current LCOL area if they got into a magnet program but these are tricky and not guaranteed. And may not be feasible with transportation with our current work schedule.
* The $415k we would save in private school would essentially go into equity in the HCOL house. Which is monetary whereas their education is not immediately monetary.
* I'm seeing this as $280k over 15 years would be the cost of living close to family. Which seems worth it in our situation.
* I've been avoiding factoring the difference in salary because our job field sucks right now. But if I did, it would be roughly $201k difference over 15 years without on call/extras. Which would make the difference to move $80k over 15 years.

Say there is a Fed Pivot (or a perceived one) this week, what stocks/sectors/assets will do the best?

Will it likely be tech (even the unprofitable Arkk type stocks and crypto) or will it also be things like precious metals (gold and silver) due to a distrust of the Fed and inflation potentially staying for longer like the 70s-80s?

Small caps as well can likely do well here if we were to come out of this bear market. 

Let me be clear, I don't believe we get a Fed Pivot this week and I think Nick Timiraos (the Fed mouthpiece) gave us more clues about the Fed likely continuing to stay Hawkish and not winding to undo their work by letting conditions ease. 

Still in a downtrend and now the earnings and economic conditions are starting to fall, so I don't see a reason to change being bearish and defensive until things change or get much worse in the market

personalfinance,I feel like I am trapped in debt at 24 years old,"Hi everyone, this is going to be a very difficult post for me to write as it is an extremely shameful side to me that I never want to talk about that has had horrible financial consequences. It is going to be very long so I do apologize and appreciate for anyone who reads. Posting this on an anon account as well bc this is just so humiliating. 

Despite my best efforts to not take after my mother who suffers from a lot of mental health issues, I have problems with compulsive behavior regulation such as spending insane amount of money on food delivery and clothes. In the past 6 months I have taken drastic measures to get my life back on track such as attending cognitive behavioral therapy, using budgeting apps, completely stopped using delivery apps and credit cards but it is only helping so much as you can’t reverse the debt unfortunately . I have three credit cards open with my total debt adding to $14,253, a personal loan for $15,168.54 from previous credit card debt I will pay off for the next 4 years, and the icing on the cake is my ungodly amount of student loan debt. 

  My student loan situation was particularly tricky since I actually went to community college for two years for a transfer degree to save money. My father paid for the two years there, and then after obtaining my associates I transferred to a local state university for computer science. At that point I was completely estranged from my mom so I could not include her in my FASFA, so I had to include my dad. My dad makes a lot of money but he did not want to pay any tuition for my university. Because of this I received no financial aid and got only $7,500 worth of federal loans. I also was working a horrible part time retail job 30 hours a week making only $10 an hour, while attending school full time. Therefore, I couldn’t solely rely on that job as a source of income. To afford the remainder of tuition and other school expenses, rent (and yes I roomed with roommates) and other stuff I had to take out private loans. I didn’t think it would be an issue at first since you can get a well paying job right out of college with a comp sci degree for the most part. Unfortunately though I started having even worse mental health issues and ending up getting an academic warning, which resulted in my only option being to take out private loans. I stuck around in computer science for two years before I realized I didn’t want to do it and switched to psychology (this was during 2020 Zoom university era) just to get my bachelors the fastest so I could stop accumulating debt. 

   Fast forward to December 2021 and I finally graduate with a whopping $95k+ worth of student loan debt. I ended up getting my private loans refinanced to one monthly payment of $585 that my dad contributes $200 to. I had finally quit my shitty part time job and found my very first decently paying full time job two months before I graduated starting at $17 an hour and fully remote as a Customer Service Representative. I end up excelling there an insane amount and immediately get another position for the same pay (back end customer service) 2 months after. I do so well in that position I score an internal internship as a business analyst in addition to doing my current job. I was making an average annual pay of $36k and as of today I have been promoted to an analyst position and now make $60k. Since this just started today, I will not receive the pay for this until 4 weeks from now. This all happened within being only one year with the company and I have been told the pay will continue to increase as my skills increase. 

  The last thing I will mention are my expenses aren’t actually too bad. I am very fortunate that my boyfriend has offered to pay the rent as I get my debt down, I have no car loan just my car insurance I pay. I also pay my phone bill, the internet, dog food and vet expenses for our dog, the personal loan which is $396 a month a few streaming subscriptions and my credit card payments of course. I have only $1,000 in savings but also have a 401k and $500 in investments. I plan to increase the amount I put into savings since I am only doing $50 of my paycheck currently. Regarding my credit score, at one point my credit score was at 760, but given that my credit card utilization rate is so high at the moment it is now at 632. I have never had a late payment as well. 

 So sorry for how long this is I didn’t know how much context I should provide. Any kind advice would be much appreciated. For people shaming me on what I’ve done to myself, trust me I’ve heard it all before and hate myself for it. Anyways, my main question here would be is it better to just wait it out given my salary increase (I guess I should also note I am only 1/2 of a Business Analyst since the other half of my day will still be spent on my previous job.

solarenergy,Why make money for the power companies?,"I have been interested in solar for a while and have some questions.  I’ve been getting quotes and it is not cheap.  The way it was explained to me I couldn’t produce and store enough in batteries to be “off the grid” so I need to be connected to the grid, is this correct?  If I am connected to the grid, anything I produce the electric company buys from me at $.07 per Kwh I then have to buy back the power I just produced at $.12-$.14 per Kwh?  So, I have to make a huge investment taking on debt and a monthly payment building a solar array for KU (Kentucky Utilities) to profit from?  My break even gets pushed out so far even with the Federal Tax break it’s not worth it.  Can KU later say they will only give $.03 or $.04 to expand their profits?!

personalfinance,"Need to withdraw contributions from IRA, Roth IRA, and more.","I know this is a bad thing to do, but I need to produce some money in 2023 and my only option is to withdraw from my Roth IRA, liquidate my brokerage account, and touch money in my IRA.  There is no other path.  I am trying to avoid or minimize, if possible, the tax/penalty hit.  Here is where I stand. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* It is possible I can make my AGI income fall  below 44,625, so my federal tax rate for capital gains can be 0%.

\* I have  a Roth IRA at 20,000.  My contributions are 10,000.  The Roth will be 5 years old next march.

\* I have an IRA with 8,000.  My contributions in this account are at 4,000.

\* I have 30,000 in my brokerage.  All of this will be taxed as long term capital gains.  

I am wondering if I can:

1) Liquidate the brokerage in Jan 2023.  As long as my AGI is below 44,625 for 2023 my federal tax on this would be 0%, right?  

2) Rollover my IRA into my Roth IRA.  Here is where my knowledge gets fuzzy.  If I keep my AGI below 44,625, does this mean the taxes I will pay on this will be 0%?  Are there any other penalty taxes I am not aware of?  Outside of state taxes?

3) Once the IRA is rolled into the Roth IRA, are the IRA's contributions added to the Roth IRA's contributions?  Would the contributions for My Roth IRA now be at $14,000?

4) **I'd like to withdraw the $14,000 in contributions once my Roth IRA hits 5 years old in march of 2023.  As everything is now Roth and contributions, this won't incur a tax or penalty hit, right? There is no problem withdrawing this combined - into - roth contribution, right?**

5) How do I report this on my taxes?  My IRA broker says Im responsible for letting the government know I withdrew contributions and not gains. 

6) Does  the withdraws from brokerage, Roth IRA (and rolled over IRA) increase my AGI in any way?  I need to make sure I stay below that 44,625.  I know paycheck counts to the AGI, what about interest from Cds, savings, sales of the brokerage account, etc.... 

7) Is there anything you can think of I may need to know I'm overlooking?

Everything crashed, bitcoin was doomed, and i left the crypto-world sad and betrayed.
Bitcoin was never going to succeed, what even is this tech? Who is actually gonna use it?

This was 5 years ago (Bull run of 2017/18).

It wasn't until I had lost everything, that I thought clearly and started to actually take a look in the mirror and take accountability for my misstakes.

Don't be blinded by all the profits, because if you do - you will never have it. You will still be the same emmotionally fragile paper handed bitch that you've always been. Stop reacting to the slightest change, and take a second to think.

Do your own research, read the whitepapers, look up the devs, make your own decisions and stop trying to take the easy road by being spoonfed (most likely false) information by someone else.

When you make a misstake and get burned, learn from it. Don't push it under the rug and hope it doesnt happen again, because it will. Over and over, until you learn your lesson.

It's hard, it really is.
Most people don't want to take the hard road, but if you do, you will get your reward eventually.

CryptoCurrency,What might the “carrot” of crypto regulation look like?,"tl;dr: if you can’t read a thousand words then you’re ngmi

When looking at the regulation of crypto, saying that the SEC has favoured the “stick” over the “carrot” approach is almost an understatement.  It would probably be more accurate to say that the SEC has taken the “piñata” approach. Taking ostensibly completely random enforcement actions against randomly selected market participants, with no prior warning, no guidance, no collaboration with the industry, and no attempt to justify either their choice of targets or their actions against them.

This has fed into existing anti-regulatory sentiment within the crypto space and resulted in a pretty hostile mutual relationship between crypto builders/users and the various regulatory agencies that are claiming to have jurisdiction over them.  The most salient flashpoints of this tension have come up in the actions against Tornado Cash, the arrest (still without formal charge) of Tornado Cash representative Alexey Pertsev, and accusations against Sam Bankman Fried (and his empire) of working behind the scenes with government to undercut rivals, hobble DeFi and fix his centralised businesses in positions of power and influence.

In short, things have been pretty acrimonious recently between crypto idealists and government regulators.  But is this an inevitable consequence of crypto’s permissionless and open nature, or is there a way that regulatory control could actually be embraced by crypto users.  In other words, is there a “carrot” way to get crypto users to willingly adopt regulation?

There is a convergence of various technological components that leads me to believe that such a carrot is possible. These factors are non-transferable tokens (Vitalik’s “soulbound” tokens), privacy preserving attestations (DECO) and the inevitable integration of decentralised systems with tradfi.

But instead of boring you to death with the details of those technologies, I will focus instead on what using them might look like.  It would be something like this:  You provide all your KYC information to an entity, it might be a central government solution or it might be a decentralised identity solution like CanDID.  In return for “proving” that you are you, you get a non-transferable KYC token transferred to your wallet.  

This “KYC token” doesn’t reveal your personal information to anyone that you don’t want it to, and it doesn’t have to reveal all of your information all at once. Think of it like a locked ZIP file on your computer that has completely customisable access.  If you want more details on how this actually works, Dahlia Malkhi’s recent SmartCon presentation on DECO is one of the most seminal and revolutionary steps forward in privacy preserving technology in years, and I think it’s criminal that it still has fewer than 4,000 views.

So basically you get this token in your wallet that can’t be transferred, that contains your personal info, and that can be used in a customisable way to “prove” various things about yourself to various smart contracts.  So if it proved your nationality, for example, it could be used to access smart contracts that are limited in terms of the nations that are legally allowed to access them.

If you’re a crypto purist you might look at this and wonder why you would opt in.  Under the current system you can access any smart contract without restriction, why would you voluntarily dox yourself in a way that is only going to limit you from engaging in some crypto behaviours that you might otherwise want access to?

I think this is where the integration with tradfi is going to come in.  The inevitable convergence of legacy and Web3 systems will allow for new products that will be, quite simply, awesome.  An example of this would be, say, keeping a certain amount of money in a Web3 automated yield farming strategy (like YEARN) where the interest earned on your initial is automatically directed to pay off a mortgage you have gotten from a legacy banking institution. So your crypto interest goes to pay off your mortgage, and there is no friction where you have to “jump” between legacy and Web3 (or between “normal money” and crypto) because that distinction has been abstracted away.

But the only way that such an integration is possible is if the relevant governments have assurances that the people accessing and interacting with those tradfi products are who they say they are.  And by far the best way for you to have a doxxed wallet is to do so in a way that actually protects your privacy to some degree.  It’s worth noting that this isn’t just pie in the sky speculation. Recent EU guidance on DeFi regulation alludes to this exact thing (see bottom of page 45 here):

https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f689e5b2-4f55-11ed-92ed-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-272370364

So at the start most crypto purists won’t want to go through the process of getting this KYC token, and I think it would be severely misguided for governments to pursue a “stick” approach to this (for example: Get a KYC token or we will fine you).

  The carrot approach will be much more effective. “If you get the KYC token, and it can show you are who you say you are, then you will have access to an entirely new playground of financial products that move seamlessly across the tradfi/Web3 boundary.  Use your blue chip NFTs as collateral for a car loan.  Pay for half your house with Bitcoin and get a mortgage for the rest that pays automatically from the yield earned from staked Ethereum, etc.”


This sort of “look what you’ll be able to do while still generally preserving your privacy” incentive is much more powerful than a hostile and retroactive regulatory regime, it’s a carrot so tempting that it would cause the vast majority of DeFi users (who are generally, after all, neither North Korean hacker or criminals) to adopt this system.  Whether there is large-scale consumer support for such a solution really comes down to how well people understand the trade-offs, what they lose by KYCing themselves vs what they stand to get.  At any rate, it’s a good idea to start thinking about it.",cryptocurrency,1667186394

dogecoin,"Currently, $DOGE is tracking past squeeze pattern and we could see at least 200% upto 400%","This is not a financial advice. I have played squeeze play for the past 2 years from GME &amp; AMC and I am seeing squeeze pattern in $DOGE recently after Elon took over Twitter. This certainly spikes lots of interests as Elon could potentailly make a crypto payment in twitter. 

Let's check out these charts. As we all know, FOMC meeting is coming up this Weds and Canada and Australia has recently raised 0.5% interest when they were expected to announce 0.75%. If FED does slow down interest rate as market expects 0.75%, there will be huge bounce in stock market and crpytos. Interestingly, We could see big bounce after FOMC meeting.

If we follow similar patterns, and let's say $DOGE does go up 200% after FOMC meeting, we could potentially follow similar pattern as past movement since many investors will take profits. We could see something from -50%-70% drop in mid October after Mid term election. 

https://preview.redd.it/3tcr5dzer2x91.jpg?width=1806&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f82b02f47acfb06d57a41c2cc95bf861f4baf76

Depending on how you play this stock but if you do swing trade, it's important to take profits. However if not, you can always buy &amp; hold. It's all up to individual investor's strategy. 

https://preview.redd.it/0d0uqdzer2x91.jpg?width=1806&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eef90b8b058493e6a9e241ad0c97c3b52fd4259

Usually squeeze pattern lasts about a month and if we can track same pattern, we could see bounce back up from mid October and contiune throughout end of November to early December.

Hope these helps for some investors.

Can someone ELI5: 
But as central banks such as the Federal Reserve engage in one of the biggest interest-rate-hike campaigns in decades, demand for U.S. government bonds already in circulation has fallen in part because most of that debt carries lower interest rates than the bonds being issued today. That could mean a glut of cheap, low-yielding debt with few buyers.
There’s been no emergency thus far, but the market for Treasury bonds is drawing increased attention out of concern that as liquidity dries up across the globe, there may at some point not be enough buyers of debt issued by the U.S. government. 
...
“If we were to have a buyers’ strike, or a failed series of Treasury auctions, 


I don't understand this. The first part, is this like the price of bonds in the secondary going to zero? (I'm [probably] exaggerating because the yield would then be infinite.) And (second part) if rates are going up, how would you have failed treasury auctions?  I would think that people (or countries, if we're talking on the massive scale) would be buying these, since these are new issues (as opposed to buying on the secondary market ones issued a year ago ).

Chase Card: $5760.70 @ 4% APR, 75/month

Apple Card: $4962.11 @ 4% APR, 65/ month

A lot of personal finance folks say to pay off credit card debts because of the 15%+ interest rates but for military we have the SCRA act that can Cap credit cards APR, acquired before entering the military, at 4%. 

So do i stop contributing to retirement and save a 3-6 month emergency fund first? Do i save $1k and then start tackling the debt also without paying to retirement? Do i keep my 5% with TSP with the match and stop contributing to IRA ? Should i invest, save, and pay debt at the same time? By investing 10%, saving 10%, and add a little more to pay down my debt?

personalfinance,Advice re: inherited IRA,"Hi all,

My grandfather passed away about a year and a half ago and left me some money in an inherited IRA. My wife and I have been hoping to use that money as part of a down payment on a house. Our goal was to buy something sometime in the next year. We have two toddlers and renting apartments has become increasingly difficult, both space and money wise. However, as the market continues its downward spiral, the value of the inherited IRA does as well and I’m concerned that our plan of using that money to purchase a home is fading (i.e. smaller down payment, higher interest rates, etc.). My question for you all is whether it would make sense to pull the money from the inherited IRA and take the tax hit, so as to preserve what’s left in order to have something to help with a down payment? Or should I continue to ride it out for as long as possible - until we need the cash to buy a home - in hope that the market improves/stabilizes over the next year?

# Final Comment

As we can see, AMD is a good and stable company, with huge potential from its fundamentals. We can expect at least 1.91% return in perpetual from this stock if we want to hold it forever, with a probability to see swings between +20% and -20%.

AMD had a high beta compare to the sector and the industry, this makes it riskier and potentially very lucrative than the average peers.

Its P/E is above the industry and the market itself, probably a little bit overvalued.

High profits margin and ROA suggest us a potential growth, same for ROE and ROIC. DuPont Analysis shows a positive 62.87%.

Financial indicators point out the fact that AMD's financials are stable and not in danger in any front in the short and mid run.

We shall take in mind that 2020 and 2021 were outliers years, and due to the lockdown the company had huge profits came with speculative bubble of those two years. The speculative bubble pushed for a positive trend on the company, inflating its price well over its fundamental value. We shall expect to see a regression towards the mean growth range and the price to stabilize to its fundamental, discounting off the hype and trend.

If this company paid dividends, it would have a higher evaluation.

Its **current** fair value is

|Price|Factors considered|
|:-|:-|
|$51.28|WACC + Earning Based growth rate|
|$47.80|WACC + Earning Based growth rate + interest rates of 4%|
|$54.94|WACC + Earning Based growth rate + ROA based growth|
|$50|WACC + Earning Based growth + ROA based growth + interest rates of 4%|
|$86|RRR + Earning Based growth|
|$58.90|RRR + Earning Based growth  + Interest rates of 4%|
|**$58.15**|**Average of all the factors considered**|

&amp;#x200B;

Reminder that this is based on the balance sheet of 2021 business year's end, in fact, growth in revenue is already over expectation, as well as costs one, but net income not yet, still under 1B missing until now, expecting a **net income of 4B EOY**

The company is a Long Hold and have high probability to pay dividends in the future, but as for now, it is **overvalued by 10-15%** due to last year trend. Good buying positions shall be around 50-55 dollars

personalfinance,Auto loan rates and inflation,"I purchased a new car in June '21, last Tuesday I was in a bad collision and the car is now totaled(dream car gone). No injuries thankfully.

Now comes the personal finance question. I got my car loan in June '21 at 1.9% for 5 years, great rate imho. Now its &gt;4.5%. Certainly not ideal. I financed through the manufacturer because I was able to get a discount on the car and the great rate. In retrospect I should have gone through a bank or credit union so nothing was tied to the manufacturer. I would love to keep my old loan and put the insurance payout towards a new car, but I'm assuming the answer is likely ""fuck no you can't do that"". But I'm curious about my options to avoid the high interest rates right now.

I'm not incredibly well versed when it comes to personal finance topics, so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1667225056
personalfinance,Big spending events are over. What should my strategy be moving forward?,"Some basic data:

- Combined income of my wife and I is around $300,000 USD (before taxes). My income has a variable component. The breakdown would be my wife at $100,000 and myself at $200,000. Mine could be as low as $160,000 (assuming no variable pay which is very unlikely) up to $250,000 (this would be on target earnings).  For example, this year has been pretty good so I'll probably be closer to $300,000 myself. I wouldn't count on this every year though. 

- **Expenses:** I won't list everything because I'm not looking to adjust my budget and I'll list what our disposable income is. With that being said I do think it's important to understand our debt profile at a high level. 
    * **Student Loans:** Me - $18,000 My Wife: $14,000 (however she can apply for student loan forgiveness so our assumption is $10,000 of that will be gone). A note on this. We got married very recently so they are not looking at our combined income when determining our eligibility for student loan forgiveness. I will not get any because I'm above the income threshold. 
    * My wife has a car payment of ~$400 a month (this includes insurance). The total balance left on the car is somewhere in the neighborhood of $17,000. The car is a 2017 Toyota Rav4 with less than 40,000 miles on it right now.
    *  We bought a house in 2021 with a 3.2% interest rate and a loan of $475,000. We put less than 20% down so we are paying PMI. Our monthly payment is $3200. 

* **Assets:**
    * I don't really look at my house as an asset right now in the sense that we do not plan on selling it anytime soon. Obviously, things can change, but this is the house we plan to settle down in and have children. With all that being said we may still have gained a bit of equity from housing price increases during the period after we purchased our house. Prices have come down a bit recently, but I don't believe we've gone below our purchase price yet. Again purchase price was $475,000 with about a $21,000 down payment. We live in Illinois in case that's relevant.
    * **Cars** As mentioned earlier my wife has a 2017 Rav4 with less than 40,000 miles on it. I Drive a 2010 Camry with a little over 100,000 miles on it. My car is fully paid for. 
    * **401k:** My wife and I both hold retirement accounts through our employers. I have around $60,000 split between both a traditional and Roth IRA. My wife has around $20,000 split between her traditional and Roth IRA. These are made up of ETFs that mirror the S&amp;P 500 primarily.
    * We also have ~$10,000 in a savings account that has an interest rate of 2.5% right now. We treat this as our emergency fund. I'd like to get it to $20,000, but I'm not sure that's the right number. That's part of the reason I'm making this post. 
    * We also have about $10,000 worth of stocks in TD Ameritrade. This is split between SPY, VTI, CVX, TSLA, and AAPL

So with all of that out of the way Our disposable income each month is consistent at $3500-$4000. Again I'm sure there are ways I could perhaps increase that amount by cutting some unnecessary spending, but again I'm not looking for budget advice at this time.

The reason I've made this post is that my wife and I have gotten through what we see as the biggest spending events in our early careers. We both are 28 years old and have recently gotten married, gone on our honeymoon, and as I mentioned earlier bought our house in 2021. 

We didn't go into debt for the wedding or honeymoon so the assets/expenses I've listed above are fairly comprehensive in mapping out our current financial footprint. 

I was hoping I could get some advice, especially given the current market trends, on how I should be prioritizing my investing moving forward. I suspect a solid first step would be to increase our emergency fund. I have thrown out the number of $20,000 because I think that would more than cover us for an extended period of time if we were to lose our jobs or to cover some other type of emergency.

Beyond that, I'm wondering if I should stockpile cash in an attempt to enter the market slowly as prices come down. I'm no expert, but from the limited research I've done it would seem in the US we are in for a rough couple of years possibly when it comes to the stock market, inflation, etc.

Are there other investment strategies you would suggest for someone in our position? Looking for any and all advice. Thank you!",finance,1667226913

personalfinance,Is there anything I can do with my budget to streamline finances?,"I'm including a screenshot of my budget (minus columns of information you don't need to know) here: [https://ibb.co/DkbgprH](https://ibb.co/DkbgprH)

**The background:** I'm in my 30s, working full time, and living alone. A lot of this debt is from stupid purchases in my past.  I admit I'm still not great with money but even in my best moments, the budget is tight. High interest rates are killing me and credit card companies are unable or unwilling to provide any kind of repayment plans/relief/assistance/etc. I don't use the credit cards and pay for everything with cash/debit card. I'm about halfway into my debt repayment process, but the remaining balances are high with high APR, which has progress stalling. Cost of living is very high where I live and I have little to no wiggle room there. The market for rentals is competitive and I'm on the lower end of a 1BR in my area. Roommate situations are not an option at this time as I have a sick cat. I am hoping that I can move to a cheaper area sometime in the next year or two.

**Big picture budget:** The gist of it is I bring home $1425 per pay check every two weeks for $2850 per month. My total expenses of rent, static car payments (insurance, cat payment) and debt are $2052.25 per month. This leaves me with $797.75 per month for food, gas, medical, pet, etc expenses.

**The goal** is to repay the non-auto debts (Apple, Chase, DCU Visa, DCU Personal) as quickly as possible, but these are my biggest balances with my highest APR and I'm making next to no progress as payments are eaten up by interest. The credit card companies don't have any relief they can offer, so I just have to dig myself out. I hope to have the Apple Card paid off soon but my finances remain extremely tight, especially around the holidays.

**Where I know I can get more money:** The only real option I can see is to stop pre-tax contributions to my HSA ($25 per pay check),  retirement ($150 per pay check) and extra withholding ($50 per pay check) which would add something like $175 per pay check to work with. But beyond that I'm kind of stuck with this.

RE: a second job, technically there's nothing preventing that from happening, but I don't know that it's something I'm seriously considering pursuing as (a) working 7 days a week is pretty miserable (b) I have a back injury that would prevent me from taking a lot of these jobs (c) I have some mental health problems that I suspect would spike up if I'm taking on too much.

**Situational costs:** Medical expenses right now are pretty high as I'm dealing with an injury and in physical therapy every week. I'm also setting aside some discretionary income for my nieces and nephews' holidays.  I'm hoping that my tax return will go some ways towards paying off the DCU Personal loan, but I'm not planning on it.

Sorry if this is rambly, and I'm happy to answer any and all questions you might have. But I just need to find any areas I can cut corners here.",finance,1667233912
personalfinance,Should I tweak following the prime directive in my case?,"My total income after taxes from my various income streams is 9-10k. (Edit: Monthly)

Here are my current debts
Mortgage 160k 2.25%
Truck 21k 2.4%
Motorcycle 22k 4.5%

Cash savings-5k
Emergency fund-2.5k (1 month expenses)

Following the flow chart it states interest rates from 4-5% should be paid down before saving for major purchases in the next year.

I’m planning on buying a used car (15-20k) by the end of next summer for my soon to be wife (wedding is already fully funded) and with current interest rates around 5-6% and possibly on the rise should I just save my money for the car purchase instead of paying down the motorcycle? In all reality both will probably be paid off by the end of next year anyways

stocks,Opinions on M2 and it's correlation to inflation?,"There's a colloquial definition of inflation which reads, ""too many dollars chasing too few goods."" 

I think this describes the cause inflation well and hints at the relationship between supply-side and demand-side inflationary pressures. Eg, whenever the dollar / goods ratio increases you should expect inflation to increase.

Given this, my understanding of inflation isn't compatible with a world of durably high inflation in which supply-side inflationary pressures remain flat or decrease, while M2 growth is flat to negative. Yet this is exactly the situation we seem to in today with supply-side pressures easing, while M2 is slightly down on the year.

Of course, this comes after a huge increase in M2 which likely needs time to work it's way through the system (those dollars don't all get spent at once), but should this trend in M2 continue would it even be theoretically possible for inflationary pressures to remain high without further supply-side disruptions - or is my understanding of inflation incorrect?

I know Jeremy Siegel has cited M2 being flat as a reason to believe the Fed might be getting too aggressive, but I'd interested in hearing what you guys think.

investing,Fed Rate Hike or Pivot? I am betting on Pivot,"The big question this week is whether the Fed is going to hit the markets with a 75 basis point or a lower hike. I tend to think the Fed has do at least a 50, but more like 75 increase due to inflation.

but I think they will pivot....

According to [AlphaBetaStocks Cheat sheet](https://alphabetastock.com/investors-weigh-recession-risk-as-they-wait-for-fed-wall-street-cheat-sheet/292774/), the fed is already talking about damping the increase. 

 San Francisco Fed Bank’s President Mary Daly emphasized the central bank’s precarious position, noting that it is at risk of either overtightening, which would cause a severe recession, or under-tightening, which would increase inflation. 

The fed doesn't want to look foolish and wants to ensure inflation is in check before pivoting. 

 ""The biggest risk is that the Fed overdoes it since inflation tends to react quite slowly to higher rates, likely even more so this cycle given still not fully understood distortions to the economy caused by the COVID pandemic,"" [said Nick Brooks](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-pivot-not-horizon-even-over-tightening-risks-loom-strategists-2022-10-28/), head of investment and economic research at ICG.

personalfinance,"What should I know about handling my 401k or IRA from abroad, when I leave the US forever","I am 38 and been in the US for the last 5 years or so. I have one more year before my project here ends and I return to Spain. 

During my time in the US I’ve been contributing to a 401k. I don’t have an IRA as of now.  

My “plan”:

1) Open a Traditional IRA now. I was thinking Fidelity. And start using it with some contributions towards some low cost 2055 target date fund or similar. 

2) As I finish my employment in the US, rollover my 401k to the IRA account. 

3) Leave the money sleeping here for the next 20+ years. Once I am 59.5 years old or more, and the market is favorable, I would get those funds transferred to Spain. 

I have some operational uncertainties about how exactly will I do that.  And probably there is a lot of details that I don’t know that I don’t know. 

About the rollover: how long is that process? I may not have a lot of time between my last pay stub and my departure. 

When I no longer have a US cell phone number or a US Social Security number… how will I identify myself and confirm that that account is actually mine?

Tax-wise: I’m assuming I will pay taxes to the IRS when the moment comes. I’m assuming it will be only federal and no state since I will not be a resident of any particular state. Am I right?

I know the US tax you for global income if you are a resident. But in this situation, a non-resident foreign national living and working abroad, I’m assuming  the IRS will only tax the IRA withdrawals and they will leave alone whatever other income I may have abroad at that time?

Apologies for the noob question. Two year T-notes recently auctioned and issued at an interest rate of 4.375%. The price per $100 was $99.839071. 

My two questions are:
1) Does the interest rate mean a total annual return of 4.375% will apply both years? If so, is this 4.375% of $100 or $99.839071?

2) Say $10,000 was purchased. This would cost $9,983.39. Excluding the semi-annual payment, at maturity would one receive $10,000 or just the principal ($,9,983.39)

Thank you all very much",finance,1667245538

personalfinance,Pay off my debts or make long term investments?,"I have about 32k liquid for no good reason. I owe 7,800 on my car loan, with a 3.6% interest rate on the loan. I am 26 years old.
I’d like to keep about 15k as an emergency fund liquid. 

Would the money be better served to pay off my debt, or should I start making long term investments (VOO, VTI)? 

I’ve already bought a home, so no large down payments are expected for me anytime soon.",finance,1667252885
stocks,how bad is the bond market right now? enough to force a pivot?,"ELI5 request. I admit I don't trade bonds and don't know much about them. I'm just starting to read up on the topic.

One article says ""the stock market is in trouble because bond market is close to a crash""

another more recent article says ""bond market crash simply isn't in the cards""

&amp;#x200B;

so what is the state of the bond market right now?

is it bad enough to force fed pivot? or is this indeterminable? What target numbers are we to look at to anticipate a fed pivot?

From what I read, I infer that controlled rate hikes should not cause sudden bond market crash.

is the bond market currently being manipulated by big players to try to force fed pivot?

(sorry if these are dumb questions.. just looking for some education)",finance,1667252988
