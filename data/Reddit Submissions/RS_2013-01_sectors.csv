finance,How Can I Find A Student Loan?,"Hello All. I'm just going to get right to it. There are many details to this question so please bear with me. I am 23 years old. I just graduated in May with a B.S in Business, which I am abandoning as I want to pursue medicine. I have been accepted into a post baccalaureate program in pre health studies at a prestigious university. The program is considered a federally funded certificate program but it has an undergraduate status. Not graduate. I accepted the federal loans which covered 7500 of the 22,000 cost of attendance. Private loans are the only option.

However, my credit is poor and also non-existent. There are four items on my credit report. All are federal loans from my first degree which do not exceed 10,000. These are in forebearance. The other is a credit card that is current but has a history of past due balances. My father took this card out without my knowledge and now I'm dealing with. Credit Karma cites my score as a 623 but loan officers are saying that I have a 557. My mother has a consistent and above average income as a psychiatric nurse. She is my co signer. But, her credit is not fantastic, as she was just recently divorced. We have never been bankrupt, desolate or in any deep financial trouble.

The Question/Problem: We've been denied from Sallie Mae, Suntrust, Wells Fargo, Citibank and a credit union run by the school I need to attend. I was told to get a new cosigner. My mother is all I have. Is there any bank that is easier for loan approval? Is there something I am missing? What can be done now to acquire financing after denial? Any known services that provide cosigners? 

I NEED to attend this school. It is so much more than just becoming a doctor. This is everything I've worked for. It's everything to me.

I have a wife, a modest car payment, a condo, and no kids. I am trying to turn my life around by having an asset-focused life rather than a liability life. I recently sold (at a huge loss) my new Mercedes and bought a 10 year old Camry that has no payments. I sold all of my luxuries like watches and music gear this week and am paying off all of my credit card debt and will probably have a few thousand leftover. I am thinking of selling literally every material possession I have except my work laptop to have $5-10K to start a small business. I work at home and have tremendous flexibility. Some of my talents are IT and management skills; I am also an experienced musician and producer. The problem is, my wife is about to attend vet school and expects to accumulate $200K+ in student loans, and I have to start paying soon on my $50K+ in student loans for my useless MS. This really makes me feel like trying to start a business or creating a portfolio is pointless until the student loans are paid off DECADES from now... any advice for pointing my life in the right direction? I am getting tired of working 80 hour weeks and being eternally in debt. I am 32; I do contribute to my company 401K but obviously it didn't turn out too well =\

I'm trying to find a way to develop assets while maintaining my current career (most recently, thinking of starting to get some cheap properties to rent, perhaps government assisted housing so the fed cuts me the check... I have a feeling this is way harder than it seems or everyone would be doing it). 

Thank you for the great advice. I am going to discuss these matters with my wife as soon as possible and will definitely check out mint.com and Dave Ramsay.

personalfinance,Savings Bonds: Save or Spend,"I have about $5000 in series I, US treasury, savings bonds (bought at a face value of $50 and go up from there overtime). They were purchased from 2004 through 2011 by my grandmother for me and are in my name. I cashed in ones from 2003 and noticed they were getting 2.72%-3.31% returns on them to pay off one student loan. 

I have some federal student loans I've been paying monthly towards; they're all one payment but are technically dispersed like this:

| Loan# | Original Loan Amount | Current Principal Balance| Interest Rate | First Disbursement |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| 1 | $2625.00 | $2053.44 | 2.39% | 10/2003

| 5 | $5500.00 | $4451.12 | 6.80% | 09/2007

When I pay towards the student loans it disperses the payment amongst all of the loans, as you can see.

[USA]","Last year I worked for the first 6 months in a co-op job, and I think I filled out something weird on my W-4 because I didn't have any federal tax taken out. Finished up classes during the summer, then started my full time position in September. Even without taking taxes from my first job, I came out slightly ahead due to the benefits of (I think) the Lifelong Education Credit or whatever it's called, plus my total income was small compared to the standard deduction and exemption.

personalfinance,Pay off HELOC or invest?,"I am currently helping my mom manage her finances and have help set her up with a financial plan for retirement. She has just received an inheritance and I am debating whether or not she should pay off her HELOC, invest the money or do some combination of the two. Here is her financial picture:

Age: 61

Salary: 120-150K (depends on commission) She is planning on earning this for at least another 10 years as she is a psychologist so she can and wants to continue working. This all assumes she stays in good health. No major problems right now, good weight, works out consistently, eats well etc. 

401(k): 160k (contributes to match every year)

Roth IRA: 20k (just started this recently, putting in max per year)

Other investments: 45k (Split between Vanguard 2025 &amp; 2030 retirement funds)

I-Bond: 10K

Cash Savings: 110k

Debt: None

She currently has around 700k left on the mortgage and 90k on the HELOC. The HELOC is tied to the prime rate which is currently 3.25%. I assume the prime rate will stay this low until at least Q3 2013. The mortgage is at 3% and scheduled to go up to 4% within a year and stay at that rate for the life of the loan. The value of the home was recently appraised at 1.3m. It is part of her retirement plan as she is considering selling when I move out and using the 400-500k proceeds to buy a smaller home for just herself. Keep in mind we live in a major city where the average home price is 800k. 

The problem is that she is only paying the interest on the HELOC right now. I feel like she is just taking that money and lighting it on fire since it's not even paying down the principal. My gut tells me she should do a combo of investing in regular investment account by pouring more money in the 2030 retirement fund  and paying down the HELOC. I was thinking she should take 70-80k from the 110k and split it between the HELOC and investing, does that seem reasonable? That would leave a 30-40k emergency fund. 

I guess at the end of the day this just seems to come down to do I think the market will do better than 3.25% keeping in mind that this interest rate on the HELOC may rise towards the end of the year. I am hopeful that the market does outperform, but obviously I have no fucking clue so here I am. Any advice appreciated.

economy,WhiteHouse.gov petition: Create corporate tax policies that are proportional to employee compensation,"During a conversation this morning about the tensions in our federal fiscal policy, I had an epiphany.

It's clear that working Americans rely more than ever on social services to bridge the gap between their needs and their wages. We also know that American workers have suffered 30 years of wage stagnation and benefit cuts: we are the most overworked first-world nation, despite our high productivity. We also know that a significant factor in our economic woes is the impoverishment of the middle class, which is so financially squeezed that aggregate consumer demand has been persistently depressed for years, and doesn't seem to be coming back.

It occurred to me that not only are these trends are directly related, but we can address them through our tax policy. Simply put, we could create corporate tax policies that are proportional to employee compensation. Corporations that pay low wages should be required to pay more into the infrastructure (via federal and state taxes) on which their employees must depend. Corporations that pay decent living wages and give reasonable perks should be given tax incentives. Of course, there should be a cap here - industries with employees who are already well-compensated shouldn't receive extra tax incentives as an incentive to gratuitously raise salaries, which would simply create inflation.

Of course, applying these policies solely to wages will place domestic companies at a huge disadvantage. We could apply these policies across the board through sales taxes to prevent offshoring.

I've created a WhiteHouse.gov petition to see if people agree, and I'll be interested in watching discussion here.

Crown Capital Eco Management - The heavily forested city of Ketchikan, Alaska, is built on rock and surrounded by water. Every commodity that comes into Ketchikan must arrive by sea or air. The use of fuel oil is problematic for both economic and environmental reasons because the oil must be obtained and refined elsewhere and transported (using additional fuel). What's more, fuel oil is subject to price instability.
Southeast Alaska Discovery Center in Ketchikan, which provides information to more than a million visitors each year, is the site of a pilot biomass boiler system now coming to life. Two oil-fired boilers serving the 250,000-sq-ft center were replaced with a highly efficient system fueled by local wood. Manufactured by Hurst Boiler &amp; Welding Company Inc., the hot-water boiler was custom-designed to fit within very limited indoor space.
Under the direction of E. Dane Ash, project manager for Tyonek-Alcan Pacific LLC, the biomass boiler system was developed with Hurst representative Gregory W. Smith of Global Energy Solutions Inc. to address environmental concerns, as well as issues related to building space, fuel costs, comfort, reliability, and simplicity of operation.
The new boiler is located on the lower level of the Discovery Center, which requires heating for a minimum of nine months a year. Local wood densified into fuel pucks is delivered to an elevated walking-floor storage bin in a vestibule area built to protect against excessive moisture. (The biomass-fired boiler can burn any wood product with up to 50-percent moisture content.) An auger moves pucks from the storage area to a metering bin and into the boiler. Freezing is not an issue because the walking floor easily breaks up any frozen contents.
The boiler system was designed to highlight how biomass can reduce or eliminate the use of fossil fuels. Visitors can see the boiler operate through specially designed windows. In the hall just outside of the boiler room, the noise level and ambient temperature is consistent with the rest of the building.
 
Savings
Fuel costs have been cut by two-thirds. The densified pucks are used with almost no residual ash; eventually, however, tree clippings from the Ketchikan walking trails will be ground and fed into the boiler, eliminating the need for transport to a landfill, burning, and other methods of disposal.
 The Boiler
 The Hurst S100 Series Fire Tube 27 HP Hydronic Water Heating Boiler features a pre-heater to optimize combustion and an underfeed stoker with dry-ash-removal system.
 Results
 The system easily can be replicated for heat or heat/power generation up to 20,000 kw. In June 2011, Smith served as a keynote speaker for the fifth annual Native American Economic Development Conference in Anaheim, Calif., where he described the initiatives being implemented in Ketchikan and shared success stories of biomass-fired boiler systems installed on institutional campuses and in manufacturing facilities throughout the United States, particularly in challenging and remote locations. Systems include municipal solid waste, as well as woody biomass for steam production and steam to power.

I’m just looking for a bit of knowledge and advice as I approach my financial future. (I hope this is the right place to approach this, if not I will happily delete the post if necessary.)


I’m a college freshman just about to enter my second semester in an attempt to receive a degree in Business Management. Unfortunately, I have not previously taken any finance or accounting courses and the way my school approaches this degree I will only be taking managerial finance/accounting instead of a personal finance/accounting course. I was wondering where exactly I could search for more knowledge on this topic as well as any great books I could read to further my knowledge. Investing knowledge would be amazing as well. As I do not have much money now reading as much as I can will help when I’m more financially stable.


I’m looking for the best way to approach my slowly accumulating student loans. My parents cannot contribute much to my education so most of the funding will have to be borrowed through student loans or any scholarships that I can get. So far I had to borrow 26,723 in loans just to fund this first year of school, 2,723 of which is federal funded loans with the rest coming from a private loan(all of which are deferred) . I also (upon my parents advise) severely overestimated how much I needed to borrow for this year by 5000 dollars that I now have in a savings account confused on what to do with. I don’t know if I should start making interest payments on the loan or if I should save the money to assist in funding sophomore year.  I’m wondering if there are any particular loans/scholarships I should be looking at specifically for funding sophomore year and how I should approach this debt now and as I continue college.


Right now I am working a part time job on the weekends that will bring in approximately 75 dollars a week which will increase to 150 a week during the summer and I am also looking for a second job. No car but currently I am using a parent’s car/ get rides to get to work.


Mainly I am very confused on how I should approach my financial and intellectual future and as Grad School is more than likely a necessity I want to figure out an exact plan so that I will not be buried in debt when I get out of school. I would also like to get a car so I can stop bumming rides but with my small revenue stream and immense debt I don’t know how that would be possible.
I will appreciate any help that r/personalfinance can give me and will be very thankful for the guidance.

(The loans are from my undergrad degree, I'm not going into further debt by going to grad school). 

Income: This is where it gets a little tricky. 
He makes commission. On an average month he will bring home $3,600 net. But he often exceeds his target, last month he brought home an extra $2,000. Rarely, he could have a bad month and bring home less than average. This causes a lot of stress for him, since we live pay cheque to pay cheque. He feels like he is under a lot of pressure to keep us fed and sheltered, and I suppose he is. I grew up very poor, so this doesn't bother me as it has always been a fact of life. But I'm realizing that it doesn't have to be this way. 
I bring home about $1,100/mo from TAing (teaching), and I will be getting a $3,000 scholarship this January. However, my tuition has to come out of those monies (~$2,000 per term, 3 terms per year). I am in year 1 of a two-year program. We are not sure whether I will be going on to a PhD after I finish this, or whether I will start working, or take a short practical program to acquire some employable skills (my current MA program is purely academic).

Our priority right now is paying off the credit card debt. We are also saving up for a wedding. We have $1,000 in a wedding fund that was a gift from his family. I have no idea how much a wedding will cost but I'm guessing between $5,000 and $10,000 for a practical one. We would like to have an emergency fund but I wonder if that ought to wait until the credit card debt is dealt with. 

Any help, analysis, or advice would be very much appreciated.

**EDIT** :  I should mention that we still have separate bank accounts, so we each have trouble seeing the whole picture. Right now, our arrangement is that the rent money comes out of my account (I wrote post-dated cheques for our rent since I was the only one who had cheques). He sends me an email money transfer for his share of the rent ($800) toward the end of every month, this transaction costs $1.50 each time. Our heat/electricity bills we split with the people who live above us (dollar amounts given above are just our share), we have to pay them in cheques, and since I am the only one with cheques, I pay those out of my account too. He pays our cell phone bill. I pay our cable/internet bill online. I buy the majority of groceries, because I have more flexible schedule than him to be going out and buying them. We are ready to get a joint account, but we aren't sure how it should be set up. I want both our incomes to go into the same account for paying our shared expenses, but I think we should also have separate that our individual debit cards connect to for our personal spending (then we can allow ourselves a monthly ""allowance""). Any thought on the logistics of setting up our joint accounts, or information on what options we have would be much appreciated as well.",finance,1357242056

personalfinance,I need some help. I've been referred to a collections agency for my student loans.,"I have a few questions and need some advice rather desperately.

First: I'm in the United States. I graduated from college last year. I have a loan for slightly over $2k, which I qualify (and have qualified) to have forgiven because of where I teach. I started work 3 months after graduation. 

I applied to have my loan forgiven on October 2nd. I never heard anything back from them, so I called them directly, and they told me I had to finish my loan exit counseling. Sure enough I had one more form to accept with my school. I did that immediately. 

I called them back and they said I have to send them another forgiveness form. Now I'm back across the country from my employer (school starts back up in 3 weeks), and they require an original copy of the forgiveness, which I obviously cannot get *again* because of the geographic distance.  I spent time back and forth with my employer to try and get another form since my copy would not work. By the time I called the Loan people back, they won't talk to me about my loan because I've been referred to a collections agency. They said that they no longer have the authority to forgive my loan. I talked to the collections agency who, no surprise here, told me i could not forgive my loan because it's ""in my federal file"". The guy also said that the collection agency didn't buy out the debt or anything. They're just the ones trying to collect. I'm waiting on my school to call me back, and am praying without much hope that they can help me.

My question is this. What the hell do I do? Is it true that they cannot consider my loan forgiveness form filed 3 months ago (2.5 months prior to filing with collection agency)?  Can my school help me forgive it, or is my only option now to go through the collections agency? Is it true that I can no longer forgive my loan because the collection agency is handling it? I feel that I don't know much about this despite how much I've read, so I'm sorry if I haven't provided enough information. 

Please help me if you can. Any and all help is appreciated. Thank you for your time.",finance,1357224865

gaming,The state of online gaming,"In recent years especially anyone playing online fps style games has run into a hacker, script kiddie, cheat, glitcher, fill in the blank.

As the years pass it feels like hackers are getting bolder and gaming companies are doing less and less to combat them.

In my personal experiance, i started with far cry 1. Not many hackers to be seen and punkbuster was on patrol. 

CoD 4 (modern warfare 1) had the occasional hacker but due to server rentals and admin rights these hackers were not much of a sore spot. (yes i know this game now is utterly hacked because most people have given up on it.

CoD MW2. Started out great and within a couple months was loaded with hacking types. The common thread seemed to be that folks were preturbed with hacking so they inturn got hacks themselves to compete. Gone now are the dedicated servers and the birth of matchmaking begins. Vac enters the scene and is determined to be as useful as tits on a bull.

Far cry 2 comes out, hacking isn't much of a problem because too few play the game. Still, dedicated servers were possible, giving hope to those who played it.

BO1 comes out, same situation as MW2, but with dedicated servers, the most diligant server admins keep the games partially clean.

MW3 enters the fray. Same set up as MW2 and the game is a complete hackfest within a week. No dedicated servers and VAC is still wanted as much as rosie odonnell wants man flesh.

BO2 comes out, gone are the dedicated servers and hacking was in place day one.

Far Cry 3 is in place, no dedicated servers and the game has absolutely no anti cheat in place. Hacking is again present on the first day. The only method to try to stop cheaters is to send pm's to random devs who may or may not frequent the ubisoft forums, but if they do see it you have to have video evidence with no promise of investigation.

The war z. Enough said.
Day Z. Again, enough said.


So the current state of online fps gaming is pretty much non existant anti cheats, gone are the dedicated server rental options. Players are forced to play with people 5 continents away and deal with the ever present hacker population.

Sure, there are a few games out there that offer some hope like bf3, but the fact is that the majority of games don't.

I personally got into online fps games later in life than most. I started with farcry 1 and fell in love with the genre.
I've never hacked glitched cheated or did anything outside of the rules. I mean, what is the point of competing in these types of games when you have to cheat your way to victory? 

If you win it is the hack that deserves the credit, not you.

Soooo i just bought about 150 bucks worth of various single player games on steam and am getting ready to retire from online fps gaming. It just isn't worth the frustration anymore.

So thank for nothing ubisoft, activision, hammerpoint and others for taking the less than stellar approach to game production and product security.

Also a big thanks for nothing to the myriad of less than credible human beings for cheating and ruining the gameplay of others.

In closing, just looking to see if there are others like me who are utterly fed up with the state of online pc gaming?",technology,1357185373

I've Googled around and I haven't really been able to find consistent information that seems 100% legit, so I turn to you in hopes that I can have some solid help.

**Back story.**

Back this past summer, I had a van (wife's, vehicle 1, paying monthly) and cheap compact car (mine, vehicle 2, completely paid off).  I've been always wanting a motocycle and financially, I could swing a ""cheap"" payment.  So I went and bought one.  A couple weeks after, my car was in an accident with a semi and totaled my car.  

Since my car was paid off, I just had liability insurance on it expecting any accident to be covered by the other person's insurance if I were to be in one.  Well, the semi accident was a hit and run and they never caught the driver, so I never got any payout from it and was just left with what a salvage yard gave me (which basically just covered the tow and storage at the tow place).  

So now, I need another car as I work, roughly, an hour from home.  I debated between a cheap beater vs a better used car.  One end, I wasn't saving anything and was living paycheck to paycheck, so I couldn't afford ANY repairs that could potentially come up on a beater.  On the other end, I could always work a bigger monthly payment to have a more reliable ride.

In the end, I picked up a ~$16k used car as I thought that would be the better choice (and let's be real, I like(d) to have really nice things).  But now, due to some things at work, I'm not making what I used to and simply can not afford this new car. 

* I've thought, ""maybe I should sell it on CL"", but people who have $15k on hand aren't going to be buying from me, they'll go to the dealer.  I would have a rather healthy difference to cover and I don't have any savings at all.

* Then someone told me I can simple forfeit my car and have it voluntarily repossessed by going to the bank and turning in my keys.  I know this would have a negative effect on my credit, but I'm in my low 20's, bought a house already, I have the vehicle I need to get around with the kids, I have my ""fun"" vehicle.  *The reason I don't sell the bike is because my car payment is exactly double that of my bike.*

* Someone mentioned refinancing, but realistically, it would save me $30-$50 at best and that's just not even close enough.  My interest rate is decent (~6%) already, so it isn't going much lower.

Any and all help is immensely appreciated and can provide more information if needed.

Now granted I don't have a lot of money in them right now because I'm focusing on paying off my credit cards and house related stuff. 

As I clear the cards I want to shift some of the money over to RRSP and savings but the movement I am seeing on the minimal amount there  doesn't really fill me with joyous prospect for when there IS more money there.

The accounts were opened in May and up until very recently the RRSP only had 50$ in it; Since May it has moved by 0.17$ and I don't know if the 150$ I added to the account recently has affected that gain in any way so I am going on the assumption that it's the gains only from the original 50$.

If my math is right that means 0.0225$ a month or 0.27$ a year for that 50$, if we follow the math here it means I'll if I were to manage to get that RRSP to 500000$ somehow, I would only be getting 2700$ a year from it. That sounds small considering this is supposed to be a premium rate. 

In the same vein, the savings account has had off and on about 780$ in it because I use it mainly to park half of my absolute bills(Mortgage, condo fees, bus pass, property taxes) every paycheck so that I don't accidentally use the money for something else and then I move the money back the day before those things are due. That one has been getting between 0.05$ and 0.20$ every month.

-- 

I need some sort of understanding of how these things are calculated so I can figure out if I'm wasting my time on these and should look elsewhere or if I'm reading my numbers wrong and there's a method to this madness.

personalfinance,Should I declare bankruptcy?,"The spouse and I are informally separated, and between the two of us have about $60,000 in credit card debt. On top of that we each have our school loans, I have a small car loan that's affordable, and we are paying a mortgage on a townhouse in both our names. Nothing has gone to collections, but we're both to the point where everything is maxed out and we're just barely keeping our heads above water. We've looked into consolidation loans, negotiating lower payments or interest rates, etc but had no luck. I've been taught to see bankruptcy as a last-ditch resort for deatbeats, but we're going to be drowning pretty soon and it would be nice for both of us to have a fresh start if we divorce, while being able to keep the cars and house (those are our payment priority right now and don't plan on getting behind on those).

personalfinance,Short-term investing for future first house purchase,"Hi, I'm a 23/m currently making $60k and planning to buy my first house next year.  I will be permanent in my location for at least 5 years with a large company, near parents and friends, etc.

My question is what to do with some extra savings $22k I currently have sitting in a 0.75% savings account that I have been building up for a down payment.  I am looking at houses around $200k or less.  This purchase would be made early next year 2014, so this is relatively short-term and I'm not convinced of investing in a stock index for this short time frame.

As for finances, I have very good credit and no CC debt with $7,500 left in federal student loans at a 5.8% average.  I am also matching my employer's 4.5% in a traditional 401(k) that is well diversified and maxing a separate Vanguard Target 2050 Roth IRA each year.  The Roth IRA will be eligible for a first-house distribution starting Jan. 1st, 2014 (five-year rule) in which I should have about $4k in earnings.  I have fully contributed to 2012 Roth, but not the $5500 for 2013 (usually bi-weekly payments to this account).

I am fully enrolled in the company's ESPP distributed every January and July.  I have not sold the company stock given this January 1st which is worth about $4500.  My net income monthly is ~$2600 that I usually put $1000 towards savings after CC, rent, Roth IRA, student loans.

Other debt is a bedroom set I bought that is 0% interest for 2 years that has about $1300 left.  My current apartment rent is $600 a month and monthly credit card bill is about $500.  I fully own my car.

I am looking for something relatively safe that I can throw the majority of my savings into while still having an emergency fund of $6-8k that will beat the low savings account rate.  I've been thinking of the total bond index VBTCX from Vanguard that gains about 4.5% a year.  Is this a good idea?  Also, since the student loan is a higher rate, I'll most likely pay the loan off immediately and use the rest in a safe investment.  I'm also thinking of investing the whole 2013 Roth IRA as a lump sum in the next month or two for the added dividend gains.

Thanks for reading, I look forward to hearing your suggestions.  Below is what I've calculated out to have before next year for a down payment without taking into account new investments.  After the house purchase, I plan to increase my 401(k) percentage as my employer offers a Roth 401(k) option as I am in the 25% tax bracket.

22000 (current) - 7500 (student loans) - 1300 (furniture) + 1000*12 (monthly savings) + 13750 (3 ESPP distributions) = 38950 + 4000 (Roth earnings pull) + 5000 (industry test award) = $47950",finance,1357337602

investing,[CEMI] Small-Cap Bio-tech. Fresh investor needs help spitballing.,"Hey guys. I’m pretty new to the sub, and relatively new to investing in general. Stumbled upon [Chembio Diagnostics (CEMI)](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cemi), and I was hoping I could spitball with someone. As a young investor, I don’t really have many peers to throw ideas around, so hopefully this subreddit might help a bit. Anyways, to the stock:

Chembio Diagnostics – CEMI

Current Price: $4.80 	
Market Cap: $38M 	
P/E Ratio: 6.66	

What it does: 

This company is a creator/distributor of infectious disease diagnostic devices that can identify HIV, Syphilis, Hepatitis-C, and other diseases. On the 21st of December, it received [FDA approval](http://seekingalpha.com/article/1075131-chembio-diagnostics-growing-sales-and-profits-with-near-term-fda-catalyst?source=nasdaq) for one of their ‘rapid HIV detectors’. According to the announcement, the detector can deliver results in 15 minutes. My fiancé works ICU at a level 1 trauma, and I asked her how often she does HIV tests on her patients. She said she has to do it with everyone, as to avoid unneeded risk to exposure. I then asked her how long it takes, and she said usually 24 hours to get full results.
  
Also, the article that mentions the FDA approval mentions that the US Preventative Services Task Force is recommending mandating insurance reimbursement for routine HIV tests. With Obamacare now the law of the land, I’m assuming more young people (after they get off of their parent’s health insurance) will have to get their own health insurance. Suffice it to say, I think there is and will be a strong demand for ‘rapid HIV detectors’.

Other highlights I found on their [10K](http://investor.shareholder.com/chembio/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1092662-13-3&amp;CIK=1092662) are their ‘Collaborative Research and Development Agreements’. CEMI signed a few agreements with a Brazilian foundation, in which they became a major supplier to the Brazilian Federal Ministry of Health Public Health Programs. Also, in 2009 and 2011, CEMI received two grants from the UN’s National Institutes of Health for the development of Leptospirosis and Tuberculosis*.  It looks like CEMI is getting global exposure in critical markets, in which ‘rapid HIV detectors’ will be highly utilized. 

Their balance sheets look good (no crazy debt, constant growth in revenue and profit). Their management looks sound (prez has been there for 25 years). 

I think I found a good, undervalued stock with great fundamentals. And it’s small enough that it might get a takeover bid (I’m not looking at it for the takeover, but it’s nice icing on the cake).
   
If you’ve read this far, thanks for reading. Like I said, new investor, just trying to spitball ideas. What do you guys think? I would really like some harsh criticism, especially on how I analyze stocks. It will only make me a better investor, right?

*I thought the UN was a strong endorsement, but I’m not sure how many other companies would have got the grant. Does anyone know how charitable these grants are? And if being awarded these grants carry any weight?",finance,1357296387
investing,Shorting Treasuries strategy,"Since rates are near zero and real yields are already negative, then in the long run yields would stay low but steady (like Japan) or rise.  With the news of the potential end of QE from the latest Fed minutes and as unemployment hopefully edges towards 6.5%, we might start to see rates finally going up.  If I have an amount of capital lying around then I can buy a short treasuries ETF (like TBF) and wait.

In the worst case scenario, the US pulls a Japan and rates stay flat.  No worries, I'll sell and breakeven.  If rates rise, then I can profit from it.

In scenarios like this, reddit would call for the fact that markets can remain irrational (negative real yields) than I can remain solvent.  But I'm pursuing this strategy from the position that I'll remain solvent even if I lose 100% of my invested capital.

personalfinance,Should I rent out or sell my home?,"I'm in my mid 20's and feel that I might have gotten into the home ownership gig too soon.  My parents had always told me the ""property is never a bad investment"" line, and I saw a good deal on homes with a low interest rate so I jumped without evaluating as much as I should have.  I've just started to pay attention to personal finance and investing, and I'm realizing that my home is currently proving to be more of a liability than an asset.  Additionally, I am strongly considering moving to a different state in the next year and a half to pursue career opportunities.  So, here's the part where I admit that I've made some poor financial decisions and overspent on my home.  Details:

* Mortgage is $1910, will be $1740 after PMI is removed.
* In my area, my home would rent for about $1750.  I would probably need to use a rental management company because I would be moving about 1000 miles away.
* If I saved up to refinance, I could get my monthly payment down to about $1580 (PMI removed in this scenario).
* I am not underwater on my home, though if I sold I would lose about $12000 on the home because of real estate agent fees, and a few grand that I could have saved by renting.  None out of pocket, just money that I wouldn't get back out of the house.

So, with those facts in mind I am looking for advice.  The options I'm currently considering:

* Bite the bullet and sell the house now.  Move into a cheap rental and start saving for the move.
* Save up for the refinance to get my payment lower, use the property as a rental to get some marginal ROI.
* Just live in the house for the next year and a half.  Hopefully by then home appreciation takes some of the sting out of selling sooner than originally anticipated.

$29k in various federal loans all at fixed from 5 to 8%
$3.2k private loan at 4% fixed

I plan to contribute 6% to my 401k to get the full company match, opt out of health insurance as I can stay on my parents until I'm 25, and put 400 a month into a roth IRA. I also plan to participate in the employee stock purchase plan, but I do not know how much that will cost yet.

Next, I am going to save an emergency fund of $5k while making minimum payments. Then I plan to pay every cent I earn to the 21k loan while still making the minimum payments on the other loans. Long term I will then tackle the 17k, then the federal loans with the same strategy while slowly building my emergency fund to 10k.

Personal: I am 21 and I have a credit score over 700. Planning to move to an apartment in 5 months time. Car is semi-reliable (high mileage honda from the late 90s with seemingly no problems) Is this a good plan? Anything I am missing or not accounting for?

Since I have good credit and a high credit score should I try to consolidate all of these loans to a private loan for a much lower interest? Thanks /pf!",finance,1357261428

gaming,"fnatic/strenx : ""One of my first international Events, Dreamhack""","Here we go, another story (DREAMHACK)

""One of my first International Events""


  This is important to notice: throughout my career, I always lived strange things. At first sight, I admit that, I was not laughing at all. What is surprising is that I always managed to get good outcomes from these situations. This might be my best tactic.
""Dreamhack Winter 2008""

  During this time, I was 17 years old, young, innocent, French (haha), and a lg whore (am I still ?!?). I was playing under Frag Dominant (FD|AMD). Funny how every team you don't know has a Steelseries/MSI/Razer somewhere in its name just to look professional. In reality, Steelseries/MSI/Razer gives one mouse, and all of a sudden, this team thinks that he is sponsored by them! I won't blame these teams, it's good to have Steelseries/MSI/Razer on your tag, isn't it?!


  FD could not afford my travel to Dreamhack, how surprising... My teammate, Spart1e, paid me everything (except hotel), so I could attend there. All these players, fox, Jibo, av3k, noctis, Spart1e were participating to this event. It was my opportunity to show something good, to prove my LG, to prove that my rocket launcher is the worst and to show my dm6 (Campgrounds) skills!
It was my first time going alone, I took 3 hours with Spart1e on Messenger, asking the same questions over and over (So I take the bus, I go right, then I go right?) I was so afraid, but I managed to do it (not the return, you will know why). After hours and hours of travel, I managed to get to Dreamhack. I was already impatient to play. Little by little, I saw a lot of computers, so many... And, the most exciting part was when I saw the players that I only saw on internet: av3k, jibo and Spart1e. I was too shy to talk to them, except Spart1e of course. 


  At 10 pm I'm the only quake player around, I was tired, bored and without a Hotel room. I had to sleep somewhere, and given the little options, I settled down on the gymnasium floor, with another 2000 people. I slept in underwear, my denim as my cushion, my coat as cover. I couldn't sleep well, and cramps would wake me up all the time. 


  At 8 am I finally gave up on sleep and stood up. I had the most beautiful face in the world... I could have played the Zombie in ""The walking dead"", but instead prepared myself to play Quake. After all, It was the tournament day!


  It would take too long to explain my groupstage; short story is, I finished 2nd in my group behind Jibo. So, I had to face Spart1e in Quarter Finals. I was saying to myself: “This is really bad… he pays me the travel, and I have to face him: If I manage to beat him, is he going to kill me?“.


  The answer came quite soon. I just had won him 2:1, and I could see from his face that he was really pissed about these games. But as we spoke, I realized he took it the right way. Eventually, he wished me good luck for the next games saying: ""Good luck strenx, but if you lose to fox, I will kill you"". 


  Indeed, the next day I had to face fox. It was really important to be in shape, so sleeping early was the best solution. ""Be in shape? Are you kidding me strenx?!"" This is what I told to myself. “I'm going to sleep on the floor again, with my freaking nice denim and my coat as cover"". I couldn't wait to sleep and dream, this moment was so important for me. Luckily, I've met a friend at the gymnasium so at least I had some company. I remember that while asleep, I woke up suddenly, I couldn't check the time so I thought that I was late for my tournament. ""F***, I have my match against fox, I need to be ready!!"" I dressed-up so fast that even lucky luke was impressed. I rushed the toilet in order to wash my face and I came back. After that, my friend looked at me and said ""dude, it is only 1am"".


  Yes, you can say it, sometimes I live in another world. 
“The Day has come! I have to play fox, the guy that I've always respected”. FAST FORWARD: “I just beat him 2-0 somehow!”. FAST FORWARD: “Oh my god, I need to take a vodka and drink it as fast as I can!”. FAST FORWARD: No alcohol at Dreamhack. RESULT: I drank water instead (it looks the same).


  Eventually, I was in the final. I had to face av3k. My headphones were broken, so I played av3k with a replacement (Gamecom Headphones). I played the worst final ever. I really could not hear a single thing clearly. I never knew where he was. And do you want know the most epic thing? I realized after my final that I played with inverted headphones. Yes, I thought I was going to jump off a bridge ^^.


  I ended up giving my winnings to fox (a laptop and a homecinema). The homecinema was too big to carry home anyways, and he needed this laptop. This was my way to show him my appreciation to him and I wanted him to remember me in a positive light. I still could come back with 500 euros… err not exactly as FD stole me the money: the guy from this team took this money for purposes I will not disclose (but I can assure it was not charity).


  Time to sleep, as the day after would be a very loooooong travel. And this part is the most epic ever. I was really worried because I didn't remember how to go back to the Airport. I only remembered that I had to take a train to the train station. When I was there, I saw so many buses. I came to a bus and I asked : ""do you go to the airport""?. He said yes, so I followed. 
I realised 40 mn after that this bus was going to another airport (a low cost one).... 

  It was not a big deal after all because I had time anyways. I waited on the bus stop with my bags nearby. And here comes the weird story. I really wanted to pee so I went to a ditch. Somehow I fell from the ledge, and that wall was so high I couldn't get back up. From down there, I saw the bus coming and I was yelling to wait for me, but he didn't hear it. I managed to climb this ditch only 1 hour after, but I already was too late for my flight. When I managed to get to the airport, my next flight was the next day (yessss! I will sleep on a f****** floor again, it is a sign, floor is my best friend). I just managed to tell my mother that I missed my flight that my telephone disconnected: no battery of course!


  But after about 20 minutes, a magnificent voice fills the airport with: “We are looking for Mister Kevin Baeza please! Mister Kevin Baeza”. ""Oh my god!"". I strafed to the gate like cetus in defrag.


  Hours passed, and I was in France. I had to take the train from Paris to Angers. I was so tired that I slept on the train, but I missed my stop to Angers. ""Really! ??? Is it a freaking nightmare or what?!"". I was 80 km far from Angers, so I took another train again, I stayed up all time and I finally managed to get home. 


  To conclude, let me assure you everything I wrote is true, and best depicts what I remember of this event. 
Sometimes, if I think of all that happened, I wish somebody would make a film about it.

 * Determine how much I can spend on superfluous things (going out for drinks with coworkers, buying clothes, etc.)
 * Start maxing out Roth IRA and investing money into low-interest/low-risk accounts to make better use of idle money

personalfinance,(Another) Student Loan question from a newbie.,"The following is from my Stafford Loan website.  I was looking to enroll in AutoPay because it would cut my interest rate by 0.25% - and every penny counts, right?

Well then I ran into this slight play on words. And I wanted to know what would be more practical for a student loan of roughly 5 grand.

&gt;Applying Payments Made Within 120 Days of a Disbursement
Payments made within 120 days of your loan disbursement are generally treated as refunds. This directly reduces the amount of money you borrowed (principal) and recalculates any existing accrued interest based on the reduced principal. It also reduces your overall accrued interest—saving you the most money in the long run.
If you prefer all early payments made through Auto Pay be applied as regular payments and not as refunds, you can change your preference below. By selecting Apply as Payment, payments are applied first to any accrued interest, then to your principal balance. Making early payments helps you keep up with your accrued interest so it isn't capitalized; however, you won't benefit from the reduced principal balance that refunds provide.

Apply as Refund

worldpolitics,Government Minister &amp; Right-Wing Catholics in Ireland Attempt to Censor Twitter Satire,"Neil of krank.ie has written an article on how Irish politicians are attempting to link ""cyber bullying"" with political satire in order to silence criticism.

http://www.krank.ie/category/opinions/jokes-will-be-outlawed-in-rabbittes-ireland/

A musical director of a popular chat show in RTE (Ireland's national broadcaster), Jim Sheridan, is a regular and popular tweeter and has a long history of fairly mild photoshop spoofs aimed at politicians of all parties and other tweeters. (Such as this one: http://twitpic.com/br6cl4)

Unfortunately for him, one of the people he lately spoofed was Ronan Mullen, an ultra-Catholic independent senator known for his hardline dogmatic Catholic views on abortion and whose history includes stories of allegedly being ""nasty"" to women who had abortions due to unviable foetuses (http://www.thejournal.ie/ronan-mullen-horrified-at-nasty-suggestions-over-abortion-debate-424919-Apr2012/) and linking abortion to the Newtown Connecticut massacre (http://www.thejournal.ie/ronan-mullen-abortion-newtown-double-think-721352-Dec2012/).

Today's Irish Independent has reported that both the Irish communications minister, Pat Rabbitte and Mullen himself have condemned Sheridan's photoshops as ""offensive"" and that someone (unnamed) had complained to Sheridan's employer about him. One of the tweets alleged by Pat Rabbitte to be ""dreadful and offensive"" is ""the head of [Ronan Mullen] stuck onto the body of a man wearing nothing but swimming trunks and a large crucifix.""

RTE have not yet confirmed if they will take action against Sheridan.",cryptocurrency,1357407214

I was never educated about finance by anyone, including school AND my family. But the past is the past. Basically, my credit score isnt terrible, but its definitely in the medium risk area, which prevents me from taking out most types of loans. I needed to by a vehicle recently, and a good friend of mine offered to take a shared loan out with me, which basically means the bank holds the funds in his account and gives me the money, and as i pay it off at a very low interest rate, the funds are freed up in his account. Unfortunately my friend and i have fallen on difficult times and i would really like to have this loan paid off so i dont owe him anything. My question is, is there any options for a guy with a kind of crappy credit score? is there any type of loan that i could take on as my own so that i can pay my friends loan off? i understand that i will likely be paying a much larger interest rate, but thats okay, its more important to pay of the loan i have right now. any insight and advice would be greatly appreciated!

gaming,"My computer just crashed and I lost all my data, Steam Could restored everything except Mass Effect 2 b/c of EA's BS.  My words to EA follow.","**Please take the time to read this, or at least the summary which I'll include at the top.  I gain no karma, so when you upvote it just spreads the word about this continuing cycle of EA BS.**

TL;DR: *Mordin Style.* Computer Crashed.  Lost all data.  Not good.  Not good at all.  Steam Cloud restored all games.  Happy user!  Not Mass Effect 2.  All data gone.  Almost beaten game.  All squad member recruited and loyal.  EA refused to use free Steam Cloud because of stick up their ass.  Not buying more EA games.

This morning, I was playing Mass Effect 2, which I had recently purchased less than a month ago.  It is a truly amazing game, I immersed myself as a Vanguard, who would murder up close and demolish with some awesome biotics.  I had progressed well in the game, completing all primary objectives.  In the main storyline, it was just after [acquiring the Reaper IFF](/spoiler ""Plot"").  I had recruited the full squad.  I had completed all loyalty missions except Legion's, whose I was on the way to complete.  It was awesome.

Later that day, after no changes to anything, not even installing an application, windows update, or firefox extension, the computer was rebooted.  On that reboot, it did not work.  The Windows logo would display, but somewhere between the logo and the login screen, the video drivers failed.  This is a recurring problem with this computer, me and my family have looked at it and we're pretty sure there's something wrong with the video card interacting with the card.  It's a weird problem we've had before, and we've tried fixing it.  We're incredibly tech savvy, but after a full day of work none of us could get it into safe mode.  We popped in the recovery disc, and told it to reinstall the system.  This is actually no problem, since it's the family gaming computer where all it has is Steam and TeamSpeak.  It's not the first time we've wiped it, and it was fine.  All the games were fine, all the data came back from the Steam cloud.

But mind you, careful reader, since the last time we had to wipe it I had purchased Mass Effect 2!  Thinking it would act as every other game in my Steam library, I erased the computer with little thought of my actions.  Near the end of it's reinstall, I remembered one crucial detail.  Mass Effect never had any ""Syncing"" progress.  Heart pounding, I googled Mass Effect 2 and it's integration with Steam.  My worse fears were true, EA refused to use Steam's Cloud.  I had just pressed the button to wipe all of my Mass Effect 2 data.

Never before had I felt so attached to a game.  Shepard had melded into my idea of an ideal person, a reasonable gentleman to the people who never quite took it easy on scumbags.  BioWare had created a game that made it able to meld to your character.  It was a work of art.  Gone.  I was incredibly mad, having so much time and dedication to that game.  And it was lost.

The worst part was EA.  Why couldn't they have integrated with Steam's services like every other game I owned?  It's not incredibly difficult, nor requires a supercomputer.  No, EA has a stick shoved so far up it's ass it'll ruin the experience for the end user for... hell if I know.  This is just the beginning.

Next is their DLC's.  Now, I bought the regular version.  I never buy DLC's, and think they're a waste.  So I'm building my (now missing) squad and realize.. there's an empty slot.  A quick trip to the EA wiki..  There are DLC squad members.  You have **got** to be kidding me.  You're going to make us pay for a game, then pay extra for core parts of the game?  Are you stupid?  Their finest example is Battlefield 3.  Great game.  I played it for a while, then got bored shortly after B2K was released (which I own).  I come back about a month ago, and realize... there's 4 DLC packs.  Holy crap.  The price if you paid for all the DLC's is more than the price of the original game.  I don't know who thought of that BS, but it detered me from coming back to playing BF3.

Back to Mass Effect.  I'm amazed how BioWare can make such a truly amazing game, then have it mauled, murdered, destroyed by EA.  The DLC's, not using Steam properly, Origin, I'm truly ashamed to own any game with their branding.  I will not be purchasing any future games from EA.  If anyone would like to join me, the more the merrier.

I don't usually ask this, but I'll put it out there if someone feels generous.  If anyone has a Mass effect profile, default face, Paragon just above the second level, renegade just above the first, all non-DLC squad members recruited and loyal, except Legion and Miranda (whose mission I completed, but pissed off), or anything remotely near that, please PM me or leave a comment.  It just needs to be about the same point in the game, I can figure out how to use console to modify the specifics.  I cannot offer Reddit Gold for this, but if anyone feels like lending a hand that'd be amazing.

I'll stop ranting now, but I can't be the only one fed up with this Bullsh-- by EA.  It's insane. [/rant]",technology,1357358864

Graduated college in May 2011, and took a job at a large insurance brokerage in September making 25k a year. I just recently took another job making 45k a year, so now that I have some extra money I need to really get my financials in line. 

I was fortunate enough not to come out of school with lots of loans (14k), but I was stupid enough to take those loans and not work while I was in school. Either way, there is a Federal Direct loan for 5k (3.5% interest) and a private loan for 9k (8% interest). I'm trying to get advice on whether I should consolidate these loans and possibly refinance them at a combined lower rate or just let them be and pay as much as I can? If the former, are there any downsides to this?

gaming,Diggames Presents Frontier,"“Frontier” a web game with possibilities for more…

Overview:
The Oregon Trail was a great game that showed players all over the world how groups of people made it out to the West. What the Oregon trail does not show us however, is what happened when those settlers made it to their destinations. We know many settlements were built and a handful of them prospered into the cities we know today, while others have been long forgotten. With Frontier, players get the chance to be a founding settler of the West and build their own settlement. Will your settlement stand the test of time or fade into history?

Frontier is a Sims like experience where players manage and build a settlement up from the ground. They grow their area by recruiting other settlers to join their community, who in turn work and produce resources. The player will participate in mini-games to gain extra resources and help level up their settlers. Players can improve their settlement by upgrading settlers, shops, and unlocking new jobs and equipment. The player will also have the opportunity to explore the wilderness and help their settlement grow by completing daily and special quests.

How it Works:
The player progresses through game play by moving their character around the map during a game day. The player has a set amount of energy available to them, which depletes as they participate in mini-games and/or quests. Mini games add resources to their settlement, level up settlers, as well as their own character . Quests on the other hand can unlock new areas, mini-games, and special rewards. The player can only do so much work in a day, so they must choose where to focus their energy. When the player runs out of energy they will need to wait until it replenishes to play more mini games. Resources that are gathered by NPC settlers will be added to the settlements stockpile throughout a day. The player also has the responsibility to build new buildings, upgrade buildings, and recruit new settlers in order for their settlement to progress.

Game Progression:
The player’s settlement will grow as they collect resources and level up their buildings/settlers. Leveling up the buildings will allow them to support more settlers as well as provide visual upgrades. These building upgrades can also lead to more efficient resource gathering, as long as the player has the appropriate number of settlers for that specific building. Leveling up settlers will allow them to be more efficient and have a higher chance of gathering more resources during their daily work. Higher level settlers are also required in order to run some of the advanced buildings.

Economy:
The game’s economy is focused around collecting resources. Food, lumber, metal, and pelts will be required as basic upkeep for their settlement. How high that number is depends on how big the settlement is. If the number of resources falls below the number required for the settlements upkeep the player will have a specific amount of time to get it back into the green (safe zone). If the player fails to return the upkeep to a healthy level, the settlers will begin to abandon their jobs and if the economy does not improve they may leave the settlement permanently.

Mini games for earning resources:
Fishing – Food
Hunting – Food/Pelt
Cooking – Food
Logging/Lumberjack – Wood
Carpentry – Equipment Upgrades
Blacksmith – Equipment Upgrades
Tailoring – Equipment Upgrades
Mining – Metal
Farming – Food/Pelt
Tavern mini-games

NPCs and game structure:
The player will need to balance the resources gathered from their own settlement. These native resources will require a balance or else the player may face limited resources. An example of this would be if the player clear cut all forests in their own settlement, hunting would suffer and hunter settlers may not be able to meet their daily quotas. As players are building their settlement they will need to learn how to trade to help supplement resources that they may not be able to gather (for example buying food because they have clear cut their forests). If the player fails to balance these resources they may have settlers abandon their settlement, forcing them to wait until another opportunity to gain more settlers arises. Settlers are people coming in off the trail and looking to start a life in the West. These settlers randomly appear so replacing them may not be as easy as one may think.

Recruiting NPCs:
Settlers will randomly appear at the player’s inn/tavern. These settlers will pay a small lodging fee to the player and the player will also have the opportunity to recruit them. Each settler will have a specific trade, such as hunter, carpenter, miner, etc., as well as a skill level of this trade.  If the player goes ahead and attempts to recruit a settler, the settler will take into account a variety of factors. These factors can include anything from settlement prosperity, size, building levels, upgrades, current upkeep/happiness, and several others. The more of these factors the player has going for them the better chance to recruit the settler. Different settlers will have different preferences and a player will always have some chance to recruit the settler. For example, a level 3 hunter may prefer a settlement with higher level hunting buildings and equipment, while a level 1 hunter may not care as much.

Housing and Laborer Buildings:
Housing and laborer buildings are both needed, but work differently in the settlement. Houses are needed to house all settlers, regardless of their labor group. Labor buildings on the other hand are how many settlers can work and collect resources for that specific trade. For example, a player may have enough houses to support 5 hunters, but if they only have a single level one hunting lodge only one hunter will collect resources. The other hunters must still be fed and accounted for in upkeep, but will be considered “dead weight” due to their inability to contribute to the settlement. Too many of these “dead weight” settlers is a sure way to strain your resources.

Laborer buildings can be upgraded and their number of laborers increased. For example, a level 2 hunting lodge may be able to support 3 hunters.  When these labor buildings are running at full capacity a maximum efficiency bonus will be added to these settlers daily quotas.

Look and Feel:
The NPCs of the world will be from a pack of characters made by Frogames.net. The pack comes with the source files so we will be able to make many versions of the models.

personalfinance,Allowances impacting Federal Taxable Gross?,"OK guys, I'm trying to better understand my paycheck and how much goes to taxes and such, but I'm thoroughly confused with my latest paycheck.  I recently got married, so I went from claiming single, 0 allowances, to married with 2 allowances.  If my understanding is correct, since I get paid bi-weekly, claiming 2 allowances should reduce my federal taxable gross by (146.15x2) or $292.30 right?

My latest paycheck reads like follows...

Gross Income - $1716.80
Pre-tax Deductions - $340.13
Federal Taxable Gross - $1377.50

So a couple of questions, 1) Why didn't my federal taxable gross get reduced by my entire pre-tax contributions? (It only reduced 339.30) - My pre-tax contributions are 401(k), DCRA account, and healthcare. 2) Why didn't my allowances reduce it at all?  Per my paycheck calculator that I made in Excel, the amount of federal taxes they took out is correct based on $1084.37 federal taxable gross, if it was really $1377,  I should have paid more taxes I'm thinking.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks!

personalfinance,Defaulted on Private Student Loan from Jan 2007 from a company that doesn't exist anymore. Am I In The Clear?,"**TL;DR:** Received private loans in 2006/2007. One collections agency hounded me since. The company where the loan originated filed for Chapter 7 in 2009. The legal statute of limitations in my state for them to sue me passed this week, should be off my credit report in 2 years and correspondance to the CRA's known address for the company will come back ""return to sender""... am I an untouchable now?

----

I received about $20,000 in private student loans from ""MyRichUncle"" in 2006 and final disbursement in 2007.

*MyRichUncle was a ""preprime"" lender who would lend to enrolled students of select colleges with no cosigners or credit history. In 2009, MRU Holdings liquidated under Chapter 7. Additionally, someone who I personally corresponded with, [Troy Hill, a Portfolio Manager for MRU, was arrested for embezzling $2.3 million from the company](http://www.northcountrygazette.org/2008/12/03/student_loans/), and actually spent some of that opening a Port City Java franchise in New Brunswick, NJ where I met him...*

My account went into collections VERY quickly... since it was a private loan, they declined academic deferment (which, on the phone, I was ensured it would *likely* be given since I still had 4 years old college ahead of me) and I was completely unable to pay whatever it was at the time they demanded. I basically never paid them a cent. 

*Regarding the ethics of not-paying-as-agreed, I feel as though I owe them nothing since my credit status has been forsaken until 2015 because of a misleading reassurance that, while enrolled as a full time student, Academic Forbearance was likely. Additionally, the school in which they gave me a loan for is not my graduating institute, therefore I do not feel they had a hand in my degree / future. Whether or not I'll ever address paying them back has yet to be seen, see below in my questions...*

Though I hadn't even paid since my first statement in February 2007... they reported my first delinquency in 08/2008. Experian says it will go to positive status in Mid 2015. 

The statute of limitations in NJ is 6 years for Private Student Loan debts. This WAS NOT a federally insured loan and DOES NOT appear on my federally-backed loans listing in National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS.) I *-just-* passed the 6-year-mark from when I cashed my 2nd disbursement check, so it is my understanding that they can no longer bring this against me in court.

My credit report is in shambles from this, as well as other financial problems I had in 2006-2007. I recently got a $40k/yr job last year and began paying off those debts, but the MRU is the shiner on my credit report.

MRU Holdings filed Chapter 7. The entire SEC history can be found [here](http://www.crmz.com/LinkTo.asp?TargetURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Esec%2Egov%2Fcgi-bin%2Fbrowse-edgar%3Fcompany%3D%26CIK%3D0001145202%26filenum%3D%26State%3D%26SIC%3D%26owner%3Dinclude%26action%3Dgetcompany). They contracted UAS Echo (University Accounting Services) from the start as the collections agency, payable to ""ACHIEVER FUND I, LLC"" in 2006, changing to ""Education Empowerment Fund"" in September 2009, then ""Younomics"" in August 2012. Other than a merciless UAS, No other companies or attorneys have ever contacted me representing any of the mentioned companies or any banks in which my debts may have been ""sold' to. On my Credit Reports, two separate accounts for my two disbursements appear only as MRU Holdings, and I'm guessing UAS (on their behalf) has been reporting accurately against me every month, since 2010. 

----

So, my questions are as follows:

 - UAS was the original collector for MRU. They handled both typical repayment and collections repayment. Am I at risk for another agency ever reporting an owed debt to the Credit Agencies? Or do Private Student Loans not get to change-hands like that?

     - I'm guessing if that does occur, it's against the Fair Credit Reporting Act?

 - While my wages can't be touched now, can I be hounded past the 7-year-mark?

     - Do I have a basis for a lawsuit for harassment? They had 6-years to file suit against me and never did.

 - If I eventually begin to repay the loan, will this ""reset the clock""?

     - Should I wait to do it after May 2015 when Experian says the account is positive?

 - UAS reports my payments were payable to Achiever Fund, then post Bankruptcy, EEF and now Younomics. These all appear to be designates designed to receive MRU monies,  EEF

 - Should I begin disputing my MRU debts to the Credit Reporting Agencies immediately? What can I expect? What's the worst that can happen? The address listed for MRU with the CRAs looks like an old address, so ""they"" may not even get notification that the account is in dispute.

    - Is there a standard template I can find somewhere?

 - Since they filed for Chapter 7, does that mean my repayment is basically paying something that no longer cost them anything?",finance,1357504987

I have $100,000 in a Term Deposit in Australia in my name. My SO has an apartment in Australia with a large mortgage and a tenant whose rent doesn't cover the full monthly mortgage payments due to high interest rates (lets not go into detail on that). We have about $30,000 in our savings account here in Canada.

I have been advised to keep the 100k in Australia and use it as a deposit on a home when we return. I do not plan on returning to Australia for at least another 10 years. I don't like to plan ahead since I would like to see what it is like to live in various cities/countries.

We are considering using the $30k as a deposit on a small condo that we would commit to living in for 3-5 years. Then we would like to move on from Canada and turn that apartment into rental income (maybe by then we could have sold the apartment in Australia).

Any suggestions from anyone? There are so many opinions out there and I am open to hearing them all. Should I leave my 100k where it is or should I bring it here to Canada and put it towards a condo?

personalfinance,My brother makes ~46k a year and has ~126k in student loan debt at ~8%.  Are there any programs that can help him?  Details inside.,"My brother makes about 46k a year working as a front-end developer.  He went to a private school and has about 126k in student debt.  106k of it is in my parents name as a federal parent plus loan at 8% interest.  My brother has about 20 or 21k in his name.  I'm not sure what the interest rate on that is.

He's made some terrible decisions.  For example, he didn't keep track of how much his payments would be when the loans came due and last year he bought a new car which costs him about 500 dollars a month.  The loans are about 1700 a month.  He says his take home pay every months is 2400.  He really can't afford all of this.

If my parents consolidate the large loan, they can get the payments down to about 800 a month, but of course he's going to be paying for the next 25 years at 8%, so the total amount he's going to be paying will be much more.

What are his options?  My parents are worried that he'll not take responsibility for the loans in their name and stick them with the bill.  My parents would never be able to retire if he did that.

I've tried explaining that he needs to find a way to make more money (transfer departments, find a new job, freelance) but he doesn't seem to be open to that idea.  I think he's still in shock over how much his lifestyle is going to change as a result of these loans coming due.

Edit: Thanks for the help everyone. I should have been a little more clear about the issue I'm running into. Both loans are serviced by chase, and when I set up an automatic payment it doesn't give me the option is how to allocate the two. I've been paying double the minimum for some time now, and have seen the total number going down.

I was going to call and figure out how I can allocate the two payments, but wanted to make sure I was doing the right thing first. 

Just to make sure I understand, Should I allocate the payments so that:

A) I'm putting enough into the higher amount / lower interest one so that it doesn't increase, and then put the rest into the lower amount / higher interest rate loan.
B) Put the full payment into the loan with the lower amount / higher interest rate. - This is how it was set up for me using the automatic payment.",finance,1357598264

personalfinance,My Mortgage Primer (Canadian) - but may be useful to everyone.,"My belief is that the greatest positive impact to financial well being is understanding loans and how they work.  The Reddit community is by and large populated with young people, many of whom are beginning to get involved with home ownership and consequently mortgages.   However, from many of the questions posted, it is clear there is a lack of understanding about mortgages and the impact they have on personal finances.

Most people understand simple interest.  You loan someone $1000 for a year with 5% interest and at the end of the year you get $50 and maybe your original $1000 depending on the terms of the agreement.  Mortgages do not operate under the principle of simple interest.   To understand why, you have to realize that we are currently in a low interest environment but average rates over the last 50 years have been in the 6% range.  It is common today to borrow $250,000 for a home loan.  6% simple interest at this amount would be $15,000 per year.  Think about this - $1250 per month before you even pay any principle down on the loan.  I mentioned average rates are 6% - in the early ‘90s they were in the 15 – 19% range which would make payments incrementally higher.  The solution to this problem is amortization.  Mortgage loans use compound interest which are a type of interest calculations that are complicated and beyond the scope of this post. [For more information on the calculation process, go here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_calculator).  However, the take away here is that – generally speaking – the interest is top heavy on mortgages.  This means you pay a much higher amount in interest at the beginning of the loan. 
 
The easiest way to understand this is to look at an amortization schedule.    Let’s use the one [here]( http://www.mackenziefinancial.com/calc/jsp/MortgLoanAmortScheduler/mortgloanscheduler.jsp?$dir=self).  Plugging in $250,000 for the loan amount, 25 years for the loan length, a rate of 3% which is common for a 5 year term these days and pressing the calculate button we see the monthly payment is $1,183.  Most people stop here and determine if that is an amount they are comfortable with and if so, hope the bank approves them.  However, it behooves us to look at the schedule that shows us the payment schedule over the 300 months (25 years X 12 months) of the loan.  In fact, before we even do this, let’s multiply $1183 times the 300 monthly payments we will make if everything remains static over the length of the loan.  Doing this, we see that we will pay just shy of $355,000.  Remove the $250,000 principle and see that we pay over $100,000 in interest.  Doesn't really seem like an innocuous 3% does it?  Looking at the breakdown of the first monthly payment we see that it is composed of $562 in principle and $621 in interest.  We are paying more in interest than we are against the loan!  Wait, I thought we were paying 3%?  This is the downside of compound interest.  Note that over the schedule of the loan an increasing amount applies to the principle and a decreasing amount of interest is charged.   

An enormous amount of money can be saved by understanding prepayment privileges of your mortgage.  Either read the mind numbingly boring document your lawyer gives you when you purchase the house, or ask your lawyer to explain them to you or, - probably the best course of action – is to speak to someone at the bank.  Confirm when any prepayment will be applied to the loan.  I have heard of instances of people making prepayments on closed loans and the bank just keeping the money and not applying it to the loan for upwards six months.  Understand what a prepayment actually does.  In the example we used above, if we made the first payment and then decided to make a prepayment of $563 (which is exactly the same as the principle of the 2nd payment) before the second payment is due it would have the effect of “moving us up” the amortization schedule.  In other words, we would now own the house in 298 months, not 299.  Consequently we save $620 in interest by prepaying $563 in principle.  Often there are posts on this sub asking if it is better to use some cash to pay down the mortgage or invest.  A common answer is to compare interest rates but this ignores the fact that mortgages don’t use simple interest.  Shown above, we are getting an instant return of110% (620 divided by 563).  This is likely a much better rate of return you can get on any investment so I would always advise paying down the mortgage.  Even after 5 years (month 61) you are paying $652 principle and $530 interest, so it would still be better to pay the mortgage down (this is strictly in terms of net worth and doesn't take into account things like accessibility to the cash).  Here’s a protip:  once you have a year and half or so left in your mortgage, do not make prepayments as your interest rate is so low it is better to use the cash elsewhere although it can be very tempting to just pay out the loan and be mortgage free.  Knowing all this, you need to understand when shopping for a mortgage not to just look at the interest rate but also ask about the prepayment privileges.  One or two tenths of a percentage may not matter as much as more liberal prepayment rights.   Further, the benefit to your net worth is so high by making prepayments, especially early in the loan, it is important to pay as much as you are comfortable with.  I mean, at 110% rate of return, take all your empties back and go through the couch looking for loose change.

Paying a mortgage off in full is one of the most beneficial and satisfying events of anyone’s life and I hope by reading this it will expedite the process for you.

business,Dow Jones Basic Materials Index recalculated!,"Why we think this sector is overvalued, and why that may not necessarily be a bad thing.

Currently, the Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Index (DJUSBM) stands at around 287.19 (as of 1-07-13).  We start by using the dividend yield from IYM (the iShares Dow Jones US Basic Material Index ETF) which is currently at 1.91%.  

We calculated our cost of equity at 5.52%  - essentially we looked at the 10 Year Treasury Bond which is yielding 1.77% and added in a conservative market risk premium of 3.75%  to come up with the 5.52% Cost of Equity value. 

From there, we looked at the Basic Materials growth from the last 52 weeks.  The index low was 241.87. Today (1-7-13) it’s at 287.19 : an 18.73% gain. However, we realize that an 18% gain on a year to year basis for 5 years is unrealistic, thus, we believe (by looking that this sector, the Dow Joes Industrial index, the S&amp;P500, and the NASDAQ) that a fair growth rate for a five year period looking forward would be around 8.5%, with a 1.76% growth after year 6 and thereafter.  This rate is based on the assumption that the Treasury bond rate is a reasonable proxy for long-term growth in the economy (which will have to be adjusted when, and if, interest rate increase).

The expected dividends from this sector can be estimated from the current dividends and the expected growth rate of 8.5%.

Current Modified Dividends:  1.94% of 287.19 = $5.49.

Using this and our expected growth rate we calculate for 5 years:

			Y1	Y2	Y3	Y4	Y5
Expected Dividends	5.95	6.46	6.59	7.15	7.75
Present Value 		5.63	5.80	5.61	5.77	5.93

Expected Dividends in Y6 = $7.91

The Terminal Value of the index = $210.35 and was calculated via:
  Terminal Value of Index = Expected Dividends / (r-g)

The Present Value of this Terminal Value =  $160.79

Thus, the value of the index can be calculated to be 189.53 
(The present value of the T.V. plus the present value of the dividends from Y1 to Y5.

Therefore, we believe that the index (like most indices) is currently overvalued, by roughly 50%, in fact.

However, we don’t believe that this is a time to sell equities.  We feel that these numbers are skewed low mainly because of low interest rates and the fact that we are still in recovery-mode economically wise.  The growth of all these indices has been substantial since their lows in March, 2008, and we do not forecast a slowdown in growth in the near future.  GDP is strong, CPI is still relatively low, and US Mfg. numbers are getting stronger.  
Wish this in mind, however, we still look at this (and all sectors) as being overvalued at the moment, so we recommend caution when entering the market or expanding your portfolio.  We will update these numbers at BMSectorWatch.com on a frequent basis to see if there is indeed an upward or downward trend.",finance,1357586355

That is really my only ""valuable"" possession (beyond $1000). I currently have about $1700 saved up, and I have about $2000 in stock that was given to me at different times in my life as gifts. 

Currently I am very fortunate to have only taken out one federal student loan for this semester and the past semester. The value of the loan is $6500 at an interest rate of ~2.4% (I'm sorry, I don't know the exact value off the top of my head). My parents are also doing fairly better financially and think, but can't make any promises, that in the future I shouldn't have to take out more loans. In this regard I am very fortunate.

This summer I'll work somewhere between 2-3 months depending on when my start and end dates are and I might have to relocate, which means paying extra living expenses since I am already leasing my current apartment through the end of the summer. So I'll hopefully make between $7000-$10000.

I have thought of two scenarios to handle this money. 

**Scenario 1**

**1.** Get a credit card this summer, and use that to build my credit/get an early start to have a longer credit          history. 

**2.** Take half of the money I earn (at the very least) and invest it/save it through some sort of mechanism       (Roth IRA, CD, unfortunately I don't have access to the 401k benefits at my company as an intern) that I could     access in 5-10 years when I need to put a down payment on a car or house. 

**3.** And of the other half of the money pay my living expenses, invest in a new wardrobe, reward myself for my            work, and then whatever is left after that lump back in with #2.

**4.** After I have graduated either pay off all of my loan at once with money I have saved from my internship or     from a hypothetical signing bonus that I might receive.

**Scenario 2**

&gt; I take all or almost all of the money I earn this summer alone to pay off my student loan. 
But with this scenario I have a few questions:

* Is there even a mechanism by which I can pay off a federal student loan before I graduate?

* Which will have the greatest effect on my credit score: Paying it all off at once, before I graduate; Paying it all off at once, after I graduate, before my grace period ends; Paying it all off over time, making more than minimum payments? I understand that in the third option I'll be incurring interest charges obviously.

* If you recommend this ""early loan pay off"" scenario, where 60-90% of my income is going to go towards paying off my loan, would you recommend me not getting a credit card yet? 

Keep in mind that I'll also be working the spring semester of next year, and the fall semester following that. The summer term is 2-3 months and the semester term is 3-4 months. So sacrificing this summer's earnings is a big deal to me, but a semester later I'll be able to reenter the work force. 

**I guess my main question is this:** Which of these two scenarios do you think would benefit me more? Paying off all of my (current, hopefully only) loans and sacrificing a summer's worth of earnings, or keeping those earnings and saving them for the future and paying my loans off in a much more normal fashion?

**EDIT:** I guess I forgot to include one reason that I had been considering scenario 2. It might sound kind of paranoid, but I'm worried about the effect that the bursting of the student loan bubble would have on loan holders. I've read a little bit about it recently and it makes me nervous. I understand that comparatively, and if what my parents hope is true, with my single loan I am in a better position than other loan holders. But if handling my loan as soon as possible and then not having to worry about whether or not the possible bursting of the loan bubble will effect me is a better option than whatever the potential outcome of that may be, then I'd like to consider it.",finance,1357537776

personalfinance,Is it reasonable to pay up to or more than 50% of your take-home pay to killing non-CC debt?,"I'm holding about $30k in debt between student loans (all at 6.8%), a couple interest free personal loans and two credit cards with 0% interest. 

I've discussed before that I've got a sweet plan that will let me get debt free in less than 2 years while I keep living the college lifestyle I was used to before. The proposition of being debt free by age 26 with a great job and already with a head start on retirement investing is tantalizing. But I find that I'm actually putting more than 50% of my take-home pay into my debt. I'm putting in $2250/mo into my debt.

Is this reasonable? I don't necessarily want to spend a ton more money or upgrade my lifestyle; if anything I would contribute more to my Roth IRA (since my loans are at 6.8%, I believe I can beat that interest rate). I do want to consider buying a condo as well - the less rational part of me wants to pay less on the debt, save for a down payment and buy a condo. I've since told my less rational part that, well, that isn't really rational and the right course is to yes, pay more than half of my take-home salary into getting debt free.

personalfinance,"New family, new single income lifestyle, new loans. Gulp! Just want to bounce this off you guys...","My wife and I are starting our family with our first baby in the next few months. Our plan is to live off my income because we both feel strongly about her raising our child(ren) at home. We're aware of the sacrifices that will take and accept that. We recently got married, so I ""inherited"" her student loan debt and we also bought a reliable new family car to replace an old clunker that died. I'm not used to debt. Never had it until now, and now I'm swimming in it.

I am 31 years old and make about 57k/year. This will be our sole income. I'm due for a raise, hopefully. Monthly: +$2900. (after putting ~$400 in 401k)

My wife's student loans total about 21k across 7 loans. Between 2%-6.55% interest rates. Monthly: -$400.

We purchased a new car this year and have a 23k loan at 2.14%. Monthly: -$500.

Our townhouse is underwater. Mortgage has $145k left, house is valued at $115-120. We want to move into a single family home in the next few years. Monthly mortgage+tax: -$1100.

We are on my wife's insurance plan, but she will stop working. My work's premiums are outrageous, so I will have to find my own individual plan. Hopefully this wont be an issue. Who knows what future premiums will be, but I'm thinking for now.. Monthly: -$600.

I have 40k in savings, which I will be constantly pulling from each month to pay for all our expenses until the loans are paid off.

Here's what keeps me up at night:

1. We want to move. If we sell our house, should I expect to bring 30k to close since we're underwater? Then there's that little bit about a down payment for a new house. Are we screwed? What are our options?

2. Right now I have 40k in savings, and about 45k in debt (not counting the mortgage). While I could almost wipe out my savings and debt at the same time, it leaves very little wiggle room while I rebuild savings. Unfortunately, you can't move/buy a house with $0. So my plan is to pretty much pay the minimums for the most part. While this will end up costing about $5000 in interest over 10 years, it will leave money in our accounts to have some flexibility. Is that the right call?

3. We'll probably need another car at some point. Not looking forward to that.

I made a spreadsheet outlining the next 10 or so years with obviously rough estimates on income and spending. Trying to be conservative, I didn't account for any pay raises at all. However, it also doesn't take into account selling/buying a new house or a second car. Here is what our plummeting ""savings"" look like for the long road ahead while we pay off these loans:

2013 Year End	$33,467

2014 Year End	$24,870

2015 Year End	$16,708

2016 Year End	$10,691

personalfinance,Recent College Grad with college loans in need of guidance. The real world is scary.,"First, I want to apologize if these are questions that are frequently asked, I tried my best to look through the threads to ensure that I’m not asking the same questions that you are all accustomed to seeing, but please bear with me, as I think I need a lot of guidance.
 
I guess I should start with a little background information. I’m a recent college grad, just turned 24 with some college debt – approximately 29k right now, with interest at approximately 5-6%. I have what I consider to be a decent paying job for someone with a non-technical college degree – taking in about 1.6k every two weeks and have only started to think about saving now, unfortunately. I have about 1k in savings and 2k in checking at the moment. I currently live at home with my parents and my average credit card statement totals about $400-500 or so, but I’m trying to cut back on my spending. The primary culprits for my credit card statement are food and gas, since I have a 31 mile one way commute.
 
From what I’ve read, it seems that there are two schools of thoughts on paying back college loans – either payoff the smaller balance to stay motivated or pay off the highest interest rate loans first. I’m unable to give the exact amounts at the moment, but the loans range from 1.5k-4k. Should I continue to save up 20% into savings, place a little ($300?) into checking and put the rest into my loans or should I build up a bigger savings while making minimum payments before getting aggressive with my debt payment, and how long should I do this, if this is the best plan of attack?
And of course, I would like to save up for retirement. I’m not currently eligible for my company’s 401k, but will have the option to sign up in July. The company matches 1% of my entire salary if I defer 4% or higher. If I defer less than 4%, the company will match 1% of my deferral amount. Is this good/bad?
Vesting schedule for the 401k is
-          Less than 2 years -  0
-          2 years of employment – 20%
-          3 years of employment – 40%
-          4 years of employment – 60%
-          5 years of employment – 80%
-          6 years of employment – 100%

Can someone elaborate the vesting schedule for me? I think it means that if I work there for 2 years, I would only receive 20% of the match that the company puts in, is that correct?
Also, when I have the option of opting in to my company’s 401k that I should only defer 4% to max out the company’s match and then place the rest into a Roth? And I think I’ve read that approximately 5k is the most I can put into a Roth in a year and that ideally, I should do so at the beginning of the year to maximize returns. When should I start doing this?
If some of these questions have already been answered by, can you please direct me to where I can read up on them? I’m sure a lot of people have been in similar situations, so I apologize for the repetitive questions – I only have one life and I would like to get it on the right track before it’s too late. Thank you guys in advance!

Her car was totaled and at the time I was driving a old beat up 80's sedan with a dying transmission and almost 300K miles. She had the reliable new vehicle and now it was gone. So we were both stuck with broken legs from the accident and a crappy and extremely unreliable car.

I decided to get a new vehicle for the two of us since I was the only one that was working after the accident(She had to be laid up for a while). That way even if we had to share a car for a while we would have another reliable vehicle.

The bought the car for about $11900 But after talking them down, trade and a down payment I ended up originating the loan at $8440. At the time my credit could have been better and I ended up with a 12.74% interest rate. I took a longer loan term of 5 years so I would be able to handle my payments. I am looking at payments of $190.30 a month and I owe $7,823 as of today. I have had the loan through my credit union since the beginning of June.

Being this is the largest chunk of money I have dealt with I feel kind of overwhelmed thinking that my rushed attempt to make things normal with the ride situation that I may have screwed myself in some way and put myself in a hole that may be hard to get out of. I am trying to seek out the best option as far as either lowering what I pay in some way or (being that we are still sharing it)if I should just try to cash out and sell it once she gets into a new vehicle.

personalfinance,Can I obtain a mortgage loan against property I don't own yet but intend to buy with cash?,"Apologies if the title doesn't make much sense; I'll try to clarify.

I'm in the process of buying a condo with cash borrowed from my parents, interest-free.  They offered to loan the money while I was shopping around because cash offers are generally more attractive to sellers and I'd be able to close on the property much more quickly and then get a mortgage afterward and pay them back.  They don't have a need for the cash right this moment, but will around late Spring/Summer.


I contacted a lender I'd dealt with before, to see how quickly I'd be able to get the ball rolling and lock in a low interest rate, and to my surprise, I was informed that I have to wait a minimum of 6 months after a title change before applying.  Is this standard across the industry?  Can I apply **before** the title change (closing date is in early February) using the cash as collateral?  Are there other types of loans/credit I could consider that have low fixed interest rates?  The unit is government-owned and so I'm wary of whether I can change the offer conditions at this stage of the game.  

This isn't a ""do or die"" situation for me or my family, but I definitely want to take advantage of the current low interest rates and pay my folks back as soon as possible.

personalfinance,General Questions about my present and future finances,"I am a 27 year old male with a job that pays 45k a year. I have a 401k from my old job with 20k, through Vanguard(more on this later). I started a new 401k when I began at my new job last March. I have a non existent emergency fund or any other form of savings outside of a money market account with tdameritrade that I deposit $15 weekly into. I have about $200 dollars spread out through all of my savings. I have $5,600 in debt. 2k in one credit card, 2k in another credit card and the rest in a credit line through paypal(I know which I need to pay off first. The two credit cards have the highest interest rate around 20%). I was laid off from my old job 2 years ago. Thats when I racked up my credit debt and burned through all of my savings. Around the time I got laid off I also got into an accident(not at fault) which ended up totaling my car. I made a stupid financial move and purchased the car back from the insurance money and put the money I got from that back into the car because I loved the car and it was what I had always wanted. 


About my job. I have to buy tools. This is an odd situation because a new position opened at my job that I am almost guaranteed to get but I have to have the tools required for it before my boss moves me. It comes with a higher pay ceiling which would obviously be helpful. If I pass it up I don't know when another position would open. Now when it comes to buying tools, there are tool trucks that drive around to different shops. These trucks usually offer no interest and give you the option to make payments. They just want the tools paid off in 10 weeks at the most. I've maintained a small balance so far but I have been making $50 a week payments. This is were the problems arise. 


I hate debt and want to be out from under it as quick as possible. I want money in an emergency fund. I need a new car. I also have to buy tools. I'm going to be moving in the next 2-3 months as well. So obviously the needs come before the wants, right? A car, tools and moving expenses. A car means more debt though. Obviously I'll be buying a used car.


Where should I be focusing a majority of my money at? I will be getting my tax return back in the near future. Which problem should that be focused towards? My dad is also interested in buying my old car from me for $1,500 because he wants the high performance motor and transmission for a classic car he is building. I was planning on using both of those as a safety net for when I move, then allocate it to the appropriate problem. 


Any suggestions or guidance as to what I should be focusing on? I have started using a budget only recently.


Now onto the old 401k through vanguard. I want to roll it over into a roth IRA but am unsure of the tax implications. The rollover will be counted towards income, correct? Im not sure if this would be a smart move for me at this point since I'm trying to pay off debt and taking on more debt and I won't have extra income at the end of the year to pay towards the taxes included in the rollover. Should I leave it in the 401k? Should I spread the rollover tax hit over the next two years?",finance,1357771972

Right now, I live with my parents, so if I have any expenses right now its going out and gas money (which isn't a lot, I live about 5 minutes from where I work). I'm being taxed out of my mind being single without any dependents, so most of my paychecks are eaten up by fed and state taxes. I spend about $800 a month on going out, gas, amazon.

My goal: I'd like to invest/save up money to buy a car (~$60k) and have enough to put a pretty big down payment on a house in roughly 5 years.

What I've done so far: I'm starting to save up enough money worth for about 5 month's worth of paychecks. For me this is about $18k. My company has a 401(k) plan, and have invested up to the match point (5% of my paycheck). The plan is through Fidelity, and they've put my fund into the Freedom K Fund 2055 (made for those age 25 and below).

What I'm researching: I liked the sound of doing a CD or an Installment Savings Account (CD but instead of lump sum, monthly payments), but I noticed the interest rates with the bank I'm with aren't worth it. I researched more and found that a Roth IRA and purchasing treasury bills may be the way to go, however, I don't know how to go about starting this, and who to go through.

I'm really trying to invest for the intermediate (car / down payment), and then a little bit for retirement (&gt;30 years from now). Should I go for the Roth IRA or treasury bills? Also, should i think about moving my 401(k) around in Fidelity and not just keep it to the fund they assigned me to? How can I lower the taxes on my income?

investing,The parable of the ox,"Heard this on the radio today:

In 1906, the great statistician Francis Galton observed a competition to guess the weight of an ox at a country fair. Eight hundred people entered. Galton, being the kind of man he was, ran statistical tests on the numbers. He discovered that the average guess (1,197lb) was extremely close to the actual weight (1,198lb) of the ox. This story was told by James Surowiecki, in his entertaining book The Wisdom of Crowds.

Not many people know the events that followed. A few years later, the scales seemed to become less and less reliable. Repairs were expensive; but the fair organiser had a brilliant idea. Since attendees were so good at guessing the weight of an ox, it was unnecessary to repair the scales. The organiser would simply ask everyone to guess the weight, and take the average of their estimates.

A new problem emerged, however. Once weight-guessing competitions became the rage, some participants tried to cheat. They even sought privileged information from the farmer who had bred the ox. It was feared that if some people had an edge, others would be reluctant to enter the weight-guessing competition. With only a few entrants, you could not rely on the wisdom of the crowd. The process of weight discovery would be damaged.

Strict regulatory rules were introduced. The farmer was asked to prepare three monthly bulletins on the development of his ox. These bulletins were posted on the door of the market for everyone to read. If the farmer gave his friends any other information about the beast, that was also to be posted on the market door. Anyone who entered the competition with knowledge concerning the ox that was not available to the world at large would be expelled from the market. In this way, the integrity of the weight-guessing process would be maintained.

Professional analysts scrutinised the contents of these regulatory announcements and advised their clients on their implications. They wined and dined farmers; once the farmers were required to be careful about the information they disclosed, however, these lunches became less fruitful.

Some brighter analysts realised that understanding the nutrition and health of the ox was not that useful anyway. What mattered were the guesses of the bystanders. Since the beast was no longer being weighed, the key to success lay not in correctly assessing its weight, but rather in correctly assessing what other people would guess. Or what others would guess others would guess. And so on.

Some, such as old Farmer Buffett, claimed that the results of this process were more and more divorced from the realities of ox-rearing. He was ignored, however. True, Farmer Buffett’s beasts did appear healthy and well fed, and his finances were ever more prosperous: but, it was agreed, he was a simple countryman who did not really understand how markets work.

International bodies were established to define the rules for assessing the weight of the ox. There were two competing standards – generally accepted ox-weighing principles and international ox-weighing standards. However, both agreed on one fundamental principle, which followed from the need to eliminate the role of subjective assessment by any individual. The weight of the ox was officially defined as the average of everyone’s guesses.

One difficulty was that sometimes there were few, or even no, guesses of the oxen’s weight. But that problem was soon overcome. Mathematicians from the University of Chicago developed models from which it was possible to estimate what, if there had actually been many guesses as to the weight of the animal, the average of these guesses would have been. No knowledge of animal husbandry was required, only a powerful computer.

By this time, there was a large industry of professional weight guessers, organisers of weight- guessing competitions and advisers helping people to refine their guesses. Some people suggested that it might be cheaper to repair the scales, but they were derided: why go back to relying on the judgement of a single auctioneer when you could benefit from the aggregated wisdom of so many clever people?

And then the ox died. Among all this activity, no one had remembered to feed it.",finance,1357763453

I want to buy a car because where I live (Orange County) public transport is terrible. 

I recently graduated with my Master's and started working only in August 2012. Started using credit card only in July 2012. So I have a very short credit history. 

But I pay all my bills on time. A lot of the times I have negative balance (paying more than minimum due). My credit limit is $2k. My last credit score was 709.

My annual income is decent, $75k before taxes. 

I am 24 years old, unmarried. 

So because of all these reasons, my own bank (Bank of America) denied me a loan. Most other banks did the same. Credit Unions require a six-month membership. Carmax said they would give me a 6.4% interest rate, and all other dealers candidly said they couldn't beat that.

personalfinance,Did you recently get a new checking or savings account with a reward bonus? or great interest rate with no minimum?,"Hello! Hopefully this is an okay place to post this.

Currently I have one checking account and am looking to open 1-3 accounts for 'savings'. BF &amp; I plan to open a joint Chase checking account - you get $125 for opening one and having direct deposit set up, we plan to do that equally with our money to reach their minimum.

But I want 1-2 other accounts for my small savings. It will be small amounts, $60-$200 a month saved for car insurance and other extra. I don't think a savings account with interest is worth it since it will be small amounts, and then will be withdrawn (so I don't want any minimum limits). I rarely go to banks in person so I don't care if its online only. Also I am in IL if anyone knows of any good credit unions.

I currently have Charter One for my main account and get no benefits, but honestly the headache of switching all of my automatic payments and online accounts with my debit card saved, isn't worth switching over my active account anywhere.

So I'm just looking for something that would be ok with a minimum deposit of $60/per month.

I'm going to leave how much money I make currently out of this, as I want to see how much money you guys think I'll need without the bias of my current income.


I am planning on moving to a big city and renting an apartment with a friend. Rent will be about 500$. We'll put it at 700$ to be safe. 

Right now I don't have a car. I was approved for two credit cards, and I'm going to be using them to help build credit. I need to buy a car in the next 6 months and have some money saved up. 

I want to know a couple things that I can't find online. Do dealerships finance used cars that are 3~5K? I'd be willing to have a high down payment and a higher interest rate than usual just to have more money on hand for moving. (within reason, of course) I don't have any credit at the moment, so this is probably the only option for buying a car. Let's assume I don't have a co-signer.

What is the bare minimum (while still having a buffer zone to save) I will need to save in the next 6 months?

I'm thinking 6 months expenses. (aiming rather high on this just to be safe)

So:

* 700 rent
* 150 food
* 200 insurance for car(i don't know what kind of rates apply to me, I'm young and male so I assume high)
* 150 for car(again, I have no clue what the car payments would be, but I'm gonna play it safe and say high)
* 50 cell phone
* 100 gas (don't expect to be driving much)

Then, to account for other expenses (toilet paper, internet, beer, etc) I'm going to add 30%.

This adds up to 1755$. We'll round it to 1800.

So, would 10.8K be a good amount to save? What about the car, how would that factor into this?

What's the least amount of money I could spend to get a car that runs reliably?

Really, I'm just looking for some opinions on the prices to see if I'm being naive or missing something. I'm young, and I know there's a lot of things I don't know (evident by my lack of knowledge about buying cars), so any help would be appreciated.",finance,1357694379

investing,USA's first crowdsourced promotional crew [invest in a first of its kind],"Hello r/investing,

Been following this subreddit for a bit, I wanted to try and shake things up and share an investment idea - which seems to fall under the sidebar rules - so here it goes:


**What is this crowdsourced promotional crew you speak of?**
[Crowd Control](http://crowdcontrol.co) is based in Denver, Colorado and is a electronic music promotional crew built on the principles of crowdfunding.  **[This infographic](http://i.imgur.com/DrnEY.jpg)** explains the basic structure of Crowd Control and how it works.  Crowdsourcing changes the rules of the game by taking away the normal investment risk of the promoter and putting it into the hands of the fans.  Our first Crowd Control show date is set for February 22nd and the site &amp; first show will be announced February 1st.

**Sounds like a good idea, why are you here then?**
Because it **is** a good idea though we are currently hampered here in Denver by the same issue that plagues most promoters; lack of venue.  One of the big strengths of crowdsourcing is you can put together a very high volume of shows with little-to-no risk because the show has paid for itself weeks before it has even happened.  If you announce 40 shows and only get half of them fully funded, that's still 20 fully-paid for shows in the books and you'll collect even more on door, drinks, merch, etc.  

However, in order to do this one must have a venue that is ok with booking forty potential dates ~2 months in advance knowing that the show may or may not happen.  As any promoter will tell you, getting more than 1-2 dates at a time from a decent venue is tough and most are too busy and overwhelmed with other promoters to give away the high volume of dates needed to really let Crowd Control boom.  

**This is where you come in**
In order to make Crowd Control blow up, a venue dedicated to throwing crowdsourced shows is necessary; a Crowd Control HQ if you will.  Fortunately, I'm a resourceful guy who's been in this industry a long time so the investment I ask for is reasonable: $5000 with a fair interest rate attached.  This pays first month's rent, security deposit, and a lil on top to cover all other bases for a properly zoned warehouse event space in Denver's RiNo neighborhood.  

**Why should I do this?? This isn't a stock at all!!**
Because the idea is novel, attractive and it simply makes sense that it would work.  We're also talking about the Denver nightlife scene, which is already large and profitable and only set to grow as Denver's population continues to climb while tourism is expected to increase because we're Amsterdenv now and our own ""airport city"" is looming on the horizon.  For the investment pioneers out there, this is a chance to help fund and be attached to something cool with a very high ceiling for success (you can already see on the cc website how simple it is to expand to other cities).  

As for my credentials, I am the founder and manager of the US-based web radio station http://rwd.fm and was booking manager for Step Nightclub in Denver from it's opening in Feb 2012 until I left in late May; the nightclub closed end of June.  I've been a Dj for six years, taught two semesters of ""Introduction to Turntablism"" during my senior year at Oberlin college, and I continue to organize, promote, and dj shows around Denver on the regular with some out-of-state gigs mixed in as well.  I also started /r/aves if that resonates here lol.

personalfinance,Put My Emergency Fund Towards Car Loan?,"I've got ~$3,500 left on my car loan.  

The interest rate is rather high since I was young and stupid and had to have a nice car.  

My payment is $273/month.

I have about $750/month spare.

I also have ~ $1,500 in an emergency fund.

My question is, should I use the emergency fund to chop the car loan
down, so that I can pay it off more quickly, or should I just take a chunk out of my remaining $750/month and make larger payments on my car loan every month?  

I could comfortably afford to make $450-$550 payments on my car rather than $273.

It's very tempting to put $1,500 toward the loan, and make big payments on the car so I have that extra $273/month eventually, because then I know I'd have an $1,023 left over each month after paying my bills, and with that money I'd pretty quickly be able to establish a nice sized emergency fund.

personalfinance,What is the smartest way to stay liquid?,"I work as a defense contractor in Afghanistan. Right now, I'm making 11k-16k per month after taxes depending on if it is a 2 or 3 pay-period month. This might sound like an absurd amount of money, but it really isn't. I'll get into that shortly.

My expenses are very small. I pay $200 per month for a storage unit to keep all of my stuff in, since continuing to pay rent in America would have been extremely pointless. My car is paid for, so between insurance, cell phone, and storage I pay roughly $400 per month for everything. 

Now for where my money goes: 
In 2012, I contributed $16,500 to my 401k. My company matches 6%.

I put $5,000 into my Roth IRA for 2012. (I posted on here last week about being worried about having too high of an AGI to contribute anything, but the Foreign Earned Income exclusion saved me for 2012. I will without a doubt make too much in 2013 even with the exclusion.)

I use 2 banks in addition to Vanguard...
Bank 1: $34,000 in a MMA which rises by $5,000 per month with .05%(this is going to be my ""I don't know what the hell to do now"" account, which will be explained shortly). $8500 in a checking account which is used for buying comfort items here, as well as being my ""fun"" money for when I am at home from time to time. I also have my one and only credit card at this bank, which has a $17500 limit, and a zero balance.

Bank 2: $12,000 in an ordinary savings account earning next to nothing in interest, which rises by $4,000 per month. The money in this account is going to be used to offset the cost of buying and furnishing a house. As a veteran, I qualify for a VA home loan so I am not overly concerned with a down payment, but I'll have the money available just in case. $5,000 in a checking account that my bills are paid directly out of, and I will consider my emergency account down the road. This is also where my $5,000 Roth IRA is.

I have another Roth IRA with about $6,000 in it with another institution that I forgot about until recently.

All of my investments are with Vanguard. My 401k has $66,000 in it and I intend on contributing $17,500 in 2013. I have 2 mutual funds, totaling $6,000 that I contribute the leftovers of my pay into,  as well as $3,000 in stocks that I do not pay a whole lot of attention to. 

Now you might be wondering why I don't think 11k per month is a lot of money, and why I am putting so much into that MMA... When this war dies down, I have basically no marketable skills in the 'real world' . The market will be flooded with tens of thousands of unemployed contractors (something most people don't seem to realize) all competing for the same jobs. I hope it does not come to this, but I am planning on being unemployed for quite some time after 2014. I do have a BS (paid in full by the GI Bill) and I am taking some online classes towards a Masters (also paid in full by the GI Bill). I am hoping that armed with a Masters and 15 years of experience (in a very specific skill-set) I will be able to find some sort of government work, but that is sort of besides the point right now.

All of that being said, I think I more or less have my bases covered for the not too distant future. A large savings to get me through an unemployment period, money put aside for when a house becomes an option, zero debt, and the formation of an emergency fund. 

Keeping in mind that my main priority is short-term stability with my money, should I look into a different strategy? I don't want to go through the hassle of changing banks to get a higher interest rate which realistically is going to be like an extra $10 per month.

TL/DR: I make a ton of money right now, but don't expect to in the next 2 years. Best ways to keep this money safe?

economy,Why the Trillion Dollar Coin is the Perfect Response to Manufactured Austerity and Fractional Reserve Accounting,"The US Treasury generally creates bonds on its citizens and sells them to a central bank in return for debt.  This debt must be paid back, but there is only ever enough money to pay back the interest.  This causes larger and larger loans to be taken out.

This process started in 1913.  It kicked off a planned process to make all Americans homeless.  The process used is inflation.  Here's how it works, or worked.

Started back in 1913, with an inflation rate of about 7%.  This rate causes the money supply to double every ten years, and it hasn't changed.  That's M1, and 1923 is M2, and 1933 is M3.  Well, in M1 a house cost $1,000; in M2 the house cost $2,000, M3 the house cost $4,000, and M10 (2003) it cost $512,000.  In M1 tax as 0.00%; in M2 tax is 0.05%, M3 tax is 0.10%, M8 (1983) it is 33%, M9 (1993) it needs to 64%, and  M10 (2003) it needs to be 124%.  Bread goes from being $0.01 in M1 to $5.12 in M10.  The value of the dollar goes from $1 in M1 to $0.001 in M10.  [More here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUyWmmWtcFM).

So, they can't tax near 100%, so you see right as that point in time, all sorts of weird things happen.  New taxes on everything, bond trading offices get attacked, stock market bubbles show up, and then in 2008 the system collapses.  In 2008, all the US banks fail, along with most of the other banks in the world.

The banks calculated how long it would take before they would own all the property, and they did it.

They now believe they have global government.

Now, we can see nations being taken over.  True global government is here.  You can see a [confrontation of the man that says he's the ruler of Europe](http://youtu.be/j9ZE1n001wc?t=12s), and the [result of that](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/8173447/Nigel-Farage-plane-crash-pilot-charged-with-threatening-to-kill-Ukip-leader.html).

The US was given more time before austerity sets in.  That time was until the elections, and it has passed.  We got the first set of tax increases.

On top of that, our cities are being dismantled.  Power plants are being removed under the guise of green, while infrastructure is being sold.  There's [more on that here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GykzQWlXJs) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/UNAgenda21).

So, along comes the trillion dollar coin.  It's a way that the US treasury can create a notes.  It has about the same intrinsic value as a trilion dollars of reserve notes.  But, whats different?  The difference is, it's created by the US government, and it doesn't have to be paid back.  That's a huge difference!

Minting this coin, or even a larger one, to pay our debt, is symbolic of a larger issue.

According to Article 1, section 8 of the US Constitution, only congress has the power to manufacture and regulate the value of the money.  By minting this coin, the Congress would be taking this power back from the FED.  The FED would not get to collect interest on the money, and nor would congress.  The people would benefit from their wealth by lower taxes, etc.

When it comes to austerity or freedom, choose the freedom.  Lets pay the FED back with something that has the same value of the magical money create from thin-air.  Lets stop paying interest to the FED.",finance,1357802282

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Questions,"I had a few questions regarding the pay back of student loans.  I am lucky enough after a few tough months to be in a position to easily handle the minimum payment and could easily pay them off in the 10 year span if necessary.  I would like to pay them off sooner if at all possible.  I have loans through SallieMae, and AES which are private as well as 3 Fed Stafford loans.  When I look at options to pay more than my standard payment, it specifically states:
""Yes, you can pay more than the amount you owe. Any interest or fees that have accrued on your loans will be paid first before reducing your principal balance. ""

I think that is crap, is there anything I can do to simplify my loans over a shorter period of time, where I won't be penalized for paying more than the required amount, meaning direct to principle?",finance,1357799900

gaming,Would anybody be willing to participate in our game,"With the turn of the calendar and PAX East just around the corner, I'd like to introduce The Traveling Hat Traders.

This is the brain child of my friends. The general idea is to trade off any hats you own for a new to you hat. We will be out and about the convention halls all weekend long. Everyone is encouraged to trade. Any TF2 cosplayers are NOT part of this game unless they choose to participate.

HATS:
-All hats MUST be in a wearable, clean condition.
-A minimum of three hats have to be up for trade. This number does not count the BASE hat.
BASE Hat: This is the hat touching you head. Everyone MUST have a base hat that is not up for trade ever. We need to establish a layer between your head and the tradable hats. It can be a bandana/head wrap/do-rag.
-Hats should be worn piled on the head on top of the BASE hat. Hats can also be attached to a backpack or bag as long as they stay visible.

TRADING:
-All hats, except the BASE hat, are fair game to the other trader. You can not specify which hat the other trader may or may not have. If you don't want to trade a certain hat, don't wear it.
-Every hat is a 1 for 1 trade.

What is a hat?
-Baseball Cap, Knit, Helmet, Shower Cap, Habit, Beanie, Fedora, Lamp Shade, Paper Hat, Beret, Flat Cap, Bowler, Sombrero, Bucket Hat, Straw hat, Coonskin, Tam, Top Hat, Fez, Turban.
If it ends in “hat or cap”, it can be used.

Not considered a hat:
-Bandana/Head Wrap/Do-rag, Masks, Headbands, Visors, Wigs

How will some recognize us?
If the piles of hats don't give you a clue, we plan on large buttons with the above logo.

I am about to begin a new position that will take my salary from 52k to 82k. I haven't been financially irresponsible in the past, but I wouldn't say I manage my money well. I could really use some tips about how I can get the most out of this pay increase and start down the path of financial security. 

More info:  

I am a 29 year old female, unmarried but living in a house with my boyfriend that we purchased together this year (mortgage = $1168.00/mo). We have a joint checking and saving account for bills but also separate accounts that are our own. 

I have ~$85,000 in student loan debt, $45,000 of which is being paid off through a research grant program over the course of the next two years (I cannot put into words how grateful I am for this). I have the option to renew this grant and could potentially have the rest of the loans paid off by 2016. 

My other larger debts aside from the usual bills include a car payment (~$400/month) and my credit card balance fluctuates between $2k and $4k depending on the time of year/travel I'm doing/holidays, etc. I have about $1800 on a furniture store credit card that is 0% interest for a few more years. 

I put $5000 into a Roth IRA about 5 years ago. I have a life insurance policy in addition to the one that my work offers. 

Here's the thing:  I have absolutely ZERO savings. No emergency fund. I rely on my credit card for that ($7000 credit limit; 7.15% interest) but sometimes it is close to being maxed out. I make enough to pay the bills and then some, but I obviously waste a good bit of money since I cannot manage to save anything.

I'd like to get married and start a family soon and I hope that I can use my pay increase to put me in a more financially stable and comfortable position. Thanks for any advice or tips anyone can offer! 

EDIT: Thanks to every single person that chimed in. Although for a brief moment I felt like an 8-year-old little girl being chastised by her parents, this is precisely why I posted here. I need a blunt and honest wake up call. My father has no debt in the entire world and manages his money well (that he makes by being an evangelical Jew for Jesus in Israel might I add, but that is a story for another day), while my mom and stepdad make a great deal of money but live too high on the hog and will most likely die in debt. I am realizing that I am repeating many of my mom's mistakes and picking up her spending habits and I want to change. 

The marriage thing:  While I too would probably think buying a house with someone to whom you are not married is risky, every situation is unique. My bf is a veteran and receives compensation from the VA every month - enough to pay our mortgage and half of the bills - for the rest of his life. He will be done with school this summer and we will likely get married soon after, but this is not something I am going to try to force or push just to be married a few months earlier. Plus, the times they are a-changing folks (not saying for better or worse, just that they are). We didn't want to throw away any more money on rent when we knew we were going to get married and buy a home in the near future. Our home interest rate is 3.75%. If we waited a few more years until we got married, I'm sure it would climb a bit higher. It was the right decision for us.

I'm 25 years old and have a decent paying job with high potential for growth and a sizable savings account - my biggest hurdle right now is a huge student loan debt with a high interest rate. 

Her advice is to take out a personal life insurance policy as a private reserve strategy. According to her, by taking advantage of the MEC I will enjoy tax deferred growth, tax free distribution, competitive returns, high contributions, collateral opportunities, no loss provisions, guaranteed loan options,  unstructured loan payments, liquidity, use and control. 

Basically I would use it as a personal bank over time and take liens against it to purchase a home, pay off my loans, etc. Sounds great right? Only problem is everything else I have found says this is bad advice if I ever plan to use the money before I die. I'm looking for a second opinion...any thoughts on this? Any alternative ideas to start growing my wealth?

She has also advised me to pay the minimum amount on my student loans for as long as I can. This is hard to do because my interest exceeds my payments right now and my principal is growing by about $700/month. Feeling pretty uncertain and any advice would help.  Thanks!

tl; dr: Is using a permanent life insurance policy as a long-term personal investment strategy a good idea for a recent college graduate?

edit: The reason I am considering making lower payments on my student loans is the public servant loan forgiveness program. However, I may not stay in this field for the full 10 years so I'm not sure I want to bank on it. Per yobria's advice, here are my personal details:

$60,000 annual income (10% raise each year)

403b w/ 50% employer matching up to 6% (""2050 retirement fund"" with a 0.78% expense ratio - no roth option currently and I have not opened one yet.)

$22,000 in savings

$2,500 invested in mutual funds

$2,000 = avg. monthly expenses

personalfinance,Facing hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans - do I get out now?,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I apologize in advance if this seems like a redundant post topic and for the great length of the post, but I have not seen any posts with debt as high as what I am looking at. I am way in over my head, financially. I am attending American University in Washington, D.C as a first year student, although this is my first semester. I have 35 credits so far which is helping speed up the process of graduating, but I am still looking at 4-5 years of school in order to graduate with my undergrad/master's through an accelerated master's program. I am majoring in International Affairs if that matters. 

I spoke with the Financial Aid office yesterday and here are my numbers for **one** semester:

Room/board - $4,663

Tuition - $19,491

Other fees - $258.50

-$5,445 in subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans

Total Cost - $20,682.50

I received no aid from my FASFA other than the loans. My parents make ~$109,000 annually and they have around $35,000 saved up for me (I know, they are extremely generous and I am very lucky to have this). However, I am still looking at around $41,241 every year. Assuming I attend for five years, that is ~$192,000 in debt. I am sure they will help with what they can, but I would hate to be a burden. That number does not take into account any scholarships I may win (trust me, I am applying) but I feel like all of the scholarships I get will be a drop in the bucket. I am also applying to a couple jobs on campus that pay $9/hour which is decent, I think.

The reason I chose AU was because of their great internship program and career placement. I feel conservatively confident that I can get a decent job coming out of the school but I don't know if it is worth that much debt. Should I transfer? Stay here? Any advice on where I should get my loans?

I apologize again for the length of this post and sporadic points but I almost feel like I made the wrong decision coming to AU no matter how good of a school it is. I really appreciate any help/advice anybody has to offer. Thank you so much in advance.",finance,1357926008

I was looking into opening an IRA with my local credit union, because they have very reasonable fees, but the apy and the dividend rate (yes, I have googled, and they don't really make much sense) are only .1% for an account under $10,000. Does that seem kind of low? I was looking at a financial calculator and it seemed to expect an interest rate of 10% a year. Aren't apy and an interest rate the same? 

Could I perhaps get a better deal with a company like Fidelity or something? Or should I just wait until I have a stable job that comes with an IRA already? (That's looking like it's going to be way off in the future, and I've had a bunch of people tell me I should start sooner instead of later.) Also, if I started an IRA that wasn't through my workplace, could I possibly add it to an employer IRA in the future? (Consolidate, maybe? Hell Idk if that even exists.)

personalfinance,"Can we create a ""Student Loans: Plans of Attack and Best Practices"" guide?","Looking around /r/personalfinance you see a lot of posts about student loan debt. Stories about paid-off loans, tricky loan companies, and overwhelming principles are all in ready supply.

What I have yet to see, however, is a comprehensive guide covering the resources and strategies available to people seeking to address student debt. 

We all know that high-interest loans should be paid down first, but beyond that I think many of us are clueless (myself included for the most part). What other tactics and strategies exist for paying down student loans? What resources are out there for determining the optimal amount that should be paid on a monthly basis. 

Ideally, I'd like to compile a side-bar quality guide to this process. In lieu of that, simply listing resources in this thread would suffice. Hopefully it will be helpful for me and my many loan-battling comrades. 

**Edit for clarification:** What I'm proposing isn't laying out an ABC plan that applies to everyone, but rather collecting all of the resources, commonly applicable plans, etc. in one place as a pick-and-choose/awareness raising tool box for people paying down student loans. 

**Examples of helpful student loan resources:**

* [Income based Repayment](http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-based)

* A guide on how to break down and pay individual sub-loans on Nelnet. (Which I'd love to create right now, but I'm at work)

We create iPhone games. 

At the moment, I have about 110k in my company checking account (BOA). My CPA is crap, not very proactive. I'm ditching him soon. He did suggest one useful thing which I am doing now, which is to switch to being taxed as an S-Corp. Seems I'll get some tax savings but looks like I'll still be paying over 25k to taxes this year!

Anyhow, a portion of this 110k will be used to pay contractors on my next game but I'm making money at a rate that's higher than my burn, monthly, so I expect the bank account to stay fairly stable. I need to figure out what's the best way to take advantage of having this money. I assume keeping it in a dumb checking account is not the best idea.

 - I'm completely naive on real estate and land ownership. I also may move around with my fiance and don't want to be tied down to one location.

 - I have a car worth ~5k and it's fully paid off
 - I have no credit card bills or anything like that.
 - I rent an apartment at $600/mo
 - I have a ""Traditional IRA"" with ING Direct that I rolled over from an old industry job that has ~4k in it. I know nothing about it and am an IRA newbie.

Just a few notes:

1. I've already lowered a lot of my expenses because I'm splitting it with my mom (Cable/Internet is $60 and Cell phone is $90). I've called and negotiated to the smallest amounts possible.

2. I know what you're all thinking to yourself - why am I putting so little money into my credit card debt at such a low rate and putting so much into my student loans?

At $500/month, I'll only be paying about $320 in interest over 9 months. In the long run, it's not a big deal to me. My federal loans are calculated on a daily interest, so I'd rather have my student loans gone or at least below $10k.

3. My boyfriend and I live in the Bay Area, and if I continue to live at home and we both are saving at the rate that we are right now, combined with CDs, gifts from parents, etc., we can probably get to about $127,000 in 4 years. He's an accountant at a startup, so he's expected to go on an accelerated career path. We are hoping to get married and buy a condo in the next 5-10 years, so depending on where we are in our careers this can be a lot of savings. 

4. $275 is probably plenty of money for me - I don't go out that much, I get all my meals paid for at my work (also a startup), my mom pays most of our expenses, and my boyfriend and I usually split everything 50/50 most of the time. 

Please let me know if there's anything I should adjust or what you think. 

Thanks!

personalfinance,Retirement planning via corporate owned incentive life insurance - what are the risks/drawbacks?,"I've seen this advertised as a retirement vehicle for high-earning professionals (CEOs, lawyers, etc).  The basic premise is to set the death benefit to be the smallest allowable by law to still count as a life insurance policy.  The premiums are distributed into investment vehicles and grow tax free.  At any point, one can choose to start distributions from the accumulated funds.  Distributions up to the original principal are tax-free (you're getting your money back), and then to avoid income taxes on the earnings, the rest of your funds are ""loaned"" to you at some interest rate, until the minimum amount of money is left to maintain the death benefit (and thereby the integrity of the life insurance policy).

On top of this, there are all sorts of little bonuses - the policy can be liquidated at any point with no fees (other than income taxes on earnings), there are market-hedging options and guaranteed (small) interest rates, etc.

It almost sounds too good to be true - that may be why it's essentially restricted to ""rich people"".  But what are the negatives?

We are current on this loan, paid ahead actually.  Apparently my wife also had a savings account with federal family credit union with a balance of $50 and great lakes merged with them.  Recently we have been getting statements from Great Lakes/FFCU for the savings account portion of the account(not the loan portion) and we noticed that we have been getting dinged with low balance fees, and account inactivity fees.  no problem, we don't use the account anyway, so we figure we will just close it.  when my wife calls to close it they say that they are unable to close her account due to the fact that the loan and savings accounts are ""linked"".

I'm 27 and currently have money saved, 401k with my employer and a Roth IRA with Bank of America. My question is for my Roth IRA. It's been sitting there, not really earning much. I want to maximize my earnings for my Roth. Should I transfer it to another institution? I have tried to transfer it to my federal credit union, however, I was informed that there would be fees involved. A few months later, I still have not done anything with my Roth. How do I go about maximizing the earning potential of my IRA?

personalfinance,Filing quarterly taxes - worried I'm getting screwed...,"Regular on r/pf, throwaway due to lots of financial information.

For the past few years, my taxes have been a bit weird/different and I've had my parent's accountant help me file my taxes.  She's given me advice that I've found to be wrong before, and the most recent numbers that she's given me I think are way off.

I had some stock options that cashed out last year that were a significant sum.  I had no investments prior to that, and thus have no real good sense of how quarterly taxes should work before this big windfall.  I think I'm paying way too much, and she isn't taking into account what else I'm paying in taxes when telling me how much I should pay.  She likes to pay an estimated amount for the whole year in January, so I don't have to file quarterly (which I'm fine with, if her guesses are relatively close to actual, which they haven't been in the past).

Here's all the info:

Dec 2011 - first disbursment of options = $92,069.81
Jan 2012 - paid $14,000 in taxes for 4th quarter 2011 ($9K fed, $5K state)
April 2012 - paid $1286 in fed taxes for potential cap gains 2012
Dec 2012 - 2nd disbursment = $6,797.61
Jan 2013 - recommended I pay $500 in fed, $200 in state

In 2012, earned $3.04 in interest, $54.33 in long term cap gains, and $1529.70 in dividends in my investment account (all taxable).

I earned ~$30K in 2012 (only worked half the year, was grad student before) and paid $5K in Fed taxes, $1,500 in State.

I know there's probably some important details I'm leaving out, but I feel like I should be getting a federal refund for this year, so I'm confused about why I'm paying more cap gains when I'm still owed from what I paid last year as estimated.

Claiming fiscaal verrekenbare tegoeden
Naast het verzorgen te beweren alle fiscale aftrek die u kunt, kunt u uw inkomen fiscale factuur minimaliseren door te beweren dat alle belastingkredieten voor u beschikbaar.
Wanneer ze beschikbaar zijn, zijn fiscaal verrekenbare tegoeden over het algemeen beter voor u dan inhoudingen zijn zou, omdat credits rechtstreeks van uw fiscale factuur afgetrokken zijn. Inhoudingen, in tegenstelling, zijn afgetrokken van het inkomen waarop uw belastingaanslag is gebaseerd.
Dus, een dollar waarde van belastingkrediet vermindert uw fiscale factuur door een dollar, maar een dollar waard van de aftrek verlaagt uw fiscale factuur door 35 cent als je in een beugel 35 procent door 30 cent als je in een 30 procent beugel, enz. In gevallen waarin u een keuze tussen beweren een creditcard of een bedrag voor een bepaalde kosten hebben, bent je over het algemeen beter af beweren het krediet.
Zo prachtig als fiscaal verrekenbare tegoeden kunnen worden, met de IRS (zoals je waarschijnlijk hebt bedacht door nu) er is bijna altijd een vangst. In dit geval, is de vangst dat fiscaal verrekenbare tegoeden alleen beschikbaar voor bepaalde zeer beperkte situaties zijn. Velen van hen gelden alleen voor bepaalde bedrijfstakken (zoals restaurants en bars, of producenten van energie). En credits komen met een aantal zeer ingewikkelde regels, die u (of, meer waarschijnlijk, uw fiscale pro) volgen moet om te beweren ze.
•Types van krediet beschikbaar — meeste Federale belastingvoordelen die momenteel beschikbaar is voor kleine bedrijven zijn zeer eng gericht om aan te moedigen u te nemen van bepaalde acties die wetgevers hebben geacht wenselijk (in het algemeen aan voordeel kansarmen/laag-inkomen personen of het milieu). Er zijn ook een paar kredieten ter voorkoming van dubbele belasting, en een paar ter bevordering van bepaalde soorten investeringen die als sociaal gunstig worden beschouwd.
•Claiming kredieten — de formulieren en procedures gebruikt om te berekenen en beweren bedrijf fiscaal verrekenbare tegoeden zijn vrij ingewikkeld.

Therefore, I am looking to open my first credit card.

What kind of card should I get? From what I hear, I should get one with no annual fee and low limit; the interest rate shouldn't factor as I plan on not carrying a balance and since I won't be using it a lot, the rewards won't really factor into it.

I had to pick and choose which debts to pay monthly, etc and I didn't meet my obligations on that one.  I'm hoping someone can help explain to me why my canada student loan is showing as ""paid as agreed"" and the status is I1. From what I read online, this is normal procedure when it's moved to the Fed. Of course it shows the 120 days past due, but other than the late payments, there are no derogatory remarks. In the comments it shows ""transferred or sold"" on my credit report.

Everything else is fine on my credit report. I did fall behind on my Visa (balance 3k, limit 4k), but as part of my rehabilitation agreement with them, they removed all late payments and are now reporting it as R1 ( up from R6 they said). I also have 1 LOC with my old bank of 4k (limit of 5k).

Also, my new bank holds my car loan which I never missed a payment on. Balance is 19k from a total loan of 33k.

I guess my question is this.. I want to consolidate the Visa and LOC away from the lenders who currently hold them and move to my current banking institution (who hold my car loan), but my concern right now is the effect of the student loan!

I'm thinking about switching my graduate school loans over from a graduated 10-year plan to IBR.
I have $40k in Subsidized Stafford Loans, $40k in Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and $11k in Graduate PLUS Loans. I'm about 2 years in on paying these off, currently at ~$800/mo on a 50k salary. I think I can kill 2 birds with one stone here by taking the 3-years interest forgiveness benefit from IBR as well as being able to target the PLUS loan (higher interest rate) with the extra payments that I'll be making. IBR will require ~ $400/mo payments and I think I can budget to pay an additional $500-$600/mo, bringing my total monthly payment to $900-$1000. 

Has anyone else done this? This is really far from my field of expertise and I worry that there's some big flaw in this logic that I'm missing.

I have lost my source of income for the past 2 years and have been looking for work unsuccessfully.

This of course got me nowhere, but I always stayed hopeful that I would keep things afloat until I got steady work again.  About a year ago I just stopped paying; the interest rates were crushing me and the stress of making all the deadlines vs. eating was just too much.

I owe money to about 5 different accounts.  The amounts vary from $1.5k to $2.5K on four of those accounts, the fifth was the largest by far at $11k.  Most of these cards initial payments were a lot less, but late fees and high interest just kept them flat or worst, increasing.

I got a call from a collection agency who is trying to tackle the largest account at $11k.  I explained my situation and they offered me a settlement deal of $6k.  I really want to do the right thing and settle my debts, it's just very difficult for me to do so at this time.  They seemed a bit pushy to take the deal and 'call friends and family to find the money' and gave me a few days to think about it.  I'm supposed to call back in a few days.

I have no assets, no wages to garner and no benefits that I'm collecting from.  Do I have any room to negotiate this further?  Should I take the deal and really scrounge around for the money?  Not sure what's really the best move to make at this point.

I want to do the right thing and if by some chance had steady work come through I would have no issues budgeting...My problem is simply lack of cashflow.  I would love to get back on my feet and take the right steps to fixing my credit.  According to them, my credit history was excellent and that it's currently 'not bad and correctable if I take the proper steps now.'

My two largest ones are federal loans (used to be Direct Loans, now Mohela).  One of which has already been consolidated from several small federal loans, but there is still a large amount on the other.  I am not able to consolidate them through the federal service because one of the two is under my dad's information (specifically, they told me if the loans are under two different SS#'s then they were not able to be consolidated).  On top of that I have a Sallie Mae loan and a couple other small loans through local programs.  Ideally I would like to have the Sallie Mae and my two federal loans consolidated, or at least the two federal loans.  One of my federal loans is in deferment, which is a terrible idea I know, but I can't get the monthly rate lowered because it won't take my other loans into consideration when calculating a monthly payment amount.  My goal would be to have one monthly payment for the three loans at a reasonable interest rate.  Is this possible, and if so what would be the best way to go about doing this?  I would greatly appreciate any advice.

ast forward to now, i've got a pretty good grasp on the bills and spending. 

in the past everyone told me i couldn't refinance due to being underwater. i'm not sure if things have changed now.

my home purchased brand new and had two mortgages since day one.

first loan:

Loan type:30 Years Conventional

Current rate:5.875%

Current principal balance:$280,000

Remaining term:23 years, 10 months

about $2090/month

second loan:

Loan type:Conv 2nd Adj Rate Mtge

Current rate:1.000%

Current principal balance:$36,000

Remaining term: 39 years, 1 months

about $100/month

i do all of my banking and mortgage stuff through bank of america. i have my checking,savings,car loan, and mortgage with them. they offered some assistance after the divorce through some hardship program, which lowered my interest rates down to the numbers i've listed above. i think my initial interest rate for the first loan was 6% and the second loan was at around 8%(according to the agreement, this interest rate is going to increase incrementally over the years). during this bank of america hardship assistance program, they pretty much KILLED my credit to about 640. during the program duration, they decreased my monthly mortgage to about $2080 from 2140, which wasn't much help. but essentially reported that i had paid the mortgage but a decreased amount, and thus my credit score dropped. THAT part i didn't know about. the $60 differential isn't a lot, and it definitely wasn't worth me taking a hit on my credit score. 

i get a lot of mail and emails regarding lending firms that want to help me, but not all of them seem legit so i'm really confused on who is really able to help me or not. i've been doing fine with my payments of both loans. i just figured there has to be a better way. 

my overall goal is just lower my monthly mortgage so i can put more to savings. ideally, i'd like to get my mortgage low enough so i can pay extra to it AND put some to savings each month. ie if my mortgage was $1200, i'd pay $1500(with 300 going to principal) and then i would be able to put $500 into savings.

De meeste dividenden op gewone aandelen zijn “in aanmerking komende”, en dus, komen in aanmerking voor een lagere belasting ratethan “gewone inkomsten,” die uit dingen zoals salarissen en lonen, rente-inkomsten, huurinkomsten en dergelijke bestaat. Ook is een meerwaarde die in aanmerking als een “op lange termijn” meerwaarde ook komt in aanmerking komen voor deze lagere belastingdruk. Zoals besproken in een recent artikel op amtblog.com, hoewel het BTW-percentage op dividenden en meerwaarden hetzelfde voor zowel de regelmatige belasting en de AMT is, kan het effect op een belastingbetaler vrijstelling bedrag betekenen dat deze items van beleggingsopbrengsten zijn de reden die een belastingbetaler de AMT. betaalt

Plannen van strategie-gebruik een model zoals die beschikbaar zijn op AMTIndividual.com om te bepalen van het reële belastingtarief wordt betaald op dividenden en meerwaarden. Voor maximale rendement, moeten beleggers altijd na belastingen opbrengst overwegen bij de beoordeling van investeringen alternatieven.

Belastingvrije obligaties rente

In het algemeen, is gemeentelijk bond belang vrijgesteld van federale belasting. Echter, bepaalde muni obligaties zijn aangewezen “particuliere activiteit” obligaties, afhankelijk van hoe de opbrengst van de obligatie-uitgifte worden gebruikt. Belangstelling van particuliere activiteiten obligaties nog steeds vrijgesteld voor de gewone belasting, maar het is volledig belastbaar voor de AMT, met als gevolg dat de RAROC na opbrengst aanzienlijk minder is dan wat de belastingbetaler oorspronkelijk dacht dat hij verdiende. Merk op dat, bepaalde muni obligatiefondsen om opbrengsten, een deel van hun portefeuilles aan particuliere activiteiten obligaties kunnen toekennen.

Plannen van strategie-Again, zou een belastingbetaler altijd moeten overwegen na belastingen opbrengst bij de evaluatie van investeringen. Een AMT betaler zouden in het algemeen niet moeten voeren particuliere activiteiten obligaties. Als de investering in beleggingsfondsen vorm is, zijn er tal van muni obligatiefondsen beschikbaar die niet in particuliere activiteiten obligaties investeren.

Partnerschappen en andere investeringen “pass-through”

In veel gevallen zal partnerschappen zelf AMT items hebben, maar aangezien een partnerschap “” deze items passeert, is het de individuele partner die beëindigt omhoog betalend de AMT. Een onroerend goed partnerschap kan bijvoorbeeld, gebruiken een afschrijvingsmethode die is toegestaan voor de gewone belasting, maar is niet toegestaan voor de AMT. Dit verschil in afschrijvingsmethoden is een AMT item die zal worden gerapporteerd aan de partner op het formulier K-1 hij van het partnerschap, dat op zijn beurt ontvangt, moet worden gerapporteerd volgens de partner eigen AMT schema, de vorm 6251.

Merk op dat deze dezelfde Pass Through-behandeling in het geval van S bedrijven, LLCs, en bepaalde landgoederen en vertrouwensrelaties leidt.

Plannen van strategie-alvorens te investeren in een partnerschap, moet een individu informeren over AMT items dat het partnerschap kan worden gegenereerd. Zodra geïnvesteerd, is het over het algemeen te laat om iets over hen te doen.

investing,"Sooo, no bs, I can pull off a good solid 10% or higher return, how the hell do I get investors?","Hey everybody. 

I'm getting great returns in real estate but I have no idea how the hell to convince anyone else to join me.  It would be like ~~crowdfunding~~ crowdpurchasing real estate.  Any ideas? 

I know this sounds like bullshit but I was thinking that maybe I need to just offer slightly better returns than the bank because everyone will be like ""Yeah, right, that can't be true!"" and ignore me if I try to start with the higher returns.


Would any of you invest $1000 in something like that?  How about a $100?  I'm trying to figure out if anyone would invest smaller amounts if the idea was basically like a 3 year or 5 year CD that you bought at the bank but with a higher APR.  

Instead of pooling money into a loan package for individuals like prosper.com the ""micro-investors"" would be loaning their money to one company that used that pool to buy property and use the rent income for the payback. 

Put another way this is like a real estate management company borrowing from a bank but instead of the bank making the profit by charging interest we pay out a higher interest rate to the crowd that takes the place of the bank.

There is no upside for me - the bank will loan me the money and I don't need to fund anything with a crowd but if I could only invest a $1000 or so in something and I wanted a decent return instead of the ridiculous sub 3% the banks give out on a 5 year CD (holy shit!) I'd be looking for something like this... and I figured, wtf, why not try to make it for everyone else?

Anyway, should I just shut up and keep buying properties by myself?",finance,1358139834

personalfinance,Percentage of take-home pay for mortgage?,"My husband and I are looking to buy our first home.  We both have stable, full-time jobs.  I'm stressed out about how much of a mortgage we can comfortably afford.  We started off looking at less expensive houses that would be comparable to our current rent, but they will all require a lot of renovating and other work that we do not want to have to do.  

It's taboo to talk about budget's with friends, but I can't help but wonder how much people pay, percentage-wise, of their income.

We make a combined $92,000 pre-tax.  After retirement savings, healthcare and taxes, we have about $4,200/month take home.  Our rent is currently $900. We have enough in our savings for 10% down and closing costs.  With that and the lower interest rates, the houses that are updated and more what we're looking for, by no means new or extravagant, look like they will be between $1100-$1200/month (incl. PMI, insurance and taxes).  

This would be 25-30% of our take home pay.  Is this reasonable?  

My husband thinks it is.  I would be more comfortable if that amount was our total housing bills, including some utilities.  

Based on our current rent price plus the $500/month we've been putting into savings for a house, I think we could swing this and still maintain our current lifestyle.  But once we own a house, we should probably still be saving at least that much for maintenance, renovations, etc.

We are around 30, and are planning to be in this house for at least 7 years.

personalfinance,"My parents took out federal student loans for my brother and I (and consolidated them), and now we have a mess on our hands.  Help!","My brother just came to me with a debt of $61k that is in my dad's name.  This loan (Loan A) is made up of loans for each of us for each year we were in school, and now they are all consolidated into one lump sum.  I called the direct loan servicing center and they said a consolidated loan can't be ""un-consolidated.""  

The payment on this loan is high, and I have another direct loan (it was recently transferred to MOHELA) and a Sallie Mae loan that I make monthly payments on.  If I could combine my portion of the debt from Loan A with my MOHELA loan I could at least get a reasonable payment based on my income.  Even if I had to take all of Loan A on to combine it with the MOHELA, I think it would be more manageable as far as a monthly payment goes.  

In a perfect world I would be able to consolidate my portion of Loan A, the MOHELA, and the Sallie Mae loans into a single, fixed rate low interest loan and make a monthly payment based on that.  Aside from that, the most simple solution would be to just split the monthly payment on Loan A with my brother and begin paying it down, but he also has his individual loans and doesn't think he can take on the $200+ more a month.  

Loan Balance:

MOHELA - Direct Subsidized Consolidation Loan $7,923 at 6.125%
            - Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan $17,739 at 6.125%

Sallie Mae - $9,431 at 4.750%

Federal Direct Loan - Unsubsidized Consolidation Direct Loan $61,777 at 8.000%

The Direct Loan Servicing center had no ideas about how to sort out the large loan, my parents have no idea what we should do, and my brother and I are just trying to wrap our heads around paying back this debt.  Any thoughts/help would be GREATLY appreciated.  Thanks!

Edit:  based on a helpful link from InMintCondition it seems I might actually be able to consolidate the MOHELA and Direct Federal loans I have into one monthly payment based on my income.   I saw the link for this service around, but the Direct Loan Servicing center told me several times this would not be possible so I didn't actually go through the process.",finance,1358288300

So I moved on then to trying to just make a mini database within excel. That eventually just wasn't working out. Then I moved on to trying Microsoft Access, being that I have a certificate in SQL I thought might as well. So I made a nice database of all my transactions and got a way to organize them, but I was having issues with moving money from my checking or credit cards to cash. Or even when I owe people money. So I modfied my system to have a database of individual accounts of mine and friends/loans that sorta thing.

personalfinance,Can someone explain Homeward Residential and their lowering of interest rates/monthly payments to me?,"I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this, but my grandmother decided to pursue Homeward Residential for their ability to lower interest rates on a house's mortgage by some sort of 2 month trial period where they take (in this case) over $1400 straight from my grandmother's bank account. She claims that she applied for the program (by having to submit bank info, her history etc) and was waiting to hear back from them on whether or not she made it into the program. She then discovered that the company simply took $1400 from her bank account. She claims that she wasn't notified that she had gotten in.

She is upset that they did that and wants to go pay for a lawyer. However, i think it's best to educate ourselves on what is going on and what these companies do/how they work. 

I am skeptical as it seems really strange to me. She claims that the mortgage is now going to be an additional 5 years and that the company will now ""escrow"" (a term i'm unfamiliar with) her insurance payments and taxes in order to lower her overall monthly payments. 

Again, i apologize if i am confusing. I don't really know too much about mortgages and these other companies who claim that they can lower interest rates and monthly payments. She kept everyone in the dark about this and i am nervous it is bad for everyone involved (except for the company) 

If anyone can help explain the risks and rewards of a program like this, it'd help a ton.

personalfinance,Should I apply for a second card?,"Hey all! I'm currently a 20 year old college student. Since August, I've had a Visa BankAmericard with a $700 limit and something like a 20% interest rate that I've used it pretty responsibly so far (i.e. I only charge what I know I'll be able to pay for, I've never accrued any interest, etc.) This is my first credit card and really my first shot at establishing credit history. I believe after a year of responsible usage I'll qualify for an increased limit and lowered interest rate. I've been satisfied with the card so far and I have a Bank of America checking account which makes paying the balance convenient and easy. 

I just got an offer to apply for an American Express Green Card and I'm trying to decide whether or not I should apply. I know applying for too many cards can affect your credit score so I didn't want to apply even  just to see if I'll qualify. It comes with a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95 each year after and I won't know the limit or interest rate until I apply. If I apply and qualify for the card, should I keep the BankAmericard? I know there are a number of benefits associated with an Amex card but I believe the green card is the lowest tier Amex, so is it even worth it? I'm still pretty new to all of this and would greatly appreciate any advice!

Edit: Thanks so much everyone! This was really helpful. I decided to not apply for the Amex and just continue establishing credit with my current card.",finance,1358277579
personalfinance,Credit history is still in infancy - How can I make my situation better for myself and actually start beefing up my credit score?,"I’m a 22 year old guy living in the upper midwest, US.

I have a credit card, but it is a “student” card with a very VERY low limit of $300. Part of the agreement with my father for him to pay for my education was that I wouldn't have credit cards. This was wise on his part since I didn’t understand money management at 18. However, I graduated without a credit history (a better problem to have than bad credit, mind you).

I’m trying to build my credit history as fast and as best as I can, but I guess will power and determination doesn’t give you good, fast credit scores.

Per advice of the FAQ, I got a soft report from credit.com. I’m coming up on a year of credit history (finally) and my score is about 100 points below average. My poor grades are for my debt usage (because I can’t really put any money on my credit card without nearly maxing it out, average at 78% debt to limit) and my credit age (kind of stuck with that one). So, naturally, 2 of the 3 biggest factors in my score are awful.

I’ve applied for the Chase Freedom card (once in May and once in November) but was turned down because of my crappy risk assessment.

What can I do to improve my credit score beyond waiting? What kinds of cards should I try to get? Is there anything that I might be doing wrong or anything that I should avoid?

**TL;DR** Graduated college in May without a credit history. Have car loan, no student loans, and a “student” credit card with a $300 limit (average debt to limit ratio: 78%). Current situation is making it difficult to amass credit history and therefore difficult to access better ways of building credit (credit cards with reasonable limits). Need help navigating building my credit, but not for reasons of irresponsibility.

UPDATE: I went to my bank and gave them a piece of my mind. Well, kind of. I ended up getting a better credit card (no annual fee, same crappy interest rate, 1K limit) and will be able to increase my limit again in a few months. I'm still going to give it a few months before I use it and apply for other cards. Thanks again for the help and advice.

I found a few websites that list the highest CD rates and it seems that local banks are the way to go (I'm from NJ). I am looking to deposit anywhere from $10,000 to $25,000 into a CD (or another type of account based on the advice I get/research I do). Here is the best list I have found so far:

So, I have a few questions:

- Is it better to invest in a short term CD with a lower rate than a 5-year CD with a higher rate? What are some advantages/disadvantages of both?

- Is a CD the best way to go? (I already have an IRA so I do not plan on opening another one of those)

- What is the difference between a CD and a money market account? What are the advantages/disadvantages of both?

- My father is an Army Veteran, but he was drafted into Vietnam. I have seen some CD rates and other info about military rates, do they apply to him/me?

finance,Potentially Stupid Question - How Do Markets Ensure No Arbitrage Opportunity?,"So, just for clarity, I'm an actuary, so while I work in finance I don't work on the investment side at all and have almost no experience in investing outside of my 401k/mutual funds and a few small positions in ETFs.  However, I'm currently taking one of my exams that deals with the Black-Scholes model and the Vasicek and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross interest rate models and have some questions.

I'm not really sure how to formulate this question, but I will give it a try.  So, all of these models seem to make a lot of assumptions regarding the marketplace, and I'm not even 100% sure how the models work in practice (i.e. constant volatility in the models is clearly presumptuous, constant rehedging to delta hedge in the face of transaction costs seems difficult).

But, deeper than that, the risk free rates of interest are all based in reality on Treasuries.  My first question is, does the Treasury yield curve ensure that there is no bond market arbitrage as there could be under some bond pricing models, and if the yield curves are based on market information, how does the market ensure that those bond prices do not allow for arbitrage?

Maybe more importantly, I'm not clear at all on how bond markets interact with stock and derivative markets to ensure that the risk free rates of interest allow for no arbitrage in either market?  I have always throught of them as two separate entities responding to two different sets of investors.  How do the two interact as they do in the Black-Scholes model in order to make sure that you cannot find arbitrage opportunities in the market?

Perhaps I'm confused or just missing something obvious, as I've just barely gotten going on my reading of the material, or perhaps it is the case that arbitrage is possible in markets in reality but closes infinitesimally fast when taken advantage of by a select group of investors.

Any insight is appreciated, as the material really interests me, but I'm just not sure how the mathematics apply to the real world.

EDIT:  A FOLLOW UP:

So I see that due to pretty simple reactions, arbitrage would close sufficiently fast to make it difficult, though not impossible, to take advantage of.  So here is my question about the current market:

If stock markets and the market for Treasuries have to interact in a way that does not allow individuals from take advantage of risk free interest rates that would allow them to take a position in assets and lend cash in a way that allows for arbitrage (or at least react to each other fast enough to close it quickly), and Treasuries are in part based in part on Fed funds rate (I believe?):  How does the Fed transparently informing investors of their zero lower bound strategy, and maybe more importantly delineating the conditions under which such a strategy would be lifted, come about to influence the opportunity for arbitrage and/or the market?  Wouldn't institutional investors, having knowledge of how the two markets interact, have enough information about (at least directionally) where yield curves are going, which would allow them to more accurately value options, and potentially take advantage of that situation?

Basically, are there issues with the Fed releasing information about their interest rate strategies in that this extra information impacts not just lending, but the wider market environment?",finance,1358378196

She said ""At that interests rate you are essentially borrowing the money so go for 5%-6%"". 

I have no idea what that means. Why would I possibly want a lower down-payment on the house if that is going to significantly increase the overall interests paid?

Dus, een dollar waarde van belastingkrediet vermindert uw fiscale factuur door een dollar, maar een dollar waard van de aftrek verlaagt uw fiscale factuur door 35 cent als je in een beugel 35 procent door 30 cent als je in een 30 procent beugel, enz. In gevallen waarin u een keuze tussen beweren een creditcard of een bedrag voor een bepaalde kosten hebben, bent je over het algemeen beter af beweren het krediet.
Zo prachtig als fiscaal verrekenbare tegoeden kunnen worden, met de IRS (zoals je waarschijnlijk hebt bedacht door nu) er is bijna altijd een vangst. In dit geval, is de vangst dat fiscaal verrekenbare tegoeden alleen beschikbaar voor bepaalde zeer beperkte situaties zijn. Velen van hen gelden alleen voor bepaalde bedrijfstakken (zoals restaurants en bars, of producenten van energie). En credits komen met een aantal zeer ingewikkelde regels, die u (of, meer waarschijnlijk, uw fiscale pro) volgen moet om te beweren ze.

business,BP Holdings: 10 ways to reduce the amount of taxable income,"BP Holdings
The following items are meant to provide BP Holdings Tax Management suggestions for your consideration. It should not be construed as tax advice. If you believe any of the strategies would be appropriate for your situation, seek the advice of your professional tax accountant or financial planner.
Saving Plan Contribution
1.Check Contribution to Employer Retirement Savings Plan. The maximum contribution levels have increased for year 2006 for 401(k) and 403(b) plans. The maximum for year 2006 is $15,000. If you are over 50 years of age, you are eligible to save an additional $5,000 as the “catch up”, or a total of $20,000. If you maintained the same dollar amount contribution from your paycheck that you used last year, then you will not be contributing the maximum. Check your paycheck record and determine the total amount that will be contributed this year. If less than the maximum, increase your contribution level for the remainder of the year.
•Impact: Pre-tax contributions will reduce your taxable income and, therefore, the income tax that will be due. Less tax withholding will be required from your pay.
2.Establish a Self-Employed Retirement Plan. If you have self-employed income, you must establish your retirement savings plan prior to year-end, with the exception of the Simplified Employer Plan which can be established as late as April 15, 2007. The benefit of establishing a Keogh Plan, Simple 401(k), or Solo 401(k) is a higher contribution amount. The plan must be established by year-end, but you do not have to fund it until after year-end. It is possible for an individual to participate in a 401(k) or 403(b) plan with their employer as well as contribute to a self-employed plan. For example, a teacher who works as a self-employed landscaper in the summer can contribute to a self-employed plan as well as their school’s 403(b) plan. Likewise, the CEO of a corporation who is also a director for the board of another company can participate in his employer’s 401(k) as well as a self-employed plan based on the director compensation.
•Impact: Reduce your taxable income, and therefore, your income tax.
•Impact: Increase your retirement savings.
3.Make IRA Contributions Now. Instead of waiting until April 15, make all or a portion of your Individual Retirement Account (IRA) contribution now. Your adjusted gross income will determine whether you can contribute to a Traditional IRA (deductible or non-deductible) or a Roth IRA. The earlier you make the contribution, the greater the deferred growth. Everyone with earned income or a spouse with earned income is eligible to contribute up to $4,000 to an IRA account for year 2006. If you are 50 or older, you can contribute a maximum of $5,000. Remember you can make your 2006 contribution any time between January 1, 2006, and April 15, 2007. Again, the earlier the better!
•Impact: Increase your retirement savings.
•Impact: Defer (traditional IRA) or eliminate (Roth IRA) tax on investment growth.

Income Tax
4.Check Income Tax Withholding. You or your tax preparer should estimate your federal income tax for year 2006. Next, check the amount of income tax that has been withheld from your paycheck so far in 2006 and project the total amount by year-end. Compare this amount to your estimate. If your paycheck withholding exceeds the estimated tax due, reduce your withholding for the remainder of year. However, if you determine that too little is being withheld, you will want to increase your withholding or make an estimated tax payment to avoid an under-withholding penalty.
•Impact: Increase your cash flow between now and end of year.
5.Convert Traditional IRA to Roth IRA. If your adjusted gross income is less than $100,000, you are eligible to convert all or a portion of your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. (Beginning in year 2010, the AGI eligibility requirement is eliminated.) This strategy may be appropriate for you if you anticipate a very low taxable income year.
You are required to pay the tax on any amount converted in the year of conversion. Therefore, you can determine the additional taxable income that you want to create and convert that amount. Any future earnings in the Roth IRA will be received tax-free when withdrawn. This strategy may be appropriate for someone in their early years of retirement.
•Impact: Pay tax at a lower rate.
6.Defer Income to Next Year. If you are scheduled to receive a bonus or other income before the end of the year, you may want to consider requesting the payment in 2007. This will allow the income tax to be deferred to tax year 2007. If you are an employee, you may not have the ability to request the payment in January versus December. However, if you are self-employed and on cash-basis accounting, you may be able to defer the income by the timing of your invoices. You should discuss this strategy with you tax accountant or advisor. If you anticipate a higher taxable income in year 2007, this may not be an effective planning tool for you.
•Impact: Defer income tax to next year.
7.Accelerate Itemized Deductions. Use this strategy if you believe you will receive more benefit from the deductions in year 2006 than year 2007. If you are making estimated tax payments to the Indiana Department of Revenue for state and local tax, you can make your payment due on January 15, 2007, prior to year-end 2006. The payment can then be deducted in tax year 2006 on your federal Schedule A Itemized Deduction form. If accelerating itemized deductions is an appropriate strategy, consider making payments prior to year-end for other expenditures that would be due in early 2007, such as out-of-pocket medical expenses, professional service fees, and interest on home equity loans or mortgages.
•Impact: Reduce taxable income.

Investments
8.Sell Investments to Offset Gain and Loss. Review your investment portfolio. If you have significant gain in a stock that should be sold for diversification purposes or to harvest a profit, look to sell investments with a loss that can be used to offset the gain. Conversely, if you have a loss carry forward from a previous year or experienced a significant investment loss in this tax year, you can use this opportunity to sell investments with a capital gain. After all gain is offset by loss, you can utilize up to $3,000 of loss on your tax return to reduce ordinary income. Any remaining loss can be carried forward to future tax years.
•Impact: Manage capital gain and loss to reduce tax.
9.Time the Purchase of Mutual Funds to Avoid the Capital Gain Distributions.
A mutual fund is required each year to distribute to its unit owners the capital gain created by the sale of securities within the fund. The owner must pay tax on this capital gain, even if the proceeds are reinvested in the mutual fund. This distribution usually occurs in the months of November and December. If you plan to purchase units of the mutual fund in the fourth quarter, you should make your purchase after this distribution is made to avoid paying tax on your principal investment.
Impact: Avoids additional tax.
10.Reinvest Your Minimum Distribution. Individuals who are age 70 ½ or older in 2006 are required to distribute a minimum amount from their retirement accounts to avoid a 50 percent penalty. If the distribution is not needed to supplement cash flow during the year, make the distribution in November or December. Waiting until the end of the year allows the earnings to continue to accrue in the retirement account for the majority of the year.
•Impact: Minimize your taxable investment earnings.
•Impact: Maximize the growth of your retirement account.

I will be able to write off every penny I paid in federal and State I believe.  I do not have a roth, and I currently have contributed $700 into my HSA for 2012.  With my tax refund of about $4500 (estimate) should I put it all into a roth or should I put it in my HSA.  I know usually an HSA is a bit better in most cases, but should I take advantage of paying no taxes this year, and place it all into a roth for the 2012 contribution year before April 15?

* I'm in a position where if I were really screwed, I could (fortunately) borrow money from my parents for a short time period.  I have an emergency fund in a savings account - given my situation, am I better off sticking it in a CD or some other venue to get higher interest, since I'm unlikely to need to access it in very short notice?

business,"Biomass Boiler Addresses Alaskans' Environmental, Economic Concerns/
Crown Capital Eco Management","Crown Capital Eco Management
Crown Capital Eco Management Indonesia - The heavily forested city of Ketchikan, Alaska, is built on rock and surrounded by water. Every commodity that comes into Ketchikan must arrive by sea or air. The use of fuel oil is problematic for both economic and environmental reasons because the oil must be obtained and refined elsewhere and transported (using additional fuel). What's more, fuel oil is subject to price instability.
Southeast Alaska Discovery Center in Ketchikan, which provides information to more than a million visitors each year, is the site of a pilot biomass boiler system now coming to life. Two oil-fired boilers serving the 250,000-sq-ft center were replaced with a highly efficient system fueled by local wood. Manufactured by Hurst Boiler &amp; Welding Company Inc., the hot-water boiler was custom-designed to fit within very limited indoor space.
Under the direction of E. Dane Ash, project manager for Tyonek-Alcan Pacific LLC, the biomass boiler system was developed with Hurst representative Gregory W. Smith of Global Energy Solutions Inc. to address environmental concerns, as well as issues related to building space, fuel costs, comfort, reliability, and simplicity of operation.
The new boiler is located on the lower level of the Discovery Center, which requires heating for a minimum of nine months a year. Local wood densified into fuel pucks is delivered to an elevated walking-floor storage bin in a vestibule area built to protect against excessive moisture. (The biomass-fired boiler can burn any wood product with up to 50-percent moisture content.) An auger moves pucks from the storage area to a metering bin and into the boiler. Freezing is not an issue because the walking floor easily breaks up any frozen contents.
The boiler system was designed to highlight how biomass can reduce or eliminate the use of fossil fuels. Visitors can see the boiler operate through specially designed windows. In the hall just outside of the boiler room, the noise level and ambient temperature is consistent with the rest of the building.
Savings
Fuel costs have been cut by two-thirds. The densified pucks are used with almost no residual ash; eventually, however, tree clippings from the Ketchikan walking trails will be ground and fed into the boiler, eliminating the need for transport to a landfill, burning, and other methods of disposal.
The Boiler
The Hurst S100 Series Fire Tube 27 HP Hydronic Water Heating Boiler features a pre-heater to optimize combustion and an underfeed stoker with dry-ash-removal system.
Results
The system easily can be replicated for heat or heat/power generation up to 20,000 kw. In June 2011, Smith served as a keynote speaker for the fifth annual Native American Economic Development Conference in Anaheim, Calif., where he described the initiatives being implemented in Ketchikan and shared success stories of biomass-fired boiler systems installed on institutional campuses and in manufacturing facilities throughout the United States, particularly in challenging and remote locations. Systems include municipal solid waste, as well as woody biomass for steam production and steam to power.

In what was supposed to be a New Year message on his official blog, Financial Secretary JohnTsang Chun-wah warned against ""blind"" pursuit of new industries as called for by more andmore economists, to address the social ills arising from an imbalanced economic growth that ismainly driven by the financial and property sectors. 
Rejecting wide-spread criticisms that the government lacks long-term vision, Tsang wrote: ""Wemust understand that a new industry takes a long time to nurture and develop, and its successis not guaranteed."" He may sound clever in citing a dialogue in the latest James Bond movie: ""Sometimes the old ways are best."" 

But this is not the time. The ""old ways"" that have been driving economic growth through assetinflation are destroying the middle class, resulting in a widening wealth gap that has becomethe main source of public discontent. 
Some commentators have scoffed at the frequent public demonstrations against theestablishment and fierce opposition to almost any government policy proposal as nothing morethan an indication that Hong Kong people love to complain. Their show of ignorance in thismatter apparently is shared by many policy makers. 
The many young rebels against Tsang's ""old ways"" are not without a cause. They havegenuine reasons to feel betrayed by market forces that are shaped by what Tsang called the""conventional economic pillars,"" finance, logistics and trade, tourism, and professional services.He left property out of the list. But everyone in Hong Kong knows its overbearing influence onalmost every other sector of the economy. 
""The four conventional pillars have become our major economic backbone because they havethe edge,"" Tsang wrote in his blog. ""While developing new sectors, we should make more effortto expand the edge of the pillar industries."" 

But for what? That is the question many frustrated Hong Kong people are asking. To be sure,the ""pillars"" have sustained Hong Kong's economic growth in the past several years despite aglobal downturn. But such growth is not seen to have brought improvement to the livelihood ofa large segment of the population, or created many opportunities that can facilitate socialmobility for those at the lower end of the social scale. 
For that reason, more and more economists are calling on the government to take the initiativein nurturing higher-value added manufacturing industries that can generate new opportunitiesfor entrepreneurs and create secured and well-paying jobs for skilled workers. Of course, ittakes time to establish a new industry and the risk of failure is real enough. But suchconsiderations should not be taken as excuses of doing nothing.

I have recently started going back to college, and it is starting to feel like the worst decision of my life. I am currently unemployed. Although I had cash to pay for last term, I have also been supporting my girlfriend as she copes with a severe panic/anxiety disorder. Because of this, she is unable to take on a full course load this term, and subsequently did not receive her federal loans this term.
I have tried to secure a private student loan to cover expenses, but they require a cosigner. My parents have agreed to cosign, but not until they finalize a house purchase (understandable). I am worried that even if they do cosign I still won't be approved.
I have some credit card debt. More than I would like, but as I said, I have been trying to support myself and my girlfriend, and it has become my only option. Today I talked to my credit union, who are usually fantastic, but they were unable to extend me any additional loans.
Rent is due in less than two weeks and I just got a notice that my power is going to be shut off on the 22nd.
What the fuck do I do? I have little of value to sell. Most of my family will not talk to me because I do not share their religious beliefs. At this point I feel stupidly jealous of folks who have 100k in student loans, because at least someone would lend them some fucking money.

I was wondering about my contributions to the TSP/Roth TSP. Ever since I joined (~2 years) I've just been doing 1% into TSP because money was tight, but now that I'm about to make E-5, I'm looking into investing more into TSP. However, no idea what to invest in. I just have a few questions regarding my options and whatnot.

-From what I understand the max I can invest in the Roth TSP is 5,500 a year? ($229 a paycheck to max it out?)
-Would you recommend any other retirement savings besides these?

-If the answer to above is no, how is it a good plan to invest in it if I can't keep growing it?                               
-If I plan on retiring early (~50) is it beneficial to not invest a lot in retirement funds that I won't be able to access until 59.5 and maybe just invest them differently?

My parents, while they had the best of intentions, encouraged me to attend a very expensive private college.  I didn't fully understand the seriousness of the amount of debt I was taking on, even towards the end of my undergraduate career.  It is debilitating having this kind of debt and I am on medication just to curb the overwhelming anxiety it gives me. I also went to a 5-year school in a major city, which accounts for some of the astronomical debt I acquired.

I graduated in 2011 with a degree in Neuroscience
Private Loans: $103,000 (3.1-4.4%)
Federal Loans: $32,000 (6.8%)

My current take home pay is $2,350. $800 of that is rent, $400 food, $200 medicine/healthcare, $150 cell-phone and cable and $1,000/month in student loans. I am barely paying off more than interest or the minimum payment.

My job outlook: My end goal was always to become a doctor.  I have recently changed my mind and decided to pursue a Masters (possibly doctoral) degree with which I will earn 60k after graduation and 80-100k within the next 5 years (probably max out at 110k).  *My Masters is funded and part-time so I will be working, paying my undergraduate loan interest and not be accruing any additional debt while in graduate school*

I really, REALLY need some advice.  Some days I wake-up and can't even get out bed because I just feel like it is all so helpless.  I understand that I will probably be paying this debt back for another 30 years and I don't have much of a choice, I just want to try to minimize the damage it has on my life and sanity.

As an aside, I don't even really know how on earth Sallie Mae gave me all of this money - my parents co-signed my loans, but they have always had an AGI of 20-30k my entire life and their house is valued at &lt;100k.",finance,1358486618

I moved to a new city 6 months ago to start my PhD (Materials Science), and thanks to scholarships, generous parents, and a coop, I am in great shape!  However, I don't know where to go from here, exactly.

Until now, I have taken advantage of a ""green checking"" account at a local bank which offered a 3% APY for up to 25k.  However, this deal is now pulled, and the bank is a few thousand miles away so I have no reason to stay with them.

My current situation leaves me with no debt, ~$30k split between two checking accounts (back home and at a local credit union), and a research assistantship granting me full tuition and a ~$25,000 yearly stipend.  My medical insurance is covered by the university, and I do not have a car, so my expenses really just come down to food, rent (~$850 per month), and random purchases.

Realistically, I will most likely be in school for another 4.5 years, spend a few years as a post-doc wherever I can find an opportunity, and then hopefully settle down into a permanent research position at a university or national laboratory.

Given this situation, what are my best options?  My plan is to put $1-2k in checking and $3-5k in a savings account with the highest interest rate as my spending and emergency cash reserves.

politics,Debt Crisis - who do you trust?,"The idea was floated that as a way to get around the debt ceiling the administration should print a one trillion dollar coin made of platinum.  Platinum is trading for around $1600/ounce.  Do the math, even if the coin weighed a pound--one heavy coin-- it would still be worth only $32,000.  The support for the idea included members of Congress, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, and two former U.S. Mint directors.  Their idea was that Federal Government would use a few thousand dollars’ worth of platinum to write checks up to one trillion dollars. Obama allegedly rejected the idea, but it sounds a lot like a trial balloon.  That is, since it was laughed at, Obama publically rejects the idea so as to seem rational, even though it was probably his administration that floated the idea in the first place.  

Even if I am wrong does it matter?  Is the coin really so different from what the Federal Reserve already doing?  As I understand it, during QE1, QE2 and now QEn Federal Reserve is buying 85% of the bonds that the Treasury prints.  Chew on that awhile.  The solution to keeping the dollar stable under our mountain of debt and sea of impossible-to-pay future liabilities is (wait for it): we print bonds and then buy them from ourselves.

This past week Obama stated that the US government needed to be responsible.  He blasted the Republicans for making demands on the raising of the debt ceiling.  On the same day he stated he would, once again, not be submitting the budget on the date required by law.  I believe this is the fourth time in five years.  Not that it matters, since he has been in office the Senate, which has been controlled by the Democrats since day one of his presidency, has passed only one of his budgets.  Obama blames this on Republican obstructionists, even though had his party voted as a unit it would have passed the Senate.  You can argue over whether it would have passed the house, but that does not explain why most years the Democrats didn’t even bring his budget to the Senate floor, one year the CBO said it was so vague they weren’t going to comment on it and this year, once again, he won’t have one by the date required by law.  (You can see how the debt problem is caused by the lack of responsibility on the part of the Republicans.)

I do not mean this as a defense for the Republicans.  They are not going solve the fiscal crisis either.  And neither will a compromise.  During the recent “fiscal cliff” negotiations it was reported that if all of the proposals from both the left and the right were enacted the combined increase in revenue and spending cuts would total $150 billion dollars--this on a deficit of over of over 1 trillion dollars.  Of course there was no way they were going to agree on all the proposals.  I don’t know what the final tally was, but I can almost guarantee that whatever compromise they reached it will have little consequence on the deficit.  I can definitely guarantee that the debt will continue to rise at an alarming rate, and that is not accounting for the real fiscal cliff--future liabilities which we can never pay no matter how much taxes are raised.

The question I have is why do we tolerate it?  I don’t know that I have ever met anyone who said they trusted politicians (except maybe the politicians themselves.)  When people talk about politicians the words they use: “dishonest”, “greedy”, “stupid,” etc.  Yet election, after election people vote to give more power to the politicians. Whether it is health care, retirement, education, or health care we entrust the people we don’t trust.   Unless that changes, unless we start trusting ourselves to run our own lives, we will continue to flirt with the fiscal cliff (bankruptcy), until eventually we fall off.  

When that happens do not expect the politicians to try to find solutions; they’ll be too busy deflecting blame.",finance,1358611485
personalfinance,"Dear Reddit, I have almost $60k in student loans but I only make $31k.  I'm on IBR, but I still wake up in the middle of the night freaking out about my loans.","So here's my situation.  I graduated from college in 2009, the very worst year ever to do so in terms of finding a job.  I decided to go through a one-year master's program in public administration, which is a professional degree (like an MBA but from the public sector viewpoint).  My plan was to get some type of federal job and have the loans forgiven after 10 years, therefore I was willing to borrow a bit over $40k for the degree.  That was THE ONLY reason I was willing to take out those loans.  

My program was very good, it was in the city with the second-largest number of federal jobs in the country after DC, and I went to all the networking events and had internships, etc.  However, I discovered the hard way that it is actually impossible to get a government job.  I believe I applied to something like 150 jobs by the time I graduated.  (I realize this doesn't sound like a lot, but these job applications take a few hours and I was in an accelerated master's program.  You have to write pages about your qualifications, provide supplemental documents, etc.)  I tried the feds, locals governments, state agencies, nonprofits, think tanks, and everything.  It's impossible.  

I had to move home, which is a second-tier city.  I started tutoring, which had been my college job, and for almost two years my income level was about $9k.  My loans were on IBR, but still building interest.  Then, last year, a miracle happened.  I was hired at a private company at the princely sum of $31k!!

I am very grateful for my job and I really like my company.  I'm doing extremely well and was recently assigned to a very high level client and to work on a big project for them at the same time; they requested me specifically.  I feel so happy that I've had this chance and it's working out.  But the thing is, now my loans aren't going to go away in 10 years - it's 25.  And also, my company has a reputation for not paying people that well and not giving large raises.  And there aren't any other similar companies that could steal me away in the area.  

So redditors familiar with the private sector, please give me your opinion.  If someone is doing really well in their job, do you think it's very likely that they will eventually reach a substantially higher income level?  Or do you think it's possible this place will keep me at $31k forever, no matter how great I'm doing?  Will I *have to* move to a larger city with more companies if I want to do well?

I'm wondering if I could fairly quickly get to a level where I could really start paying the loans off.  If they're going to keep me at the same lower level forever, then I feel like I might as well just keep doing the minimum IBR, but if my income is going to go up then I ought to really start buckling down on the loans.  I never planned on working in the private sector so I don't know how getting promoted and soforth works.  Any thoughts?",finance,1358601420
personalfinance,Short term personal loan website,"I have a small amount of credit card/personal loan debt. Roughly $2500 total. I borrowed money from a relative to start a business and have some credit card debt I need to get rid of. Business is making money, but not a ton of money. Average profit is roughly $100-200 a month. It was also partly financed by credit cards. On top of this, I have a part time job and make roughly $700 a month. I do all this while being a student. What bothers me is paying 22% APR on the credit card with a $1500 balance. I've heard of websites that people invest small amounts of money in and their interest rates are about 10%. I'd rather pay 10% over 22% (who wouldn't). I have proof of income, I have very minor expenses, which are usually personal related. Mainly food. Aside from that I live with my parents and have no other expenses (besides the credit card)

personalfinance,"Starting a job with fed gov't, what should I do about my student loans?","I've been with the agency since 2009 as a co-op and was offered a full-time job when I graduated, which I am starting in March. The question is, what do I do with the student loans I have (~$56k @ 5.988% from an engineering school)?

Since I am working for the federal government, I believe I am eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service). 

So, I was wondering, do I pay back the loan in the standard 10 year payment plan ($620/mo); pay it back with the 25 year extended plan for a lower payment ($360/mo); or pay it back with the income-based plans ($380/mo) for the 120 payments I need and get the rest forgiven? Or, am I missing something here / making a dumb decision?

Sure, I'll spend more if I pay the whole 25 years, but if I pay for the 10 years required and the rest is forgiven, then I'll pay $43,200 in total versus the $74,400 paying it all in full. But, this locks me into the job for 10 years, when I think I'd only be there for 7-8 at most if I could leave freely. Also, remember, I'll be able to deduct the student loan interest (at least for the time being) as an adjustment to my income.",finance,1358576719
politics,A couple of thoughts about occupy and relationships,"I met one of the original founders of occupy Tucson tonight.  He asked me if he could quote me in an article, and I agreed.  What we achieved in Tucson was roughly a camp out at best, a group of scruffy homeless looking people who considered themselves the 99%, living in tents, creating a general disturbance in downtown Tucson.  The man I spoke to wanted to disassociate himself from this movement.  I can only estimate because the homeless population who lives in tents represents the 4%, not the 99%.  We really have 95% who are not involved.  Like myself, the 95% (which I will call 95% for better lack of real statistical figures) work real jobs.  We are lower middle class at best, stuck in a middle class lifestyle.  We aren't homeless, nor unclean, but we have about as much disposable income as those who choose to pitch tents and cause a general nuisance to society.  Yet, we don't want to be associated with them, because we do, in fact work and provide for our families, therefore we are excluded from what we consider, for lack of a politer word, the bums.  We are the 95%.  Those that haven't succumbed to failure, but are on the verge of an overwhelming debt crisis.  We are the ones employed by the 1% who wake up and become slaves to the system.  We are above tents, but below  livable wage.  We provide but it is never enough, and we creep slowly into debt and high interest rates.  We give a shit, we work, we try to achieve, and we are mostly educated.  We do the jobs the 1% doesn't want to do, like IT and accounting.  We make money for the 1% but we are not rewarded, and the don't know our names.  But we are not bums, we are not homeless and we don't camp out downtown or carry signs to prove a point.  We might not do this out of fear.  If I show up on television, I may lose my job.  If I am quoted in the media for standing up for something, I may not be able to provide for my family.  Yes, us 95% are below OK, but we must keep our jobs and live in fear of our own government, and our own employers.  We are the 95%.

I met a very intriguing woman, and we are both going through divorces.  She wants a ""friends with benefits"" situation, but as I live with her, I form very real emotional feelings for her.  She is a 95 per center, like myself, only fucked by the system more than me.  Her husband is ex military, and disabled, and thus receives about $3000 a month, none of which is considered by the government as income due to Veteran disability acts.  Therefore, she is obligated to pay him living expenses, housing expenses, plus alimony, even though she is one of the 95% who has a moderate income and a modest living.  We, in America, actually offer people better money and better benefits to pick up a gun and kill foreigners, than we give to our own citizens.  If you are willing to shoot a Muslim, or a German, or a Vietnamese person, you are rewarded ten folds more than any American citizen who tries to open a small business, or contribute to our sagging economy.  That's right, in America, you are rewarded for choosing killing over working.  And yet, this girl, the one I am falling in love with, will leave me for another military guy eventually.  Because, sadly, I am in the working class, not the military class.  I can only offer her friendship, kindness, and sacrifice, while a military man can offer her travel and early retirement because he shot one of our ""enemies"" in the face and lived long enough to collect that generous pension.  There is no hope for any of us who actually give a fuck about this nation.  She has already told me, not specifically, but I have the intelligence to figure it out, that she will one day be gone.  She is waiting for a man, a guy who has served for the last 10 years in Afghanistan to come home.  He sends her flowers, gifts, everything to my house where she is currently living.  When he comes back in April, I will be an afterthought.  Just a friend who is forgotten.

There is no real conclusion to all of this.  Only realizations.  Those that serve in the military to ""defend"" our country are only human weapons destined for great luxury and happiness if they survive.  How is this any different from the promised virgins the Islams supposedly believe in?  They are doing the exact same thing, only they don't have to die to achieve it.  You serve, you volunteer to kill and amazing women will fall at your feet.  

Here is the summation, if there is one.  I will never kill.  I will never pick up a weapon in hate.  I will always talk my way down from a fight before I will pursue one.  I will always enjoy a cup of tea alone before I will ever get completely wasted with friends in order to get sex or otherwise.  I will always treat women with respect even if it means I end up in the friend zone.  I can accept the friend zone.  I will always be a compassionate individual, no matter if I am used for it.  I will always have emotions, as a man, and I don't give a fuck if people think I am gay for it.  I will cry if I have to.  Most of all, I will continue fighting.  I will fight against hatred, inequality, and bullshit aggressive actions this nation has given people, especially young people that they will make money and get women by ""choosing"" to ""serve"" their country.  It's bullshit.  You kill for this country, you are rewarded.  You work for this country, and you are shit upon.  We are the 95%.  Good luck America.",finance,1358574666

business,"Crown Capital Eco Management/Biomass Boiler Addresses Alaskans' Environmental, Economic Concerns/STORIFY","Crown Capital Eco Management
Crown Capital Eco Management Indonesia - The heavily forested city of Ketchikan, Alaska, is built on rock and surrounded by water. Every commodity that comes into Ketchikan must arrive by sea or air. The use of fuel oil is problematic for both economic and environmental reasons because the oil must be obtained and refined elsewhere and transported (using additional fuel). What's more, fuel oil is subject to price instability.
Southeast Alaska Discovery Center in Ketchikan, which provides information to more than a million visitors each year, is the site of a pilot biomass boiler system now coming to life. Two oil-fired boilers serving the 250,000-sq-ft center were replaced with a highly efficient system fueled by local wood. Manufactured by Hurst Boiler &amp; Welding Company Inc., the hot-water boiler was custom-designed to fit within very limited indoor space.
Under the direction of E. Dane Ash, project manager for Tyonek-Alcan Pacific LLC, the biomass boiler system was developed with Hurst representative Gregory W. Smith of Global Energy Solutions Inc. to address environmental concerns, as well as issues related to building space, fuel costs, comfort, reliability, and simplicity of operation.
The new boiler is located on the lower level of the Discovery Center, which requires heating for a minimum of nine months a year. Local wood densified into fuel pucks is delivered to an elevated walking-floor storage bin in a vestibule area built to protect against excessive moisture. (The biomass-fired boiler can burn any wood product with up to 50-percent moisture content.) An auger moves pucks from the storage area to a metering bin and into the boiler. Freezing is not an issue because the walking floor easily breaks up any frozen contents.
The boiler system was designed to highlight how biomass can reduce or eliminate the use of fossil fuels. Visitors can see the boiler operate through specially designed windows. In the hall just outside of the boiler room, the noise level and ambient temperature is consistent with the rest of the building.
Savings
Fuel costs have been cut by two-thirds. The densified pucks are used with almost no residual ash; eventually, however, tree clippings from the Ketchikan walking trails will be ground and fed into the boiler, eliminating the need for transport to a landfill, burning, and other methods of disposal.
The Boiler
The Hurst S100 Series Fire Tube 27 HP Hydronic Water Heating Boiler features a pre-heater to optimize combustion and an underfeed stoker with dry-ash-removal system.
Results
The system easily can be replicated for heat or heat/power generation up to 20,000 kw. In June 2011, Smith served as a keynote speaker for the fifth annual Native American Economic Development Conference in Anaheim, Calif., where he described the initiatives being implemented in Ketchikan and shared success stories of biomass-fired boiler systems installed on institutional campuses and in manufacturing facilities throughout the United States, particularly in challenging and remote locations. Systems include municipal solid waste, as well as woody biomass for steam production and steam to power.

personalfinance,Help PF! Traditional or Roth IRA (specific case).,"So I'm 27, have been maxing out my company's 401(k) match since I started working, but now I've saved up enough to open an IRA. My specific situation is making it really hard to decide between a Traditional and Roth IRA. Here are the important facts:

* This year my adjusted gross income is $55,800. My understanding is that this is *just under the limit to get the full tax deduction for a Traditinal IRA*. If I get even a small cost of living adjustment in 2013 I won't be able to claim the full deduction. Between state and Federal taxes the deduction would work out to just under $1,000 in savings (for a $3,000 contribution). 
* My situation is pretty stable. I have a relatively stable job, some cash in a money market account, and a family that could probably help out if disaster struck. That said, it would be nice to have a Roth that could serve as a last-ditch emergency fund. 
* I have no immediate plans to buy a house, but this is a distinct possibility in the medium-term. I know that both accounts have provisions for first-home purchases, but it seems like the Roth is a little more generous. 
* I will likely be making another lump-sum IRA contribution around April, so if I choose a Traditional IRA now I could always choose a Roth when I make that second deposit.

personalfinance,Refinancing - cash out to pay student loans?,"Due to lowering interest rates we're looking at refinancing. Our appraisal was yesterday and I don't have the final numbers but the appraiser indicated that we may have significant equity so I'm entertaining the thought of a cash-out refinance. What do you think? Some details:

Current loan: $238k original balance, 4%, 30-year term, starting May 2012. Currently at $229k because we are paying PMI so we've been dumping money into the mortgage to get below 80% LTV. Original appraisal: $280k.

New loan: 3.375% if we keep the same balance, 3.5% if we cash out. Appraiser indicated that we should be in the $300k range. With about $3k in closing costs, we could net about $8k out with 80% LTV. Of course, this is subject to what the actual appraisal comes to.

I have put together a spreadsheet detailing costs of the loans. In terms of nominal dollars in payments and closing costs, a $240k loan costs us the least over a 14-year period, but ultimately costs the most over 30 years.

However, we have student loans with an average rate of 6.3% on a balance of about $22k (among other debts). I'd love to knock those out faster.

Another thing: I am trying to minimize living expenses, and save as much as possible, specifically from about 2014-2021, as this is when we expect to be on a single income. This is pushing me toward a maximum cash-out option, since it's the lowest cost through 2026. And this is before considering interest savings on the student loan from paying them off faster.

We aren't planning to move until the as-yet-unborn kids are out of high school (barring major financial changes).

personalfinance,Foreclosure help - What are my options?,"Hey /r/personalfinance:

I'm looking for some direction here.  My situation - I'm ~30 years old.  I bought a house when I turned 23 and through a 2.5 year ordeal with Bank of America where they messed up my mortgage, I ended up foreclosing on my house about 2 years ago.  My state attorney general ended up including my case in a class action lawsuit against BofA which was settled for a small sum (under $2000).  The lawsuit does not preclude me from being able to pursue other legal action.  I'm currently renting a home and am engaged to be married.  My fiancee has fairly poor credit.  Short of student loans and the foreclosure, my credit is pretty decent (700+).  I have a good job that pays comfortably enough to pay my bills and over $40k in investments/stock.

My questions:
 
1. I would like to stop renting and buy another house again.  One of the ladies at the attorney general's office suggested that I dispute the foreclosure on my credit and cite the settlement to try and get it off to raise my credit score back.  What are the chances of this happening?  Do I have other options to have the foreclosure removed?

2. In an effort to improve my credit, what would be a better option?  Should I try to buy a house with my fiancee and cash out my investments for the down payment?  Should I pay off my student loans with the investment money to help my credit score further?  My understanding is that student loans aren't horribly bad and that buying a house and making payments on time might be a better move if I can't get the foreclosure off?

3.  I'm in the process of one of the independent foreclosure reviews that I was eligible for through the federal government.  Whether that goes in my favor or not, how will that change my situation?

4.  Realistically, am I out of my element in trying to buy a house again?  Am I thinking about this all wrong?  Can someone shoot me straight on what would put me in the best financial position with the goal of buying a house for my fiancee and me?

Thanks, guys!  I'm struggling with what's the best thing to do and I'm not really sure where to turn or where I can go for help.  Any advice or anything really that points me in the right direction would be appreciated deeply.",finance,1358700551

Also has a separate unit in the back that public records classifies as an unfinished detached garage, but it's tiled and has some counter space, and possibly a bathroom. It's big enough to be a small studio apartment in my eyes.

Well, it turns out they want $39,000 on a short sale. The house is foreclosed on the by the bank, who are the ones selling the house. Would they take an offer of less than the asking price, or should offer what they are asking?

I'll be calling my bank on Monday for a loan, who I've been with for at least 3 years now. I would be able to afford 5% down, and I don't want to wait to save more money in case this house ends up getting sold.

Real estate agent said part of the floor was buckling. My father said it probably only needs a couple of the wooden things (yeah I don't know the term) under the house that keeps the floor stable (not the foundation). I'm having a friend of the family who knows a heck of a lot about repair work check it out when I make an appointment to see the inside of the house.

The real estate agent lives kind of far away, so she wanted me to get pre-approved from a bank before she makes the drive to show me the house. Is this normal?

I have a ~750 credit score according to CreditKarma and am 23 years old, so I should be able to get a good interest rate, right?
I'm interested in any and all answers, suggestions, advice on everything including what do do with the detached garage if I do get the house.",finance,1358698933

economy,In Regards to Economics,"It needs to be said, governments exist because of economies.  Civilizations have always bartered, traded, exchanged and commerced.  In the process,  civilizations have always attempted controlling this phenomena time and again.  The tales of Ancient Rome, Chinese Dynasties, and the British Empire come to mind.  
No matter what, when we are analyzing socioeconomics, one mustn’t forget we are talking about people.  Surprisingly enough, I feel like that element often becomes lost in translation.  Yes, common people like you and I.  To explain further,  I need say four words that affect everyone, everyday:  Supply, Demand, &amp; Market Equilibrium.  
 
For practical purposes, I will demonstrate with a fellow  by the name of Joe Shmoe.  Mr.Shmoe wakes up at 5AM to the warbling sounds of an alarm clock. Mr.Shmoe then uses the shower provided in his leased apartment.  He cleans up with a shave and a toothbrush, pulls together the modern day work outfit, and brews himself a cup of coffee before commuting to the office workplace.      

Mr.Shmoe, like all of us, lives in a world composed of transactions.  He bought the alarm clock at Bed Bath and Beyond, is leasing the apartment through Fairfield Residental, purchased his toiletries at K-Mart which were produced in a factory by Procter &amp; Gamble. The coffee, grown in Columbia, is Folgers, marketed as “the best part in waking up”.  How does he fund his well-being one may ask?  The Department of Education pays him a salary that makes this lifestyle possible.  He works for the government.  His financial holdings, protected by the Bank of America, are created in part, because of a similar pre-work routine, five days a week.    After work he drinks a beer.  He spends the weekend playing xbox 360.  

Society is a very, very, complex network.  Economics is an attempt at analyzing this network through not only the movements of Mr.Shmoe’s financial holdings, but the study of the industries that he fuels, the government which he works for, and how that government regulates and adjusts what we refer to as cycles of growth and constraint in an attempt to create equilibrium.  Through aggregate linear equations and derivatives, the study of economics becomes a biological form of calculus.  It is not Rocket Science, however, Rocket Science is physics.            

As in nature, a food chain consists of various life forms that feed and survive off one another in a constant struggle for homeostasis.  For civilization, this food chain is society and the interactions between various life forms becomes the study of economics.           
Surely civilization is composed of a framework of individuals.  Just as in nature, these individuals can be classified into tiers of a food chain.  Individuals form groups which build populations.  The upper tiers become apex.  We classify them as the wealthy, the elite.  Their impact in the economy is great in the sense that they create opportunity for the lower tiers to survive and probably spend greater sums of their holdings on luxury.  This causes envy, a subject in its own right.     

Anthropology acknowledges a class system; it helps give definition, identity, and culture.  Different people are better suited for different tasks.  The beauty of the United States is there are no restraints onto where one belongs on the food chain.  People from across the globe travel here in hopes of it.This is what differentiates the animal kingdom from human intelligence.  One’s own cleverness and cunning can bring it out of the woodworks and into the limelight.  Up the ladder, so to speak.  A tad bit sorrowful for nature because a dungeness crab cannot outshine a white shark, that is unless it is boiled and served with garlic butter.  Maybe it is not sorrowful at all; it is just the way of things.  It is the ecosystem.  It is economics.    
I am and never will be an economist.  While attending Oregon, my father who majored in economics at UC Berkeley, pressured me into studying it.  I dreaded the subject and although I came close, I could not even complete the coursework to receive my minor in it.  Looking back, it’s hard to believe I even passed as many econ courses as I did.  I failed one.  All of it is theory though, Keynesian theory.      
Keynesian theory expresses a belief that total spending in the economy [demand] does not equal the productive capacity [supply].  From my viewpoint, what this theory tries to state is this: Market equilibrium does not exist without government intervention. It basically says, survival of the fittest will not work.   
   
It says, a free market is an erratic market, and federal regulators cure this problem with all different types of intervention.  We hear about it in the news constantly be it, changing interest rates on treasury bonds, borrowing from China, spending on a stimulus package, or perhaps the adjusted inflation rate.  Now, the overall measure of the United States economy is measured in GDP [Gross Domestic Product].  It is not a perfect system but tariffs and taxes fuel our government which in return, give us our market equilibrium even though it is not really in homeostasis.  That is why unemployment is high and we’re in the so called “Great Recession”.
In hindsight, Keynesian theory sounds like something scribbled up by the government or even politicians themselves to stay employed.  Back to basics, these are people, people employed in the public sector.  The public sector is government, a group within the overall population.  The very, very, complex network.  
  
Along with Keynesian theory is supply-side economics.  I don’t believe one must choose between one or the other, supply-side theory is an extension of Keynesian.  Many Americans also refer to supply-side as ‘trickle-down theory’ or even Reaganomics, named after the 40th president, Ronald Reagan, who began to implement what I will explain further.   

Fundamentally, supply-side economics  tries to give the impression that economic growth occurs when there are less barriers and regulations for the so called “job creators”.  There is more flexibility for someone to start a business and create jobs for other people in the process.  It is believed that income taxes and capital gain taxes, for example, hinder someone’s desire to begin an entrepreneurial endeavor.      

The entrepreneur needn’t forget that taxes and government make it possible for an organization to take authenticated form.  It becomes legally acknowledged which enables it to conduct business.  A successful business creates revenue greater than it’s expenses known as the gross margin allowing it to grow further.  Every business either sells a product or service to society which hopefully advances civilization, drives innovation, or simply enhances one’s personal well-being.  

Theoretically, economics is complicated enough but in reality, clarity of the subject becomes even more clouded.  There is an underground economy that exists that deals along the line of illegal trades.  Taboo trades such as drug dealing, prostitution, and any other “under the table” activity.  I believe it makes true GDP incalculable.

 Newscasters give the impression that the modern day global economy is in a whirlwind, even apocalyptic.  It is mere perception.  Technology has created a database and overall wealth of information that can feel overwhelming.  It is not excessive however, it only furthers overall insight and transparency.  Our comprehension of it should only increase in time.  

 Ancient Rome, Chinese Dynasties, and the British Empire all eventually lost their glory.  I’m not a historian either but it is safe to say both micro and macro economics were directly responsible.  Both the innards and exterior environmental factors overpowered ignorance in the complexities that created their civilizations.  Be it, they stretched their resources too thin or perhaps lost their vision in what they were trying to accomplish.

I believe society, as a whole, is loosing track of what it wants to accomplish.  People talk about world peace, utopia, and perfection but the truth is, I don’t know if it is possible.  I challenge people to believe in it because I see the potential, just as many have prophesied.  In a world where demand is not matching supply, perhaps it means people are not achieving what is entirely possible.  Equilibrium, balance, and harmony.  I was taught to imagine so imagine I will.  There cannot be anything wrong with that.

personalfinance,I'm a broke academic with crushing student loans and a family to support.  I need a plan to avert disaster.,"First, let me thank you for tolerating yet another post about student loan debt.  I wont lie - it has been morbidly comforting to see that I am not the only one feeling trapped by the student loan beast.  I sincerely hope that we all get out okay, but I am having a hard time being optimistic right now.  I desperately need some perspective on this issue. 

A little over a decade ago, I chose my passion over money.  I threw all of my energy that I could into my field (broadly speaking, math and science).  I made fantastic grades, published papers, made stellar contacts, and just generally excelled.  I have been offered a (short-term) job at a top-tier university in another country.  Should I take this job, my chances of landing something potentially permanent in academia should go up considerably.  I feel like I have an excellent handle on my professional life.  Unfortunately, my financial life is simply a disaster; my finances are waiting to implode unless I make a radical change in the near future.

For nearly a decade now, I have put my finances on the back burner.  The only thing that mattered was getting to where I am now.  Of course, I tried to minimize my spending the best I could, but between a wife with a chronic, often debilitating illness and a son, I racked up considerable debt.  Between my wife and I we have around $150K in student loan debt, an awful conglomerate of federal and private loans that just keeps growing. 

I don't know how to handle this mess.  At this stage in my career I can only make around $40-45K.  That is a very standard rate, and I can't really change that by bargaining with anyone.  With this amount, I don't know how to both support my family and pay down debt.  My wife could possibly get an entry-level job somewhere, but nearly every cent she would make would go towards childcare, extra meals out from exhaustion, gas, a second car, clothing, and so on.  Her working might actually cost us money.  

I have made a few attempts in the past to ""jump ship"" to the relatively more lucrative private sector, but my attempts have been met with almost universal silence.  I used my contact network, but I didn't get anywhere.  It's quite a contrast with academics, where I seem to be in demand.  Even if I could get a private sector job, do I just up and leave everything I love about math and science just to make more money?  Would I even be successful?  If I hate my job, I won't be any good at it.  

I just can't write any more on this.  It's emotionally exhausting.  I have destroyed my life and my family's.  I don't see any pathway that makes sense here.  This issue has been a depression and anxiety trigger for me for years now, but like an idiot I haven't seriously sought treatment.  That's a step I have to take.  

Thanks for your time and comments.

TL;DR - I got where I am by digging a great big hole.  I will likely never be able to pay my loans off.  I need to clear my head and make a plan.",finance,1358665492

As a US resident, which currency, euro or yen, would you consider riskier?

gaming,"Shrinez, also known as ShrineNi on youtube, is being false flagged by ""Gurl Gamer"" fans","ShineNi, a popular ""Gurl Gamer"" griefer, has been hit with a landslide of false flagged requests from the second woman playing in the video titled ""How To Gank A Girl Gamer 3: Hide and Seek""

While she was playing, she had absolutely not a single problem with watching a low, low, low level character with PVP flag on, who she then killed ASAP, while smugly touting ""World PVP bitch!""

This is when Shrinez striked, as she was locked in PVP combat, he walked up, ganked her once, then twice, and then three times where she threw a fit, smacked her desk which woke up her baby, and then logged off.

He then posted a video about her on his youtube channel, showing the whole mindset and process about how to do this, and also her gaming attitude.

She then called the police, and said to them that he ""Used my video without my permission, and used my daughter in his video""

This is total, and utter bullshit, lets explain how fair use works.

A) Its called fair use laws, you are -ALLOWED- to reproduce other peoples content if its in the form of criticism, review, a ongoing narrative OR if none of those such as inserting it into your own piece of media (Like the Pony Thread Simulators) as long as the content is not reproduced in full such in the case of movies/TV, you are allowed to use clips from them if you offer up your own content along with theirs, in the terms of music you are ALLOWED to use full songs online on youtube etc, because you are not distributing them.

Fucking TV shows use this -ALL THE GOD DAMN TIME- as its legal, the fucking Daily Show/Colbert report makes a fucking living doing this, RayWilliamJohnson makes a living doing this, The Nostalgia Critic makes a living doing this, Spoony Makes a living doing this, etc etc etc.

You are -ALLOWED- to reproduce parts of tv/movie content for your videos, and you are allowed to reproduce full songs for your videos, as long as it contains some of your own content, such as dancing to singing in the rain.

.

B) You are privy to your own privacy in your own home or business, you -GIVE UP- this privacy by publicly exposing yourself outside of your home or business such as going outside to shop, going to the movies, getting groceries from the store, going out for a walk, and most importantly, putting your image online for everyone to see. Her claiming you ""Used her face without her permission"" is fucking flat out fucking retarded, single handedly flat out fucking retarded, as by exposing yourself to the public outside your home, you are allowed to be recorded by -ANY- form of media capture, such as camera's, cell phone video, video camera's, or in this case, FRAPSing a woman's stream she is publicly streaming.

She then further goes on to say that ""You used my child in your video!"" like he was making fun of the baby, I have to ask, why does this woman care so much about the welfare of her baby, when she herself doesn't even care that much about the welfare of her baby. In the 3.0 video, after getting ganked twice, she reaches down and picks up a 40 ounce bottle of Smirnoff Ice and takes a swig.

Yes, a parent bitching about the damage some stranger could cause to her child was apparently way worse then the damage she was doing to her own child sitting in a crib next to her in a room, swearing foul mouthed at the computer monitor while chugging alcohol, this is clearly grade AAA+ parenting going on here folks.

And let me add one final point here, to all you white knight retards who ""Race to defend"" these people like PewDiePie, Tobuscus, and the 99 billion ""Gurl gamers"" out there streaming with her tits hanging out, you are beyond, to be blunt, fucking pathetic.

Oh, its ""OMGZ OH SO FUNNIZ!"" when somebody puts up one of billions of CoD/HALO/Gears of War/Planetside 2/League Of Legends/*Insert popular online game here* when griefers are picking on 8-10 year old kids in games and recording them spazzing out on the mic, but oh no, you can't grief these guys! They're POPULAR so its totally different

If you have ever laughed at a pubescent kid in a griefing video screaming his lungs out, you have zero right to defend a person online who has the IQ of a pencil when they get griefed and spazzes out, literally, you have no right to defend them. If you do, you are a complete hypocrite.

Anyways, I hope to have a intelligent discussion about this, and I am not talking about woman or girl gamers, people that actually play games, and do it to have fun. They make terrific streamers, cause they actually know what they are doing.

People, man or woman, using their looks to exploit underage children for views and money? They are the scum of the earth.

This is why I support Shrinez, he's calling attention to a problem.

I am going to see if I can get in touch with TotalBiscuit over this, as he was one of the many prominent youtube partners who fought back against the ""Reply Girl"" plague of youtube a year and a half ago, who used their looks to exploit impressionable young men out of their money, and I am very interested in knowing his opinion on this plague of streamers.

personalfinance,Advice for someone who 'vanished' from creditors almost 7 years ago,"Now that it is 2013 I would like some advice from you guys as this is the year my debts I skipped out from hit 7 years old or older.

My story (if it matters) began 7 years ago (give or take a few months) when I had a great job making 75K+ a year in a small town with low cost of living so that 75k felt more like 125k. I was in a long term live together relationship with someone younger than myself who did not have much credit so the house, both cars, loans, credit cards, etc were all in my name but her pay of around $30k helped pay the bills. We lived beyond our means and racked up bills left and right trying to keep up with the Jones.

Then I lost my job due to the company merger/buyout, girlfriend left me around that same time leaving me with the debts that were all in my name anyway so she walked away clean, and the stress of it all led to my drug use and general self pity attitude. I got a job that paid nowhere near the same thanks to a fellow drug user and tried to pay what I could (after drug purchases) but was falling back further and further. This lasted maybe 6 months.

As the house was close to foreclosure with the mailbox full of bills, as I watched the tow trucks take my cars, and as my cell phone rang off the hook from bill collectors up until that was turned off for nonpayment...I called up my mother and explained my drug addiction and that I couldn't stay at the job I had as I needed to severe all ties to drug buddies.

So that's when I packed up, moved home, and 'fell off the grid' for the last 7 years. No change of address of course, just vanished from my obligations. I got clean quick and found work after about a year where I could but it never was a long term job so if debt collectors were trying to track me via employment I was probably gone by the time they sent any garnishment letter. I would say I had about 5-6 jobs during this time but there all part time short term things lasting a month or so then more unemployment. I used cash for everything including paying my mom each month for a car she gave me the cash to buy. My phone was a prepaid.

I moved into a apartment 2 years ago with a new girlfriend but we both use cash for everything and neither use credit. The apt, electric, cable is all in her name as I have been terrified that anything would flag me in some system somewhere and creditors would be all over me within a week wanting hundreds of thousands of dollars from a guy who makes $20k a year barely making it. I love my job - it just doesn't pay much. I've worked there for about 3 years now and never got any garnishment letter or anything. No letters at my mom's house neither which is what my driver's license shows as my residence.

So, the point of this long winded post is this is the year my debts hit that 7 year age that if I understand correctly must vanish off my credit reports. I did peak at my credit report once about a year ago and it's basically like a time capsule from 7 years ago with phone numbers and addresses from my old life. I've seen where debts have been sold and resold to various debt collector companies which seem to refresh the dates so they appear not to be 7 years old.

Do I simply sign up with all 3 credit report companies and start disputing everything down the page as 'over 7 years old' and watch it all vanish after a month or two or will it be more complicated than that? Or...are there some debts that do not go away after 7 years? For insight my debts consisted of a house foreclosure, 2 cars repossessed, several credit cards, utility bills, and a loan or two from local finance companies. Total debt in my name 7 years ago was if I had to guess maybe around $160k-$175K.

UPDATE: Thanks to some comments so far I looked up my state. Statute of limitations on loans and general debt is 6 years; credit cards is generally 4 years. Court judgements for my state have a 12% interest rate and they also have a statute of limitation of 7 years from the judgement date. This might explain why I haven't been contacted in the last year or so now that my life is easily track-able through tax returns and stable employment. So even though they are on my credit report some or possibly all of the debts have expired past their statute of limitations.",finance,1358802842
personalfinance,"Need to borrow $20,000 to buy a home - would it be better to get a personal loan or a mortgage?","Some background:  I have terrible credit.  My husband and I owned a nice little house (not extravagant) and were doing fairly well until he became too disabled to work a couple of years ago, and our income dropped by $80k per year.  Within the last 48 months, we've declared bankruptcy and moved across country to be closer to family.  I have been out of work for 9 months, but collecting unemployment (which pays better than actual jobs pay where I live).  We've managed to save $5,000 in the past 9 months but I'd like to avoid using much of that.

Where we live is a trailer owned by my Aunt-in-law.  She's now out of work and wants to sell the place, and for a number of reasons we need to stay put (mostly because we are next door to my husband's parents, who help me care for him which will allow me to go to work in the city when a job opens up).  She is willing to sell it to us for $20,000 and *says* it's worth $45,000 (that's debatable, but the acre of scenic mountain land by itself is worth $12,000).  If we don't buy it, she'll get an equity loan against it and then allow it into foreclosure because she needs the money right now and it regularly takes years to sell land where we live, so we'll still be out of a place to live.

My father-in-law says that we should get a personal loan so that the property is not encumbered, and that he'll co-sign for us (or will get the loan in his name and we'll just make the payments - we're responsible folks, we just didn't anticipate full disability in our 30s).  We'd like to start rebuilding our credit, so we'd prefer to get the loan ourselves.  But I feel like a mortgage (we have a VA Loan available to us) would have a better interest rate.  You folks seem to have all your shit together, so I was hoping someone might have some insight into which is better.

**TLDR: Would a personal loan or mortgage be a better option for a recently-bankrupt couple living on disability and unemployment benefits?**

Bonus question:  If we go the mortgage route, will the bank appraise the property?  And if it appraises lower than $20,000, will the bank deny the loan?

I had multiple store cards, mobile phone contracts which were unpaid, frozen, etc. I have paid all of these off now, which I am very pleased about.
My bank loan is, I think, just under £3,000 as of this month (down from £5500) and my overdraft is ~£2,000 down from ~£2,500. 

These are pretty large amounts for me, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get them paid off within the next 12 months. I earn a little over £1,000 a month, although I am lucky enough to have been offered more work hours so may be able to pull in another £100-£200 a month this year which I'm going to pile on my debt.


Sorry for the wall of text, all I really want to know is what sort of state my credit rating might be in, how can I find this out and start to fix it?

Also, about a year ago I got a credit card, it was a £200 limit with quite a high interest rate, I use about £50-£70 a month of 1 or 2 purchases and paid it off entirely before the bill date.

Banking,Practical differences between checking and savings accounts?,"As an extremely poor college student, I use my checking account to pay my bills and my savings account as a nice place to imagine putting money if I had any extra - it has a couple hundred dollars in it, so its interest rate is completely irrelevant. It's mostly useful in the sense that I have two different accounts to differentiate money if I want to track spending vs. savings. 

But I'm asking the question because I recently found out that my gainfully employed boyfriend doesn't use a savings account. He just has all of his money put into his checking account and lets it sit there accruing for a year. (This isn't counting automatic contributions to his retirement account, rent, credit card, etc.) At the end of the year he sends the lion's share off to his financial manager to invest. 

This seemed like a wasted opportunity to me. I don't know very much about banking, but couldn't he be making better use of that income by at *least* putting it in a higher-interest savings account every month?

When I expressed incredulity that his system was optimal, he said maybe he would just send more money off to his financial manager to be added to his investment portfolio (or whatever it is) every month - apparently his investments are liquid enough that he wouldn't be in danger of not having easy access to his savings if he needed them. I don't know enough about various banking strategies to know if there's any particular reason he would need to have a savings account as a kind of halfway house for his surplus earnings.

I'm not looking to educate my boyfriend, he can take care of himself and his money. But I'd be interested to have a better understanding myself. If anyone can give me a rundown on checking vs. savings vs. investment for me, that would be great!",finance,1358744551

The place has a tenant currently in the unit, and he pays $765/month for rent. Tenant has been a good, long-term renter (and I have some cash reserves in case we lose him). It's a 2 bed/2 bath. The current owner moved to China, needs to liquidate and receive a higher short-term cash flow, and thus has offered to owner finance at 4% with a $10,000 down payment over with a 10 year payment plan.

I'm estimating $1200/year on maintenance. (Probably an overestimate as I can do a lot of the labor myself.)

The current owner is willing to owner finance with $10,000 down at a 4% interest rate.

So by my calculations, expenses should be $8700 per year ($2100 tax+$2400 HOA fees + $1200 maintenance + $3000 loan interest)

Now, three years later, I brought my car loan interest rate way down and the years down ($2100 with 5-6 payments left), all student loans paid off, and have remained at home this entire time.

personalfinance,Need help figuring out if putting 'points toward a lower interest rate' on a mortgage is worth it.,"I have searched this sub, /r/Accounting, and /r/RealEstate and couldn't find anything helping with this subject

My question is this: my bank, Chase, as well as pretty much anyone else, offers you to pay 'points' in order to lower your interest rate. For example, I can pay 3.62% fixed for the next 30 years if I pay .25 points toward a $200,000 Mortgage, or I can pay a 3.75% interest rate and get a .5% rebate. Or pay 3.8% and get 1% cash back. In the middle is around 3.7% rate for no points and no rebates. 

I plan to stay in this condo no longer than 5 years, give or take. 


Mathematically, what is the best deal? I keep confusing myself with calculations and amortizations. My initial math seems to tell me to pay nothing, or get the rebate program, and paying points would only help after paying the loan for around 10-15 years.

After going through Turbotax last night, I owe about $28k to the IRS this year due to that sale and the subsequent AMT liability. Some/all of this may be recoverable in future tax years, although I've had a hard time understanding the probability that this will work out, or how many years it will take to recover. I'm being pessimistic and assuming it will not be recoverable (i.e. I don't want to count on it)

I'm married, one kid + another on the way .. we have assets to cover this debt:

* 50k in emergency fund
* 110k in retirement (most in regular 401k but some in Roth)

Income: $165k/year

Liabilities: About $3400/mo in mortgage/ptax/PMI, another $600/mo in auto loan (balance on the auto loan is $21k, interest rate is 1.9%). The other car we own outright. 

Despite our income level, we live in a high cost area and our cash flow situation has tightened up since we had a child.

I'm considering the following options:

1. straight payoff using the emergency fund
2. arrange payment plan with IRS
3. loan against 401k 

In particular with my wife being pregnant, I really appreciate having the emergency fund, since who knows what may come up in terms of medical expenses. But I'm not sure there's any really good reason to not just go with #1. 

Another option would be to pay off the car loan to free up another $600/mo in cash flow, which would enable us to pay back the IRS and/or replenish our emergency fund more quickly. In the event we encounter hardship we could always sell the car in order to generate additional cash.

Bitcoin,Anyone interested in a weekly technical analysis of BTC?,"EDIT: Yes, it looks like there's plenty of interest. 

I spent a good portion of the 2000's either trading stocks or analyzing equities and options for subscription services. During that time I developed my own approach to technical analysis. While chart-reading is not the holy grail that some make it out to be, I like it for several reasons:

- *It's objective and emotionless.* Even though charts are still open to interpretation, a technical approach subtracts the more subjective (and less quantifiable) fundamental elements such as news events, speculation, and rumors.

- *It can help you fine-tune entry and exit points.*

- *Technical analysis can create a self-fulfilling prophecy.* When enough market participants are aware of a technical level - for example, major resistance at a descending trendline - it naturally becomes a potential battleground for buyers and sellers.

- *It's particularly well-suited to BTC.* Relative to established trading instruments like stocks and options, Bitcoin traders don't have a whole lot of information to trade on. There is no BTC Federal Reserve meeting or bluechip earnings report to drive trading. While there are still major macro factors driving price action, Technical Analysis can help traders increase the odds of a profitable set-up.

It looks like there are already a few sites devoted to analyzing BTC. You might have your own approach as well. My weekly analysis would differ in two respects:

- I'd post it for free, here on Reddit, once a week. This timeframe means my analysis would be focused on swing trading (typically buying and holding a minimum of 3-5 days), rather than daytrading.

- It would reflect my own perspective and approach to technical analysis. Rather than throw a metric fuckload of indicators on the screen, I prefer to use a handful of more closely-watched indicators (like moving averages, trendlines, and perhaps stochastics or MACD). This helps to prevent ""analysis paralysis,"" where indicators are giving conflicting signals and your chart is covered in digital spaghetti.

So - that said, is this something the community would be interested in? And if so, what BTC chart program/platform do you think is the best for analyzing and presenting this information? (As a point of reference, my Gold Standard for charting is QCharts.)",cryptocurrency,1358873813

Currently, I'm a graduate student and if all goes well I'll be graduating with a Master's degree and hitting the job market at the end of this semester.  I work two part-time jobs, live at home, and will not have and never had any student loans. (One of the part-time jobs is a graduate assistant, so the university pays my tuition.)

I applied for an unsecured regular credit card 4 or 5 years ago when my income wasn't above $3K per year and was denied.  Since then, my income has improved a bit (~$9k for 2011, should be about the same for 2012 but my W2s are not in yet) and if all goes well I can get a decent job after graduating. (Wishful thinking in this economy, I know, but that's getting off-topic.)

Anyway, now that my background is covered, let's get down to business about the credit card:

* I have enough in checking and savings that I will always be paying the bill in full when it's due.  As far as I know, this should make the interest rate irrelevant.
* The primary purpose of the card is building credit.  Later on, I can get another more awesome credit card when I have an awesome credit score.  I suppose what really matters is having good credit if I need to take out a mortgage or something in the not-so-distant future.
* I don't plan on buying anything expensive on my credit card, so having a high credit limit is not of importance to me.  (Other than maintaining usage percentages that make creditors happy.)
* While I know that having a co-signer with excellent credit would be great, I'm on my own for this.
* Cash back would be nice, but still not the most important thing.
* No annual fees would be nice, because even with 1% or 2% cash back I'm not going to spend enough to make those worth it.
* I did go to a nearby Capital One Bank.  Since I don't have an account there, they said to just apply for cards online.  They said not to bother with a secured credit card at this point in my life and just apply for the unsecured one.  Should I listen to them?
* Even though I will be out of school in a few months, should I consider a student card?  Or will the perks not last long enough to be worth it?

They are almost completely unwilling to work with me (especially NJClass...HESAA basically just reminds me that my wages can be garnished everytime I call).

I am a 25 year old college graduate, graduated in May 2011.  In highschool I was told by my parents to go to any school I wanted, that they would figure out the loans, and that I'd be able to pay when when I graduated.  I didn't go to, what I thought, was a *crazy* expensive school--I spent a year at a small private school in Maryland and did four years at the University of Delaware (out of state school). But long story short, all said and done, I now have ~$165k in student debt.

The problem now is my monthly payments are ridiculous.  All together I am expected to make payments of $1500+ a month.  ~$800 to NJClass (private), another $400 to Wells Fargo (private), and then finally ~$200-400 towards my newly consolidated federal loans.  The job I have currently, after taxes, I bring home about $2000-$2200 a month.

I pretty much cannot afford to both live and pay off my loans.  I am completely ignorant about finance in general--I'm not sure what options I might even have.  I cannot get a co-signor for a condolidation because my parents credit has also been tanked by my loans.  On top of my student debt, I also have a credit card with ~$940 on it.

I'm not looking to make excuses, and the point is I *want* to take responsibility for it.  I want to start paying everything off.  But I don't see how I can even begin making payments that high.  Is there any way to get these, especially the private ones, lowered?",finance,1358969382

personalfinance,"Need Reddit's Advice, Student Loans or Roth IRA","So earlier this year I had a decent paying internship during school and was making close to 1K a month.  I was naive and stupid and made assumptions on student loans thinking my highest interest rate was 6.8% and I was excited to start a Roth IRA with the extra money I was making.  I donated 400 a month to it and put in $4000 before December.  After finally accepting a job offer I started to get serious about figuring out a budget and that included checking out the loans my parents got me so I was able to go to school.  I then realized my highest interest rate was 7.9% and that I had been accumulating interest on all my loans for the last 4 years of school.  I immediately wanted to pay down the interest that way it would not compound on me when I needed to start payment on my loans.  Thankfully I have a great job and the standard 6 months before I have to start paying off the loans.  I researched taking out an IRA early and discovered that you can take it out with no penalties if it is for educational costs.

My questions are:

1:  How do I take out the IRA without penalty to pay interest on my student loans?

2:  Is this indeed the correct way to proceed?  Seeing how it is very hard to make 7.9% in the market, and the way I see it, I would not borrow money to invest to begin with.

On a side note, I am an idiot for trying to start an IRA without taking a closer look at ALL of my student loans.  Through the course of college I just let my parents handle my loans since they got me parent plus loans.",finance,1358959967

* At the very bottom is my current checking account / savings account. Checking is spending money / unallocated and savings is my emergency fund. I would like to get my emergency fund up to $10000 before I start paying any student loans or anything just for peace of mind. That leaves me with around 5 months of emergency expenses.


* I currently owe $33,000 in federal student loans which are all consolidated at 5.75% interest. I am not able to get a match on my 401k until October 2013, and when this goes into effect, the match will be 3%.

I would like to start putting money into a Roth IRA.


 My questions are as follows:

* Should I be contributing to a Roth IRA first, or should the $822.72 extra that I have per month be put towards my student loans?

* If I start grad school in August, should I pay for that out of pocket, or take out loans while I contribute to my Roth Ira. A rough estimate for grad school is $4800. My job pays for 60% of schooling and school expenses each year would be $12000

* Any other advice is welcome. Aside from my phone. That will not be changing anytime soon. I know it is $110 and I have looked into MVNOs and my current phone is not supported. With the ETF fee and having to purchase a new phone, the price comes out to be roughly the same. I will change to MVNO once my contract expires.

Employers would be able to take job application documents and feed them into databases easily (assuming that the documents meet an accepted standard).

Some employers have databases of applicants (the state of Florida, for one) but the databases get altered and corrupted and data is lost (from my personal experience).

BP today announced it has once again confirmed the integrity of the Macondo well and its associated relief wells following a recent subsea survey to identify potential sources of a surface sheen near the Deepwater Horizon accident site in the Gulf of Mexico. The latest survey marks the fourth time since the Macondo well was permanently sealed in September 2010 that it has been visually inspected by remotely operated vehicles (ROV) at the sea floor and confirmed not to be leaking.Under a plan approved by the Coast Guard, BP and Transocean deployed ROVs early last week to determine whether there is residual oil still trapped under wreckage on the sea floor that may be escaping and causing the sheen on the water’s surface. The Coast Guard has said the sheen is not recoverable and poses no risk to the shoreline. The four-day survey was conducted jointly by BP and Transocean, owner of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, with Coast Guard oversight. It was performed in the presence of the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, as well as representatives from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and State On-Scene Coordinators from Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida. During the survey, the ROVs inspected the drilling rig, portions of the riser that once connected the rig to the sea floor and BP’s cofferdam, an 86-ton, steel container that was lowered over a leaking drill pipe during the Deepwater Horizon response in 2010 in an attempt to capture the oil and siphon it to the surface. The cofferdam, which was not part of the operation to seal the well itself, now sits abandoned on the sea floor, roughly 1500 feet from the Macondo well. While the survey was focused on finding still-trapped oil in the wreckage, it also looked at the Macondo well head and the well heads of its two associated relief wells to confirm integrity.No conclusive evidence of hydrocarbons leaking was observed from any of the surveyed areas. However, a white, cloudy substance appeared to be emanating from several places on the overturned rig, and samples of the substance were collected. BP will review the results of the investigation with the Coast Guard. The Macondo well was capped on July 15, 2010, and permanently sealed with cement on Sept. 19, 2010. The well was later plugged and abandoned with the approval and oversight of the U.S. government. Well integrity was confirmed during and after the abandonment process. On Aug. 25, 2011, BP again confirmed the integrity of the Macondo well and the two associated relief wells with an ROV inspection that came after a surface sheen was reported near the well site. A third ROV inspection followed when BP reported another surface sheen at Mississippi Canyon 252 on September 16, 2012, to the National Response Center. Following the discovery, BP took a number of voluntary actions to monitor the situation, including surveys by aircraft and vessel. The FOSC then issued a Notice of Federal Interest to BP and Transocean, which together developed a plan to survey the well area with ROVs. That plan was approved by the Coast Guard and resulted in continuous monitoring from October 15 through October 17. It also led to the discovery of oil droplets leaking from an abandoned piece of subsea equipment used in the response called a cofferdam. Days later, ROVs plugged openings in the 86-ton container, which sits roughly 1500 feet from the Macondo well head, to prevent additional residual oil from escaping. The fourth and latest ROV inspection was conducted after BP on Nov. 2 reported a sheen in the vicinity of the accident site. BP will continue to work with the Coast Guard and Transocean on any further steps, as needed, to address the results of the most recent ROV survey.Further information:Name: BP US Press OfficePhone : +1 281 366 4463Email: uspress@bp.com

personalfinance,Options for uncle's FFEL consolidated loans (he only has very little SS for income),"So the responsibility to sort out my uncle's finances has fallen on my shoulders.  After much digging, I've discovered he owes about 33,000 in a consolidated FFEL student loan serviced by Sallie Mae. It looks like he's on some sort of graduated balloon payment where he's only paying interest on the loan and then the minimum payment rises over time.

Right now he's paying $100/month that's automatically taken out of his checking account.  This was established a couple years ago when he was making money but now he doesn't and his only source of income is Social Security (SS) income which is only $567.  

His minimum payments will balloon to 133/month for a year, then 179/month the next, and then 240/month for about 14 years.

Needless to say, he can't keep this up.  What can he do?  

Is there some law where Sallie Mae can't garnish SS income if that's the only income a person has?  I think Sallie Mae doesn't know that the only income my uncle has is SS.  

Or does he have to go for IBR? 

If Sallie Mae can't garnish his SS and my uncle doesn't pay, what happens to the loan? Does it go to a collection agency? Won't they run into the same problem as there's no income to draw from? 

My understanding is SS can't be touched by anybody except the federal government and even then there are rules in terms of how much is allowed to be taken out as you have to account for living costs.

Edit: Found this interesting tidbit:

""The most that can be garnished from Social Security benefits is 15%, and your benefits should never be garnished below $750 per month. If, for example, your monthly benefit is $800, 15% won’t be taken—just enough to reduce your check down to the $750 floor.""

So since my uncle only has $567 SS income per month, even the government can't take anything right? So what happens to the loan? Sallie Mae can't garnish SS. If they pass it to collection agencies, they can't do anything. The federal government can't do anything. What happens to the loan?

I will get details tomorrow but  i was wondering if there is any advantage to staying with a company as opposed to dropping it and purchasing through work?

Employer is offering 1-6 yrs salary depending on how much I have deducted from my paycheck.  I can max this out without a physical and can always lower it later. (raising it in the future would not be as easy)  My spouse is also elegable for coverage.  There is also accident/disability insurance available.  Is coverage through the company a better option in general?  

what varaibles do we need to consider when comparing rates/fine print/providers?

Wife  has her own coverage through her work.   I don't think i am covered though.

We also have a big honking mortgage that is uninsured.  Is this a seperate issue or something that is considered in the overall plan?  And what is the difference between mortgage insurance and term life insurance?

personalfinance,Shares in 401k purchased at higher rate than market price?,"Hi,

Tuesday I balanced my portfolio. Part of that included purchasing Vanguard Total Bond Index (VBMPX).
The transaction went through at a 'NAV/Price' of $14.03. Meanwhile, the market price at the time was $11.06

(http://www.google.com/finance?q=VBMPX)

I asked support staff of the retirement plan. Here's the response:

""whether or not a fund's Net Asset Value(NAV) on our website matches the open market price will depend on the approach used for valuing that fund within the 401(k) Plan. Within the &lt;company&gt; 401(k) Plan, some funds are valued using the ""Mutual Fund Approach"" and others are valued using the ""Trust Portfolio Approach"".

Funds that are valued using the ""Mutual Fund Approach"" will track and follow the price found on the open market for that particular fund. All but four of the funds within the &lt;company&gt; 401(k) Plan are valued using the Mutual Fund Approach.

Funds that are valued using the ""Trust Portfolio Approach"" are funds in which the Trust determines the prices by taking into consideration any fees, expenses and interest rate factors that are applied to the fund. This will create a different NAV than the market shows. However, even though the fund has a different NAV than the open market value, the fund within the 401(k) Plan will still track the movements (i.e. increases and decreases) of the fund on the open market. This means that if there is a 2% increase in the open market value then you will see that same 2% increase in the NAV within the 401(k) Plan. The only funds within the Accenture 401(k) Plan that follow this approach are: Vanguard U.S. Treasury Money Market; Vanguard Prime Money Market; PIMCO Stable Value; and Vanguard Total Bond Index Fund.""


But, the fees for this fund is only .05%, I don't see how I could possibly be paying a 25% markup. 
Is there something I'm missing?

personalfinance,"If I make an extra monthly payment to my loan entirely towards the principal, does it shorten my repayment by exactly one month, or more? (Details inside) (CA)","I've been trying to figure out the math on this for awhile now, so I apologize if it's a silly question. Numbers are approximate but I can provide exact numbers if needed. Not even sure you need it. 

* This is an OSAP loan in Ontario, Canada.

* I currently owe $17,250 on my student loan (was $21,650). 

* I've paid 21 out of 120 of the monthly payments (98 months remaining). 

* Each monthly payment is $245.

* My interest rate is 5.5% ($2.35 at the moment, added on daily).

* On each payment, $70-$80 (depending on the month) goes to pay of the interest that's accrued over the last month, the rest go to principal.

* I've payed an additional several hundred dollars on top of my monthly payments when I've had the cash to do so.

* There is no penalty for making extra payments.

My question is about how extra payments affect how long it will take to pay off my loan. 

Now, say that on the same day I make a monthly payment of $245, I make a second payment of the same. The way my loan works, ~$75 of the first payment would go to interest and the rest to principal, then interest starts accruing again from $0, so because I've already paid it, the second payment would go ENTIRELY to principal. 

I'm guessing this doesn't work on a pay 1 month-subtract 1 month ratio because of the interest, so paying double in a month *should* shorten my loan repayment period by more than one month.... right? But can anyone tell me HOW much more it would shorten my repayment period? Simple math tells me about 1 1/3 months, but I'm not entirely certain it's that simple. 

What I'm trying to figure out overall is how much extra money it'd be beneficial for me to put towards my loan, because every dollar means other things I can't have or do. If it's only paying off my loan SLIGHTLY faster, there's no reason for me to deprive myself of other things; I'd rather pay less for a longer time. But if paying an extra month now is the equivalent of 2 months later, perhaps it's worth me paying as much as I can toward is.

Can anyone help explain this to me a little better, please?",finance,1359044394

personalfinance,College student and NOT enrolling in my company's 401(k) plan. Good or bad decision?,"So I have a unique situation that has caused me to not enroll in my works 401(k) (I know, I'm crazy right?).

Background on me: 20 years old, 2 semesters of college left next year, double major in finance and financial planning, will have around ~$40,000 in student loans when I leave college.

I am currently interning for the next 7 1/2 months, full time at a large corporation in the tax division. I work 40 hours a week at $20 an hour. My company has a 401(k) plan that I am immediately vested in, they match me 100% up to 6% of my salary. Naturally, you would think I would enroll. 

Estimating conservatively, after 7.5 months @ $20 * 40 hours a week * 4 weeks in a month, my plan would have $2880 in it when I leave. The maintanence fee on the plan is $150 a year. This is 5.2% of my account. Assuming ~ a 6% return annually in the current market environment (the plan is split up into large cap stocks, mid sized, small sized, bonds, etc), I would earn .8% for the year. I must also mention that dividend reinvestment is subject to a 1.25% fee. Any company stock I buy is subject to $.06 in fees (part of the plan structure is to buy company stock). I have left out tax implications because I really am not sure how to go about it (or am just lazy and my job is doing tax all day already as it is...but I realize any investments that I do with this money will be taxed first as my income, then again on my capital gains). Also I am forgetting that I am immediately earning 100% return with my company's match that I wouldn't get otherwise.

I feel I can earn over 10% in my TD Ameritrade account on stocks for the year as I already have done so for the past 2 years. Also I have student loans that I will have to pay back after school, but since my return on the market is higher than my interest rate, I will worry about that after college. I have no credit card balance outstanding, I always pay it off before the end of the month.

Am I crazy for not enrolling or did I make a sound decision? I feel my opportunity cost is also higher at the moment because since I still have another year of college left, I have a lot of expenses ahead of me and I don't work during the school year. Of course once I work full time after school I will enroll in my company's 401(k) plan. The only factor I am missing is the tax implications which could throw off my all of my reasoning.

Thanks in advance for the help!

**EDIT: I've done the math and talked to one of the tax guys at my work. Even if I were to take the 10% penalty for early withdrawal and my effective tax rate of 24%, I will still come out ahead with my initial 100% return.
I feel silly now, going to enroll immediately. Thanks!**",finance,1359034877
personalfinance,24yo getting back to college needs some help with college loan decision,"I need some help with a 4 year-long decision I have to make.

Some background: I'm a 24 yo brazilian guy, working a good job in IT and living with my parents. This year I'm going back to college (never completed one). I have some installments purchases on my credit card over the next 10 months and have to pay for my motorcycle for the next 24 months. 

I have no money saved since I wasted my income being a stupid and happy young man, and I have 2 options for paying for college:

Option 1: If I pay for college during graduation, the monthly fee will be 45% of my monthly income after taxes. I can afford this, but it will live me with a very tight budget and saving money won't happen until I pay for my credit card purchases, at least. So after the 4 years duration of the course, I'll end up with no debt and with plenty of spare income.

Option 2: I can get a government funded loan to pay for school, I'll won't have start paying ultil after I graduate and then I can pay for the loan until up to 2031 at a 3,4%/year interest rate. This will allow me to be in a much more confortable financial position during the graduation. The plan would be to have zero debt as soon as possible and save as much money as I can living with as less expenses as I can, so by the time I graduate I'll have a huge debt at a good interest rate (specially for brazilian standars), but with a bunch of money saved up, possibly enough to buy a small appartment.

I'm not sure how to approach this. I like Option 1, it will be paifull but will get me on a nicer spot by the end of graduation, but the loan may be a good opportunity that I don't wan't to miss on.

gaming,Help me. I've forgotten how to be a gamer.,"Hi Reddit,

I can't game anymore. I really don't know how. As a kid and teenager I absolutely loved video games, seriously loved them, and they really helped define my childhood. Fond memories of playing Quake on PC, or playing Discworld and the 9 year old me being very confused about the puzzles give me that warm and fuzzy feeling.

Even as I got older and graduated from playing Earthworm Jim for hours on the SNES to saving Mudokken's in Abe's Oddysee or smashing up cars in Destruction Derby 2 I was still hooked. The trend continued, through various incarnations of Final Fantasy and led me to the PS2. I loved it. Playing GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas quite obsessively (I even got the secret tattoos in San Andreas). One summer I played Kingdom Hearts almost daily, managing to complete it and feeling totally wrapped in it's environment. 

I even made time for a bit of retro gaming on the side, with things like Chrono Trigger being great fun and really illustrating to me know how much beautiful craft there is in a great game. Age Of Empires was a favourite ever since I was a child, I remember playing the demo obsessively and finally getting the full game which kept me occupied for countelss hours, and I always made time to play that now and again - and I remember being rather miffed when I realised my PC wasn't powerful enough to play AoE III when it came out.

In my later teens, as I was faced with university applications and exams that would determine my future as well as learning to drive and an increasingly active social life in school, I still gamed. I loved to play Hitman 2 and Contracts on my laptop in between studying - and Sid Meier's Pirates! made me giddy with joy as I looked to conqueur all the ports of the Caribbean. Any titles I'd missed through the years I would revisit, trawling eBay for Final Fantasy X-2 or the big box version of Beneath A Steel Sky. 

As I left home for college, there was a distinct drop off. Probably because I didn't have an XBOX 360 yet and also because as a film student I was busy enough watching movies. I would occasionally play multiplayer games, like Pro Evolution Soccer, in a room full of rowdy students and plenty of beer. But not like the days before. 

Sometimes, maybe on the weekend, I would get my laptop out and play an hour or so of Age of Empires before my friends came knocking and said we should go and explore the city and grab a cheeseburger.

Coming home for the summer after my first year, I did pick up the pace a little. I bought an XBOX 360 after I realised the new Hitman game (Blood Money) wasn't working on my laptop. It was great, and I played through the new Broken Sword games too - which made for an enjoyable summer. 

But I never really had much money, and I couldn't keep up with the scene. I used to buy game magazines almost weekly as a kid, not anymore. I certainly couldn't keep up with the latest titles, not under my own steam - it was over a year before I got the first Gears Of War in some little bargain off eBay. Eventually, I sold my XBOX 360 for some quick cash. 

For a while I was consoleless. But it was okay, I still could watch movies. To be honest I was happy enough without it. I could still relive some childhood memories on my laptop, and ScummVM allowed me to relive all my old adventures (and find some new ones). Eventually I really didn't game at all. It wasn't really something I thought about in all honesty. That was, until GTA IV was released.

Despite being relatively cash poor, I bought a PS3 and stood in line for GTA IV on release day - it was great. I had so much fun playing that game and I obsessively completed it with great joy - similarly to how I played the previous GTA games to death.

Fast forward a few years, I'm out of college with a job. Life's going well and I have every reason to get back into gaming. But somehow, I can't. It's frustrating, but I don't have the same passion or drive to actually play games anymore. 

I play very occasionally now, and I'm never up on the latest releases. I'll play a little bit of SimCity 4 here or there, but nothing serious. I've really tried to get back into gaming to - I've used my hard earned cash to buy plenty of games, but I just can't play them like I used to. Some of them have never been played, L.A. Noire is sitting in its case unplayed. It's such a waste.

I guess I feel like I'm wasting my time by playing games, I know that doesn't really make sense but it's the feeling that I get. I'm still interested in gaming though, this subreddit is one of my favourites and if I'm bored I'll hit YouTube and watch a speedrun of Tomb Raider II from time to time.

So, I guess my question is - how can I get that passion back? Is it something you have to really commit to, or is it simply too late for me and I've outgrown it?

TL;DR - I don't play games as much as I used to, how can I get the enthusiasm for playing back again?",technology,1359025323

personalfinance,"25 y.o., ~60K in debt, unclear future, some assistance appreciated.","So I was in a grad school program in 2011 with a bright future. Ended up having a health scare  over Thanksgiving, had to drop out of the program and eat all the debt (currently at 56K; undergrad included), plus my terrible credit card debt at the time nearly 100% of $12,500 limit over 2 credit cards (7500 at 29.9% 5,000 at 9.8%).

That was essentially the start of 2012 for me. Since then I've cleared $8400 in CC debt (the entire balance of the ridiculous apr card) and 4100$ remaining on my lower interest rate card, and $0 in savings. But I still have 56K in student loans with the most notable loans currently accrusing interest being a 23K loan at 6.8% interest and 8K loan at 8.9% interest, along with a myriad of other smaller loans. My students loans come into repayment pretty soon around 300 bucks for a couple of months and then up to $800ish near the middle of this year.

Luckily I was able to find a job I enjoy, but it has no future/upward mobility and I can only make 21-23K pre-tax annually based on the number of hours I get (but Health Insurance YAY). At the same time I have been spending a lot of money on post-baccalaureate courses so I can try to find my way back into a grad program or some other field with an actual future.

I have moved back home with the folks and they are supportive. At the time I do not pay rent but I can't in good conscience do that for much longer. I have a reliable car with no car note. I spend very little on myself aside from gas, food, and gym membership.

Terrible fortune aside, what should I do? This is operating under the assumption I can't get back into school in the immediate future. Should I just throw everything I earn at my higher interest student loans? Save? Invest? Fake my death? 

TL;DR: Appx 60K in debt (56K student loans, 4K cc, 0 savings, make appx 21-23K atm) How should I approach my finances?

I've tried to make myself a budget on numerous occasions but I always seem to fail. Part of it is a lack of understanding, the other part of it is a lack of financial self control.

I don't have a set fortnightly income, the hours I work are different every fortnight. One pay period I might earn $800 and the next I might earn $1200, so this can make budgeting difficult. 

I'm hoping someone (or many people) can help me with advice on getting my shit together.

Rent: $250 per Fortnight
Gym: $31 per Fortnight
Personal Training $80 per Fortnight (a session a week)
Private Health Insurance: $12 per Fortnight

business,Former PwC employee's farewell to colleagues goes viral across PwC and accounting world as a whole. Enjoy.,"This letter was written by a former fraternity brother. To anyone involved In the corporate grind, accounting industry, or just likes a good fuck you; enjoy



Purpose: To convey in the most appropriate way possible via email the widely known fact that I am jumping aboard a ship to sail to calmer waters and greener pastures. 

Evidence Gathered: What can I say? The time has come. Well, its technically the third time I have put this action in motion but as the saying goes - ""third time is a charm."" It is almost a jaded message but one that I think inherently conveys the angst with which I have anticipated this day. Honestly, it comes with different emotions than I would have anticipated years ago. There is a small feeling of separation anxiety and a small insecurity with the choice made. Yet, I think it's safe to say these manly emotions can be attributed to the immense success of PwC's 2009 Propaganda Campaign which I became acquainted with on 10/4/2009, my glorious first day. 

Rhetorical Question: Do you want to be a success in life?? Great, you need to stay until at least manager. Don't worry, while this may result in diabetes, the dismantling of a few relatively important relationships, high cholesterol, obesity, an innate dissatisfaction of your life, and an ever-decreasing level of self-respect, your odds of becoming a CFO are greater. Jobs you are passionate about do not really exist anyway. Shut up and crunch numbers. 

What can I say, they had me sold. I thought I would potentially stay until this magnificent milestone. And why not? PwC will give you 25% of your salary when you make it as an extra bonus. And you won't want that money the day of the promotion. Why would you? Honestly, you realistically don't even need it which is one of the contributing reasons they make you do 3 years to Senior and 3 years to Manager. How much more money could they possibly give you? At the end of the day, greed is evil, and in essence, they are protecting you. So hold tight for 9 more months and the money is yours. Does anyone else feel like PwC is a desperate girlfriend who knows you are continuously trying to break up with her so she finds any way possible to keep you around for another day, week, month??? Maybe I need to date smarter, or just be smarter. Who knows (unfortunately, the Atlanta and Denver offices)? Then again, I chalk up the ignorance to the distraction the copious amounts of money I have been rewarded has provided. 

I don't want to go without a big thanks to PwC:
·         Words said: We would love for you to move to Denver! Can you do it in 4 weeks (mind you its supposed to take months - plural). I know its sudden but don't worry, you will work less and your quality of life will be significantly better. Words Meant: Ryan you are young, naive, and gullible - so listen up: You are going to get put on the shittiest client in the Rockies. You will work every Saturday and be too tired to ski Sundays. You will still go, but boy will you be fucking exhausted Monday morning while the mountain of work you have to complete mounts up. If you get stressed, be tough. There are enough people crying in the audit room currently. Some are managing to hold back their tears until they get into the car at midnight. Set an example. Suck it up. Don't be a bitch. At least you are closer to the mountains. They are pretty. Worse case, you hold on longer to old relationships that you can use to get out. I am sure that will end well.
·         Real  Actual Question: Do I need any shots before heading to India for the 9 days I am assigned? Real Actual Answer: ""No, no one that has gone over there with PwC has gotten shots."" Interesting, because I heard everyone does, but I'll roll with it. I suppose he meant ""Of course moron. This is pretty last minute and IFR Managers are mindless morons so I am going to say no to make this easier for all involved parties. While you skip 20% of your work days over there because you are vehemently throwing up, just know that when you are able to stand we will make it up to you by taking you to all the all-you-can-eat Indian buffets your heart desires. Also, in between sitting on the toilet and throwing up into it, take solace in the fact that you aren't breathing in the shit infested air outside. It can't be enjoyable for someone with asthma and allergies like yourself. (Side note for those travelling to India - I tell this story when India comes out. Watch strange men attempting to throw feces on your shoes. It can cost you a lot of monopoly money. I mean Rupees).
·         You will all be working on a very important project to the firm. This will in every way help your career as there is a lot of exposure and a plethora of networking opportunities.  Real Meaning - We are making so much fucking money on you, I will tell you anything. You have an incredibly easy job so just be happy you can revert back to collegiate life and get paid. However, please note that while in NJ there will be a hurricane. Trust that we will wait until the last minute to tell you not to fly up North for the week. You should probably pay for internet at 30,000 feet so when you get the news to not come you can practice your sales skills and see if you can get the pilot to turn around. It is your fault anyway you took the slightly cheaper flight to get up there a few hours earlier to avoid the weather anyway, moron.
·         GREAT NEWS - Instead of a bonus this year (remember our lesson about greed and your sufficient existing wealth), we are going to send you to Palos Verdes, CA where you will be surrounded by several hundreds of your peers. It will be so fun and relaxing. You get a daily schedule where you get to run around doing 6th grade activities with a bunch of douches who enjoy these retarded team building activities - if you can really even call them that. When you are done playing, we take a dive into your soul to help you explain why your masochism is perpetuating your tenure here. Your repressed feelings will surface and you will fight quitting on the spot just so you can play games near the ocean a few more days. Also, good luck finding someone to really binge drink the pain away with; most people here are married or as lame as it gets.

So, to sum up the aforementioned, thanks big time Dubs. In retrospect, it is hard to complain too much about my time here. Roaming from Atlanta to Denver to Chicago back to Atlanta to get staffed 75% of the year on a project split between NC and NJ, where your main concern each day was not throwing up at your seat (A huge shout out to whoever threw up outside the girls bathroom) really isn't all that bad. Throw in various free weekend trips on the firm during the project and some prior trips out of the country and to the west coast, and one can almost forget how bad this place can be. In the end, its just time to transition into a little more freedom and little less bullshit. 

Conclusion: I would like to end by thanking the people that made my life and job tolerable the last three years. The friends in Atlanta during my first and second stint, the group out in Denver who I saw so much they were essentially like a my Denver family (CB, Colin, MW), Chicago for putting me on a Risk Assurance gig for which the client refused to give us work but allowed us to kill the code (lot of stressful days signing on and sitting on the couch while my Senior was looking for new jobs) and, well, everyone on the IFR/CFG project. Let's just say, I knew deep down there was no turning back after 7 months of debauchery that created memories I have been trying to repress since and some that I will share over drinks for years to come. I so badly want to include stories but so many stories would illicit suspicions of people sexuality and tendencies and other would result in people jumping on the last day bandwagon. So after making finding a way to make 2012 my bitch professionally, I leave on the best note possible (personally, at least. I think my HR wants to castrate me for leaving in January but I actually listened at Discover so the jokes on them). 

For those of you staying, I refuse to ""wish you the best."" Rather, I pray you keep your head up and find ways to make drinkable lemonade out of the rotten produce inherited. Should you wander on towards greener pastures and want to throw me a high paying job, my personal details are below. And don't fret Atlanta Office, once I am gone, I will start my mission of finding a new girl each June to get me into the Promotions Party. How else would inappropriate things happen? 

Good luck finding an FSLI to hide the time your spent reading this. Good thing its Friday. You are going to have to make up half the day's time anyway, what's another 20 minutes. 

One Love, 

**** ******* ****

personalfinance,Another student loan thread.  How do I not become homeless?,"I have been reading past threads and haven't found any solutions so I'm gonna try my own with my personal specifics to see if I can get some help.  I am $91k in debt to Wells Fargo for private student loans.  I have been working freelance in film/television for 3 years now since graduation and it is extremely tough to make a lot of money early on, so much so that I may have to go on unemployment.  I cannot get anyone to cosign, my credit score is 526 and I make maybe 30k a year if I'm working enough.  I have seen options for federal, but there has to be SOMETHING to save me.  My payments for these loans total $800 a month, which I simply cannot afford. Wells Fargo will not do anything for me, I've called a million times and they say sorry, you owe it.

personalfinance,Calculating Tax Liability,"Hey all, so I was curious as to what my tax liability for 2013 will be and decided to try my hand at deciphering the tax formula.

I have a pretty simple situation, but wanted to make sure I'm not making any errors in math or deduction/credit handling.

The numbers:

Salary = $75,404

401k Contributions = $3,770.20

Other Pre-Tax Deductions* = $8,620.56

So my federal taxable income is $63,013.24


I also have federal student loans

Student Loan Interest = $2,000

That reduces my taxable income to $61,013.24


Now it is time to take out the standard deduction and personal exemptions. I am married and we will be filing jointly for 2013; we also have 1 child with another due in April.

Standard Deduction = $12,200

Personal Exemption (4 @ $3,900) = $15,600

So that brings the amount I will be taxed on to $33,213.24


The first $17,850 will be taxed at 10% = $1,785

The remainder ($33,213.24 - $17,850 = $15,363.24) will be taxed at 15% = $2,304.49

Add these and get my tax liability (before any credits) = $4,089.49


I will also get a $1K tax credit per child = $2,000

So my tax liability for 2013 will be $2,089.49

Correct?

Fuck karma, I want comments. Opinions please everyone.
  
(TL:DR) I want as many opinions as possible on: How to get what you want from your bank 
  
So I am 23, just got a new kick ass job and decided I want to get my finances in order. I call Wells Fargo first and they give me a GIANT middle finger when I tell them I am in the process of greatly reducing my $2,000 credit card balance and that I'd like to lower my APR. They transfer me off to a bunch of managers, all the while I am growing more &amp; more impatient with each person. After the third manager in a third city, I hear myself say ""Basically I have fewer options and fewer benefits with you than with ANY other bank I could be a customer with."" She didnt have a great answer to that.
  
TL:DR - Wells fargo doesnt give a rat's ass about my business... so I am writing to the executive office about my unsatisfactory service
  
[EDIT]...and yes I should have learned that sooner but I dont really use this account often except for automatic payments.
  
Cursing myself for choosing such a horrible bank service, I moved on to call Navy Federal. They have always been great to me from a customer perspective. Then they go on to tell me (just like wells fargo) that in August I was ""locked"" into another APR percent that can only be reviewed and changed once per year.. Seriously? wtf? I don't have any recollection of accepting any sort of option about my APR percentage. Probably because I didnt and they used some tricky dick bank stuff. So after talking to a manager I tell her: ""I understand I am ""locked"" into the credit card but I KNOW you can do something.""
I even went on to say: ""I will open a roth IRA right now if you can so much as lower my APR 30 or 40 percent."" At which she responds that she is unauthorized.

TLDR - Navy Federal doesn't care either. 
  
So I called USAA and a local credit union and basically found those organizations to be more helpful. They offered me a balance transfer with 12 months 0% APR to deal with wells fargo. They told me my credit score was great for being 23 and that I had multiple different options because it was obvious I pay my bills. Again, wtf? Why are these transactions so opposite? Are they just being nice until I become a customer?

TLDR - USAA and a local credit union act how I was expecting my banks to act. This whole industry bothers me.
  
So...
  
How can I talk to wells fargo/ navy federal and get what I want? 
  Is there anyway I can close my WF account without it affecting my credit score? 
  
I'm willing to give NF more of my business but is this really a good idea?

TLDR - How can I get what I want from my banks? Is there a specific languange/ tone (aggressive?) that I need to have everytime I get on the phone? How the hell can I get them to lower my APR?",finance,1359134499

I have a lot of student loans.  About 150K federal and 150K private (undergrad plus law school).  I knew what I was signing up for; I worked full time in undergrad and part time in law school, but I went to great schools and they were expensive.  I had a great highly-compensated lawyer job right out of law school (approx 2 yrs), which allowed me to pay down about 15K in loans and 20K on credit cards.  Due mainly to health reasons, I quit such job to pursue other options (solo work plus temping; health reasons not sufficient for ""total and permanent disability"" and the private loans aren't discharged for that reason in any case).  Fed loans are on IBR with $0 payments, and private loans are on interest-only payments ($700/month) - not ideal, but credit score is high and creditors aren't knocking down my door.   

***Plot twist!*** -- I'm moving to France with my (French) husband this summer.  

Options: (1) continue paying $700/month for my loans to remain at the same 150K balance or (2) stop paying

Important factors:

- we are not planning to return to the US

- Fed loans will stay on IBR - no plan to default on these

- I have no US assets; I plan to have no French assets in my name

- none of the loans were cosigned

- private loans consist of 9 separate loans, with 2 lenders and 3 servicers.

**The Question:** Aside from any moral/ethical argument (which I fully understand and appreciate), what is (or should be) stopping me from defaulting on the private student loans once I move abroad?  Am I missing an important piece here?  (yes, they can obtain a default judgment, but will they bother with the expense of tracking me down abroad, given that I will still have no assets?)",finance,1359126338

Her monthly payment is now almost halved.  She was angry about this despite the fact that the interest rate is the same.

However, I have been on a debt-repayment kick lately: I've drawn down my cash reserves to where I don't have 5k sitting around to throw at my 2012 Roth contribution (whoops!). I did meet my 2012 debt reduction goals though!

I could borrow money: there exists the ability to get an ""IRA Loan"" with the local credit union that would allow me to finance at 2.2-3.6% interest (depending on the term of the loan). The caveat is that I have to invest the money through the CU for the duration of the loan, so I can't just move it all to a vanguard account immediately. All they offer are low-interest CDs (in fact, the loan interest rate is the ""CD interest rate +2%""). But I could move the assets in 3-12 months, once the loan is paid! The benefits of tax-free growth in a Roth are pretty stellar, so I'm thinking it could be worth it to take a one-time hit on the financing costs in order to have an extra 5 grand compound in the Roth. I have 35 years of compounding to work for me, so I don't think that $150 (3% of 5k) is too much to pay for the tax advantages gained. Repaying the money would not be a problem.

What does r/personalfinance think? Are Roth IRAs powerful enough to warrant paying an interest penalty to fund them? How big of an interest hit is too much? To what extent is it desirable to take a cash-flow hit to fund it? My situation is perhaps unique, but what about for people with less financial room to work with?",finance,1359083818

During College which I eventually dropped out of I had a real convoluted view of the world and was not thinking straight with my spending habits. I was usually pretty bad but recently I have been improving little by little. I opened a Schwab account and they closed it cause of my credit score! This was the last straw and I really want to change things around.

I have **8** negative accounts largest being Sallie Mae.

**Sallie Mae:** End of November 2012 the last month before my loan went into collections I entered an agreement with them. I paid close to 2 grand and now have month payments of $112 every month. I've made 3 consecutive payments and my interest rate will effectively be 0.1% while I pay off the debt. I'm at $11k owed at the moment. Basically would take a little over 8 years paying on their terms. Currently listed as Charged Off since I entered agreement.

**Credit Card 1:** Had a $500 limit during college now somehow I owe $1,600. They took me to court and they won. Never had wages garnished or anything. I got a call from a firm on their behalf 2 days ago and took the women's contact information so that I may arrange something. Maybe the lender finally sold the debt? Will have to find out. Currently shows as Charged Off. TransUnion shows: Estimated month and year that this item will be removed: 08/2016 -- do not think this is accurate.

**Direct Loans:**Owe $1900 haven't paid in a few months, government subsidized loan. Will have to make arrangement with them. Account is currently open. Shows 180+ days overdue and credit report shows $400 in arrears.

**Direct Loans 2:** Shit just noticed I have a closed DL account for $3,300....shit. Shows as Activity Designator: Transfer/Sold

**DSL Company:** I am an idiot, was a little strapped for cash since I changed jobs (took a pay cut to move into technology from sales). I pay for internet switched over to cable company (only internet no cable) to save some money. Didn't pay these guys like an ahole and it made my terrible credit report even worse. JEEEZ balance only $71 fuck me why am I so stupid. PAYING THIS TOMORROW.

**Credit Card 2:** Paid off in full was charged off, will be off my account 12/2015.

**Credit Card 3** Company went bankrupt in 2008 or 2009. Shows as Charged off for $750. Has been switched to many different firms over the last few years. I might be able to dispute the account or offer them a low % of total balance to get it off my report once and for all. Shows will be off my report by 12/2015.

**Cell Phone Company:** This one is really old and occured when I was working for 100% commission in a shitty sleazy job that got sued by my state a few months after I left!! Anyways this one has changed to many many many different firms. I know I could offer the latest firm which took it over only a couple of months ago some really low % of the balance and take care of it.


Now I am taking responsibility for my actions I have been very immature and really don't know what I was thinking 90% of the time. I am analyzing myself and my report here formulating the best plan of attack. ANY advice would be greatly and sincerely appreciated. I do not want to live my life like this. I am an intelligent young adult that is nothing be insanely luck to be born here and not in the third world country my parents came from. I am currently working on a business in my spare time and just on improving my life. 

I will be if things go well getting $1k in a couple of weeks and another 14K spread throughout 2013. I do not want to be emotional with the money I want it to work for me and give me the best possible advantage given my current situation. (As for the why former employer was screwing me, somehow company ended in my name, i found out they fled country and I'm selling it) Again any advice or guidance would be immensely appreciated.

I am working on increasing my income through employment (and eventually my businesses) but for the time being after taxes I bring home $22k-$25k. I recently got to the 3rd interview for a consulting company starting was $45k-$55k which WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT since its my dream job! But I was super nervous and I had 3 hours to complete a set of 4 scenarios. I breezed through them but on one of them had tunnel vision! It was migrating data from old PC to new PC and they wanted me to copy all files change wallpaper etc so it was like old PC. So I got a lot of Xs instead of check marks. They may still call been less than a week but I've applied to another ~25 jobs since then in Information Technology. Having extra income will certainly help pay things faster.

Random tidbit also have around $1k in ACTC stock. Had more but sold some of it at a loss to pay for the nearly $2k for Sallie Mae. 

Lastly, what does /r/personalfinance think about those firms that dispute credit inaccuracies on your behalf? Is it worth it? Would it be better to do it on my own? Any chance of this being effective in my case? Any additional info would be appreciated.
What about a secured credit card? I could put gas and misc. every month and pay off in full. Working on a GTD calendar to sync with my PC and Phone will have all payments on my calendar and am used to working only with cash should be ok in not going over and ruining my credit even more.

Text as it appears on the website.

&gt; Citizens of the world, 

Anonymous has observed for some time now the trajectory of justice in the United States with growing concern. We have marked the departure of this system from the noble ideals in which it was born and enshrined. We have seen the erosion of due process, the dilution of constitutional rights, the usurpation of the rightful authority of courts by the ""discretion"" of prosecutors. We have seen how the law is wielded less and less to uphold justice, and more and more to exercise control, authority and power in the interests of oppression or personal gain. 

We have been watching, and waiting. 

Two weeks ago today, a line was crossed. Two weeks ago today, Aaron Swartz was killed. Killed because he faced an impossible choice. Killed because he was forced into playing a game he could not win -- a twisted and distorted perversion of justice -- a game where the only winning move was not to play. 

Anonymous immediately convened an emergency council to discuss our response to this tragedy. After much heavy-hearted discussion, the decision was upheld to engage the United States Department of Justice and its associated executive branches in a game of a similar nature, a game in which the only winning move is not to play. 

Last year the Federal Bureau of Investigation revelled in porcine glee at its successful infiltration of certain elements of Anonymous. This infiltration was achieved through the use of the *same tactics which lead to Aaron Swartz' death. It would not have been possible were it not for the power of federal prosecutors to thoroughly destroy the lives of any hacktivists they apprehend through the very real threat of highly disproportionate sentencing. 

As a result of the FBI's infiltration and entrapment tactics, several more of our brethren now face similar disproportionate persecution, the balance of their lives hanging on the severely skewed scales of a broken justice system. 

We have felt within our hearts a burning rage in reaction to these events, but we have not allowed ourselves to be drawn into a foolish and premature response. We have bidden our time, operating in the shadows, adapting our tactics and honing our abilities. We have allowed the FBI and its masters in government -- both the puppet and the shadow government that controls it -- to believe they had struck a crippling blow to our infrastructure, that they had demoralized us, paralyzed us with paranoia and fear. We have held our tongue and waited. 

With Aaron's death we can wait no longer. The time has come to show the United States Department of Justice and its affiliates the true meaning of infiltration. The time has come to give this system a taste of its own medicine. The time has come for them to feel the helplessness and fear that comes with being forced into a game where the odds are stacked against them. 

This website was chosen due to the symbolic nature of its purpose -- the federal sentencing guidelines which enable prosecutors to cheat citizens of their constitutionally-guaranteed right to a fair trial, by a jury of their peers -- the federal sentencing guidelines which are in clear violation of the 8th amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishments. This website was also chosen due to the nature of its visitors. It is far from the only government asset we control, and we have exercised such control for quite some time... 

There has been a lot of fuss recently in the technological media regarding such operations as Red October, the widespread use of vulnerable browsers and the availability of zero-day exploits for these browsers and their plugins. None of this comes of course as any surprise to us, but it is perhaps good that those within the information security industry are making the extent of these threats more widely understood. 

Still there is nothing quite as educational as a well-conducted demonstration... 

Through this websites and various others that will remain unnamed, we have been conducting our own infiltration. We did not restrict ourselves like the FBI to one high-profile compromise. We are far more ambitious, and far more capable. Over the last two weeks we have wound down this operation, removed all traces of leakware from the compromised systems, and taken down the injection apparatus used to detect and exploit vulnerable machines. 

We have enough fissile material for multiple warheads. Today we are launching the first of these. Operation Last Resort has begun... 

Warhead - U S - D O J - L E A - 2013 . A E E 256 is primed and armed. It has been quietly distributed to numerous mirrors over the last few days and is available for download from this website now. We encourage all Anonymous to syndicate this file as widely as possible. 

The contents are various and we won't ruin the speculation by revealing them. Suffice it to say, everyone has secrets, and some things are not meant to be public. At a regular interval commencing today, we will choose one media outlet and supply them with heavily redacted partial contents of the file. Any media outlets wishing to be eligible for this program must include within their reporting a means of secure communications. 

We have not taken this action lightly, nor without consideration of the possible consequences. Should we be forced to reveal the trigger-key to this warhead, we understand that there will be collateral damage. We appreciate that many who work within the justice system believe in those principles that it has lost, corrupted, or abandoned, that they do not bear the full responsibility for the damages caused by their occupation. 

It is our hope that this warhead need never be detonated. 

However, in order for there to be a peaceful resolution to this crisis, certain things need to happen. There must be reform of outdated and poorly-envisioned legislation, written to be so broadly applied as to make a felony crime out of violation of terms of service, creating in effect vast swathes of crimes, and allowing for selective punishment. There must be reform of mandatory minimum sentencing. There must be a return to proportionality of punishment with respect to actual harm caused, and consideration of motive and mens rea. The inalienable right to a presumption of innocence and the recourse to trial and possibility of exoneration must be returned to its sacred status, and not gambled away by pre-trial bargaining in the face of overwhelming sentences, unaffordable justice and disfavourable odds. Laws must be upheld unselectively, and not used as a weapon of government to make examples of those it deems threatening to its power. 

For good reason the statue of lady justice is blindfolded. No more should her innocence be besmirked, her scales tipped, nor her swordhand guided. Furthermore there must be a solemn commitment to freedom of the internet, this last great common space of humanity, and to the common ownership of information to further the common good. 

We make this statement do not expect to be negotiated with; we do not desire to be negotiated with. We understand that due to the actions we take we exclude ourselves from the system within which solutions are found. There are others who serve that purpose, people far more respectable than us, people whose voices emerge from the light, and not the shadows. These voices are already making clear the reforms that have been necessary for some time, and are outright required now. 

It is these people that the justice system, the government, and law enforcement must engage with. Their voices are already ringing strong with a chorus of determined resolution. We demand only that this chorus is not ignored. We demand the government does not make the mistake of hoping that time will dampen its ringing, that they can ride out this wave of determination, that business as usual can continue after a sufficient period of lip-service and back-patting. 


Not this time. This time there will be change, or there will be chaos...

personalfinance,Roth IRA home payment questions,"First question:

I understand I can take $10k penalty-free from my roth IRA for a first time home buying down payment.  As a 25 year old in the 15% tax bracket, is it smarter to use this or take out the money from a taxed non-ira account?  Both accounts are long term 8-10% mutual funds.


Second question:
If I take out the $10k from my roth, which I understand will remove contributions first, what if I can't close on a house and don't end up using it...can I put that money back as if nothing happened?  I've maxed out my contributions ever year, so would I be able to put that $10k back as a whole, or am I stuck back with the ~$5k per year limit?  According to [this](http://www.wellsfargoadvantagefunds.com/wfweb/wf/retirement/ira/faq.jsp):
&gt;Once a distribution is taken from an IRA, you have sixty days from the time you receive the check to replace those funds and avoid any associated penalties or taxes. This type of rollover can be done only once every 365 days. 

Is that applicable to what I'm asking?


Third question:
A variable rate mortgage offers the lowest APR and is locked in for the first five years, is this a safe option if you know you will be moving within 5 years?  Say interest rates sky-rocket to 8%...if you sell the house by the end of the 5 year period, or have the cash saved up to pay off the remaining mortgage, are you safe (assuming no early pay-off fees or other provisions in the mortgage agreement)?",finance,1359179367

Up to 3.8 MW of electricity will be generated by three UK landfill sites following a partnership between Manchester based renewable energy specialist, ENER-G Natural Power and Hartlepool based Seneca Global Energy.
ENER-G said that for its part it will design, build, finance, operate and maintain three renewable energy facilities at Seneca Global Energy's landfill sites at Blaydon, near Newcastle; Longhill, Hartlepool; and Gilberdyke, Hull.
The company added that the landfill gas generation plants could be operational by March this year, and will generate sufficient electricity to power up to 3800 homes.
Combined the plants are expected to cut annual carbon dioxide equivalent from the sites by a total of 117,264 tonnes, offering a comparable benefit to the carbon sequestered annually by  96,118 acres of pine forest.
According to ENER-G methane gas will be drawn from the sites using a series of wells and then converted into electricity using ENER-G landfill gas generation equipment, designed and manufactured at the company's global headquarters in Salford, Greater Manchester.
The company added that the generating equipment will be housed in small soundproofed enclosures.
The projects will be funded by ENER-G, including operation and maintenance.
Over the past decade the company said that it has designed, built and safely operated more than 100 landfill gas facilities, providing in excess of 160 MW of generation capacity.

personalfinance,Need help with post-Bankruptcy Credit Report,"Brief History:  Thanks to a lovely car accident that knocked me out of work for almost a year and credit card companies that didn't care, I had to let $4000 in credit card debt balloon to almost $9500 in that year.  Determined thanks to relatively low income (I think I made $18.5k last year working full time) that I needed to file for bankruptcy. 

Fast Forward to Feb. 2012.  Bankruptcy cleared, chapter 7, I feel relatively relieved.  Now all I have left are my student loans, and those would be the backbone of rebuilding my credit.  

Today after seeing someone saying that paypal should be reporting to credit agencies but it's not (at least not Transunion) I decided to run my Transunion credit report.  I see a few glaring problems on it.

1)
Date Filed:01/04/2012 Date Paid:04/05/2012 Date Updated:04/06/2012	
Type:	CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY DISCHARGED
Responsibility:	Individual Debt
Court Type:Federal District

Estimated month and year that this item will be removed: 
12/2021

2) My Edfinancial Student Loans:
Remarks: 
ACCT CLOSED DUE TO TRANSFER; TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER OFFICE

This is showing on all 3 of my loans, yet I've been paying on them monthly.  

My confusion is that I was told Bankruptcy would be on my file for 7 years, which would be 2019.  That says end of 2021, which would be 10 years. 

Secondly, wtf is going on with my loans?  They're closed until Monday, so if anyone could shed some light on this to hold me over until then I'd be overly happy.",finance,1359161904

Forex,Fundamental Analysis: Week 27 January 2 February 2013 Event Calendar,"As I have hinted markets continued to trend last week. This week could be a break from these trends to gather more strength. So don't be surprised if it ranges most of the time. Trends do not go from point A to B in one straight line. Don't forget there will be corrections. USD events will dominate the market, other than that there are no red flags data wise. Volatility will begin slow and it will increase through the middle of the week.


For USD pairs week will begin first with the indicators hinting health of the current economy. Core Durable Goods Orders, although not very reliable shows what will be the production figures in the future. More orders is good for the economy. Expectation is positive but an extreme number is not expected. Pending Home Sales, which is an another leading indicator for the existing home sales will also be released. An increase is expected which is a good sign. Surveys show the amount of foreclosures are declining. US housing market is showing signs of recovery. Federal Reserve rate decision will be announced but more important part is the FOMC statement. Nobody expects a rate change yet. Statements hinting the future decisions are more crucial. Non-Farm Employment Change and unemployment figures will close the week on Friday. Employment is a very important figure for the current state of the economy. A small increase in NFP and a unemployment rate under 8% again will not be a surprise. By looking at the overall expectations through-out the week one can say a stronger USD should be expected.

personalfinance,Major changes coming up... Need suggestions on how to manage my personal finances.,"I have some major changes coming up in less than a month. I need some advice with my finances. Any short term and long term suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Here is some info about me…
23yo single female
Graduating May 2013 (no debts)
Currently have ~$8000 in savings
Car paid off.
CCs paid off every month (I charge all my bills, living expenses, etc… to get points)

2 jobs (1 FT, 1 PT)
FT job @ major hospital system (I just got the job, and am going in to fill in paperwork on 2/1. I think this is also when I tell them if I want insurance and fund retirement plans)
Expected Income: ~$51,000 
Some relevant benefits offered based on employers benefits summary: medical, dental, vision, prescription, credit union, Roth 401k, 403b, 
401K: ""You are 100 percent vested in matching contributions after 3 years. Employer matches 100 percent of the first 2 percent you elect to contribute, and 50 percent of the next 2 percent you contribute""
Cash Balance Plan: “3% credit when you work 1,000 hours/plan year. Funds earn a fixed interest rate based on prior year’s US treasury rates. 100 vested after 3 years”. (not sure what this is for)
PT job @ private practice
Income: ~$25,000 (no benefits)

In the process of buying a $262,500 house in Fairfax County, VA (interest rate not locked in yet, but estimating 3.3%) Down paying $56,000.

Will be taking care of mom (unemployed), 24yo brother (in college, income: ~$10,000, I just provide housing and food for him. He pays for other expenses himself), and 19yo sister (living away @ college, unemployed, Most of her tuition is paid for through financial aid and student loans, but it still costs about $1500/semester, which I will be funding). 
I will not be claiming anyone as a dependent for taxes.

Monthly expenses:
I do not have the final numbers on what the house would cost me/month. It is estimated to be around $1300/month, at the most (including HOA fee, tax, insurance)
Bills: ~$1500/month.

Some goals that I can think of at the moment:
I would like to go back to school to pursue my masters to become a nurse anesthetist in about 5 years.
Would like to save up $20,000 in emergency funds 
I’m hoping to get health insurance for my mom, as she has a lot of health issues. The last time I checked, I got a quote for over $800/month.
Per another redditor’s suggestion, would also like to look into setting up a Roth IRA.
After getting settled, I would like to start investing.

personalfinance,Company vesting w/ no match vs. double down on student debt (3.25%),"Hey r/personalfinance,

First off, I just want to say this is a wonderful sub and I hope to learn a lot while I am here.  

Following the order of operations (originally in the FAQ), I should match my employers contribution and THEN work on debt with over 3% interest.   I am currently contributing 10% of my paycheck to my Roth 401k, but came to the realization that my company doesn't match, they vest.  Meaning that if I continue working there for 3 more years, I will be able to own 100% of their contributions (10%) regardless of my contribution amount.

What are your thoughts on choosing not to elect until the student debt is eliminated?  I currently have around $17k @ 3.25%.   

EDIT: Included highlights from my Plan's Summary document:

**Your Salary  Reduction Contributions**

You may contribute an amount of not less than 1% (and if you are a Highly 
Compensated Employee not more than 10%) of your Eligible Compensation
(excluding bonuses) to the Plan as a Salary Reduction Contribution.
Your Salary Reduction Contributions may be deducted from your paycheck 
(i) before federal and state income taxes are withheld, reducing your taxable income, or 
(ii) after federal and state income taxes are withheld in the form of Roth 
contributions.  Your Salary Reduction Contributions cannot exceed the 
annual dollar limit set by federal tax law ($17,000 in 2012)

**Company Contributions**

Depending on the Company’s profitability, the Company may make a 
Company contribution to the Plan for each Plan Year in an amount 
determined by the Company.  The Company contribution for a Plan Year is 
allocated to the Employer contribution accounts of eligible employees.  Each 
Plan Year the Company determines what portion of the Company contribution 
for such Plan Year will be allocated to eligible employees based on Eligible 
Compensation and what portion will be allocated to eligible employees in 
accordance with an Integration Formula.

**Vesting**

Vesting refers to when you have earned the non-forfeitable right to amounts in 
your accounts upon your termination of employment.  Amounts attributable to 
your Salary Reduction Contributions are always 100% vested.  Amounts 
attributable to Company contributions become fully vested upon your (i) 
completion of six (five if you have attained age 40) Years of Service, (ii) your 
attainment of age 60, or (iii) your termination of employment by reason of your 
disability or death.  If you terminate employment before completion of six (five if 
you have attained age 40) Years of Service, attainment of age 60, disability or 
death, a portion of your Company contributions may be vested depending on 
the number of Years of Service you have completed.",finance,1359304645

personalfinance,"Advice Wanted. Out of college, no student loans, employed. Looking to increase net worth.","Hello r/personalfinance,

I am what you would consider an average person. I'm in my early 20's, been out of school for about 6 months, and I am living on my own comfortably. I'm not extremely rich, nor am I extremely poor. Out of college I was offered an 80k paying job and a 50k paying job. I accepted the latter because to me, I rather have a job I enjoy waking up to every morning. This has possibly came back to bite me in the ass.

I consider myself to be pretty responsible with my money, however, over the past 6 months of working I've noticed that I have not became any more or less wealthy than when I started working. 
Granted now since that I am living on my own I have expenses to pay... I am looking for ways to invest in my net worth and my future. Does this mean I am living above my means? Or its just the nature of my salary vs living expenses?

Here is some personal info for you guys to get a better idea to work off of.

-50k / year
-basic living expenses (rent, food, electricity, water, internet, car insurance etc)
-no student loans
-no car note (would like to be able to purchase a ~$35k vehicle in the next year or so)

I am looking at other subreddits for info, specifically r/frugal and r/investing. But I would also gladly accept any advice you guys are willing to provide. Again, I'm not trying to ask to be spoonfed, just pointed in the right direction.

Thanks for your time reddit.",finance,1359295005

&gt; Hey Gundam fans! As you know, a new gundam shooter has been available to play for a month now. It's quite a fun game, but the hoops you have to jump through to play and the fact that it's not localized in English makes it fairly difficult to get hooked on. There was a little bit of discussion about playing together in the comments for the open beta, but that was almost a month ago.

&gt; I've been playing MSGO for a few weeks now and I have been searching for more English-speaking players to enjoy the game with. Platoon combat really helps the experience, but not being able to communicate is frustrating and stops any good maneuvers from happening. There is a pretty comprehensive writeup on the sometimes-friendly Something Awful forums, and a small guild has formed. and we have a few folks running in a platoon most nights The non-Japanese community surrounding this game is nonexistent at the moment, so I'm hoping that some internet cultural boundaries can be crossed and a few lonely redditors might come and hang out with us.

&gt; **In short, find English speaking players on the Francessca server, Zeon side. Redditors are cordially invited to join GoonSquad**

&gt; If you have any questions about the game when you're logged in, send whispers to Nixon大統領

&gt; **A Mumble server has been set up for public access. Connect if you have any troubles getting the game set up or to find a group to play with once you're in-game. mumble.msgo-english.info**

&gt; An awful wiki is now up as http://msgo-english.info

**What is Mobile Suit Gundam Online?** MSGO is a large scale multiplayer third-person shooter set in the universe of Mobile Suit Gundam Specifically, it’s set during the One Year War, but I think there will be expansion of the mobile suit lineup so we have a better selection of mechs to pilot. At the moment, gameplay is a 50v50 battle of Earth Federation Special Forces vs. the Principality of Zeon with match outcome being determined by combination of capture-and-hold objectives combined with base destruction. It's in the same vein as Mechwarrior online and Hawken, but with a different setting and an interesting commander role similar to the alien commander in Natural Selection.


**The good - What’s this game have going for it?** If you’ve been on the internet or watched any 90s Toonami, you’ll know the Gundam series well, and MSGO provides a great way to live out some kickass giant robot fights inside a familiar universe with the added bonus of wacky Japanese shit thrown in every once and a while. Standard class types of assault/healer/sniper/heavy/tank are in-game, and you’ll even find pilotable battleships with 5 crew slots and damn strong armaments as well as mounted gun emplacements to control.


The real selling point (for me at least) is the Commander mode, allowing a 51st player on each team to take on the role of a famous commander from the series and shape the flow of battle by issuing orders to the players as they see fit. Aside from command issuing (the system is automated nicely and provides great incentives to ensure that players follow your orders), the commander can utilize several powerful abilities to help forces on the ground, such as releasing Minovsky particles to cloud enemy sensors, air strikes to clear the way for mobile suits, and even summoning powerful ace pilots such as Amuro Ray and Char Aznable.


MSGO also has a built-in ranking system that will track player performance in several key areas of gameplay. Rankings are finalized every week(ish) and the top 1000 players (and guilds!) will receive prizes for their efforts. Rise up in the ranks and claim your title as the best eight-year-old girl pilot that you can be!


**The bad - What isn’t there yet.** Unfortunately we’re still in beta (beta launched December 19, 2012) so there is a good deal of work to be done in the game. The most glaring thing you’ll notice is the graphics quality - it’s not too good. If you have played Dust 514, I think that’s a pretty good comparison in terms of making you go “wow, this looks shitty for how good it could be”. Gundam models look good when viewed in the hangar, but when the battle begins it feels like the resolution reverts to 1024x768 so I would like to think that we’re just waiting for a patch. Or there’s a solution and I just can’t read the Japanese.


Other than the graphics, the map rotation is currently fixed and changes every day (I think at 11:00gmt, but :iiam:). This isn’t too bad because each map has 2-3 variants of points, but there are only 4(?) maps in the game right now. Texas colonies is coming on Jan 29!


One more thing, if it isn’t clear yet, the game is only in Japanese. In fact, the beta is restriced to Japan so there is a small bit of work to play the game and you’ll be using a VPN to play it, but keep reading and you’ll see why MSGO is more than worth the small hassle. The primary motivation behind this OP is to stir up a bit of a :goonrush: and see if we can’t start up a small English speaking group to do some robot asskicking.
:frogsiren:Give this game a chance, it is really good! It can be frustrating not always being on top of everything that’s going on and having to figure a few parts of the UI out, but the gameplay is very rewarding if you can get past the more obvious issues that will hopefully be ironed out.:frogsiren:


**Show me fucking screenshots! Here’s a few, more to come.**

**Can I pilot my special snowflake RX-78-7 blahblahblah? (What gundams are in game currently?)** This section needs to be expanded still. There are currently 17 models on each side, with EFSF having tons of variants on the RGM-79 with a smattering of other units including a few guntanks and an RX-78 EZ-8. Zeon forces get as many Zakus as you can shake a stick at, as well as a few variants on the Dom and Gouf lines.


**Getting MSGO** :siren: Remember, this is all in Japanese. Just use Chrome or run it through Google Translate. Don’t miss out on the fun because it’s one more step!:siren:


**Creating an account** First, you’ll need to create a [Bandai-Namco ID](https://www.bandainamcoid.com/v2/oauth2/signupurl) which you’ll use to log in to the game. Follow the steps, check your email, and confirm the account. VERY IMPORTANT - select Japan as your country of residence. Next, you’ll need to enable your account for beta access by logging in with your new Bandai-Namco ID. 


**Downloading and installing the launcher and game** Now you can download the game’s launcher and get it installed. Even in japanese, installers have a familiar look and feel, so you’ll be fine without translation. After it’s installed, you’ll want to click the large orange button in order to start the download. It’ll take a few hours to finish.

After the game has installed, you’ll need to patch to the latest version, so click the orange button again and click OK at the prompt. It’ll take another while, just let it run.

* http://i.imgur.com/ZKk3f.png

Now you’re ready to play, but hold on just one moment. Create a shortcut on the desktop and then right-click the shortcut and add “./data” after the GundamOnline.exe in the path (the first line). Now if you try and launch the game, you won’t be able to log in. The game is region-locked, so you’ll have to connect through a VPN.


**Getting and configuring the VPN** Yes, this part is annoying. We don’t want to game through a VPN, but we’ll put up with it in the meantime. The game works well even with the slightly higher latency (you’ll be connecting to Japanese servers either way, so expect high ping). The best solution I’ve found so far is [WTFast](http://www.wtfast.com) , which has a free 30day trial, which should be more than enough time to decide if you like the gameplay. It’s $5 a month after that, which wouldn’t be too bad for an otherwise F2P game. After installing WTFast, you’ll want to configure it as shown below and then start the game profile with the Tokyo server selected.

**Main menu overview** From the main menu, you’ll notice two primary areas. First, there is a bar at the top of the game that persists across every menu before you’re actually fighting. Click the buttons to jump to the corresponding area of the interface Mousing over each icon will give you shortcuts to each of the submenus, and I’ll provide translations for the important ones shortly. Aside from the menu at the top, you’ll have several large buttons in the center of the screen.

We can afford to pay it but have no money for savings or even to buy groceries. We we need to get rid of the car. We are about 3,000 dollars upside-down in terms of what we've been offered (owe 21k, offered 18k).  We have tried to get a loan to cover the difference, through our credit union and Wells Fargo and sites like LendingClub and Prosper. Denied, denied, denied.

We have an income tax refund coming that could be enough to pay the difference. But we wanted to use that money for tickets to visit my sister in England. My family is going in May and the plane tickets and passports would be almost the whole refund check. 

Basically, I'm running out of options. We can not get a loan because of our debt, we can't pay off our debt because we can't save up money. I'm sick of seeing my wife cry and not having a clue what to do. I need the money as soon as possible because we have to buy the tickets next month. If we have our car payment we won't be able to go.

* Sitting at 21% of $13,000 between 4 cards, and 3 have a balance. I'll be getting ~$800 back from the IRS by the end of February, hopefully, and another ~$500 from work (reimbursement of monthly expenses). If I use that extra cash to pay off some CC debt, I should be looking at around 11-12% CU.

**Student Loans**

* $9,900

**Credit History**

* Eight years of credit history

* Zero late payments

* Zero negatives on my report

Moving up entails: Unlimited withdrawals vs 3 withdrawals a month, higher interest rate (0.08-0.12% depending on amount of money in account) vs what it was (0.01%!) 
- only necessity is to have $2,500 at least in the account to not inquire a $12 monthly fee, and in the savings account it only needs $300 to not inquire a $5 monthly fee.

personalfinance,"Need some advice, is this a good plan?","Six months ago I signed a new car lease for a 2012 vehicle with $0 down and payments of 390 a month. Recently, I studied out the contract and found out that by the time I'm done paying for the car, the total would come out to 29K for a car worth 20K. The 29K total is the total combined payments from the 3 year lease + the residual value of the vehicle. I drive about 30k miles a year so returning the car after the lease is over isn't really an option; i would have to pay close to 3 grand in excess mileage fees. Alternatively, If i decide to purchase the car, I have to deal with tax, lic. and registration and probably a higher interest rate. Everything is looking pretty bad to this point. I would also REALLY like to lower my monthly payments by at least $100 a month and downgrading my vehicle to something more affordable might be the way to go, I would also save about $50 dollars a month on insurance. I have been thinking of an alternative and here is what I've thought about so far. I sell the car to CarMax for $21,500 and take out a small loan to pay the difference (the car payoff is 26K, so I would take out a small loan for $4,500). Next step would be to get into another vehicle with 0 down and payments of $250-$280 per month; not a lease but finance it. I have already been in negotiations with some dealerships and have gotten these quotes and I could save quite a bit a month. In summary, I have potential savings of $190 per month, plus saving 2K when the lease is up to purchase the car or saving 3K+ for returning the car when the lease is up. If I add up the 190 per month for 3 years + 2K, that's almost 9K in savings just in three years. 9K - 4.5K loan, i'm still saving 4.5K.

personalfinance,Question about state income taxes and itemizing deductions,"EDIT: ISSUE IS SOLVED! Thanks to people who replied!

I've never had to itemize deductions before (mid/late 20's, renting), but some out of the ordinary stuff happened this year, and it looks like I might exceed the standard deduction ($5950 for single filer for 2012 correct?)

* I had $3510 of unreimbursed dental expenses.  These are clearly deductible

* I contributed to a Roth IRA and paid my part of employer health care (paid pre-tax), but to my understanding neither are deductible.

* I had $2150 withheld as state income tax.  From my reading of the 1040 instructions, page A-3, I can deduct this and don't have to reduce it by expected refund.  (As an aside question, why don't people who itemize increase their state withholding amount to reduce their federal income tax?)

* I donated clothing valued at about $150 

* I paid about $800 in student loan interest.  

My only question is whether student loan interest paid is a deduction, or reduces taxable income.  If it's the latter, my deductions total around $6600.  So should I be itemizing?  If student loan interest isn't lumped in, my total is only ~$5800.  Are there any obvious deductions I'm missing to put me over the top?

Thanks

EDIT: So I found a site that clearly says student loan interest is ""above the line"" (pre-AGI) so it doesn't contribute to this amount.  I guess I'll try to look for more deductions or just take the standard deduction.  Sucks, I was hoping to get some tax benefit for all my unexpected dental costs.

EDIT 2: Reading [this site](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/09/overlooked-tax-deductions.asp#axzz2JOl7aX3p) it appears to say that I have to subtract 2% of my AGI from miscellaneous deductions, and 7.5% of my AGI from medical expenses if I itemize.

I'm 24 and make ~60k/yr.  I have a solid amount of student loan debt that I am paying ~$1k/mo into and should be paid off in under 8 years, but I don't have any credit card/car debt.

I live in an area with very cheap property costs, but it is hard to know if I will be biting off more than I can chew with purchasing a house.  I probably wouldn't even be considering it, but I'm already paying $750 a month on rent, and if I were to buy a house, I would be looking for a 4br/2ba and renting out the basement.

Obviously there are a lot of pros/cons about purchasing a house, but I have only a very shallow knowledge of all things personalfinance work.  I'm going to lay out my perspective below, and if you are able, please correct my misconceptions, any any additional advice would be much appreciated.


Pros:
- Purchasing an asset like a house will be hugely valuable long term.  I can do things like take lines of credit against the house and use that money to pay off my student loans, but at a lower interest rate.  (but perhaps this is dumb and I should just rent a place and use the disposable income to pay off my loans quicker?)

- Renting out the basement will bring the cost of my mortgage down to the point where I am not paying much more for housing that I am currently

- If I decide to move in 5ish years (and I can sell the place), it will be much easier to purchase a new place than it would be if I was renting over the next 5 years.... Obviously the place wont likely sell for some time, but during that time hopefully I can rent out the top and bottom separately and have the mortgage pay for itself.... (too optimistic?)

- The housing market will likely be getting better in the next 5-10 years, so it is better to buy now when the costs are down and interest rates are down, then it is to wait

Cons:
- Purchasing a house is a long term commitment, and I wont likely find a buying once I am ready to move, and it may hamper my ability to change jobs/move out of state

- there are a lot of hidden costs when buying vs renting - shit breaks, etc

- I could be using my disposable income to pay off student loans with a high interest rate, and buy a house down the road once they are closer to being paid off + by then likely having a higher salary.

- A lot more work - being a landlord, maintenance, mowing the lawn, etc (not too bad of a con though imo)


I feel like I'm missing several cons that I was thinking about while writing out the pros section... hmmm.

Anyway to have a better understanding of my financial situation, here is my income/bills

Income

~$4000/mo take home - fluctuates based on quarterly bonuses, but $4000 is current average (although it has been increasing steadily since I started the job).  I also expect a raise when I get another certification in August.

Bills
- Student loans - $1000
- Rent - $750 (all inclusive)
- 401k - ~$200
- food, gas, entertainment etc - ~$500

I currently live with my girlfriend, but I make significantly more than she does, and most of her income goes to her student loans, and she takes on several of our additional bills.  We have been together for 3 years, so things are serious, but I think I would rather take on the mortgage of the house myself so that we don't financially intertwine ourselves without being married first.


Any help is much appreciated.  I've been reading a lot over the last few days, but still don't have a firm grasp on all of this.  I really wish they had taught some sort of intro to finance class as a required core class in university.  Important shit to know, and there is a large gaping hole in my understanding.

If I look at my monthly expenses and the mortgage interest tax deduction that I would get, I think that I could afford a monthly mortgage payment including everything of about $3500-$4000.  This would allow me to afford a 1 bedroom condo at a price of 450K to 500K.  Unfortunately, I don't have the $100K to put on a down payment at this point, but I do have about $50k.  If I were to buy a place now, I would have to pay PMI, but I could probably get up to 20% in like 1-2 years and get that removed.  The other option is to just wait the probably 2-3 years it would take to get the other $50K to have the 20% down.  

When I run the numbers and I try to predict my net worth in 3-5 years, it seems like be higher if I buy a place now (mostly increased by more equity in the house) versus just waiting and renting for like 3 more years.  Plus, I would be able to take advantage of the lower home prices and interest rates that currently exist.  But, this would all come with the higher risk of 10% down on a house.  

What is your opinion on my particular situation?  What should I do: buy now or wait?

Edit:  Thanks to everyone for pointing out my math error!!!!  I feel so dumb (for some reason, I was thinking about my emergency fund of $25k when I wrote the post, which will probably have to be higher if I buy a place too.)",finance,1359443376
personalfinance,"23 year old recent college graduate, about to get married with questions.","Hello r/personalfinance,

I'm a young 23-year old recent college graduate taking home about 3650 a month after taxes. I live at home and have no debt. I also have a decent emergency fund of about $3,000, but I'm trying to get that to $5,000 in the next few months. Here's a breakdown of my expenses.

Cell Phone $100/Mo
Gas $100/Mo
Roth 401k  deductions $200/Mo. (enough to max out company contributions)
Car Insurance $90/Mo 

My question is this-- my Fiancee owes about $50k (~6.7%)in student loans. She doesn't really make much money (takehome about $700/Mo) but her loan payments are about 500/Mo. I'm trying my best to help pay her loans down before we get married and rent an apartment. I've only started paying them this month (hoping to pay off ~$2,000/Mo.) 

Here's my question-- taxes. For next year, is there any kind of tax exemption or deduction I could qualify for due to paying off these loans for her? Interest deduction? We're not going to be married until September, if that makes a difference.

We've also considered consolidating her loans to see if we could get a better interest rate, but I'm unsure what the credit impact would be as well as if it's worth it to get a better interest rate but give up the ability to suspend payements( as 1/2 of the loans are federally subsidized.) I know now I could get a 60 month, $25,000 loan at 2.99% through USAA. 

Any other observations on my living situation? I'm trying to pay off as much as I can before real expenses start popping up.",finance,1359432148

personalfinance,780k in cash.  Should I completely pay off my mortgage?,"I'm 38 and married with three children.  I've been a conservative investor and started saving early but I could use some advice and opinions from people.

I have been successful by starting several businesses in the past, growing them for 3-5 years, and then selling them off.  That is my intent right now, but if it doesn't work I will go back to the corporate world and make $100-150k/yr in the technology world again and work my current business as an after hours project.

I am currently sitting on around $780k in cash.  As I mentioned I tend to be fairly conservative and I have felt great having a nice sized safety net.  I also left my job last year and started my own business, so at the moment I have little real income coming in.  Living expenses are around $125k a year.

My current mortgage has $375k on it at a 4.625% interest rate.  This all came up because I looked into refinancing down to 3.5%.  This would mostly end up a wash long term without additional principle payments, but would lower my monthly payment around $300.

Current net worth is $2.8M including my current mortgage debt.   I have $1.2M in annuities paying $30-50k a year in interest, $350k in 401k/IRA accounts, $400k managed by a financial planning firm with more active/semiactive stock positions, $125k in Prosper and some non-liquid investments into privately held companies.

No car loans or other debt, and I pay off my credit cards in full every month.  Credit score is 804.

Here's the big question mark.  Intellectually, I know that I should be able to beat 3.5% long term with other investments.  However, part of me feels like given the size of my exposure to stocks and other investments, I am better off paying off the mortgage than sitting on piles of cash.  The cash is earning me at best 1% pre-tax.

I like the flexibility of the cash and the runway it provides, but I'm starting to feel like it's stupid to waste $25k a year on mortgage interest and principal payments when I don't really have to.

I'd love to hear some opinions from folks here.  

Throwaway for obvious reasons, but I am happy to answer any questions people have.

I just received a W2 with my address on it from a company, but with somebody else's name on it. I have never worked for this company before (but I did apply there about four years ago), and I'm so confused right now as to what to do. I'm going to call social security tomorrow, but the problem is, I'm not convinced it's a ""real"" W2. Wouldn't a large company and/or the federal government check to see if the name matched the social? Why did the W2 go to **MY** address, and not to the woman who stole my ssn? I'm wondering if this could, in any way, be a scam? I'm not sure how that would benefit the scammers though. 

Also, aside from calling the credit bureaus/ss office, what should I do? Will this mess up my tax return? Should I include it on my tax return (even though I'm clearly not the person that used it)? Has this ever happened to anyone before? What could possibly be going on here?

personalfinance,My unsolicited by fairly solid personal finance advice for you 20 something redditors posting questions in r/personalfinance.,"There seems to be a lot of questions here especially regarding debt and investing that keep coming in the 20 something age range so I wanted to share a bit of advice general advice.  Think of it coming from your 10 year future self ;)  

DEBT
If you are 20 something and in CC or student loan debt your main focus should be paying off your loans even if they have a manageable monthly fee.  CC debit is terrible.  If you have CC debt stop what you are doing and cut expenses and get that paid off.  Student loan debt should also be paid off as soon as you can even if the interest rate is lowish.  If you are in debt and see others posting about investing and start feeling like ""maybe i should start investing too!"" please realize that PAYING OFF YOUR DEBT IS INVESTING IN YOUR FUTURE.  Paying off your debt means guaranteed return on your money and you'll be getting out of paying some company tens of thousands of dollars. This is money that is coming straight out of your future self's bank account.

Once you get out of debt be very wary of debt.  Remember that nobody gets anything for free.  Debt just means someone else is making money off of your shortsighted vision of the future.  The easier the debt is the more money they are making off of you.  

INVESTING
Once you are out of debt investing is important so if you are 20 something and asking questions about investing you are in great shape.  Take a deep breath and know that the most valuable investment you can make is to learn about the basics of investing and building up the habit of investing.  Knowledge gathering and habit forming are way more important than what specific mutual fund you invest in.  It takes time so be patient and learn before you invest.  Over time knowing what you are investing will be much more important than an extra month or two in the stock market.  Ask questions like ""what should i look for in a mutual fund?"", ""what is an expense ratio?"", ""what is an index?"" instead of ""where should i put my hard earned money"".

LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS
This is by far the most important bit of information I can pass on to you.  We live in a culture that does not encourage this but please please please live below your means.  Avoid the temptation of lifestyle inflation.  Keep track of your expenses and know where your money is going.  Remember it isn't how much you make that counts but how much you keep.

That is all.  Be well fellow denizens of the internet.

Currently I'm in a smallish apartment, but tons of devices. 
2 Gaming desktops, both wired. 
2 Xbox 360's (mainly used for streaming netflix). 
Multiple smartphones at any given time and
2 Laptops 

Almost always have at least 3 of these devices running. However lately it's impossible for someone to game while another is on netflix or vice-versa.

I'm looking into buying a new router, I think I've decided between the ASUS N66U or the newer AC66U, just have a couple questions for those more knowledgeable. 

-  The price difference is only about 20$. Is there really any reason not to go for the newer version?

-  What exactly is this ac band? Real world application for me?

-  Do you have a completely different router suggestion?

personalfinance,Options for debt management: How do I get the smallest interest rate on my debt?,"Hi guys. I have a LOT  of debt in credit cards and loans.  I finally have a job making 100k annually and can make steady payments on my debt, building my credit score back up.

gaming,Razer Sabertooth Controller: First hands-on (limited) Impressions,"So, Fedex just delivered my Razer Sabertooth controller. I'm at work right now so I cant fully test it yet. But I CAN tell you that right off the bat, it is the best ergonomically designed controller I've ever held. It fits perfectly in my hands. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like the controller is gripping my hands rather than my hand gripping the controller. I know, it's crazy, but true.

It kind of feels slighly smaller than a standard MS 360 controller and slightly lighter. It does however, feel sturdy. Definitely NOT cheaply made.

The entire controller has this rubberized outer coating that adds a really nice and grippy feel, which I really like. The buttons feel near-perfectly placed and easily/quickly accessible to each one my fingers. 

The A,B,X,Y buttons are shorter than those of the standard 360 controller and have a slight click to them which makes pressing them feel quicker and more definite. No more spongy 360 buttons that often fail to respond for me.

The D-pad is much better, as each directional button is seperate and smaller than those on the Onza (which were a complete mess). Think: Playstation D-pad. No more inaccurate 360 mush pad.

So far, I'm very pleased with the feel and appearance of the Sabertooth. Sabertooth's design team deserves high marks for this one. 

Next, comes the real test -- The Sabertooth's responsiveness while rocking some BF3 later tonight. 


[Updated]

So, I configured the buttons as I wanted and got to playing bf3. It took me a few moments to get used to using the new configuration, which lead to me dying a few times (I was able to bury a few enemies quicker than normally tho once I remembered where the new button scheme was). But I have to say that the buttons and infact, the entire controller was noticably more responsive and quicker than any other I've used so far. It's definitely worth the money IMO.

[UPDATED AGAIN]

I have noticed that there is a slight crackling sound every few seconds when I use my Sabertooth with my Astro A40 headset. I've heard of others complaining about this sound when using the Sabertooth with this particular headset aswell. I've emailed Razer, asking whether there is any fix for this -- perhaps some driver update or something. I'll update this post when they reply.",technology,1359571726
personalfinance,"How should I handle my ""emergency"" fund and other short-term savings?","My wife and I have an emergency fund holding $10,000 (at .9% interest, accessible in 2-3 days from online savings account SmartyPig) and a savings account buffer for non-regular expenses that never goes below $8,000 (traditional bank, ~ .25% interest). Our checking account generally stays at a balance of $3,500 after monthly expenses paid and paychecks deposited.

Not including student loans which could be deferred, our normal monthly spending is around $3,000, but we could probably cut down to $2,500 in a true emergency. We have two relatively equal incomes totaling about $100,000 before taxes, and believe the risk is low that we'll both lose jobs at once (my job function is unique at my work and protected from layoffs by union).

Only debt is huge student loans at various interest rates, but paid for by loan assistance from our former university at about 80-90%, so no interest in paying those down for now. Will be fully paid off in 7 years. We have a mortgage at 3.375%, well above 20% equity.

We both have 403(b) plans, but just recently made our first contributions to a Roth IRA, Vanguard 2045 target-date fund. My wife is contributing 7% to her 403(b), I'm currently contributing 5%. Both of us have passed the employer match for 403(b). Both Roth IRAs are at $2000 apiece, so we still could contribute $3000 each for tax year 2012. Also put $2,000 in a 529 plan for our 1 year old kid this year. Total retirement funds are at $35,000 and we are 30.

What's the best place to put our money? I have a nagging sense that we have too much cash in our emergency fund and our savings account buffer. I've started to automate some contributions to our online SmartyPig account for irregular expenses, like a replacement car (3 year horizon) and Christmas gifts. That should reduce our need to tap the savings account buffer and help track it better. We automate $1000 into that buffer account every month and then slowly drain it for purchases outside of our regular budget; I automated moving some of it each month to the SmartyPig targeted savings accounts.

I think we need at least $5,000 in cash for a true emergency, and the rest of the funds could be slightly less liquid. What would /r/pf recommend for the remaining $13,000? Keep it as cash in low-interest accounts and accept the lack of return? Put more in IRA and withdraw contributions only if needed? Invest in a short-term fund? I got the investing ""bug"" a bit after opening 3 investment accounts in one month, and I admit I might be over-thinking this :)

The only other big expense I can see coming up is that we have talked about renovating our kitchen at some point. We have a 1980s kitchen, and know we will probably need to move if we have a second kid once they get a little older, say in 5-7 years. We plan to renovate before then to help move the property faster and would like to enjoy the benefits of the renovation ourselves, so hopefully renovate in the next 1-2 years. However, the max we would be willing to spend on this is $10,000.",finance,1359570393

What I'm wondering is what is the best way to manage this? Should I pay off the loan ASAP or make payments that they suggest?

Some questions about credit. Right now I have a credit score of about 670. It's low because Verizon falsely claimed I didn't pay my last bill, though I did. How can I fix that/can I even? I only have one credit card, because the two other cards I've applied for turned me down (Discover student and Amazon visa) I'd really like to grow my credit more, but it seems impossible to do so.

What would be the best way to save my money?

-----------------------------------------------

My story starts in a city....

It is the middle of the night. The moon is shining through the windows of the hospital that I had just gotten to a few hours before. This place was still new to me. It was an eerie feeling seeing the empty streets outside in the town with the occasional brain eating citizen ever few yards. The swing set in the local play yard could be heard screeching in the wind now and again. I truly felt alone. 

I walked outside of the single patient room that I had hid myself in, and headed down the dark hallway of the first floor. Loot! Finally canned beans! ""Who would leave this here?"" I asked myself in a whisper at my monitor as I scoffed it down like the hungry alone animal I was. I considered the possibility that there were more things for me to find in this place and continued searching in the hallways and rooms. 

I had a decent collection of materials now. Blood-packs, bandages, painkillers, soda; enough to keep me alive. There was still one need that I had to fulfill. Human contact. It was time to try. I headed to the second floor. I could swear it was darker here than the last floor. I stumble away from the staircase only to fall off the balcony, breaking at least one of my legs. I spend zero time hesitating to check my gear for morphine to resolve the new situation; none. I look up out of my bag to see a zombie limp past me as I lay exposed in front of the opened main doors. My own adrenaline fuels the speed of my reactions now. I react quickly again, pulling myself to and up the staircase once again, making sure to avoid the same mistakes. I make my way into a room on the north facing side of the building and pull out my flashlight. 

I suppose I do realize now the danger of revealing a position when you are alone. There are people out there looking for that same thing you want, survival, but some people do it at your expense. I lit my flashlight up and sent a pattern of flashing beams to the other buildings across the courtyard our front. No response... I flash them again, this time higher up. No response.... In one more attempt I shine at a large building to my right, shortly followed with the sound of pellets breaking through my window and hitting me in my arm. I fall to the floor bleeding and without usable legs. One step at a time.

I patch up my wound and stay laying down under the windowsill for 10 more minutes. Occasionally bullets whiz through the window a few more times, confirming to me that he cannot see any better then I can. I crawl out of the room and make my way up to the third floor where I find roof access. I can wait in here with nothing but my pistol or see what lies on the roof for weapons. I try my luck with the roof. I crawl out to the roof, and the moonlight shines on my back. ""This place is beautiful,"" I realize, in an apocalyptic, dark, kind of way.

Oh but whats this?! A double barrel shotgun. A defensive weapon for a broken legged man? I do think so. I slowly inch my way to it, knowing that at any second, the man who shot at me could see me, and my trip would be over....I got it! Excited, I back myself away, behind the roof access walls, making me exposed only to the south, east, and west, enough food to last me the standoff.

My adrenaline rushes at every sound and creak that I hear. My hand trembles on my still mouse, and I bite the skin off my lip in anxiety of the situation. Then I hear it. Footsteps. Getting quieter though...wait no. They are getting louder. He is on the steps. He must be on the steps. Louder...closer....THERE, in the window of the roof access room, I can see him passing down the hallway to the roof. I pull up my shotgun. This is it.... He comes around the corner... Off goes my gun. Once, BAM. Missed just to the right of the shoulder. Agitated he fires back with his pistol. Strange. That is not the weapon I was being fired upon with earlier. BAM, second shot, missed again! I am regretting the choice of the shotgun from hell, and quickly fumble my way though my gear to try to get out my pistol as well while he is reloading. He heads back through the hallway and gets out through the other end, onto the roof. I wasn't quick enough, and he arose as victor. My enemy had won. 

A new day dawned and I felt like I did not just respawn .... but instead was sent back for a purpose. That purpose was clear, and I set off, with my marker on the hospital set for my GPS.

* My wife and I are currently saving 10% of our gross salaries in our respective 401(k) and 5% each in Roth IRAs. 4% match for her, 5% for me.

* We currently have no debt, except for our mortgage, which we refinanced last year: 192k, 30 years, 3.875% interest.  We haven't made any extra payments.  We are underwater on the loan by about 20k, but have no PMI (VA loan refinance).

* We gross 148k combined.  After monthly expenses including 529 contributions for our two children, daycare, discretionary spending, etc we have roughly 1k left (working on bumping that up some) to invest.

* 6 months of net income as an emergency fund spread out in a savings account and laddered CDs plus another 30k in add'l savings.

* We currently have ~70k saved for retirement (we only recently increased our contributions above the employer match).

* If I never get a promotion again, I'm looking at about 20k/yr net for my federal retirement starting at age 62.  That includes deductions for taxes, healthcare, and survivor benefit.

personalfinance,Do I pay off my car now or in 3 to 6 months? ($3170 owed),"I'm assuming this will be an easy answer, but I have never been effective with finances; I thought I would ask here.

With my upcoming tax refund, I'll be able to completely pay off my car. My refund is, no joke, $10 over what I owe. I've been paying the minimum on my car for the past 5.5 years ($540/mo because of horrific 17.9% interest the cause of which would take too long to detail so I'll just say I ate an entire bag of dumb). I've made some major extra payments around tax refund season in the past and managed to spend an entire year paying $100 over the minimum every month. I had to regress back to minimum payments because it was eating in to other parts of my budget.

Thanks to this massive debt and massive financial stupidity in my early 20s, my credit rating is poor to fair depending at which reading bureau is referenced. The only other debt I have is a motorcycle I bought to save gas which is a mediocre $130 per month. I owe $5000 on that and the interest rate is only 3%.

If I pay the car off now, I'll have an extra $540 per month and could afford to up my savings budget from $300 per month to about $510 per month without worrying about having to tap in to it for unexpected things every so often. However, my wife's green card is about to expire in ~~a few months~~ March and renewing that for 10 years costs $600. I could use half the tax refund to pay for the car and the other half for my wife's visa (and still have an extra $600 or so left). Paying the car off now would save me $70 in interest over the 6 months (roughly $11.xx every month), but it's going to be paid off in 6 months anyhow.

I'm assuming the response will be ""pay off that stupid car you complete asshat"" which is my initial thought. That said, I would much rather get audited by the IRS than ever, ever have to deal with USCIS and immigration difficulties and fees again. This refund would really help in that regard.

One other thing to note: in March, I will be getting a pay raise from $2800 to $3100 per month.",finance,1359650041

personalfinance,Need advice on avoiding bankruptcy,"Well folks I am anxious, depressed and scared. Things seem to have just gone wrong lately and although it's fine now I'm really worried about what's going to happen and unsure how to prepare. Here's the deal: 4 years ago I got divorced, had to move across the country, and had a house that I couldn't sell. Started having to pay child support, even though I have custody of the kids 50% of the time. Had to rent the house out, at a loss, to some people who trashed it. I racked up a lot of CC debt pre-divorce fixing up the house to sell. Last year we managed to sell the house, but I had to put about another $20k into it to fix the damage the tenants had done.

Things were ok. But I've had to major swings here. First, my pay was cut due to the payroll tax holiday expiration. Second, I'm going to owe the IRS pretty significantly due to the sale of the rental property (which was profitable by the IRS standards thanks to recaptured depreciation). On top of that, I moved last year to a place that was marginally more expensive than where I was, but that I'm pretty positive will have the rent increased this summer.

At the moment I have a part time gig which means I am in no danger of not being able to pay the bills. However, if that part time work goes away I'm screwed. My goal has always been to use that part time work to pay off debt and make sure I can live on my salary alone. And now that's not an option and it scares me...

Here's a breakdown of my current monthly expenses:

Salary Income (after taxes and child support): $3,983.03 / month
Part time income: $2,000 / month

And my current expenses:

* Rent - $1,295
* Power / Water - $100 a month (average)
* Natural Gas - $100 a month (average)
* Garbage - $20
* Cell Phone - $168 (2 phones)
* Auto Insurance - $150 (teen driver on policy)
* Cable/Internet - $84
* Web Hosting - $20 (needed for side work)
* Backblaze online backups - $5
* Hulu - $7.99
* Netflix - $7.99
* School Lunches - $50
* Car Payment - $322
* Student Loan - $127
* Debt Management Plan - $778
* Credit Card Minimums - $280 (a few store cards, amex not eligable for dmp)
* IRS - $150 (installment plan I'll have to take out for taxes)
* Taxes - $952 (state/federal/self employment saved from each months side work)

So at the moment I've got:

Income: $5,938
Expenses: $4,615

Free Income: $1,323

I'm reasonably frugal. I don't drive much so I spend less than $100 a month on gas. I can feed me and my family reasonably well for $400 a month ($150 a week when I have 3 kids with me, $50 a week when I don't). I think as long as things continue as is I can have a surplus of about $600 a month. 

My current debts are:

* $25,000 on Debt Management plan (6-9% interest rates, 3.5 years left on plan)
* $8,800 credit card debt not on DMP (many at 0% now, normal rates ranging from 13% to 25%)
* $8,700 balance on car loan (16.49%, 34 months left)
* $10,000 student loan (3.8%)
* $8,200 owed to the IRS come April (will go on an installment plan)

However, things could change. Like I said I'm positive my rent will go up this summer. I don't know how much. I know they were desperate to rent when I came in here. It's a property management company so they don't really care about me personally, they just look at the $. I could try and find somewhere cheaper if they raise it, however it costs money to move and it's hard to find a place big enough for a family of 4 in a part of town that is convenient to the kids schools. On top of my rent worry, there's also the possibility that my second job could go away. I anticipate it continuing on through the end of the year at least, and they consider me essentially a part time employee for the forseeable future, but there are no guarantees. I do receive quarterly bonuses of about $900 through my job and I do think that I will be ok with that, except if my rent increases...

So that's my situation. I'm scared that my side income will go away and I'll be really screwed. I'm also scared that my rent will go up and I won't be able to afford it or won't be able to afford to move. 

For the time being all I can say is I can devote about $600 a month excess to...something (plus another $900 a quarter in bonuses). But I keep waffling about what to do with it. On the one hand I want to save it and have it for emergencies. Or to just have a nest egg if things go bad and I need time to figure out what to do. On the other hand I feel like I could be putting that towards either my car payment, or my non DMP debt to get those items paid off sooner, which would make my monthly budget work better. My current auto loan balance is $8,700 @ 16.49 and the non DMP credit card debts total $8,800 with several at 0% interest through may - august. Getting the car paid off would free up $322 a month to absorb a rent increase. 

I'm not sure what to do here. And I'm paranoid I'll do the wrong thing and will end up having to file for bankruptcy. This would royally suck because I'd have to wait 6 months to file (for my second job income to be removed from my 6 month lookback), during which time I'd be unable to pay all the debts and would be hounded by creditors. On top of that I'm afraid even Chapter 13 wouldn't help me because I only have 1 dependent but have half time custody of 3 kids, so I'm worried I wouldn't get a reasonable budget approved (as my housing, clothing and other expenses need to account for 4 people). Plus, in a chapter 13 I'm stuck with a payment plan for 5 years that would leave little room to build up savings for emergencies.

I've babbled on long enough here, but at the moment I'm really nervous and stressed and I'm not sure what the best course of action is. I keep telling myself right now things are fine and there's no use worrying about what might happen, but I'm a worrier and feel like I lack a plan to deal with the worst case scenario...",finance,1359603481
personalfinance,"$3100 monthly take home, no savings, renter, multiple charge-offs, and $11k in debt. Where to go from here?","Hi r/pf,

I'm *finally* pulling my damn head out of the sand and looking for advice on the best way to move forward.

Long story short, I'm almost thirty and have spent the past eight years wastefully and its had a ruinous effect on my credit.

This needs to stop, and that realization came to a head today courtesy of a $750 tax levy on my checking account. 

As it stands, after making a long series of phone calls tracking down outstanding debts, I have uncovered that I am around $11k in debt.

* 40% old credit card debt, willing to settle
* 40% federal back taxes (combined effect of years doing nonprofit work and a year and a half un/underemployed)
* 20% state back taxes, misc. charged-off debt, and bank overdraft account repayment

I also have zero in savings and nothing invested. No 401k, no emergency fund.

All things considered, I'm fairly fortunate in my foolishness: eleven thousand dollars isn't insurmountable. It's just embarrassing, especially as I'm staring down my thirtieth birthday.

I could use some suggestions on how to tackle all this, and in what order. 

* Drag out the federal taxes as long as possible and, in the meantime, pay off everything else?
* Build a $1k starter emergency fund before anything, and then go from there?
* The Charge-Offs have already done their damage to my credit score, so can/should I go ahead and settle or pay in full?
