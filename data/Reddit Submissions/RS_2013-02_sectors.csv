personalfinance,Should I pay off our house or student debt?,"Hello everyone, I was wondering if I could get advice on this issue my husband and I are debating on. We bought a house about two years ago that was purposely under our budget because we knew that with one income of around $25k a year we would be OK (I wanted to stay at home with our son while I finished school). We have about $55k on the house left. I recently graduated and have been offered a job that will pretty much double our income. After taxes, childcare, health insurance (Yay!), and saving up for a second car, we figured we could pay off our house in three to four years. However, I also have $60k in student debt which averages about 6% interest. A lot of places say to pay off debt first home later. However, my husband wants to pay off the home first since after 5 years of working I would qualify for loan forgiveness (I am a teacher) and whatever is left we could get a home line of credit. Since he works for the bank we would qualify for a discount. 

Should we do what most experts say and pay off the student debt first and the house second? Or should we pay off our home, wait for the loan forgiveness and get an equity line with a lower interest rate for what is left? Thanks for reading!",finance,1359763076
personalfinance,Advice on buying a home,"Hey guys! I realize this question has literally books written on it but I couldn't think of an easier way to sum the question up. Here goes!

My fiancee and I are looking to buy a home within the next year. I recently paid off all my student loans and am 100% debt free (yay) so I'm able to set aside a good portion of my monthly income to save for the down payment. 

Here's where it gets tricky though. I have never had a credit card, stubbornly refuse to if it can be prevented and was told by a mortgage refinancing specialist at my bank that all the years I was keeping up to date with my student loans count for nothing as they can only impact my credit negatively if I stopped paying. As a result, it seems like I have really no credit since I've never otherwise had a car payment or any other debt. She's self-employed and her income isn't really substantial at this point. She also has some credit card debt and for a number of different reasons, her credit isn't the greatest. Our current plan is to not include her on the loan as it would just serve to hurt our debt:income ratio. 

So I guess my questions are thus: 
1) Is it true that student loans don't impact credit? Honestly, whenever bankers at my bank (Chase) talk, I just assume it's a sales pitch and that anything they tell me is just bullshit to hurt me and help them. 
2) Is it actually worth opening up 2-3 lines of credit via credit cards and keeping them active for 2-3 years (cards that I have absolutely no use otherwise) just to save a few points on my interest rates? I realize that over 15 years, little points add up to hundreds, if not thousands but I really hate the concept of credit and would like to avoid it.
3) Am I overreacting in my hatred of credit cards? I really strongly feel that they're just ways to kept people in debt and the fact that I feel forced to use them to prove I am good with credit in order to acquire more credit is asinine when the only credit I need in the first place is for a home loan. Maybe I'm wrong though?

I realize this is a lot but as someone who is trying really hard to be financially responsible, any sound advice will be taken to heart. Thanks for your help!

edit: Apparently I was mistaken slightly. The fiancee has informed me that her credit isn't necessarily bad, she just has debt.",finance,1359757759

Banking,Forecasting Bank Deposits,"I am interested in forecasting bank deposits using a Genetic Algorithm similar to what is described in the following link:

I have a simple math background and have some experience with basic regression forecasting.  There are many reasons that normal regression is insufficient in forecasting bank deposits but the most important is that the variables (ie LIBOR, Fed Funds, US Domestic GDP, Unemployment, etc.) are all very corellated to each other thus cancelling each other out.  Can anyone recommend good software (preferably a free excel add in) that can help?  Also, the article above is relatively technical and I could use some help breaking down the process into pieces that can be explained simply.  Thanks.",finance,1359745157

I have a student loan that I don't *have* to start making payments on until 2015 although I wouldn't mind knocking it out before then ($5,249 at 3% interest). The interest doesn't start until 2015.

I don't make a significant amount of money, $17.50/hour full time with partial benefits. My father is helping me out with the school loan some.

Is it okay to be putting money away in my 401k? I figure my returns on it overtime will significantly outweigh the low interest rates on both of my loans although I haven't done the math.

personalfinance,I have a huge amount of student loan debt.  I'm trying to lower my interest rates (not my monthly payments),"Hey Reddit,

I have a serious amount of student loan debt, and the interest rates are killer.  I'm trying to figure out if there are ways for me to lower my interest rates so that I can save myself some money in the long run. I'm currently trying to pay these all off in under 8 years.  Hopefully less.

I still plan on making the same - if not larger - loan payments every month, I'm just looking for a way to lower these awefully high interest rates  --- dumb mistakes at 18 where I just went with the flow if the student loan system without doing proper research.


I plan on going into my credit union later today to see if they will be willing to give me a line of credit to use to pay off my other debts.  I would assume my interest would be lower this way, but I'm a complete newbie when it comes to understanding personalfinance.

Here are my loans roughly itemized:

- Loan 1 = $6,722.29 @ 9%   -- paying $173/mo

- Loan 2 = $4,139.87 @ 6.8% -- paying $51.86/mo


- Loan 3 = $25,942.72 @ 5ish%  -- paying $230.42/mo

- Loan 4 = $14,108 @ 8.25%  -- paying $194.57/mo

- Loan 5 = $7,220.58 @ 7.65% -- paying $99.44/mo

- Loan 6 = $22,746.35 @ ~6%  -- paying $192/mo

Total payments each month = ~ $941
Total to pay back is $80,579.37

- Loan 1 and 2 were taken out by my parents in their name.  They are parent plus, and a private loan from Sallie Mae.

- Loan 3 is a loan my parents gave to me that they got from a line of credit on their house.

- Loan 5 and 6 are in my name and from the government


I'm paying my parents each month, and they are simply using that money and putting it directly into the loans.


My main questions are - 

- will consolidating to a private loan help me?  

- Will it give me lower interest rates?

- Can I consolidate my parent's loans with the other loans I have?

Any advice, help, or pure information would be extremely helpful.

Thanks you very much!

personalfinance,"Should I use most of my savings to buy out my lease? Or should I just finance it? (US, FL)","I'm going to be keeping my 2010 Honda Civic at the end of its lease(I know leasing wasn't a good idea in the first place, my mom talked me into it). The payoff amount is about $12k. I make $45k/year, I'm recently married and my husband makes ~$25k(not sure the exact amount, his hours vary). We would like to buy a house in the next couple of years, and have talked about only keeping one car(his is a lease right now as well, we'd only keep mine).

I have around $15k as my savings/emergency fund in case I lose my job, plus a cushion of about $2k for ""emergencies"" that aren't real emergencies that would justify touching the $15k. I also have &lt;$3k combined in my 401k and other investment accounts, and something like $5k in stock units that will vest this year(if that even matters). Neither my husband nor I have any credit card debt or student loans, I believe he's got around the same amount in his accounts as I do. Our finances aren't combined, but I just want emphasize that if I do use my savings and an emergency happened we wouldn't be completely screwed. Currently, I'm able to put aside about $1k/month between my savings and various ""pots"" I use for things like gift funds, vacation funds, shopping funds, etc. My car payment is $250. I think that's all the relevant info.

My question is, would it make sense to wipe out $12k of the $15k in my savings account to avoid a car payment? I would immediately(and aggressively) start rebuilding my savings in that case. Or would it make more sense to finance it, putting a couple thousand down and being left with a relatively small payment? It looks like the interest rate would be somewhere around 3%. I haven't applied for financing or anything, I'm kind of lost on how to go about that as well... and I just made my last payment, so I have less than a month to figure out what I'm doing.

Edit: Just want to add since I've seen this suggested before -- turning the car in and buying a cheaper used car is not an option for me.

personalfinance,"Where should I put my money? 24 years old 60k+ saving, 6 figure salary.","I've already done a bit of reading on this subreddit about people in similuar situations. I think I have a decent grasp on what to do, but just wanted to get some feedback on if my plan is sound and there's a few questions I'd like advice on.


Background - I am 24 years old. I was lucky enough to graduate college with zero debt a little less than 2 years ago thanks to both my parents and some summer internships that paid extremely well. And again I was lucky enough to immediate get a full time job that pays 6 figures after bonuses. (I'm a software engineer at a top tier company.) 


In the last year and half I've saved about $60K, that is currently split in checking and savings accounts with Bank of America. My checking's account is a some ""advanced tiered account"" so it basically pays same amount of interest as my savings account anyway. Not that it matters as the interest rate is so low I don't even get a full dollar each month. I have another $10K in a 401k with Vanguard set up with my job. I've so far been only contributing up to what my company matches, which is 4% of my salary. I have another few thousand in stock on an account with Charles Shwab. This amount is expected to go up significantly as more stock vest and our annual bonuses are usually paid in stock as well. So far I have not sold any of the stock yet. 

I buy everything with a credit card (yay cash back!) and pay the full amount every month. 


I'm single, no car (live + work downtown), rent an apartment by myself. no loans no debt.


future plans (next 3-5 years): no idea. I might buy a house/condo in a couple years if I decide that I won't be moving to a different city for a long time. I'd like to take 6-12 months off for a ""sabbatical"" in 2-3 years. Probably travel the world or some shit like that. I'm confident I can get a new job any time I want. I currently have no plans to purchase a car but that could change if I end up moving where I can't walk/bus to work.


So here is my plan


Max out my 401K, I've been only putting in up to whatever work will match. I have more than enough savings so there's no downside not to max it out from what I read here. That right?


Keep $15k in checking/saving. My monthly expense is currently ~$3k. But that's cuz I've been lazy and don't cook and rent is pretty expensive as I live in a downtown area. If a emergency really comes up I can bring that cost down a lot so $15k is more than enough. Might even consider lowering this to $10k.


I read on here that it's not too late to get a 2012 IRA to save some taxes. Can someone give me a little more detail on this? Limit is $5k? Does it matter where I open this IRA account? Is there a recommendation? What is my deadline for getting this set up. I'm assuming I should get this done before I file my taxes. 


What about 2013 IRA? I read some recommendations for Roth IRA. It's $5500 limit starting this year right? Same questions as above, does it matter who/where I get this with. Pro and Con for regular vs Roth IRA for this?

My stock from work. I'm going to start selling them as soon as they vest. The idea is that I'm already heavily invested in the company by working there, I should diversify rather than keep more investments there. I personally think the stock for where I work is growing strong but it's still better to diversify instead of putting all my eggs in one basket. Do people agree with that?


Ok, everything else, so basically $35k + any money I save from now on. Oh and + the stock money if I sell them. I should be investing them. This is where I'm not entirely sure what's the best way to diversify. I'm fairly young so I probably want to lean on the riskier side. Should I just pick a comprehensive mutual fund and put it all there?


Something like [SWEGX](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/investment_help/investment_research/mutual_fund_research/mutual_funds.html?path=/Prospect/Research/MutualFunds/Summary.asp?symbol=SWEGX)
 or [SWHGX](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/investment_help/investment_research/mutual_fund_research/mutual_funds.html?path=/Prospect/Research/MutualFunds/Summary.asp?symbol=SWHGX)

or should I just pick a bunch of index funds myself? like
SWPPX, SWTSX which follow S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones? 


Also where should I get my mutual funds from? I already have a investment account with Charles Shwab due to my company stock set up with them. But people seem to recommend vanguard a lot more on here. 

Oh, and should I switch to a credit union? I hear interest I get with a credit union is much better than with a bank.

Are there anything major that I missed? Any other tips or suggestions for how to manage my money?

personalfinance,Coming from r/frugal for some advice,"I'm not sure if I'm on the right board, but this seemed like the best match for related boards to r/frugal.

I decided that I want to get out of credit card debt.  I have 5 cards, each w/ various limits.  I crunched numbers today and found out that I'm almost 4k in credit card debt!  I have some friends who've gone through their bank/credit union to get a bank loan in the amount that they need to pay off all CCs and then they pay back the bank at a much lower interest rate (25% for CC and 10% for bank loan for example).  

Has anyone ever done this? Will it hurt my credit to close all of my accounts and then take out this loan?  

I have decent credit, have only made a late payment maybe 5 times in the 9 years I've had credit cards.  I don't really need them anymore and I'd prefer to pay them off ASAP and this seems to be the quickest most cost-effective way b/c it seems like I'm barely making a dent even though I make more than my minimum payment each month.

gaming,Prt1 of a 3prt story on my DayZ experiences of two particular full days of playing. Anyone out there excited for the standalone?,"I just love this game. I don't know if it's the adrenaline I get from the unknown, or the idea of survival, using your wits to stay alive, fed, hydrated, and not a zombie.

--------------------------------

My story starts in a city....

It is the middle of the night. The moon is shining through the windows of the hospital that I had just gotten to a few hours before. This place was still new to me. It was an eerie feeling seeing the empty streets outside in the town with the occasional brain eating citizen ever few yards. The swing set in the local play yard could be heard screeching in the wind now and again. I truly felt alone.

I walked outside of the single patient room that I had hid myself in, and headed down the dark hallway of the first floor. Loot! Finally canned beans! ""Who would leave this here?"" I asked myself in a whisper at my monitor as I scoffed it down like the hungry alone animal I was. I considered the possibility that there were more things for me to find in this place and continued searching in the hallways and rooms.

I had a decent collection of materials now. Blood-packs, bandages, painkillers, soda; enough to keep me alive. There was still one need that I had to fulfill. Human contact. It was time to try. I headed to the second floor. I could swear it was darker here than the last floor. I stumble away from the staircase only to fall off the balcony, breaking at least one of my legs. I spend zero time hesitating to check my gear for morphine to resolve the new situation; none. I look up out of my bag to see a zombie limp past me as I lay exposed in front of the opened main doors. My own adrenaline fuels the speed of my reactions now. I react quickly again, pulling myself to and up the staircase once again, making sure to avoid the same mistakes. I make my way into a room on the north facing side of the building and pull out my flashlight.

I suppose I do realize now the danger of revealing a position when you are alone. There are people out there looking for that same thing you want, survival, but some people do it at your expense. I lit my flashlight up and sent a pattern of flashing beams to the other buildings across the courtyard our front. No response... I flash them again, this time higher up. No response.... In one more attempt I shine at a large building to my right, shortly followed with the sound of pellets breaking through my window and hitting me in my arm. I fall to the floor bleeding and without usable legs. One step at a time.

I patch up my wound and stay laying down under the windowsill for 10 more minutes. Occasionally bullets whiz through the window a few more times, confirming to me that he cannot see any better then I can. I crawl out of the room and make my way up to the third floor where I find roof access. I can wait in here with nothing but my pistol or see what lies on the roof for weapons. I try my luck with the roof. I crawl out to the roof, and the moonlight shines on my back. ""This place is beautiful,"" I realize, in an apocalyptic, dark, kind of way.

Oh but whats this?! A double barrel shotgun. A defensive weapon for a broken legged man? I do think so. I slowly inch my way to it, knowing that at any second, the man who shot at me could see me, and my trip would be over....I got it! Excited, I back myself away, behind the roof access walls, making me exposed only to the south, east, and west, enough food to last me the standoff.

My adrenaline rushes at every sound and creak that I hear. My hand trembles on my still mouse, and I bite the skin off my lip in anxiety of the situation. Then I hear it. Footsteps. Getting quieter though...wait no. They are getting louder. He is on the steps. He must be on the steps. Louder...closer....THERE, in the window of the roof access room, I can see him passing down the hallway to the roof. I pull up my shotgun. This is it.... He comes around the corner... Off goes my gun. Once, BAM. Missed just to the right of the shoulder. Agitated he fires back with his pistol. Strange. That is not the weapon I was being fired upon with earlier. BAM, second shot, missed again! I am regretting the choice of the shotgun from hell, and quickly fumble my way though my gear to try to get out my pistol as well while he is reloading. He heads back through the hallway and gets out through the other end, onto the roof. I wasn't quick enough, and he arose as victor. My enemy had won.

A new day dawned and I felt like I did not just respawn .... but instead was sent back for a purpose. That purpose was clear, and I set off, with my marker on the hospital set for my GPS.

Our circumstances have recently improved and I got a job with higher pay, plus we received a windfall that allowed us to pay off one of our cars.  Thus, we have close to 2k per month to put toward CC's.  We applied for a 0% balance transfer CC and was approved for 25K.  I've transferred the CC's with the highest interest rate to that card, and with some careful maneuvering, I'll be able to get our entire CC balance interest free for at least the next 12 months (basically, playing musical CC's).

I plan on using my Amex Preferred Cash for our normal daily purchases and paying in full every month.  

Any extra funds we can scavenge up (bonus, tax returns etc) will go toward the cards.  I estimate we can pay down at least 23K over the next 12 months if not more (our 2nd vehicle should be paid off fairly soon).  All of that 23k will go toward principal since all of the balances  will be on that promo rate.  It makes perfect sense to me, but wanted to see if anyone could see any pitfalls.

It made me realize why we don't have much choice on election day or hear our current politicians promote seemingly common sense ideas (example, ending the drug war). The people with new ideas can't even get onto the primary ballot in many cases and once on the primary ballot, they have a hard time organizing support (Richard Mack vs Lamar Smith /r/testpac ). 

This makes for an interesting and relatively cheap opportunity to drastically change the political discussion in American politics. Candidates that supported new ideas only need about $5-10k to get them on the primary ballot. This means that for the cost of an expensive senate race, you could have candidates that support an idea running in every single House race.

All of a sudden, you would have many political contenders supporting, for example, federalized gay marriage. It couldn't be ignored. More importantly, you could run candidates who support the idea as Republicans and Democrats. In this way, if both primary backed candidates won, this issue would no longer be the deciding factor in the general election.

Using social media, you could let people know their vote is more important in the primary than the general election. Particularly in gerrymandered or heavily partisan districts, the general election is already settled long before the primary. For example, if Richard Mack had won the primary against Lamar Smith, he would almost certainly be in Congress today. You may not agree with everything he stood for, but he would have been a strong ally for digital rights, and you probably disagree with Lamar Smith in a much stronger way.

Bitcoin,"An economy using a deflationary currency would be inherently unstable, likely with high unemployment and a low standard of living","I'll try and keep it brief. The title comes from the simple observation that spending = income, and that you need income for jobs.

Too much spending for the economy's output potential and you get inflation, too little spending and you get unemployment - partly because wages are incredibly [sticky downwards](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/17flll/bitcoins_gains_may_fuel_central_bank_concerns/c85f9vq).

What is one of the biggest determinants in the amount of private spending in the economy? Real interest rates, that is interest after inflation is taken into account.

Why? Because if you have a means of accruing interest, you will not spend unless the benefit you get from that expenditure exceeds the opportunity cost of the interest you forgoe. Exactly the same tradeoff occurs with loans - you will not take out a loan unless the return from that loan exceeds the real rate of interest, for if it does not, you cannot afford it.

It is on this observation that our current monetary systems are based. That by controlling interest rates, we can keep the level of spending consistent with the amount required for full employment. This system has obviously broken down as of late, as even with the primary interest rate as low as it can go - there's still insufficient spending for full employment. So it's flawed also - but not as flawed as Bitcoin as a foundation for an economy to run on.

Why do I say Bitcoin would be flawed? Because this real rate of interest is completely out of everyone's control, and will tend to be in the high real positive territory. This is equivalent to a central bank keeping the brakes on the economy at all times, to always having high interest rates. This would be a real deterrent to spending - which means insufficient jobs, low output, and accordingly a low standard of living.

Now I'm not saying that Bitcoin does not have a place in society - as a medium for semi-anonymous transactions it's great - all I'm saying is that those that see it somehow replacing government fiat? I can't see that ever happening - and I think it would be a terrible thing if it did.

**tldr;** A Bitcoin based economy is one that permanently has high real interest rates. High interest rates deter spending and loans, low spending = few jobs, few jobs = low output, low output = low level of consumption, low level of consumption = low standard of living.",cryptocurrency,1359800503

personalfinance,"I have 106K in student loans, my parents are unemployed and they recently filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. How do I handle my new personal expenses?","Personalfinance, I could use your help. Although my inability to pay this new expense is only temporary, I could use some advice as to how to take care of it.


I’m a senior in college, about to graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering. I currently have $106,000 of debt. I have 55K in private loans (Sallie Mae), 35K in federal loans, and my grandparents directly loaned me 16K for my last year of college. 

Last September my mom lost her job and last December my dad lost his job. So after this happened, my mom gave me copies of her and my dad’s determination letters, which basically tells the office of financial aid at my university that our financial situation has changed and therefore, officially, my parents are no longer able to afford my tuition (they were never able to, but according to the EFC calculation, they should have been). Anyways, I went into the office of financial because I know that they can award aid retroactively. When I talked to one of their staff, however, he told me that because my parents got laid off so late during the year, and financial aid is based on their income last year, that their EFC won’t be low enough to push me in the range for a Pell Grant. I'm curious about this because my brother is attending a trade school, and his office of financial aid was able to get him a Pell Grant upon giving them the determination letters, which doesn’t make sense if they’re using the SAME EXACT EFC calculation to determine what my parents can contribute to his schooling (luckily, his tuition is low enough that he can afford to pay for it every month). 


Then today, parents talked to an attorney and have decided to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. One of the consequences of this is that my parents can no longer help me out with the interest on my loans. The interest is $350 a month. This hit me like a brick today. I’m living on a shoestring as it is (about ~$600 a month, which includes rent of $350 plus utilities). So to hear that now I have to pay another $350 a month… I have no idea where I’m going to find that money.


I literally have to survive until July, when I'll start receiving paychecks from my new job.

**These are the questions I have:**

* PRAYING TO GOD THAT SOMEONE KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT FINANCIAL AID. Does the EFC change between universities? How is it possible that my brother is eligible for a Pell Grant at his school but I’m not eligible for a Pell Grant at mine?
* Will the fact that my parents are filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy make me eligible for any additional aid?
* Is there any leniency for deferring the interest on my private loans (in addition to the loans as well)? From what I was reading, Sallie Mae isn’t too liberal with making exceptions.
* How much would it fuck me/my grandparents over if I didn’t pay the interest on my loans for 6 months?
* I’ve applied for multiple jobs, but nobody will hire me because I only have three months of school left and it wouldn’t be worth their time to train me if I would just be leaving shortly thereafter. I’m looking into participating in paid surveys/research and donating blood or platelets. Is there any other way for me to come up with this money? 

I’m sorry to be so negative when I know that people have it worse than me. I completely recognize all of the things that I have to be grateful for: 

* I’ve accepted a full-time position as a mechanical engineer upon graduation. I’m lucky to have a job waiting for me, especially when most of the people in my graduating class are unemployed or underemployed.
* Not only am I lucky to have a job, but I’m lucky that I’ve found a well-paying job.
* In general, I’m lucky to have gotten an education and that even had someone in my family with good enough credit to cosign my loans.",finance,1359781772

A little less than half of U.S. coal ash ponds are unlined, according to data from the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
“If they prevail on this, I think it would send a real chill up the spines of utility executives everywhere,” Dillen said. “It could be transformative.”
Dillen said she hopes lawsuits like these also highlight the need for federal rules. Without them, she said, the utility industry may be left guessing whether they’ve done enough to protect the public from pollution -- and by extension, to protect themselves from liability.
Earthjustice and other environmental groups sued the Environmental Protection Agency last year for failing to regulate coal ash waste, even after a devastating Tennessee coal ash spill in 2008. The agency itself has predicted that unlined coal ash ponds will increase health risks such as cancer and damage to the kidneys, liver and the central nervous system.
Dillen said the EPA is resisting any time line for issuing coal ash rules, while Earthjustice wants the court to give the agency a six-month deadline.
In the meantime, she said, the number of civil lawsuits over coal ash have been climbing.
“People are becoming more aware that the ash pond in their backyard is responsible for the pollution that’s making them sick,” Dillen said. “Until we have effective safeguards in place, we’re only going to see more of these lawsuits.”

personalfinance,Complete and Utter Credit Frustration!,"I'm at my wits end and hoping for some solid advice as it seems there are some knowledgable people in this sub.

I've had some credit issues I need to overcome.  Lost a job in 09' and was out for a year and lost my car so I have a repo 5/2009.  I also have some other things that have showed up on my report that are not mine (utility bill, overdrawn bank account, tmobile bill)that are not mine and are showing up negative.  I've tried multiple times to dispute these items through all 3 bureaus but they never go away.  Extremely frustrating.  I put notifications for fraud warning on my report hoping nothing else shows up again.

I have only one positive trade line currently - secured $500 limit credit card i've had since December 2011.  Never missed a payment - I charge about $200-$300 a month and pay it off the next time I get paid.  Usually I carry a balance for less than a week.  I've had a car loan since the repo with a crappy interest rate from 7/11-10/12.  Paid in full never late.

This leaves me currently with 558TU, 566EQ and 507EXP via score sense.  It's been extremely frustrating seeing these scores fluctuate so much but never go much above 600.  I paid off the car (traded in for another vehicle under my wifes name) and my scores all plummeted.

Fortunately my new wife has fantastic credit (around 780+) and was able to finance my current vehicle and currently holds the note for her vehicle and our house.  The problem is we want to buy a house next year but i'm afraid I won't be able to raise my score about 600 in that time and we won't be able to include my income in the mortgage decision which is substantial at $100k.

The whole thing has been so frustrating - just looking for some advice/hope on how I can fix this.  Should I bite the bullet and pay off things that are on my report I can't get off (minus the repo which I owe $14k ... that's a little more difficult)

Save enough to cover 3 month's expenses.

Pay off Car1 and 2 and credit cards.  

We haven't paid off the credit cards or saved in any significant manner yet is because we have been saving in anticipation of a large tax bill.  We are changing our W4's right after our taxes are finalized.  

Are we on the right track?  Are there glaring things we are missing?

personalfinance,Questions regarding filing 2012 taxes and moving forward into 2013.,"Nice and simple thing that I probably know the answer to already:

Just filed my 2012 Taxes.  Getting $46 back from the Feds, but it's saying that I owe $5 to NYS.  Do I really have to file my state taxes or is such a minor amount not even worth it?

Again, I probably know the answer, but the problem I'm having is that to pay them I would need to order checks, so that $5 owing would end up costing me almost $20.

Regarding 2013:  The hotel I'm working at is about to undergo a major renovation, and much of the management on both the hotel level and the company that oversees the hotel have expressed interest in promoting me to Front Desk Manager, with the current manager moving to a 100% Sales oriented position.  I would guess that would entail a nice raise to boot.  I'm currently making $18.2k as of 2012, and I'm going to be on pace for about $19k this year.  Looking online I see the median salary for a manager with my experience at a 3 star hotel is hovering around $29k in this area.  Should I reduce my exemptions down from 2 to 1 to boost my withholding prior to any raise or wait until that raise happens (hopefully around May if all goes well) then make the adjustment... or do I even need to make an adjustment and continue enjoying the boosted paychecks and throwing that $25/week that I got into a savings account to make me 5-10 cents a month?

On a totally separate topic:  Thanks to the people who actively help others.  I got YNAB and for the first time in my life I'm actually able to pay almost all of my bills at the start of the month.

I figure my first order of business is getting rid of the credit card debt which I should be able to do in a couple of weeks. I would then like to establish an emergency fund. After that I was unsure if I should save up 5K and try to open up an IRA before April or if I should just start aggressively paying my student loans. My Fed Loans are currently in deferment until March. I figure that I could pay my loans off within 8-9 months, starting with the 9.5% Sallie Mae one.

Getting back to the IRA, I currently have a pension and an annuity that I can't touch (without penalty) until I am 63.5. They both get about 13-15$ for every hour I work put into them by my employer/union (I work minimum 66 hours a week). Should I still pay into an IRA? 

Also I will most likely not be making this much money long term. I am currently working on a special project that is supposed to last for a maximum of 6 years but more likely 2-3. At that point, if I stay in the union my pay will drop to about $65,000 and then top out around $80,000 (gross not net). I honestly don't plan on staying in once this job is done. 

If the job lasts 3 years and I am smart about this opportunity I will walk away with $250,000. How can I leverage this money into long term wealth?

* I'm a 27 year old single male.  Have a bachleor of science in Computer Science.  Have a good, stable job.
* I am debt free.  Once I got out of college and started working, I made paying off my student loans a priority.  I know people say that paying extra into my student loan was a bad idea because the value of the loan would go down over the life of the loan, but it sure is nice being debt free.
* I don't have a car payment.. I've been driving the same '92 Chevy Caprice since I was 18.  I really have no interest in fancy cars so I'm not looking at buying a newer car unless mine quits on me.  Only carry liability insurance so that payment is low.  I'm aware that since my car is older it could up and quit at any time, so I keep my emergency fund healthy so I can get a used car if need be.
* I get the max employer match in my 401k.
* I pay $5,000 into my Roth IRA yearly.
* I'm saving up and plan to be able to put a 20% down payment on a house with emergency funds to spare.

So here's the rest: I've been living on my own in an apartment for almost 5 years now.  It's a nice apartment with an attached garage.  I'm getting to the point that I want more space and to be able to customize my living space however I want.  I know houses are a lot of work and there are a lot of unexpected expenses you don't have to deal with when renting.  I feel like I would actually enjoy some of the handy-work needed on a house, but I know the timing of maintenance is usually less fun...

My big problem is, I'm not really settled on where I want to live long term.  I don't have any immediate intentions of up and leaving the city or anything... but being single I want to keep that option available too.  At minimum I would likely stay there 3 years if not longer.  Also being single, I've been told that if I get a house and eventually find a girl and get married, that she will probably hate my house and want a different one since she'll want a say in picking out the features of the house.  I want kids eventually but that's not in the cards yet.

So with all of this being said, I want a house.  I know it has been said here before that unless you're just flipping houses, ""a house is not an investment, it's a place to live.""  Though I feel like I should also be able to think of it as an investment to an extent?  I know it isn't liquid by any means, but assuming I live in it long enough, I COULD get a return on it...  especially considering the market right now. That's the other thing, with interest rates being as low as they are, I feel like it could be a good idea.

TL;DR: I'm single and I think I'm financially stable.  Not sure how long I want to stay where I'm at (maybe 3 years, maybe 10 years).  Should I make the plunge and buy a house, or just rent a bigger apartment or rent a house?",finance,1360009959

A picture might help more:

http://i.imgur.com/ieJXOFp.jpg

I could add a column to the right of the ""Additional payment"" column, where it would show what the payment was actually worth over the lifetime of the loan.

FOR EXAMPLE, in the picture above, there has been ONE extra payment, of $150, and the total interest saved was $568.98.  The 568.98 is the number I am interested in.  However, a second  additional payment will update the cell that says 568.98, to the new value - it won't tell me what it's singular affect on the interest is.

Maybe an additional column is the easiest way.  How to do that in excel?

Thanks!

**UPDATE after hashing around with it some.**

Look at my goal in this way: I wanted to find the value of a dollar in any given period of my amortization.  For example, in month one of a 360 month loan, my dollar is worth 

=((1+[interest rate]/12)^360 )

My interest rate is 5.25%, so
((1+0.0525/12)^360 ) = 4.81

Every dollar I put in, is worth $4.81 to my loan, *in the first month of my loan*.

Now if I want to address other periods, the ""360"" iterates - my payments are numbered, so ""B12"" cell = payment 1.  ""361-B12"", where B12 is payment ""1"".  This allows the formula to be pasted.  

Therefore, in month two of my loan, ((1+0.0525/12)^(361-2) ) = 4.79 - the value of my dollar has decreased ever so slightly (but still it's worth a crazy amount over the lifetime of the loan.)  

Now the task is simple.  Say I add $10 in period 2, the formula is a multiple of the value of a dollar to my loan.  

$10*((1+0.0525/12)^(361-2) ), or 47.90  
$100*((1+0.0525/12)^(361-2) ), or 479.00  
$1000*((1+0.0525/12)^(361-2) ), or 4790.00  

Hope that makes sense.  Now one more thing I'd love to know, is how to calculate the value of an extra dollar in X payment period, as a ROI.  I don't *think* it's as simple as being the interest rate of the loan, but maybe.  Or maybe it starts as such, and diminishes as the loan ages.  I don't really know, finance is certainly not my thing.

crown capital eco management environmental news

The heavily forested city of Ketchikan, Alaska, is built on rock and surrounded by water. Every commodity that comes into Ketchikan must arrive by sea or air. The use of fuel oil is problematic for both economic and environmental reasons because the oil must be obtained and refined elsewhere and transported (using additional fuel). What's more, fuel oil is subject to price instability.

Southeast Alaska Discovery Center in Ketchikan, which provides information to more than a million visitors each year, is the site of a pilot biomass boiler system now coming to life. Two oil-fired boilers serving the 250,000-sq-ft center were replaced with a highly efficient system fueled by local wood. Manufactured by Hurst Boiler &amp; Welding Company Inc., the hot-water boiler was custom-designed to fit within very limited indoor space.

Under the direction of E. Dane Ash, project manager for Tyonek-Alcan Pacific LLC, the biomass boiler system was developed with Hurst representative Gregory W. Smith of Global Energy Solutions Inc. to address environmental concerns, as well as issues related to building space, fuel costs, comfort, reliability, and simplicity of operation.

The new boiler is located on the lower level of the Discovery Center, which requires heating for a minimum of nine months a year. Local wood densified into fuel pucks is delivered to an elevated walking-floor storage bin in a vestibule area built to protect against excessive moisture. (The biomass-fired boiler can burn any wood product with up to 50-percent moisture content.) An auger moves pucks from the storage area to a metering bin and into the boiler. Freezing is not an issue because the walking floor easily breaks up any frozen contents.

The boiler system was designed to highlight how biomass can reduce or eliminate the use of fossil fuels. Visitors can see the boiler operate through specially designed windows. In the hall just outside of the boiler room, the noise level and ambient temperature is consistent with the rest of the building.

Savings

Fuel costs have been cut by two-thirds. The densified pucks are used with almost no residual ash; eventually, however, tree clippings from the Ketchikan walking trails will be ground and fed into the boiler, eliminating the need for transport to a landfill, burning, and other methods of disposal.

The Boiler

The Hurst S100 Series Fire Tube 27 HP Hydronic Water Heating Boiler features a pre-heater to optimize combustion and an underfeed stoker with dry-ash-removal system.

Results

The system easily can be replicated for heat or heat/power generation up to 20,000 kw. In June 2011, Smith served as a keynote speaker for the fifth annual Native American Economic Development Conference in Anaheim, Calif., where he described the initiatives being implemented in Ketchikan and shared success stories of biomass-fired boiler systems installed on institutional campuses and in manufacturing facilities throughout the United States, particularly in challenging and remote locations. Systems include municipal solid waste, as well as woody biomass for steam production and steam to power.

I'm a 23 year old young professional, who stumbled into a job that paid me way more than I knew what to do with, and naturally my spending got out of control. I haphazardly built my financial house, and it's a rickety thing that leaks and threatens collapse regularly.

It's time to get things under control. I think you might be the right people to help me out. 

My income is right around $2000/month after tax. 

I have $0 in my Navy Federal Savings Account.

I have $0 in my Navy Federal Checking Account. 

I have about $800 in my Suntrust Checking Account. 

I owe ~$7000 on my auto loan, which I pay $200 a month on.

I have a Visa Flagship Rewards CC with $10,000 on it.

I have a Visa Platinum CC with $700 on it.

I have a Best Buy CC with $0 on it.

My monthly expenses are as follows:


-Rent: $750

-Utilities: $300

-Auto Loan: $200

-Cell Phone: $80

-IRS payment: $300 (with about 5 more payments until I'm caught up)

-Gas: $200

-CC Payment: $200


That's right around $2000, and that's not including food. 

I feel like I'm bleeding uncontrollably. 

What would you guys do? I want to tackle this problem aggressively. 

How should I set up my bank accounts? How many should I have of each type? How should I spread my money across them?

I have been offered a full time job with my current company, with a salary of $50k, which I intend to accept this week, so that will lead to a higher income, though I'm not sure what the actual income will be after tax withholding. Any idea what that will come out to roughly?

What else should I be doing that I'm not doing? 

Thanks for any advice you have.. I have made getting my financial life straightened the highest priority of 2013.",finance,1359971517

The Fed's asset-purchase programme has been among the chief reasons for the swelling inflows into the Chinese territory that have buoyed markets. Fed reticence about further growing its $2.9 trillion balance sheet could limit capital flows.
The Hang Seng Index on Friday went into the midday trading down 0.8 percent from Thursday's highest close since June 1, 2011. The China Enterprises Index of the top Chinese listings slid 1.1 percent after hitting its most overbought levels in more than two years on Thursday.
The CSI300 of the top Shanghai and Shenzhen listings fell 0.6 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.2 percent at the resumption of trade after a three-day New Year holiday in the mainland, starting 2013 on a weaker note after stellar December gains.

I understand what a horribly insane number this is. It causes overwhelming stress and anxiety everyday and everyday and I regret my decision constantly. I was too young at 17 to make this decision informed initially and by the time I realized my mistake I was 4 years in. In my current job I make 42k. My salary without an advanced degree would max around 60k. 

My conundrum - I promised myself I would not incur any more debt to get my masters and would only consider programs that I could pay for myself. I was recently (and unexpectedly) accepted into a top program (Yale), but I would need to take out another 40,000 to attend. Salary after graduation would be 65-75 starting (bare minimum) and max out at around 125k. The additional loans would all be federal, totaling my debt at around 170k. I would be able to pay interest on my current loans while in school - so those wouldn't be accumulating more debt while in school.

The Fed's key role in international economic policy coordination is a largely overlooked and ignored aspect of its work. Typically, most people think that is what the president and his economic officials do during the meetings of what American academic community derisively calls ""talking shops"" (G8, G20, and various U.N. agencies).

But the best kept secret is that the Fed does more for the successful operation of the global business cycle than all these ""talking shops"" combined. And it does that at no cost to American taxpayers. Last year, for example, the Fed transferred $76.9 billion in profits to the U.S. Treasury, while one of these summit jamborees can cost $850 million.
How does the Fed drive the world economy?

The dollar is the channel through which the impact of the Fed's policy is transmitted to the rest of the world. Transmission mechanisms are very wide and instantaneous. About 90 percent of international trade and financial transactions are conducted in dollars; some economies are fully dollarized through currency boards or dollar pegs, the dollar accounts for 62 percent of world currency reserves, and the overwhelmingly dollar-based foreign exchange market has an estimated daily turnover of $4 trillion.",finance,1359956382

Not sure if this is a naive question or a loaded question, but I'm having a hard time understanding how interest rates affect the profits of different financial institutions. I understand that the banking industry is most affected by things like credit risk and interest rate risk, but still can't make the complete connection.

Do higher interest rates increase the number of defaults? Do banks overall prefer lower or higher interest rates or are they indifferent and would prefer stability?

E.g. mREITs can extend out more loans in times of low interest rate but during periods of low interest rates, there's less prepayment risk and their cash flows from MBSes are more secure",finance,1359948561

I'm 32 and have no clue about investing so i'm trying to learn as much as I can. I just read a similar posts and thought I really should ask for myself. This is my very first post, so let me know if asking which funds to choose is allowed in here or not. 


I originally had 10% going to my companies 401K plan, which I paid for them to help invest for me. They currently match up to 4%.


Just today, I changed that amount to meet the companies 4% match, and the rest would go towards a Vanguard ROTH IRA (which I will set up and probably make another post on). I also enrolled and maxed out a HSA plan this year not knowing what it really is and does (i'm an idiot, I know). 


Since my 401K is  managed by my company and at the moment is is allocated like this. 


PIMCO Total Return-Inst	                     (1%)

BlackRock Equity Index-I                             (22%)

I will adjust these myself once i get comfortable with what to choose and why later on.

This will allow me to wire or facililate any electrical work in the state of Washington.

**Background:**

I decided not to go to college. Not my thing. I live at home rent free at the moment and am taking advantage.  I plan on moving out in around a year and a half to two years.  This will allow me accumalte around $15,000 in my bank account before I make the plunge. I get driven to work everyday so I don't really have to worry about transportation at this point.

**In two years....**

	*Life/Financials:

With the $15,000 I will have I plan to have when  I move out...

	*1. Invest $5,000 into a Roth

	*2. Save $5,000 for an emergency

	*3. Not really sure for the last $5,000. Advice?


	*Career:

I will become a liscensed commercial Jouneyman by around age 22 or 23.  This will gurantee me atleast a very minimum $25 an hour with no roof really on how much I can make or who tells me what to do. I may even start up my own electrical business. I have yet to encounter all the oppurtunities that lay before me so I can't really be sure how much I will be making after the journeymen transformation.
The one drastic idea I have conjured up is the idea of heading out to Alaska after becoming a journeyman and really making the big bucks. I hear many people going down there in my line of work making upwards of $100 an hour with major over-time. This would be the the ideal situation of me being able to really put my head down and make some seroius cash. Just no life while down there.

**Goals (By age 30)**

*I want more than anything to be able to tell my parents they can go on summer vacation for the rest of their lifes on my dollar. Now is that going to happen? Probably not. Goals are goals though.

*I want to travel my self. Life is NOT all about working

*I want to be my own boss

*Get into the real estate game

*Living great while also living under my means

*Be a great musician (love playing the drums and piano)

*Still be playing sports weekly

*Political figure?

**Goals (By age 45)**

*As I said before, I want to travel. Life is NOT all about working

*Be financialy independent

*Do what I want when I want

*Be political figure

Life is but a game of cards, I have been dealt a very average hand but that is not to say I can't influence the deck while the dealer is turned. I have a desire deep inside to become something more than average while bringing my family and friends along for the ride. This will happen.

business,Springhill Group International News - Asia stocks fall on unexpected dip in US economy,"http://www.salon.com/2013/01/31/asia_stocks_fall_on_unexpected_dip_in_us_economy/
BANGKOK (AP) — An unexpected contraction in the U.S. economy at the end of 2012 sent Asian stock markets into retreat Thursday.
The U.S. economy shrank in the fourth quarter for the first time since mid-2009, hurt by big cuts in defense spending, falling exports and sluggish growth in company inventories, the government reported Wednesday. That put the brakes on a Wall Street rally that had pushed the Dow to near-record highs.
“The market has been looking for any excuse to pull back after such an epic month and has taken this news as the main lead for the day,” said Evan Lucas of IG Markets in Melbourne in an email commentary.
The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 0.6 percent to 11,047.59 after the government reported lower-than-expected growth in December’s industrial production. Output climbed a seasonally adjusted 2.5 percent from November but most analysts had forecast an improvement of more than 4 percent.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.5 percent to 23,698.19. South Korea’s Kospi shed 0.4 percent to 1,957.13. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 fell 0.2 percent to 4,885.90, following 10 straight sessions of gains. Benchmarks in Taiwan, Indonesia and Malaysia fell. Mainland China was mixed. The Philippines rose.
In a statement released after a two-day policy meeting, the U.S. Federal Reserve acknowledged that the economy is still struggling to regain momentum. The central bank said that growth had “paused in recent months,” and while it was taking no new action, it would keep buying $85 billion of bonds a month.
With the Fed meeting behind them, traders and investors will now turn their focus back to company earnings and Friday’s nonfarm employment report. Lucas of IG Markets said he thinks a good jobs report could be just what the markets need to resume their upward momentum.
“If we see positive data there, it will reinforce the idea that the pressure is easing and economic data in the U.S. is continuing to get better,” he said.
Among individual stocks, Australia’s Whitehaven Coal Ltd. fell 4.9 percent after warning its earnings would be under $10 million in the first half of its financial year. Japanese video-game maker Nintendo Co. fell 6.2 percent after the company lowered its full year sales forecast to 670 billion yen ($7.4 billion) from 810 billion yen ($8.9 billion).
Game machines have taken a beating from the proliferation of smartphones and tablets that also offer games and other entertainment, competing for people’s leisure time. Some analysts say the global market for game machines is saturated with offerings from Nintendo, Microsoft Corp., Sony Corp. and others.
The Dow closed down 0.3 percent at 13,910.42 on Wednesday after the government reported that the economy shrank an annualized 0.1 percent in the October-December quarter of 2012. It grew 3.1 percent the July-September quarter. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 fell 0.4 percent to 1,501.96. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.4 percent to 3,142.31
Benchmark oil for March delivery was down 6 cents to $97.88 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 37 cents to finish at $97.94 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange
In currencies, the euro rose slightly to $1.3569 from $1.3567 late Wednesday in New York. The dollar fell to 90.84 yen from 91.20 yen.",finance,1360027822

personalfinance,"Maxed out, hight debt to income but good assets, can I still get a 0% transfer credit card?","So, I have two maxed out cards, as tends to happen when life kicks you in the junk, along with a few mortgages and equity lines.  My issue is trying to knock those two credit cards down but not having adequate income to make a dent or even allow me to transfer balances.  Everything goes towards debt these days and I have liquidated pretty much all I can to cover the bills up to now.  

Funny thing is I still have 730 credit and own a 4plex, a house, and part of a TIC, all of which I can't access the equity in but which does generate revenue.  Bonus: my job was downsized and I now have to live solely on the roughly $7k income from those properties while my debt is slightly more than that (California real estate is expensive).  I refinanced two properties which helps, but the credit card interest is still killing me.

Before you skewer me for my foolish ways, I'll also mention I had a huge amount embezzled by a business associate (who shall soon be going to Federal prison for a very long time, which unfortunately won't give me back the long since spent funds).  Sadly his theft started the downward spiral (the first of three catastrophic losses in an 8 month period which tipped the scales) and I haven't been able to dig my way out yet.  I have a massive write-off for theft, but what good is that if income is lacking?

It'll take time, but for now the one I think I need to get rid of ASAP if possible is the credit cards.  I've got $55k on two cards and just want that 0% transfer for a year so I can use it to pay those down rather than tread water. (Oh, and both cards decided to raise my rate from 9.9% to 19% for no reason, I've never been late ever)  Any suggestions for someone with an upside down debt to income (and assets with equity but that I cannot access?)",finance,1360022568

personalfinance,Paying less than accumulating interest - possibly wise?,"My girlfriend has approximately 68k in school loans, and a pre-tax income of 27k.

Her payment plan (either income based or income contingent) currently requires no payments due to her low income. 

However, she does want to make more than those payments.
She has approximately $400 per month to dedicate to these loans.

I played around on unbury.me, and it seemed vastly more effective to pay the minimum, let the interest accrue, and completely pay down the higher interest rate loans.  

Also, she works for a 501(c)(3) charity, and probably will in perpetuity.  
So, her two consolidated loans would be discharged after 120 payments made while employed, but not the NETS or GATE loans.

Given the above, does it seem like a good idea for her to focus all of her money on one loan while making only token payments on the other.

Just wondering if you could help me out with something.  I owe $4,840.09 on my car.  I have $4500 give or take in savings.  Should I blow my entire savings and pay the car off?  My interest rate on the car loan is 8.25%, my interest rate on my savings is 5.00% on the first $1500, and 0.10% on the rest.  My regular payments on the car are $251 a month.  What are your thoughts?

I am contributing to my 401k up to my employer's maximum match, and I'm on track to max out my $5k of IRA space for 2012 by April.

I've already contributed about $2k to my Roth IRA, and I was planning on putting the whole $5k for 2012 in Roth. But when I prepared my federal taxes, I realized that if I put the remaining $3k of IRA contributions into a traditional, the tax deduction would get me into the 15% bracket and save me about $700 in taxes this year.

Does the lowered tax bracket now make the tax-deferred Traditional IRA contributions more desirable than the tax-free growth of Roth contributions?

Another concern of mine is that I hope to get raises over the course of my career, and may want to use the 'backdoor Roth' in the future. Will the backdoor be problematic if I already have a Traditional IRA?

If I had realized this last year, I would have just increased my 401k contributions to get into the lower bracket, but it's too late for that now.

So, assuming that we won't need to touch the money for 25+ years, and can take an aggressive/high risk approach, what rate of growth can we reasonably expect?

My husband maxes out his 401k contributions, but doesn't want to divert any more money to investing until all the debt is paid off.

abney associates news internet technology

Miljoen en miljoenen US Facebook-gebruikers ontvangen een e-mail laatste weekend dat JURIDISCHE MEDEDELING VAN REGELING VAN KLASSE ACTIE lezen - net als dat, in hoofdletters. Het zegt dat ""een federale rechtbank deze mededeling goedgekeurd"", en dat het ""niet een uitnodiging van een advocaat."" 
Het vertelt je ook dat je mogelijk recht op tot $ 10, rechtstreeks komend van de diepe zakken van Facebook. 
Hoewel het klinkt misschien als een scam (in feite is het echt, echt klinkt als een scam), kunt u er zeker van zijn dat het 100% legit. U kunt doorgaan met uw bewering zonder angst - maar u misschien niet wilt. 

Dit afgelopen weekend, een andere grote groep van Facebook-gebruikers ontvangen de Settlement e-mail, die voortvloeit uit een lopende class action-rechtszaak die voor het eerst werd ingediend in het begin van 2012. Facebook vestigden de rechtszaak, die beweerden dat het bedrijf had geschonden op de privacyrechten van gebruikers wanneer ze hun gelijkenissen, foto's en activiteiten die in Sponsored Stories advertenties zonder toestemming, compensatie, of de mogelijkheid om opt-out. 

De eerste nederzetting werd echter verworpen, en Facebook werd gedwongen om herwerken de voorwaarden. In december 2012, een rechter gaf een prejudiciële beslissing tot goedkeuring van de nieuwe voorwaarden: een $ 20 miljoen regeling dat de meerderheid uitgedeeld aan gebruikers of aan diverse goede doelen en belangenorganisaties zullen zien. Het hangt allemaal af van hoe veel claims worden ingediend. 

Wat Facebook heeft gedaan, in de meest eenvoudige termen, is het creëren van een gigantische fonds dat kan worden gebruikt om de cursisten te betalen. Als je een email ontvangen, betekent dit dat u in aanmerking komt om aan te melden als lid van de klas omdat uw activiteit of gelijkenis werd gebruikt in een Sponsored Story voorafgaand aan 03 december 2012. Het bedrag dat elke eiser ontvangt hangt af van hoeveel mensen springen in het zwembad. Als er te veel mensen een claim indienen, en het is ""economisch niet haalbaar"" uit te betalen iedereen zal het fonds worden uitgekeerd aan een twaalftal non-profits die allen werken aan ""leren volwassenen en kinderen hoe ze sociale media-technologieën veilig te gebruiken,"" of te ""beschermen de belangen van kinderen. 

Zij zijn: 
Centrum voor Democratie en Technologie, Electronic Frontier Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Joan Ganz Cooney Center, Berkman Center for Internet and Society (Harvard Law School), Information Law Institute (NYU Law School), Berkeley Center for Law and Technology (Berkeley Law School) , Center for Internet and Society (Stanford Law School), High Tech Law Institute (Santa Clara University School of Law), Campaign for Commercial-allergene Childhood, Consumenten Federatie van Amerika, recht op de privacy Fonds, ConnectSafely.org, en WiredSafety.org . 

Als u over de schikking bericht, heb je vijf opties. U kunt een claim indienen, waardoor je in aanmerking komt voor de $ 10, maar voorkomt dat u van deelname aan een andere actie tegen Facebook in dit rijk. Of u kunt zichzelf uitsluiten, waarmee u behoudt uw vermogen om Facebook te klagen, wat betreft Sponsored Stories. Als u niets doet, geeft u uw recht om zowel het geld en toekomstige geschillen. 

Er is ook opties om bezwaar te maken tegen de schikking of een hoorzitting bijwonen, die geen van beide werkelijk zal worden beschouwd door de meeste gebruikers. 
  
Als u besluit om een claim in te dienen, maar moet u weten dat u zult waaruit een paar dingen die misschien moeilijk te getuigen (voor de meer geïnformeerde Facebook gebruiker). Zoals opgemerkt door Forbes, zult u het ermee eens dat je ""niet van bewust dat Facebook kan een vergoeding worden betaald voor het weergeven van acties als deze, samen met mijn naam en / of profielfoto, om mijn Facebook vrienden"", en dat je echt ""gewond"" door het display van uw informatie in een Sponsored Story. 
Hoe dan ook, alle informatie die u nodig hebt om het even welke route te nemen is beschikbaar op een speciale site voor het pak, fraleyfacebooksettlement.com 

Wat is net zo interessant als de cy druk schikking is de set van veranderingen die Facebook heeft ingestemd met implementeren als gevolg van de uitspraak. Facebook heeft beloofd om nieuwe taal toe te voegen aan de voorwaarden, waardoor Gesponsorde Verhalen makkelijker te begrijpen voor de gemiddelde gebruiker. Facebook heeft ook ingestemd met betere mechanismen te implementeren voor het bekijken van vroegere activiteiten die mogelijk zijn te zien in Sponsored Stories, alsmede opzetten strengere controles op wat er in de toekomst. 

Hier zijn al die bepalingen, zoals voorzien door de overeenkomst in Fraley v. Facebook: 

• Herziening van de voorwaarden van de dienst (bekend als de ""Verklaring van rechten en verantwoordelijkheden"" of ""Srr"") om meer volledig de gevallen waarin gebruikers akkoord verklaren om de weergave van hun namen en profielfoto's in verband met de Sponsored Stories 

• Maak een gemakkelijk toegankelijk mechanisme dat gebruikers in staat stelt te bekijken om, op een going-forward basis, de subset van hun interacties en andere inhoud op Facebook die zijn weergegeven in Sponsored Stories (indien van toepassing) 

• Ontwikkelen van instellingen die gebruikers in staat stelt om bepaalde posten of categorieën van inhoud of informatie over die worden weergegeven in de toekomst Sponsored Stories voorkomen 
• Herziening van de SRR om te bevestigen dat minderjarigen vertegenwoordigen dat hun ouder of wettelijke voogd instemt met het gebruik van de naam van de minderjarige en profielfoto in verband met commerciële, gesponsorde of verwante inhoud 

• Zorg voor ouders en wettige voogden met aanvullende informatie over hoe reclame werkt op Facebook in zijn Family Safety Center en bieden ouders en wettige voogden met extra tools om te bepalen of hun kinderen namen en profiel foto's worden weergegeven in verband met Sponsored Stories 

• Voeg een controle in kleine profielen van gebruikers dat elke minderjarige gebruiker in staat stelt om aan te geven dat zijn of haar ouders niet zijn Facebook-gebruikers en, waar een kleine gebruiker geeft aan dat zijn of haar ouders niet op Facebook, zal Facebook maakt de minderjarige niet in aanmerking om te verschijnen in Sponsored Stories totdat hij of zij de leeftijd van 18, totdat de kleine wijzigingen zijn of haar instelling om aan te geven dat zijn of haar ouders zijn op Facebook, of tot een bevestigde ouder in familierechtelijke betrekking met de minderjarige gebruiker is gevestigd. 

Voor zover het geld gaat, heb je tot 2 mei om uw claim in te dienen. Of kun je niets doen, natuurlijk. Persoonlijk denk ik niet dat ik een claim dat mijn onwetendheid bepaalt op het feit dat Facebook was om geld te verdienen off van Sponsored Stories in te dienen. Plus, ik vind mezelf het gevoel bijzonder benadeeld door het concept van een Sponsored Story. En op het einde, het indienen van een claim is gewoon meer een gedoe dan het waard is. 
Maar als je het volledig oneens met mij (als ik weet zeker dat velen doen), en ontving u een e-mail, kunt u verder gaan met de wetenschap dat dit allemaal legit. Gelukkig vorderingen indienen.

*Ok I am a 20 year old  that wants to hear some feedback on my financial plans and career aspirations.  I am pretty cofident that Iam doing adequate but I would love to hear any advice you have to offer. Everything can always be improved.

**Financials:**

* Checkings - $180

* Savings  - $1,850

* CD - $1,500 (1-Year  %0.45 interest/Dividend)

* Total Cash: $3530

* Line of credit - $500

* Credit Card - $1,000 limit

* Credit Score - 720

* Debt: $9,200 (auto loan)

	I only use my credit card to boost my credit score. I pay it off completely each month.

	After my expenses, I save roughly $950 a month.

**Income Breakdown:**

* Wages - $12 an hour ($1 raise every 6 months)

* Weekly Income - $390 (after taxes)

* Monthly Income - $1,560 (after taxes)

* Yearly Income - $20,280 (after taxes)

**Monthly Expenses:**

My monthly expenses add up to $615 a month. This includes a car payment, car insurance, gas, food, and fun money.
My car loan is a 5 year fixed rate at a %4.49 interest rate. That is $215 a month. I am about 6 months into it and have $9,200 left to pay. I always pay $100 dollors extra on principal so my payment is totals to $315.

**Career:**

I am 2 years through a 4 year apprenticeship as a commercial electrician.  At the end of this apprenticeship, I will be able to test for my journeymans card that will allow me to become a liscensed commercial journeymen electrician.  This will allow me to wire or facililate any electrical work in the state of Washington.

**Background:**

I decided not to go to college. Not my thing. I live at home rent free at the moment and am taking advantage.  I plan on moving out in around a year and a half to two years.  This will allow me accumalte around $15,000 in my bank account before I make the plunge. I get driven to work everyday so I don't really have to worry about transportation at this point.

**In two years....**

	* Life/Financials:

With the $15,000 I will have I plan to have when  I move out...

	* 1. Invest $5,000 into a Roth

	* 2. Save $5,000 for an emergency

	* 3. Not really sure for the last $5,000. Advice?


	*Career:

I will become a liscensed commercial Jouneyman by around age 22 or 23.  This will gurantee me atleast a very minimum $25 an hour with no roof really on how much I can make or who tells me what to do. I may even start up my own electrical business. I have yet to encounter all the oppurtunities that lay before me so I can't really be sure how much I will be making after the journeymen transformation.

The one drastic idea I have conjured up is the idea of heading out to Alaska after becoming a journeyman and really making the big bucks. I hear many people going down there in my line of work making upwards of $100 an hour with major over-time. This would be the the ideal situation of me being able to really put my head down and make some seroius cash. Just no life while down there.

**Goals (By age 30)**

*I want more than anything to be able to tell my parents they can go on summer vacation for the rest of their lifes on my dollar. Now is that going to happen? Probably not. Goals are goals though.

* I want to travel my self. Life is NOT all about working

* I want to be my own boss

* Get into the real estate game

* Living great while also living under my means

* Be a great musician (love playing the drums and piano)

* Still be playing sports weekly

* Political figure?

**Goals (By age 45)**

* As I said before, I want to travel. Life is NOT all about working

* Be financialy independent

* Do what I want when I want
 
* Be political figure


Feel free to give any opinion and advice!

* Stafford/Unsubsidized        **$13,000 @ 6.55%**
* Grad PLUS/ Unsubsidized    **$19,000 @ 8.25%** (*ouch*!)


Total Debt -                             ~ ***$80,000***

Total Monthly payments for these loans are as follows:

* Sallie Mae -  ***$243***
* Great Lakes - ***$175 + $180***

**Supplamental retirement account** - Employer automatically contributes amount equal to 5% of my base salary


Thank you if you've made it this far :)

***Repayment:***

For the past year I've been slowly paying down the loans out of my savings.  But I don't think this is the best move.  Just about the time that account runs out is when the payments are scheduled to double and this will have a significant impact on my lifestyle unless I get a big raise in the next year (which I don't count on happening).


Obviously I should see if I can tackle those 7% and 8% interest monsters first. I'm wondering if the best strategy for me is to contribute extra to pay those down as quickly as possible and then consolidate the rest of the loans over a longer pay period so the higher interest rate won't factor into the average.

I know the mantra here is to erase all debt as soon as possible but I don't mind extending the pay period and paying more over the long term on the smaller loans to maintain a quality lifestyle.

***Bonus Question:*** - Can I/Should I leverage my old 401k to pay the debt down?  Should I roll it into an IRA or leave it where it is?

personalfinance,I am trying to get a loan for school and I need some guidance.,"I went to a new school last semester after moving from Virginia to Pennsylvania. While I was in school in Virginia, I was receiving an in state scholarship that covered my tuition for four years while in public school. 

Unbeknownst to me (until a few weeks ago) I thought the scholarship was through Veterans Affairs. When I moved from Virginia to Pennsylvania, and transferred to a new school, I called Veterans Affairs and asked about my scholarship, to which they replied, ""fill out this paperwork and you'll be all set.""

All semester, nothing happened, and I was left with an outstanding bill of about $16,000 for the semester. I found out afterwards that my scholarship was only for the state of Virginia. Also, it was too late to get financial aid. 

As of right now, I can't get financial aid for last semester, and I am sitting with an unpaid bill. I need to get a loan from a bank to pay of my bill, but I am unsure of where to get it from. It is coming down to the wire, as I have been out of that semester for almost two months, and most places have a timeline of when you can get a loan for a past semester. 

My dad will be cosigning on my loan with me, but will only sign if it is low enough. PNC has an 8.25% interest rate, and my dad won't sign on that. I could really use some advice on where to go to get this straightened out so I can go back and finish school.

When I got my first statement I saw that, having done nothing but put money into the account the last few months, it's just sitting there earning a 0.01% interest rate. Wondering how this ""stacked up"", I checked my credit union's website and was surprised to see they offer 0.25% on simple IRAs.

I see there's an ""Income Invested:  $0.00"" line. I'm sort of afraid of it, but I have a feeling I'm supposed to be directing CS to do something with my money besides let it languish at a sappy little interest rate.

The odd thing I've found is that Great Lakes has split up my direct federal loans from my other federal loans into two accounts. Instead of paying each loan individually, I make two monthly payments (one for $165, the other for $80 - these are just a few bucks more than the minimum). The GL rep I spoke to assured me that the payments are applied first to interest (obv), then to the principal with the highest interest rate. Now, I did not consolidate these loans into two accounts - GL told me that this is how the loans were ""sold"" to them. I'm wondering if I'd be better paying each individually, and I'm also struggling how to figure out how interest is accrued. I'd like to use unbury.me and Tutition.io, but the strange grouping of these loans is throwing me off. Here's what I have:

GL Account 1: $6,851.15 principal ($76.64 monthly payment)

* Subsidized......... $4,450.23 @ 5.35%
* Unsubsidized..... $2,379.33 @ 6.55%

GL Account 2: $15,220.56 ($161.34 monthly)

* Subsidized..........$5,433.03 @ 3.15%
* Subsidized..........$5,433.03 @ 4.25%
* Unsubsidized......$4,354.50 @ 6.55%

Sallie Mae loan: $3,445.61 @ 6% ($50.33 monthly) -Also subject to a .25% interest rate deduction next month once automatic debit kicks in.

So I guess what I'm really wondering is if this looks normal. Obviously, I'd like to get rid of the higher interest loans first. The 6.55% with ~$2.3k principal is my first target, followed by the Sallie Mae. To do so, I guess my strategy is to pay any extra dollars to the first group of GL loans - any amt over the minimum $76.74 goes to principal on the 6.55% loan (after interest of course). Would I be in a better spot if I was paying the two loans separately?

**tl;dr:** Loan servicer groups together student loans and I'm wondering if I'd be better off without.

Sorry, this is a bit of a rant - I hope my question is clear enough. I tried searching around before posting but I couldn't really get a good understanding of GL's loan-grouping policy. I can answer any questions or other info that I forgot to bring up. If it's relevant: I graduated and started working in May 2012 @ $36k salary (bumped to $42k in December).

personalfinance,Break Even Salary Analysis,"Hey PF, I was hoping someone could help me run the math on this situation:

-Fiancé is a government employee with ~$121,000 in federal student loans at 7.25% fixed interest rate

-Her gross salary is $53k a year (no bonuses, cost of living, or raises expected).

-Currently her income based loan repayment is $379/mo.

-If she continues to work for the government for another 6.5 years and does not miss any loan payments, the remaining balance on her loan is completely forgiven as part of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

-If she chooses to leave government work for the private sector (requiring full repayment on the loan), what would her new salary need to be to completely pay off the loan in the same timeframe of 6.5 years? 

Note: (1) assume no change in spending behavior, she would continue to live as if making $53k and commit the increased income fully to loan repayment; (2) a higher income tax bracket will presumably need to be taken into account; (3) Public Service Loan Forgiveness is not taxable as income under section 108(f) of the IRC; and (4) don’t take into account any deduction for student loan interest.",finance,1360250390
personalfinance,"Questions about Taxes, Student Loans, and Saving","My Job:

I'm 21. I just started a job as a teacher. My salary is about $32,000 a year, but I am paying for healthcare, I have union fees, and there are heavy taxes. My bimonthly paychecks are about $890.  

My expenses: 

* I also have student loans (federal- $507 a month, state- $100 a month). I live in a trailer with rent at $350. I pay $87 for car insurance. I drive about 35 miles a day to and from work. I fill up every 200 miles at about $20, sometimes more (I think that's about $150 a month in gas). My weekly groceries are $35, so monthly it's about $140. 

Here's where I need help:

* I'm moving to Boston at the end of May and wanted to save $500 a month for moving. I can't go any lower on that. I've already bought my plane ticket.

* I've never paid taxes before. In fact, I didn't know there were federal and state taxes, and I frankly have no idea whether I'm supposed to pay money or will get a 'return'. I'm all on my own and I've been crying over the last 2 hours because I've never filed taxes, I don't have a tax filing pin thing, and I live in a state where I can't file them for free with H&amp;R or whatever.

* I have a car that my mom gave to me, but I never put it in my name. I was going to register it and sell it (blue book value at around $1100), but I was just told by the mechanic at BrakeMaster that my axles are near snapping, and that it'll be $250 PER axle to fix. I need the car until two days before I move. Is it worth registering? Can I even sell it? Should I see if I can sell it for parts with my other mechanic at a local auto shop?

* I just got a bill in the mail saying that I'm three weeks late on state student loans. I was under the impression that all of my loans were in the same place. It was $507 total; now add another $100 to the monthly equation. I just applied for income-based reduction with the federal loans, but I am not sure when that will go through or if it will work. My bills are due on the 15th of every month.

I know that's a lot of information, but can anyone give me advice about my budget? I feel like such a failure for not being able to figure this out on my own, but my mom never taught me this stuff. I've lived on my own since I was 17. I've been in school for the past couple of years- I have half my Master's degree done and I have a steady career at 21, but I've never paid taxes, I don't know how to save money, and I am already fucking up my student loans. I can't ask my family for help because nobody else has gone to college, a lot of them are drunkards, and I don't want them to think I'm a failure.",finance,1360246623

* Sallie Mae: ~$7.1K @ 10.25% w/ $250 min payment
* Discover: ~$22.2K @ 10% w/ $186 min payment


Federal:

* Direct Con. Loan: ~$27K @ 5.25% w/ $133 min payment



I'm trying to lower my overall monthly liability because I also have around $6000 in CC debt that I want to pay off in the next 12-18 Months. I make around $70K a year. 

I've seen some low interest rates on: https://consolidation.custudentloans.org/home/rates_and_fees... Basically, w/ my credit score (718) I am hoping I can get a loan for around 6% and lower my monthly payments by ~50%. I want to take those extra savings and put them towards my CC payment to pay it off faster. And once the Card is paid off, increase my loan payments back up to what I can comfortably afford. What worries me is that the consolidation loan is variable, Base Rate (Assuming 5.25%) + 3 Mos LIBOR (currently .33%). I've been looking at the LIBOR rates for the past decade and have seen them go as high as 6.5% which could push my interest rate up significantly more than what they are at now. My questions: 1- Is this a good strategy to get out of CC debt faster and save on interest on the Student Loans? 2- How likely is it that the LIBOR rates will jump 3-4 points in the next 5 years?


My gut tells me it probably isn't a good idea...

personalfinance,How should funding a Health Savings Account (HSA) be prioritized?,"If you're unfamiliar with HSAs, here's a little about how they work:

* You're eligible for one when you have a high deductible health plan (HDHP)
* You fund it with pre-tax dollars similar to traditional 401(k)s or traditional IRAs
* Your money rolls over year to year unlike Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)
* You can keep the HSA after you're no longer insured with a HDHP, you just can't contribute to it
* If you spend the money from it on qualified medical expenses, you are not taxed. If you spend it on non-medical expenses, you are taxed and pay a penalty
* If you withdraw for non-medical expenses after you turn 65, it'll be taxed at ordinary rates but there's no penalty

Where should HSAs fit into your priority for funding tax-advantaged accounts? It's pretty unlikely you won't eventually have medical expenses to spend it on, so it's unique in that the money will never be taxed in that scenario. But like many 401(k) plans there are often fees associated with investing in HSAs and the funds can be limited and expensive. Personally, I'm 25 with not a ton of medical expenses and max mine out. Anyone else approach theirs differently?

Note: some states don't treat HSA contributions the same way as the federal government does, though I'm not too sure of those details.",finance,1360206807

so i decided i might like to become an economist, b/c i question why we do the things we do. i question so much that i don't really end up doing anything.

we do things obviously b/c we are rewarded, but are we always compensated enough to do the things we are doing? or are we just buying into a myth that we are.

at an elderly ten years old, my friends dog goes obediently into it's crate because, as a puppy, it was fed every time it entered its little prison.
we're supposedly smarter than that, but sometimes i question that assertion.

the big tall buildings and activity of the random cities i find myself increasingly wandering through are the physical manifestation of all the work being done, willingly or unwillingly, for good reasons and bad. and when i see them, especially as an outsider, who has more or less fallen out of the economy, i wonder:

-why all this, what for? of course adam smith and others has explain this (very well), but having worked some really BS jobs, I wonder why should you buy into the system if you could be happier spending your time and efforts in another fashion.

-why i am not a part of this system i can't figure out.

-how i can become part of it.

i think after i took the GREs and got a good score, grad school became the most feasible answer to question number 3. so i applied, and hoped to work at restaurants until i got in and started on some respectable track. but i got fired from the good restaurants i worked at and my mom nearly had a nervous breakdown b/c her son was a dishwasher, so i gave that shit up.

(backstory, i got pushed out of a software job and shortly thereafter got in legal trouble. my rcord + the economy = tough luck, kid)

anyway. all these decisions. when i saw my friend aaron, still at VT, I told him how, when you enter the real world - unless you have a job you are faced with actual non-binary, complex decisions. That is to say, more complicated than school A or B, 

when you get kind of in a rut - your question is ""how do i get out of this rut?"" if you hit rock bottom, it is ""how do i climb my way out of this hole?"" not either or decisions.
Succesful people have a talent for finding answers to these types of questions, you probably know some of those people, who seem to know how their life will look 5 years ahead of time.
I knew a few like that and I tried (unsuccesfully) to be like them. My main problem was with the law, but my other problem was that I never hit rock bottom. So I always had options, and I always chose the most expedient one. But when I finally hit skid row, so to speak, I had no options (I'm using the past tense by the way, but as I write this I am still right there) so instead of either or decisions, i had to *[think for myself](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve)*

thats the painful fact. succesful people, the people who can succesfully navigate themselves through a complicated world - who have good ""vision,"" tend to also be the people who have the either-or decisions. Because they aren't in desparate situations. Move 3000 miles for slightly better salary in San Fransisco? Harvard or Yale?

gaming,THE FUTURES SO BRIGHT - By Deep Seeded Geek,"Recently, I read a book called “Ready Player One” by Ernest Kline.

The book takes place in the not too distant future where most of the population has retreated to living in a virtual reality called the Oasis. Imagine if World of Warcraft engulfed the internet and everyone could access it for free with the use of V.R. Goggles and Haptic gloves. Within this world lives the protagonist who, like many others, is on a quest to find hidden clues within this world that would grant them ownership of the entire Oasis. This is a book written as a love letter to all of us who grew up geek. 80's pop culture, video games, cartoons, sci-fi, everything gets a tip of the hat throughout the book. And many ideas are presented to the reader that stick with you long after the finale.

Which leads me to the topic for today. In the book, the education system has changed dramatically from what we know today. Because everyone had become so obsessed with the Oasis, the board of education had decided to incorporate it into their way of life. Meaning you didn't have to physically go to school anymore, but your virtual self was required to by law.

How it worked was that anyone under the legal age was required to be logged into between a certain time to attend a virtual school. At any time, there could be students into the thousands all sitting in to listen to the same lecture being given. The beautiful thing about it was that it allowed everyone to get the same standard of education...and it was free!

Now this wasn't just a classroom like we know it today, this was still a virtual world. So say a science teacher was giving a lecture on the planets? Well there is talking about it...and then there's being able to transport every student to one of the asteroids floating within Saturn’s rings and see it first hand. Or reenacting the fall of Rome as a spectator or soldier. Or how about watching a performance of Hamlet in a recreation of The Rose Theatre in the actual time period? Education becomes a much more tangible and desirable thing.

When I finished the book, this was a topic I kept coming back to. For a long time I was left wondering, could that be possible? How close are we to that becoming a reality?

Before I answer that, I want to share a few discoveries I've come across in the last little while.

Many of my clients are educators in grade schools and high schools throughout the city. It's not surprising to hear how the teachers have incorporated the use of tablets and smart-phones into their everyday use, but they've gone so far as to allow their students to use them as well. And in some instances, the school provides them the devices for use in the classroom! I can see where their line of thinking was where they want to get the kids excited and interacting with their lessons...but at the same time, I see this as being a defeatist approach thinking that, “Well we can't get them to stop texting during class, might as well try to bring it into the fold.” I don't see it working out the way they hope it will, but time will tell on that.

To take it a step further, one school that I know of has adopted the use of Smart Board technology into their classrooms. It's essentially an interactive white board with touch capabilities that can also double as a standard PC. That sounds a little closer to the idea of bringing an interactive media to the classrooms, where it would combine the old over-head projectors with a chalk board AND the old film projectors as well. It's like Apple's version of a chalk board. An iBoard!

Quite possibly my favourite example of this idea becoming a reality is finding a plausible reason that a school would ever allow what is essentially a video game to be used during a lecture.

To my surprise, the answer came in the form of Minecraft!

In the documentary for the video game, we are introduced to Minecraft.eu. A program that is bringing Minecraft into schools around the globe. Used by teachers and students. The game has been a huge success in not only getting students excited about school, but has also had staggering success in improving overall education. My favourite instance in the film was where a parent tells the filmmakers that he doesn't have the heart to say to his child, “Time to turn off the video game” when he looks over to see his young son figure out all on his own how to build a working aqueduct to build his crops in the video game.

I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DO THAT!!!

Now that's the educational side. From the technology side, this year alone in we are going to see the introduction of Smartglass integration with Microsoft and Xbox, V.R.  technology become a reality with devices like the Oculus Rift bringing your field of view into the 3D game world. And if that's not enough, just a few years back someone had the idea to make the ultimate gaming environment incorporating 360 degree view, body scanning motion technology, multi-directional treadmills, and paint balls simulating impact, to create the most realistic first person shooter experience.

The technology is all there. The schools are already in the game. The future could be closer than we all think.

And still...we don't have flying cars!? I mean what the hell???

But enough ranting from me, let's hear from all of you! What is your opinion on future tech and it's implementation on our daily lives?

And as always, if you want to watch the video version of this topic, you can find me over on YouTube as Deep Seeded Geek.

I have three maxed out credit cards to pay off, Visa ($8,000 balance), MC ($6,000 balance) and Store ($3,000 balance). The interest rate on all of them is the same (19.99%).

I have calculated the math, and based on my budget and income, I should be able to pay all of them off by the end of the year. However, the Visa sends me offers every couple months for 0% transfers. The transfer fee is 1%, and the current offer is 0% interest until November 2013. There are no limits (apart from my credit limit, of course). 

Would you recommend throwing all my payments (twice monthly) at the Visa, then immediately transferring out funds at 0% (plus the fee) to the other cards? If I have it figured out correctly, this would gradually turn my ~20% Visa debt in 0% debt , due to the new laws saying that highest interest debt gets credit applied first, after min payment, while simultaneously paying off the other two. Of course, once the other two are paid, I will pay down the Visa balance.

What I'd like to do is make one-time payments to pay off each of the 6.55% loans and ignore the other ones, but I don't see *any* information on their site about doing this.

Has anyone had experience dealing with a similar situation, through GreatLakes or otherwise? Should I be able to pay towards the individual loans in these accounts? If so, how?",finance,1360347642
personalfinance,"College senior, would like advice on paying off debt.","Here's my situation. I'm 22, set to graduate in May. I don't have a big kid job lined up, but I should be able to keep my current job if I can't find anything. I make ~$1000 per month gross, but after taxes and any time I take off, it's more like $750-800 a month. I just financed a $6500 car because my old one had major issues and it was costing me way too much in repairs, and I needed something reliable to get to work and school. It's a 4 year loan. I still live with my parents and they pay for the necessities like food and shelter.

I have about $500 in my checking account as I write this.

Here are my monthly expenses:  
$160 car payment  
$120 gas  
$70 car insurance  
~$50 health/medical (I don't pay for health insurance, but I pay any copays or prescriptions. It's high right now because I have some health problems I'm trying to get resolved.)  
~$150 food (I can eat the groceries my family buys, but I pay for the snacks I bring to work, any fast food I buy, or any restaurant meals. Between work and school I have like 60 hour weeks, and I often don't have time to stop at home and cook, so I get a lot of fast food.)  
~$100 miscellaneous like clothing/gifts/etc. I'm trying to rein this in, but I've been really stressed lately so I make some impulse purchases to make myself feel better.  
$25 minimum payment on the credit card I carry a balance on

Debts:  
$6300 left on my car loan at 7%  
$1630 on a credit card at 0% until January 2014, 19% after that  
$2200 student loan debt at 6.8%, unsubsidized so it is currently accruing interest  
$300 on a credit card I pay off every month at 19%

I'm trying to figure out which to pay off first. I'm somewhere between the debt avalanche and debt snowball camps...I want to pay off smaller debts first if I can, but if there's a 7% difference in the interest rates, then maybe not. I also need to get the timing belt replaced on my new car in the near future, it's about 30k miles overdue. It will cost about $600.

personalfinance,Mid career pension freeze,"Here's a story of how life turns out when you have a retail management career, no money to invest early in life when the economy is good, and later, when you can afford to invest, it's impossible over the 2000-2012 decade to make much return on your investments. 

Just got a notice in the mail today, current employer (major retail chain) froze the pension plan at age 54 with only 10 years on the  job.  That will translate to a meager $700 a month at 65 with no possibility of increasing.  

Sure we have $130  in a 401k and $85 in IRA's, but  as everyone knows, mid career conversions in your 50's from defined benefit pension to 401k cuts your monthly income at retirement in half, even with enhanced contributions from you and the employer, and that assumes you have 20 years in the pension fund, not 10.

The problem is our 401 k is not what it should be at 50 had we saved since 30, nor have we already accrued 20 or 30 years of defined pension contributions because every employer went bankrupt a few years into working there.  At every turn in this business, the employees have been shafted.

We're talking 4 major national retail companies that went out of business and stiffed their managerial employees for their pension. With a family to support, there was no money or time for college, which means each time a company went under there was no way to change careers either, just had get another managerial  job at another retail chain that seemed good for the long haul.

The reason there's only 10 years on the job here is because the last employer went out of business at age 44 with 6 years on the job, leaving only $ 20k from their pension plan to roll over into an ira that's now worth $30k.   

Before that, there was the 3 years working for low salary at a company that went out of business and left only $9k from the pension plan that got spent on credit card debt.  During that time we were also paying off the wife's student loans.

Before that was 4 years at another company that didn't offer a retirement plan at all, and before that there was the 3 years at the company that sold out to that one, before being vested in their pension plan.

And before that there was a failed attempt at self employment that left us $25k in debt thanks to the 1985 oil bust.  But by golly we paid it all off and didn't declare bankruptcy!

During those early years there was never any money for saving, we lived paycheck to paycheck raising 2kids, paying a mortgage, paying off the business debt, buying used cars, forgoing luxuries, skimping on necessities.   i'm talking buying kids clothes at thrift stores, getting birth control and free vaccinations at the health dept, clipping coupons, living on donated furniture, etc.

So when the kids went to college although salaries were improved by then we had no college savings, and had to take out PLUS loans for $ 100,000, for the 2 kids, rolled half into the 15 year mortgage and the other into a 5 year 401k loan.  We also paid cash out of pocket for their living expenses which came to $12k a year.

But by golly we never declared bankruptcy and paid every debt, that was important, as was putting the kids through college so they could start out with a better advantage than we did.

So here we are age 54 and only $200k saved for retirement and now we learn the pension will never exceed $700 a month all the while talking heads espouse cutting social security benefits. We still owe 3 years $35k on the 401 k loan, 12 years $171k on a $230k house, and 4 years $ 25k car loan, no credit card debt.  Is it time to leave this employer?  Or is it advisable to stay?

  Theoretically if this company doesn't go under we might could get it all paid off, but how to add to the 401k?  And with the track record of retail, what confidence can there be this company will still exist in 5 years.

Playing catch up on the 401 k is difficult since we had to lower the contribution by 10% to be able to afford the $900 a month PLUS loan payments.   Might could have squeezed another 2% into the 401k  contribution but then wham came the payroll tax increase.  So now its down to 2% until the loan is paid off in 3.5 years, at which time we can accelerate mortgage payments or max out 401k or some combo of the two. 

Part of this problem is the youngest son just graduated and is still on our insurance so we are paying a lot more than we should be. We have been on him to find a job with health benefits but he can't possibly afford his meds on his hourly $11 an hour job if we kicked him off the plan before then.  That problem will resolve itself next year when he turns 26 one way or another. 

So if any of you has any ideas how to parlay $ 200k  401k into a $4000 monthly  fixed income in 15 years, I am all ears.   Btw we already keep $5-10k in liquid savings for emergencies, already  have a Christmas savings fund, and plan to stay in this house until it is paid off at age 65.  The 401k money is half bonds/fixed and half s&amp;p index funds.

Medical bills are normal, kids are moved out, and we don't supplement them.  We live fairly frugally, already cut the cable cord and pay only $ 25 a month for netflix/hulu, and try notbto waste electricity, water, or gasoline.  on nice days we even ride bikes to the supermarket.  in the past we spent $1000 every Christmas on family outings but we have decided to stop that after this year.  We also recently decided to cut back on gifting, and have no plans for vacations or major spending.  We were going to do some house redecorating before the pension news, but those plans are off now.  

At this point we are considering taking boarders or foster kids for added income. Any advice on that?",finance,1360314030

personalfinance,I'm planning to buy a home within the next few months. Should I hold off on applying for another credit card?,"I'm in good financial shape right now. Just turned 30, make a decent amount, no debt, currently renting, and have a 700+ credit score. My new job requires that I travel often, mostly out of country. I usually spend about $500 USD overseas a month. 

I have 5 credit cards, but actively only use 2 (AMEX, Chase), both of which are about 2 years old. The other three are older ones that I just keep around (8-10 years old). I always pay off the full amount every month. All of these cards charge a 3% foreign transaction fee.

I was looking at applying for the CapitalOne Cash Rewards card, because of their no foreign transaction fee. However, I'm worried that this will negatively impact my credit score enough to affect potential interest rates for a home purchase. I'm still in the market for the right house, so it could be anywhere from next week to a year.

Should I just wait until after I purchase a new home? Or is the effect of my credit score being negatively impacted be minimal?",finance,1360305566

I also have no plans to buy a house or anything big in the near future really aside from that but as for any other expenses I might have I'm not entirely sure.

Woman was daughter of retired police Captain who reportedly represented the suspect in his termination hearing from the LAPD. The other victim was her fiance. Suspect was employed from 2005 to 2008 with the LAPD and was fired in early 2009 for ""allegedly lying about actions of a fellow officer"" he reported for excessive force.

* **Last few days:** Suspect posted his [11,000 word manifesto](http://ktla.com/2013/02/07/read-christopher-dorners-so-called-manifesto/#axzz2KI4SJAo8) [[another version](http://laist.com/2013/02/07/christopher_dorners_manifesto_in_fu.php), some are edited] to Facebook.

* **Thu. (5:15AM):** Torrance, CA - A patrol unit assigned to protect a different target misidentified the blue truck with the two women delivering newspapers.

* **Thu. 5:55 PM**: Suspect's recent history - Appeal to get his job back was denied in 2011, upholding original decision back in 2008 to fire him. In 2007, he had reported a fellow officer for excessive force on Mr. Christopher Gettler. In his statement, he said that ""she stood up and kicked Gettler twice in the left clavicle. And then...kicked him on the left cheek, causing him to start bleeding"". It was later reported Mr. Gettler was schizophrenic and that Dorner filed the complaint about his fellow officer two weeks later. His allegation was denied by the female officer, the claim was classified as ""Unfounded"", he was charged with ""making false statements"" and officially fired in early 2009. In December 2012, he defaulted on his home in Las Vegas and just days ago his Naval Reserve career was terminated [edit: honorable dischage]. *Source - ABC7 News.*

* **Thu. 6:00 PM**: Suspect's home near Las Vegas is surrounded but empty. The search area is covering all of California and parts of Nevada at this point.

[edit: per user /u/November_Bravo ""1 Minute of Angle, in shooting terms this means being accurate enough to shoot a ~1"" group at 100 yards""]. The video is apparently of Mr. Getter's interview after the event. He is the schizophrenic man Dorner claimed was a victim of excessive force. Getter's testimony supposedly confirms Dorner's complaint to his superiors but nothing has been shown to the public to confirm this.

* **Thu. 9:15 PM**: Press conference - ~400 homes expected to be checked this evening. No sightings or signs of him outside of the last tracks in Big bear in the snow/mud. No new tracks of a second vehicle near the original burned out vehicle. Schools and ski resort are opening back up, implying the area around Big Bear is relatively clear but search is ongoing in poor weather conditions.

* **Thu. 9:40 PM**: KCAL9 reporting multiple news sources received letters/DVDs from the suspect. Only Anderson Cooper got the coin, reportedly.

* **Thu. 10:10 PM**: Alleged excessive force victim Gettler's family interviewed, confirms suspect Dorner was standing up for their son (their words) but then pleaded with Dorner to turn himself in and stop hurting people. Also, the boat he tried to steal was unable to launch because a rope got caught in the propeller. The owner said the suspect mentioned ""heading to Mexico"". *Source - KTTV Fox 11.*

* **Thu. 10:30 PM**: Online court documents reportedly show that the LAPD questioned Dorner's excessive force claims because of the timing of reporting it to his supervisor. Apparently he received an unsatisfactory performance review just before that, saying he'd have to ""improve in order to move up in the department"". Dorner had then filed a wrongful termination suit against the LAPD. *Source - KTLA 5 News.*

* **Thu. 11:05 PM**: Dorner was honorably discharged from the reserves last Friday. Suspect was reportedly married for ~30 days back in 2007. LAPD has doubled up all patrols, no solo officers. Motorcycle cops have been put into cruisers for their protection. Various units at key strategic targets and the entire state is reportedly on tactical alert. *Source - KNBC 4 News.*

* **Overnight**: Various hoaxes, false reports, etc. Car in San Diego and sighting in white Lexus appear to be bogus.

Original snow tracks from the burned out vehicle were followed as far as possible until they hit frozen ground and lost them. *Source - SB County Sheriff John McMahon.*

personalfinance,Series EE US Savings Bond Questions,"I have about $7,500 worth of series EE paper bonds that my parents purchased for me throughout my early childhood (1989-1993). Many of the bonds are in my parents names. The bonds earn a fixed 4% interest compounded semi annually. I feel like this is a good rate for bonds and I plan to hold until maturity. 

Questions:

I would like to convert these paper bonds to electronic. Will doing this have any negative impact on the value of the bonds (i.e. conversion fees, tax implications, change in current interest rates, etc.). 

While converting, I would also like to change the name on the bonds from my parents to me, so they do not have to worry about the tax burden during redemption. Is this possible and what are potential issues?

Does anyone have any tips on how I could reduce the taxes that I will inevitably have to pay? I know you can use them to pay for tuition, and my brother is in college (freshman) right now.

I'm in the fortunate position of having been eligible for enough financial aid to cover the majority of my 4-year degree. I would be walking away from my BA degree program at a private university with $11k in student loans (still a lot, but relatively, not so much). 

However, I decided to pursue a 5-year program at my school, so that I would be able to walk away with two degrees (bachelor's and master's, in the same concentration), hopefully making myself more marketable to future employers. The 5-year program comes with a 50% tuition waiver for the Master's portion of the program-- as such, I'd be responsible for about $9k of the Master's tuition.

I have a decently-paying, secure office job right now, working at about 75% of full time (~ 30 hrs/wk, plus a full time school schedule) and am expecting to get a raise in May, when I finish the Bachelor's portion of my program. I carefully budgeted and will be able to pay outright for the master's portion of my program by saving a certain amount each month, combined with my existing savings.

My issue come into play here. The $11k in loans will enter repayment in December of this year. By that time, I'll still be saving in order to pay the graduate tuition, in an effort to not take out anymore loans. The $11k comes with a pretty low interest rate (3.4%), so I wouldn't be racking up an insane amount of interest. But I would feel more comfortable paying off the loans as soon as humanly possible (My fiance and I agreed to get married only once we are 100% debt free-- he's paid off his $13k in student loans by now and it's all on me.) because I want to start saving for a home/wedding (obviously the former is the priority, here).

I have about $7k in a UTMA account. Question is: **Should I put this 7k in its entirety towards my $11k in student loans?**

If I put the $7k towards the $11k principal balance, I will be left with literally about $300 in savings to my name, after also paying my graduate tuition outright. This is really risky, obviously. If I continue saving at the rate I am currently after I make the last Graduate tuition payment (Feb 2014), I should be able to have the $11k completely paid off by May 2014, when I graduate from my 5 year program (using the $7k savings + my normal monthly savings). Is paying off the loan right away worth the scariness of having a net worth of exactly $0 this time next year?

Sorry if this is confusing-- just wanted some outside opinions (fiance is obviously all for it, lol).

**Bonus Question!** Can someone give me the tl;dr of loan deferment? My loans are government loans, and I was curious as to whether I could extend my 6-month grace period since I'll technically be in school through May 2014, due to the 5 year program. I Googled this furiously, couldn't find any straight/consistent answers.

Many thanks for reading!

Bitcoin,Current worldwide economic signals of instability versus the future of Bitcoin.,"This started as a response to a post in a thread but I felt I should make it it's own post: Just thinking about three recent news events on monetary policy issues just gets me going crazy about the strength of the bitcoin.

Firstly the discussion of the 'trillion dollar coin' to be used by the Fed to 'pay off debts' completely devaluing my HARD EARNED savings because the Federal Gov't can't even balance its own budget is angering but sadly business as usual. Secondly, the currency war between nations and the resulting turmoil (and likely increased inflation and further devaluation that that will result in) only marks the increasing recognition of the house of cards governments have built for themselves economically. And lastly, the increase of credit card companies skimming more and more from hapless consumers in the US with additional surcharges only makes the current system less and less viable. And all this time I was vying for a return to the gold standard to bring stability to our money yet since that obviously received no political traction I was almost completely resigned to losing all hope. That is until I found out about you guys. 

Remarkably I find that there is a panacea, Bitcoin. You guys are making it happen. You are true revolutionaries of the 21st century. There will be no need for guns or riots or protests. The freedom to choose will empower all of us to remake the 21st century not as it started in the last decade, dictated by fear, war and financial crisis, but one emboldened by privacy, freedom, economic security and true democratic power of the people. You will all go down in history as being on the ground floor of the most revolutionary development since the automobile, and the steam engine (or metallurgy and agriculture-thanks losermcfail) . This frees us from our bonds of economic tyranny. I am amazed at your brilliance and your perseverance. I applaud your efforts and am tantalized at what marvels will be developed from your vast, collective imaginations.

7K Student Loan @ 5.5

Expenses and income are set in a range 'from' and 'to'.  Most of the numbers are somewhat rough estimates, but should fall within those ranges.

I'd like it to be critiqued and have suggestions made for things I might be missing and can change.  This is very loose, and I'm not married to any of it.  The spending money can come down, but I'd like to keep at least something budgeted.  We use that to save for special events like birthdays and holidays.  Savings is going toward an emergency fund that we are just beginning, and you can see our credit card debt off to the right.  We should be able to have that paid off by the years end or sooner by this budget.  Credit card interest rates are 7% on the bigger balance and 12% on the smaller.  

Rent is low, but will most likely be going down to free as a result of a program that we're interviewing for that will be a second job for my wife and I beginning in March or April.  That extra money will go straight toward debt.  

As you can see, I don't have anything in for our student loans, because those haven't come in yet.  My wife's will be coming in next month, but we don't know what those payments are going to look like yet, since we're applying for IBR.  I'm more interested in getting credit card debt paid off, and then tackling the student loans.  I'd like to be paying $600/month at least on those once we get there.  I'm just afraid that's going to be a conservative amount.

personalfinance,Roth vs. Traditional: An argument in favor of Traditional,"I think the general consensus is that it effectively doesn't matter which one you choose if you think you'll be in the same tax bracket later, but I think it does matter for a couple reasons.

1. What if you work in an income tax state and you choose to retire in a state that has no income tax (like Florida)? My state has a 5% income tax. California is even worse. That's a huge chunk of money!

2. Our tax brackets are progressive. Have we forgotten to consider that? If you're in a 25% bracket now and plan to be in it later, the Roth will be  taxed at the full 25% since it's taken from the top. But what about when you start withdrawing from a tax-deferred account? Some will be taxed at 10%, some at 15%, and some at 25%. Given a $40,000/yr withdrawal rate, that is effectively 15.1%. Quite the difference!

3. This ties in with #2, but keep in mind that since you will no longer be contributing to a 401k or savings, you will be able to have a much lower annual income. So not as much of your income will be in higher brackets as it is now.

What do you guys think? I'm personally in favor of Traditional, but maybe that's because I like seeing the larger numbers in Mint. However, I do feel that tax diversification is important, so I do plan to begin maxing a regular Roth IRA soon, especially since I like the option of penalty-free withdrawals. (I haven't started yet because my employer matches a portion of my 401k contributions up to the federal limit, so that is my priority.)

But I do not intend to convert my Traditional 401k into a Roth for the reasons stated above.",finance,1360388014

Bitcoin,Exchange business structural question,"I'm pretty sure the tax system (GST) in my country (Australia) prevents the possibility of an exchange business based on my current knowledge and what I'm hearing from others. So I thought I would put this out to the greater community to get some clarification.

Disclaimer: Please excuse my naiveity here.

Operating on the assumption that bitcoins are esentially a piece of licensed software, never actually ""owned"" and the rights (copyright) belongs to the contributors and Satoshi Nakamoto albiet open source. This classes Bitcoin as a digital product and so according to the law, tax applies to all Bitcoin purchases (income) made on the exchange.

(I know the difference in reality, it behaves as a currency not software, coins are owned by the person who has access to spend them. I speak here from an official ""outsider"" perspective.)

So let's say I'm an exchange and the tax is 10%, this means I must sell you 1BTC for 110% of it's actual value; or alternatively absorb that cost of business at a ~10% loss. Explicit example, you buy 1BTC worth $20 for a total of $22.

Now let's say you cash out straight away, in fairness you might expect $22 in return. Well unfortunately I don't pay you tax back because your an indiviudal, $2 of your original transaction has gone to the Tax Office never to be seen again, so you're only getting $20 back (expense).

I'm assuming this problem is solved by companies like Paypal declaring themselves or their transactions as ""banking in nature"" -- banks don't charge or absorb tax costs every time I deposit money in to my account. Or with escrows, the money is held in a trust which acts a promise to pay and isn't declared as income either.

I'm also assuming this solution only works when the consideration is tied something of actual value, like precious metals or federal backing. I read this is actually the [Australian legal definition of a valid currency](http://matholroyd.com/post/34232285907/the-irony-of-australian-e-currency-laws). So because Bitcoin is backed by ""nothing"" or speculative value, it's not seen as a currency and the framework wouldn't support it. 

I don't see how any of this works without suffering from epic losses or losing the ability to be competetive. Am I right in my assumptions here? Or am I missing some accounting mechanic that makes this possible?",cryptocurrency,1360373993

personalfinance,Escaping from FHA PMI,"Hi PF!

I'm a regular reader here and semiregular poster, but I'm looking for some advice on the correct way to escape from FHA PMI. I'm hoping this post isn't too technical, but please let me know if I can clarify anything.


As I understand it, the conditions for escaping FHA PMI are:

* Have a 78% LTV ratio from the amount of the original appraisal (not the current appraised value)
* On time payments for five years

Now, let's get into the specifics of my situation:

* I owe about 395k on the house
* My PMI payments are about $400 monthly. This constitutes about 8% of my total spending across everything.
* The original amount of the loan was 410k, giving me a 3.7% FHA LTV ratio
* According to Zillow, the appraised value of the house is now about 440k, giving me a ""real"" ~10% LTV ratio.

From here on out, I'll use two terms. FHA LTV refers to the LTV of my loan as the FHA sees it, which equals (amount owed) / (amount originally appraised). Real LTV refers to (amount owed) / (current appraisal).


As inflation takes its course (assuming house value rises with inflation, and rate of 3%, bear with me), and I continue to make mortgage payments, my real LTV ratio will fall quite quickly without any intervention from me. For example, today it would require a 50k lump sum payment to reach 78% real LTV. If I wait a year, it will only take about 35k because the value of the house has increased due to inflation and the amount owed has decreased due to payments. If I pay no lump sum at all ever, I'll hit 78% real LTV in late 2015.


My loan originated in late 2011, so the earliest I could conceivably dump the PMI without refinancing would be late 2016, which is a frustrating answer. So I'm thinking of pumping a large sum of money into the house and then refinancing. By my calculations, if I put 50k in today, I would get returns on that equal to the interest rate of my mortgage PLUS the money saved from lack of PMI. Given that this would save me about 18k in PMI over 4ish years, this seems like a guaranteed 12% annual return on my 50k investment, which is pretty sweet. I currently have about 80k in the stock market, plus a stock bonus and tax return heading my way this month. If my math is correct, this would be a higher-yielding place for my money than the market with none of the risk, which seems like a slam dunk.


Does this strategy make sense? Am I missing anything serious? Thanks for reading!",finance,1360477754

--Bank accounts

--paying for funeral; there is life insurance, but how soon do you have to pay for the funeral? I imagine the life insurance is not disbursed instantly.

I make 130k/year with about 10-15k annual bonus.  I was pr-eapproved for 750k recently. I am putting 75k down and 1st loan is for 600k and 2nd loan is for 75k so I don't have to pay PMI.  First loan is at about 4%, the second at 5% but higher interest is still cheaper than PMI. I have the funds for 20% but I don't want to tie up 150k in the house.  

I did the following calculations.   
Montly PITI is 4117.  Out of that  
1. Principal is 954  
2. Interest is 2312  
3. Prop tax is 750  
4. Insurance is 100

Total tax deductible costs are interest and prop tax which come out to 3062 and result in 928 in fed + state tax savings.

I am also paying off 954 of principal every month.

So when looking at the monthly payment of 4117 I have to subtract the tax savings and principal payments to come up with 2233 of ""money down the toilet"" which is basically the interest and prop tax after fed and state tax deduction.  My current rent is 2100 so it's very similar.

Even though the house looks like a lot at 6x income, tax savings and principal payments make the ""wasted money"" the same as with rent, but instead of 2/2 apartment I'd be living in a 4/3 house. Similar houses in the area rent at 3000.  Plus I would benefit from any appreciation as I would be living in the house for at least 15 years.  The principal part of the payment would increase and interest would decrease over the years as well. 
I have a pretty stable job and don't intend on leaving the area. Of course a lot of things can happen in 15 years, but at least I'm not planning to make the move on my own.  

Wanted to check if others have made similar calculations and if I'm missing something.  
I am aware of the risks, interest rates could go back up to 6% which would bring the prices down, I could have to sell quickly for a loss and lose my down payment etc.  But I just want to check the numbers, assuming that I will stay in the house for 15 years.

* Draghi says will monitor impact of euro strength
* Yen on course to log seven straight weeks of fall
* Pound recovers after incoming BoE chief drops no easing hint
* Aussie rebounds on China data after hitting 3-month low

TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a two-week low on Friday after the European Central Bank chief voiced concern about the impact of the currency's recent strength on the economy in remarks that analysts said went further than they had expected.
Mario Draghi said on Thursday that the exchange rate is important for growth and price stability and that he wants to see ""whether the appreciation is sustained and will alter our risk assessment as far as price stability is concerned."" Analysts said.
The euro traded at $1.3405, close to its late U.S. levels after having fallen 0.9 percent on Thursday. At one point it fell as low as $1.33705, the lowest since Jan. 25.
Draghi said economic activity in the euro area should recover gradually in 2013 but added there are more negative risks than positive.
""I got the impression that he went into greater depth than expected...given that last month he just read out a G20 statement, when he was talking about currencies,"" said Teppei Ino, currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
The euro also slipped to a two-week low against the British pound, which broadly strengthened after incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney gave no hints that he favoured immediate easing monetary policy.
The pound also rose against the dollar to $1.5718, off a six-month low of $1.5630 hit earlier in the week.
The single currency also slipped against the yen from a 33-month high of 127.71 yen set on Wednesday to trade at 125.40 yen.
Still, despite the latest setback, the euro could be supported by the perception that the ECB's policy easing bias is much weaker than that at the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""When U.S. and Japanese central banks are expanding their balance sheet, the ECB is shrinking its balance sheet. The euro is likely to be firm unless we have a major surprise in Italian election,"" he said.
Polls have showed Italy's centre-left bloc is in the lead to win the Feb. 24-25 election.
But its narrowing lead over the centre-right led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has unnerved investors on concerns that his policies, such as tax-cut proposals, could undo the country's efforts to win back investor confidence.
The yen edged up slightly from late U.S. levels on profit-taking but is still on course to log seven straight weeks of losses against the dollar, which would be the longest spell since 1989.
The dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 93.48 yen, as traders took profits after its failure to convincingly break above a major resistance at 93.96, a 38.2 percent retracement of its 2007-2011 decline. But it's still up 0.8 percent on the week.
The dollar hit a 33-month high of 94.075 earlier in the week as investors sold the yen on expectations that Japan will pursue aggressive monetary easing to shore up the economy.
The country's deteriorating balance of payment also weighed on the yen. Data showed Japan posted a current account deficit for two months in a row in December, the first time the balance turned red for two straight months in data dating back to 1985.
The Australian dollar dropped to 3-month low of $1.0256 after the Reserve Bank of Australia trimmed its growth and inflation forecasts, but the currency bounced back after strong Chinese exports data.
It last stood at $1.0295, up 0.15 percent from late U.S. levels as data showed China's exports grew 25 percent in January from a year earlier, above expectations of 17 percent growth, adding to evidence of an economic rebound.

* $14,800 @ 10.5%
* $5,600 @ 9.25%
* $6,200 @ 7.25%

I have around the same amount in Federal loans too, but those interest rates are pretty manageable. I also have around $5000 in revolving credit card debt that I'm trying to pay off (hard when my student loan payments alone are ~$800/mo).

From the various free credit score sites (credit karma/credit sesame/work credit monitoring) I'd estimate my credit score to be around 700-720. I'm thinking I should wait until my credit card balance is ~$1000 lower before applying for anything.

Here are some specific questions I have:

* Who are good lenders for private student loan consolidation? (Looking at Wells Fargo currently)
* Do you think I can apply without a cosigner at this point?
* Do you think my credit score could get me a low rate?
* Should I risk variable interest rates? It seems like they've been low for as long as I can remember.

Tax credits to soften the blow?,"Not many people know about [AmeriCorps](http://www.americorps.gov/), but essentially it's the the domestic Peace Corps and at the end of your term of service you are granted an education award that is listed as other income with the IRS (absolutely no way around that - it is treated as income not a scholarship).  I served a term last year and upon graduation I applied my full education award amount (to the tune of ~$7000) for various reasons with the idea in mind that I would use my savings to cover the tax burden.  Which was stupid in hindsight when I could have split the award across years, but I was afraid of my student loan interest at the time and now I'm stuck with the decision.  On top of this, I owe a small amount of taxes due to one employer I had last year that didn't withhold anything state or federal.  Hence, my total tax burden is now at a whopping $1521.  I figured that I was stuck paying it, but after I just filed my taxes a friend brought up the idea of opening a last minute retirement account to get [a tax credit](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Get-Credit-for-Your-Retirement-Savings-Contributions), thereby I would at least be having part of the money go towards something for me personally rather than it flying out the window.

Not counting the extra paychecks/bonus, I currently have about $1400-1500 a month extra after all regular expenses, contributing to a 401k (I already get the full match) and fully-funding a Roth IRA. Total, I save over 20% of my take-home pay toward retirement. 

I have no school or consumer debt, but I do have about $103k left on my mortgage (4.125% interest rate). I have a 10k emergency fund (9 months of expenses if I lose my job, about 6 months of expenses if I and my spouse both lose our jobs). 

What do I do with the excess income? I don't really have the patience or the desire to play with stocks outside of my retirement funds. CDs are terrible right now because of the low interest rates. Right now all I can think of is:

By David Ariosto , CNN
updated 9:42 AM EST, Wed February 13, 2013 CNN.com 

 
New York (CNN) -- Banks are holding more than $200 million in insurance payments meant for victims of Superstorm Sandy, nearly four months after the storm made landfall, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday.

The Cuomo administration said it has delivered letters to various banks and mortgage service providers asking they ""use maximum discretion and effort to speed the release of funds.""

""Families need to be able to return to their homes and the state economy, which took a hit from Superstorm Sandy, needs the boost from spending on repairs,"" Cuomo said in a written statement. ""After insurance companies have sent homeowners checks to pay for repairs, the money should not be sitting with the bank because of red tape.""

A month of outrage later, Senate passes Sandy relief 

The state's Department of Financial Services found that four of the biggest U.S. banks -- Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citibank and JP Morgan Chase -- are holding more than 4,100 checks worth more $130 million. The banks were not immediately available for comment, though have maintained that they were socked with a massive amount in payouts that require processing in the wake of the storm.

Thousands of storm-battered residents are still awaiting a total of $208 million in insurance checks.
Cuomo said the payouts are often issued jointly to the homeowner and their bank or mortgage servicer, which then requires the ""bank's endorsement of the check before the homeowner may access the funds.""

Delays can follow when banks request proof of repairs or servicing required by federal mortgage agencies. But many residents have complained that they haven't received the funds they need to start the repairs.

Superstorm Sandy left 132 people dead in the United States and contributed to tens of billions of dollars worth of damages, especially along shoreline communities in New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut.

personalfinance,Retirement Calculations: How's this for reasonable?(US),"I've been working on an excel spreadsheet that would take in basic information, like salary, how much you save, and your mortgage payments and then estimate how many years you will have to work before you can retire.

I plugged in data from the census bureau (Median values) in bold. 

Household Income: **$50,000**

Married with 1 child, Taxable Income: $26,700

Federal Taxes Paid (Income + SS + Medicare): $6960

Saving 6% of Gross Income

Median New House Sales Price: **$220,000**

Monthly Mortgage Payment (20% down, 30 year @ 5%, 1.25% property tax): $1,173

Yearly Spendable Income (Income - Taxes - Savings - Mortgage): $25,960

Required Retirement Income (Spendable Income + Reverse Taxes): $29,733

Required Savings (3% Safe Withdrawal Rate): $991,100

Interest Rate on Savings (APY above inflation): **7%**  
(This was difficult to find and ultimately was fudged, factored in average stock market index fund return, with averaged bond return, and subtracted average inflation rate)

#**Years Spent Working: 46**

Now, this calculation takes several assumptions, and ultimately makes some sacrifices in accuracy for ease of calculation. But it gives you a great general idea of what's going on.

Essentially, the ""average American"" (Median values: $50k household salary, married with 1 child, in a house worth $220k @ 5% interest) can retire at 66 with a retirement account worth about $1M in 2012 dollars and doesn't need to rely on SS at all by saving 6% of their gross income into a pre-tax retirement account (401k or similar).

As I said, there's some assumptions in there that don't technically work out exactly the way they are assumed. First, nobody starts out making $50k per year at 20 years old and only ever gets raises equal to inflation. This affects your savings significantly, $50k saving 6% means the first year you save $3000. After working 45 years, that $3k has accumulated to $65k, more than 5% of your total retirement account came from that very first year that you deposited money into a 401k.

Second, no 3 person family that is making $50k buys a new $220k house with a 20% downpayment on a 30 year loan. The median values are skewed in this respect.

Finally, due to a limitation in my own calculations, I assume that you consistantly save 6% of your gross income yearly (into a 401k or similar pre-tax retirement account), and that after paying off your mortgage you simply start spending more yearly instead of saving more, but once you retire you revert to spending the same as you did during your mortgage paying years.

Anyway, after 46 years of working, the average American will be living in a house that's paid off, and is safely retired, withdrawing 3% yearly from their retirement account without accounting for social security.

Basically, what it comes down to is that even though your household was bringing in $50k in salary during your working years, you only had access to $26k of that money to spend on things other than mortgage payments (food, entertainment, vacations, cars, insurance, etc.). And, in order to replicate that $26k worth of spending money, you need to withdraw about $30k per year from your taxable retirement account. This means, that in order to retire at a comfortable median US lifestyle, all you need is a paid off house and $1M in your retirement account.

(Median values were obtained from Wikipedia and the US Census Bureau)

**TLDR: Get $1M into a retirement account. Live in a house that's paid off. Retire. Even Median Americans can do it.**",finance,1360781085

personalfinance,maximizing student loan interest deductability (paying down loans vs investing),"So, my student loans come out of grace period this year.
$10,000 @ 3.9%
$23,000 @ 6.8%

I have the means to pay a little extra on my student loans, lets say $5000 this year. I could also just put a little extra into my retirement funds

If you assume a reasonable return on the 401k of 6.8% (to make the math easy), before taxes the ROI of paying the loan down vs putting the money away in the 401k is equal.

However, because student loan interest is tax deductible (up to 2500) per year, that effectively reduces the interest rate of my loan by 25% (my tax bracket), so now the unsubsidized loan is effectively a 5.1% rate. This is before you consider that an extra payment would put me over the 2500 limit in interest deduction this year(since I deferred interest until now) so the ROI on the payment would be even less.  

For my example, I calculated the tax savings to be $763 by investing instead of paying the loan.

personalfinance,Could I get a better deal on my 30 year fixed refinance?,"Providing some specifics, so I’m using a throwaway.  

About 5 years ago I bought a condo for $280K with $20K down on a 6.25% 30 year fixed mortgage.  My monthly payment is about $1500 P&amp;I  plus $300 for local property tax and another $130 of Private Mortgage Insurance PMI.  I currently owe $240K.

I went back to my bank and applied for a refi and this is what they’ve offered:

* 3.75% 30-year fixed.   There are slightly better rates available, but I’d have to put in a ton of money that I don’t have to increase my equity.   The rate is also higher than average due to it being a condo instead of a house.  Coming from a 2.5% higher rate, it sure does look good as-is.

* $7K fees which would roll into the new loan for a new $247K starting balance

* PMI and property tax are still $300 and $130.

* P&amp;I portion would fall to about $1100 for a net savings of $400/month or $4800/year.

* 45-day lock on the rate.

Here is where it gets tricky:  Last year, a different bank, Navy Federal  , offered to refi  at a “competitive rate” (4% last year) with similarly rolled-in fees, *and* here’s the kicker: they would drop the $130 PMI.   So w/ Navy Fed  I could save another $1500+ a year vs. the first bank -- until about 2020 when my equity hits 20% and the PMI would come off automatically.

I am two-thirds of the way through w/ the refinance process w/ the current lender, and I’m already on the hook w/ them for $400 for the home assessment they already completed.   All I have left to do at this point is wait for their underwriting to greenlight my app and do the closing. 

Is there any reason I couldn’t give Navy Federal a crack at this point?   I am worried about having a second bank inquiry show up on my credit report when underwriting (at Bank #1) processes my application.  Could that ruin my application?   My home appraised for about $260K which was *just enough* to clear the LTV requirements at the first bank.   I fear that if I wait too long, my home value will fall to the point that I can’t refi at these rates.  If I read their graphs right, Bankrate shows that 30-yr fixed rates on average are just a quarter point over their *lowest point in years*.  I’m not economist so how much lower can those rates really get? 

**tl;dr:** Is there any reason I couldn’t get a refi quote from  (and possibly go with) another bank even though I’m just a few weeks from completing a refinance w/  my current bank?   I could save myself ~$12K over the next 8 yrs in PMI fees by going w/ the other bank.",finance,1360733595

personalfinance,"I'd like advice on how I'm doing, and if/how I should make changes (mortgage, investments, etc.)  Am also considering moving, and wondering what to do with my house.","Hello folks! 
It just occured to me this evening to poke around Reddit for stuff involving finances.  I figure there's so much I don't know, and although I think I'm doing all right, there's probably always room for improvement.  Trouble is, I'm not sure how to go about it, so I thought I'd ask here and see what folks think! 

For starters, I bought my house in 2009, and my interest rate is 5%.  I've been comparing rates to other friends who have since bought homes, and found they have down to 3%.  I'm not sure how best to go about refinancing, and what to watch out for to make sure I don't get taken for a ride, or wind up in a hole.  

I used an FHA loan to purchase the house, and am paying PMI premiums on it.  If I can get rid of PMI, I'd be saving about $30/month, but not sure what is required to get rid of it.  Additionally, I'm paying about $35/month for a ""we pay your mortgage for up to a year if you get laid off"" thing that came with my mortgage -- I've been recently wondering if it's worth more than the paper it's printed on, and if I should just ditch it.  

I have excellent credit (my score is 750+), have never had credit card debt (pay my cards off every month from day one) and own my vehicles outright.  I'm pretty stable at work, have decent income, and am generally pretty stable overall.  

I have a 401k through work which matches my contributions up to 6%.  I put in my 6% just to get the maximum match, and leave it at that.  I own stock separately in a few firms, I use the broker my family has been using for 30+ years, and let him tell me what to do.  He looked at my 401k, and had me alter my investment profile in it, which has borne fruit thus far.  I'm not too concerned about this part of things, since my broker is a really good guy, and hasn't steered me wrong since I started working with him.

I'm debating leaving the area that I'm in right now, as jobs are stagnating (I'm not exactly happy where I am right now) and I'd like to move out of state to where I can find more options for work, and better pay.  My big dilemma here though is my house.  I'm not sure whether I should sell it, or turn it into a rental property.  

Selling is attractive, as I could turn a bit of a profit on it, and it'd be less responsibility overall.  Just sold, gone, vamoose, no worries anymore.  

Renting is an alluring prospect though, as passive income is a good thing.  I'm not sure where really to start on this though.  From the financial perspective, I don't know how it'd affect my mortgage or my insurance (how I'd need to alter both and what they'd cost) nor do I know if I should be the landlord, or if I should go with a property management company.  Property management is alluring, as it's nice to get a cheque in the mail and not have to worry about dealing with tenants.  Problem is, I've heard they don't generally do a whole lot of maintenance to the properties they manage, and let things go downhill.  Lot of horror stories heard. 

Overall I feel a bit penned in, because although I'm able to keep paying the mortgage and bills without issue, I don't really know where to begin to shift my life around.  It feels a bit overwhealming.  

Thanks for making it through this post! 

tl;dr: 

* 1) I'm at 5%, and want to refinance, how best to not get shafted.
* 2) I've got an FHA loan currently and am paying PMI.  If I refi, will I still have to?
* 3) I'm paying for 'job loss' insurance on my mortgage -- I lose work, they pay for a year.  is this worth it?
* 4) I have a 401k and stocks, I think I'm pretty good on that, but advice on investing is always welcome
* 5) I'm considering moving, and debating whether to sell, or turn my house into a rental property.  
* 6) if I turn house into rental, pros/cons of property management
* 7) if I turn house into rental, how will I need to alter mortgage/insurance?

personalfinance,You seem like a money-savvy bunch. Here is the entirety of my financial situation. Give me your best advice!,"My S.O. and I make about $2,600/month combined after taxes. We purchased our first home last August. It's no palace, but it was a steal at $57,000. We both have very good credit, so we lucked out with a 3.5% interest rate. Our mortgage payment is about $410.

Our credit card debt amounts to around $6070. It was once over $14,000, but we spent the year previous to purchasing our home working hard to pay it down. Our credit card payments are about $155/month (four different cards).

Now the scary part. I personally have about $57,000 in student loan debt, and not much to show for it beyond a meaningless Associates degree. (Biggest mistake of my life, but to be fair, I was severely depressed, riddled with crippling social anxiety, and couldn't imagine much of a future for myself. I used the loans and the guise of a college education to postpone real life, because I simply couldn't cope with entering and engaging the world. Had I known then that I would one day find a bit of peace and would then have to drag this debt into another person's life, I would have done things very differently.) 
My student loan payments are about $350/month. As they were mostly private loans, I am told they cannot be consolidated. 

The rest of our bills (utilities, car insurance, phones, hospital bills, etc) come to around $500/month. 

If you're doing the math, that leaves us approximately $1,185 each month for groceries, entertainment, and miscellaneous purchases.

We do not have health coverage. We each have $90,000 worth of life insurance. 

We paid off our car last May, but my biggest financial worry is that the car will break down on us. I bought it new, but it is almost eight years old now with about 80,000 miles on it. 

I know it is probably possible for us to make more money, but we are pretty complacent in our current situation. We work together and have identical schedules, which would be very difficult to leave behind because I am the only driver between us. (Long story shortish: no one ever taught him to drive. I attempted it once, but we gave up. We haven't tried again because if we added him to our insurance policy our payment would double.)

I hate going to work. I feel like a slave to our bills every time my alarm goes off at 4 am. I very much want to retire on time, if not early. I just can't see how that's possible with this amount of debt. 

I am 27, btw. The S.O. is twenty-five. So if you've got some sound financial advice for us, we might have enough time to turn this all around.",finance,1360720557

investing,It's a good day for GE shareholders,"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nbc-deal-could-push-ge-235410246.html

Full text here:

BOSTON (Reuters) - News that General Electric Co is selling its remaining stake in NBC Universal to Comcast Corp earlier than expected may be just what the largest U.S. conglomerate needed to get out of the penalty box.
Its shares rose 3 percent in postmarket trading to levels not seen in normal trading since October 2008 - when Chief Executive Jeff Immelt was forced to cut GE's dividend and sell additional shares amid fears that the financial crisis would wreck the future of GE Capital and perhaps the whole company.

The NBC deal, worth $16.7 billion, is part of Jeff Immelt's campaign to refocus the world's largest maker of jet engines and electric turbines on its industrial roots, as it exits media and scales back its GE Capital finance arm.
The company also said it would buy back $10 billion of its shares this year - roughly 4 percent of its market capitalization - and raise its total authorized stock buyback to $35 billion from $25 billion.
If GE's shares trade above $23.18 on Wednesday, they will be at their highest since October 2008. They passed that mark in postmarket trading on Tuesday hitting $23.34.

During the depths of the financial crisis, GE shares had dipped below $6.

""We have been looking forward to them moving away from that NBC Universal, and this will give them more capital,"" said Mike McGarr, a portfolio manager at Becker Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, which holds GE shares. ""In the end they will get back to what GE used to be and probably with higher margins.""
The higher stock buyback will get Immelt closer to his goal of reducing the company's total outstanding share count to its level before the company sold $15 billion in additional shares to investors including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc during the crisis.

GE executives have repeatedly said they do not anticipate a repeat of the $11 billion wave of acquisitions the company embarked on in 2010 and 2011 to bulk up in the energy sector, which it funded with proceeds of the initial NBC deal.

""The core business that they have at the moment is fairly solid,"" said Morningstar analyst Daniel Holland. ""What I would look for them to do is repurchase shares.""

GE's initial 2010 deal to sell NBC Universal to Comcast had given it the option of selling the rest of its holdings to the No. 1 U.S. cable company in two stages, part in mid-2014 and the balance by the end of 2017. GE officials had said they were interested in selling the rest of the stake earlier rather than later.

LIVE FROM NEW YORK NO MORE?

In addition to the proceeds of selling the remainder of NBC - a deal expected to close by the end of the first quarter, more than a year earlier than investors had expected - GE is selling NBC-occupied floors at 30 Rockefeller Center to Comcast for $1.4 billion.

Built as the RCA Building in 1933, the 70-story building is the focus of the Rockefeller Center. It was renamed the General Electric Building in 1988 after GE required RCA, which it helped found in 1919. The building is home to the famous Rainbow Room club restaurant. Tishman Speyer co-owns the building.

The floors GE is selling include the studio where ""Saturday Night Live"" is produced, where Immelt and his top lieutenants have conducted the company's annual December outlook meetings. GE spokesman Seth Martin declined to comment on where GE would hold this year's meeting.

Immelt, who has run GE since 2001, has repeatedly emphasized to investors that the company would have a lot of cash to deploy in the coming years, reflecting both the NBC deal and Federal Reserve approval last year for GE Capital to resume paying a share of its profit back to the parent company.

""This company is going to have a ton of cash over the next three years,"" Immelt told investors in January. Immelt is scheduled to discuss the deal on a conference call Wednesday morning.

Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, which holds GE shares, said the higher buyback was welcome news.

""Additional share buybacks are likely to be positive for shareholders,"" Pursche said. ""The M&amp;A space right now has gotten a little expensive.""

My question relates to the Snowball Strategy of paying off, in my case, student loans.

I currently have a combination of private &amp; federal loans, all with different rates and terms. My larger balance loans (3/4 of total debt) are both private loans with a Variable Rate, currently 4% &amp; 4.86%. These are both 20yr loans.

The remaining loans (1/4 of total debt) are a combination of Federal and Private DOE loans with a Fixed Rate at 5.75%, 6.28%, and 6.86%.
These are all 10 yr loans.

If you had enough cash to payoff 1/4 of the current debt, would it be better to pay of the Fixed/Shorter Term loans to free up Cash Flow 

or 

Pay partial (1/4) on the Variable Rate and have less exposure to the Market, but have a higher monthly payment (+ higher emergency fund)

He oversimplifies finances to the point that, in my opinion, you're paying  a HUGE amount of money in the long run (in opportunity cost) for a ""fuzzy feeling"" or mental win.

For about a year, I stopped funding my TSP (Federal 401k basically) to pay off debts.  However, after reading this subreddit, and doing the math, I realized that funding my TSP at the fully matched 3% (additional 2% matched at 50%) hardly affected my paycheck in any meaningful way, due to the ""pre - tax"" TSP deduction and affect on other tax deductions due to the reduced income.  In fact, the ""reduced income"" almost ""pays"" for 1% of my TSP contribution due to the reduced tax hit.

For me, the extra two hundred some bucks a month thrown pre tax into a fund that gives an immediate 100% return is worth waaaaay more than saving the 5% I'm paying toward student loans.  (for the record, I'm still paying the loans off on an accelerated time line).

Here's a quick and fascinating breakdown by total amount held and percentage of total U.S. debt, according to Business Insider:
 
Hong Kong: $121.9 billion (0.9 percent)
Caribbean banking centers: $148.3 (1 percent)
Taiwan: $153.4 billion (1.1 percent)
Brazil: $211.4 billion (1.5 percent)

So America owes foreigners about $4.5 trillion in debt. But America owes America $9.8 trillion.

Even if America owes America 9.8 trillion plus to itself, does not mean it's not owed and is a big problem. If we owe this to our self then it must have been spent somewhere somehow. This is unless it was never spent on real goods. How much was the 9.8 trillion spent on foreign goods since we don't make much in the U.S anymore. Or a better question if this 9.8 trillion was not spent on goods. Then what did we buy with it or where did it come from? WTF is a dollar unit btw?",finance,1360859292

I just matched into a residency program this week and I will be starting residency in mid-June and moving from Tennessee to Michigan at the end of May. My wife and I are debating on whether or not to buy our first house. 

Details

* 
We are planning on only living in this home for 5 years. This is the length of the residency and we will be moving for fellowship following completion of residency.
* 
We do NOT have any money for a down payment (medical school is expensive and we do not have much in savings)
* We do not want to spend more than $900.00 per month on mortgage
* 
Our yearly income will range from $46,000 the first year to $52,000 the fifth year

* 
The area we are moving to is Grand Blanc, MI (48439)

Questions

1. For the short (relative to a 30 year mortgage) amount of time we will be living in this location, would it make more fiscal sense to buy a home or to rent?

2. If buying is the way to go, where do you start? We will probably only be able to travel to Michigan 1 or 2 times between now and the end of May. Should we go to a local bank that is also located in Michigan and apply for a loan? My wife has **GREAT** credit and I think we would be approved easily
3. How do you find programs that will help resident physicians receive good interest rates, if they still exist.

This is a completely new experience for us and we have no idea where to start; if I you need any more information, I would be glad to provide it. I really appreciate any advice you can offer!",finance,1360812529
business,International Cooper Chung Reviews - Stock market hoped to thrive in 2013,"International Cooper Chung Reviews
The Director of a Hanoi-based securities company said that he could see positive signals in the stock market in the latest bustling trading sessions.

Everything is now backing the stock market recovery: the government is making every effort to rescue the frozen real estate market, while the State Bank is considering loosening the lending to fund securities investment deals and easing the bank loan interest rates.

The director said that though 2013 is believed to be another difficult year of the national economy, the government’s announcement about the packages to stimulate the demand and the one percent interest rate reduction all have made investors excited.

This would lead to the higher liquidity of the most influential shares (the shares of real estate firms, banks and finance companies), which would help impulse the market development.

Besides, when businesses can get benefits from the bank loan interest rate reductions, they would be able to overcome difficulties, which would prompt investors feel more secure to pour capital into the businesses.

Sharing the same view with the director, NTH, a market analyst of a HCM City-based investment fund, has noted that the market has shown signs of getting better. Especially, if the bailout aiming to save the real estate market is launched, businesses would be able to clear inventories, put the capital flow through. All of these positive factors of the national economy would foster the stock market.

However, the analyst said since the bank restructuring process has not finished yet; there would not be big changes with bank shares. Meanwhile, the liquidity of securities companies’ shares would be better which would attract the cash flow back to the market.

Nguyen Doan Hung, Deputy Chair of the State Securities Commission, also said foreign and domestic finance institutions all believe that Vietnam’s economy would get better in the second half of 2013, which means that the stock market would bounce back again.

Securities companies to undergo major operation

According to Hung, if the inflation rate is curbed at low level, commercial banks would loosen the lending and reduce the interest rates. If so, deposits would be less attractive and the capital flow would head for other channels, including securities and real estate, rather than the banks.

Regarding the control over securities companies, Hung said the State Securities Commission (SSC) is restructuring the market and there are many things to do in 2013. One of the things is to reorganize and strengthen securities companies.

Hung said securities companies would be classified into three groups: good, average and bad ones, while the bad ones would be put under the special control by the watchdog agency.

In late 2012, SSC issued the Circular No. 165 setting up stricter requirements to impose a stricter control over the performance of securities companies.

Under the new legal document, a company would be put under the special control if it does not submit the report on its financial safety situation for the two consecutive periods, or it does make public the information about the audited or checked finance reports about which auditing firms gave negative comments or refused to give comments.

international hass associates news blog

Administrasjonen har lagt ut et executive bestille på cybersecurity for kritisk infrastruktur. Kongressen er ikke fornøyd. Men jeg tror at denne rekkefølgen i stor grad får ting riktig.

Rekkefølgen fokuserer på systemer og eiendeler, enten fysisk eller virtuell, hvis ødeleggelsene ville ha en ødeleggende effekt på sikkerhet, nasjonal sikkerhet, nasjonale økonomiske sikkerhet, nasjonale offentlige helse og sikkerhet, eller en kombinasjon. Det er riktig sett med problemer- og en langt gråte fra noen tidligere klassifisering av kritisk infrastruktur som hadde med alt fra en miniatyr golfbane i San Jose for å i vedtektene for Liberty i New York Harbor.

Ordren krever direktør for National Intelligence å dele Uklassifisert informasjon på cyberthreats med den Department of Homeland Security (DHS) i tide, og for DHS ""raskt"" formidle det samme til de målrettede enheten. Helt riktig.
Rekkefølgen setter direktør for National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) ansvarlig for å koordinere en ""ramme"" for å redusere risikoen for cyber mot kritisk infrastruktur. Det er rett byrået for jobben. DHS har rettshåndhevende organer i avdelingen, og disse gruppene har noen ganger komplisert forbindelser med den private sektoren. Sikring av kritisk infrastruktur-nettverk krever smir samarbeidsforbindelser med privat næringsliv. Begge NISTand sin overordnede avdeling, Department of Commerce, har masse erfaring med å utvikle slike frivillig innsats. Så var dette en god samtale.

Rammen er ment for å være ""prioritert, fleksibel, repeterbare prestasjonsbasert og kostnadseffektiv""--alle viktige aspekter. Rammen er å ""ta metoder for å identifisere og redusere [negative] virkninger"" på business konfidensialitet og personvern og borgerrettigheter. Og det er å bli gjennomgått og oppdatert med jevne mellomrom. DHS Sekretær vil etablere en frivillig program for å støtte innføringen av rammen. Alle gode.

Sektor-spesifikk byråer er å gå gjennom rammen og utvikle implementere veiledning. Dette er veldig viktig. Cyber-beskyttelse som gir mening for power grid er ikke de som vil fungere for telekommunikasjon, og ingen av de passer behovene til den finansielle sektoren. Sette på plass beskyttelsene som fungerer for hver sektor er en kritisk del av å få cybersecurity høyre. (Dette er noe kolleger og jeg har skrevet om her.) Montering kur til problemet er viktig, og det er viktig at dette har blitt anerkjent helt fra starten.

Det vil være årsrapport og insentiver for deltakelse. Det er nødvendig, og godt å se på plass.
Rekkefølgen er svakere enn det kunne være på innkjøp, ber bare om anbefalinger på ""trinn [at] kan tas for å harmonisere og gjøre konsekvent eksisterende anskaffelser krav knyttet til cybersecurity."" Dette problemet saker. Opp til nå, har vært en ettertanke: vi ønsker bjeller og fløyter, og oh, ja, hvis du kan gjøre det samtidig som man bygger et sikkert system, det er bra. Dette er ett sted administrasjonen kunne ha reell innflytelse, og det gjenstår for å se hvor alvorlig anskaffelser aspekt vil være.

Det er bra at DHS Sekretær må bruke en risikobasert tilnærming i å bestemme hvilke kritiske infrastruktursystemer trenger oppmerksomhet først.

Dokumentet er ikke uten problemer. På papir kommer personvern og borgerrettigheter tidlig (seksjon 5 i rekkefølgen). I praksis, det er noen fare for at personvern og borgerrettigheter kunne bli dyttet av bordet.
Beskyttelsene er å bli bygget på den rettferdig informasjon prinsipper, selv basis forprivacy beskyttelse rundt om i verden. Hva er trolig det viktigste i denne sammenhengen er rettferdig informasjon prinsipper beskyttelse mot ""sekundær bruk"" av informasjon uten eksplisitt velge i. Som er den gode del.

Den dårlige nyheten er at mangel på tennene på rettshåndhevelse side. Samsvar vurderinger vil komme fra DHS Chief Privacy Officer, DHS offiser for sivile rettigheter og borgerrettigheter, Office of Management og budsjett, og personvern og borgerrettigheter forglemmelse styret. Men mens man kan argumentere for at den nåværende DHS Chief Privacy Officer har en interesse i personvern, gjeldende DHS offiser for sivile rettigheter og borgerrettigheter er bare en fungerende avtale. Personvern og borgerrettigheter forglemmelse styret møtte fjor høst for første gang på fem år, og det fortsatt mangler en stol.

Administrasjonen har nå hatt en god post på aspekter av personvern. Nasjonal strategi for klarerte identiteter i Cyberspace har satt personvern front og senter i sin ID-innsats. I en årrekke har Federal Trade Commission aggressivt jage saker mot selskaper som bryter deres egne retningslinjer. Denne håndhevelse har vært sterk nok til at på minst de større bedriftene arbeider hardt å ikke bli neste. Og den gode nyheten på executive order er at dens fokus er på informasjonsdeling fra regjeringen til privat sektor.

Men om det er screening-enheter på flyplasser, den økende samlingen av telefon transaksjonsdata, eller regjeringen tilgang til alt fra forretningsoppføringer til biblioteket lån med en enkel bokstav for nasjonal sikkerhet (og uten juridisk overoppsyn), det er rikelig med grunner for publikum å tvile på den amerikanske regjeringens forpliktelse til personvern. Det er derfor denne ellers utmerkede dokumentet har noen måter å gå.

Hva mangler? For en start er det ingen styrende prinsipper i dokumentet. Vurdere hvordan det amerikanske forsvarsdepartementet har reagert på bekymringer om sin rolle i å beskytte cyber verden. Mens direktør for National Intelligence General Alexander ikke ønsker å være låste ned om hvor hans makt ender, var forsvarsminister Leon Panetta veldig klar på Dods rolle i cybersecurity. Sekretær sa at beskytte nasjonen mot cyberwar, ""ikke betyr at det amerikanske forsvarsdepartementet vil overvåke citizens' personlige datamaskiner. Vi er ikke interessert i personlig kommunikasjon eller i e-post eller å sørge for den daglige sikkerheten av private og kommersielle nettverk. Det er ikke vårt mål. Det er ikke vår jobb. Det er ikke vår misjon.""

Den gjeldende executive ordren, diskuterer imidlertid prosessen, men ikke prinsippene. Presidenten kan ha samme intensjoner som sekretær Panetta, men slike beskyttelse må være tydelig stavet ut. Hvor gjør det sier at overvåket skal bare brukes til å hindre aktive skade på datasystemer? Den personlig kommunikasjonen vil bare bli overvåket av regjeringen, hvis det er en avlytting for?

Executive order må være støttet av eksplisitt handlinger. Det inkluderer en aktiv personvern og borgerrettigheter Board, en permanent DHS offiser for sivile rettigheter og borgerrettigheter.

Som for Kongressen er opprørt med ordren, som har mer å gjøre med pique enn innhold. I år har den lovgivende organ dilly-dallyed på cybersecurity. Nå har presidenten tilegnes dem. Det er ikke en god grunn til å motsette seg rekkefølgen-- men det er en god grunn for Kongressen å komme bak cybersecurity. Støtte NIST i sin innsats (finansiere programmet!), få eksplisitt forpliktelser fra administrasjonen på sivile frihet beskyttelse, insisterer på årlige rapportering på samme, gjennomføre overvåking for å sikre rammens hensikt er egentlig fulgte. Som tilsyn fungerer er viktig - og Kongressen bør gjøre det.

Denne executive order treff til høyre peker. Det setter ansvar for cybersecurity framework i Department of Commerce, som kan arbeide med privat næringsliv, det fokuserer på bransjespesifikke løsninger, lover det betimelig anmeldelser av cybersecurity rammen, det setter risiko og kostnader effektiviteten først å bestemme beskyttelse. Styrke federal anskaffelser og sivile friheter aspekter, og vi har en arbeider cybersecurity planlegger her.

Det er på tide.

personalfinance,Early payments value question for fixed-payments car loan (BR),"Hi all! Here in Brazil, car loans are fixed-payment loans (French Amortization System, or PRICE System). If you want to amortize a given value off your debt, you are generally given the option to pay the last unpaid payment before the due date.

For example: I take a $ 10,000.00 loan at 3% per month interest rate to pay in three payments. That will be three payments of $ 3,235.30. If I want to reduce the amount of total interest I will pay, I can pay the 3rd payment together with the first. This way, I call the bank and they give me a new value and invoice.

According to what I was taught, in this case, the early third payment value would correspond to the Principal Value (PV) of the loan by the regular due time of that payment. Also, according to anecdotal reports, the remaining payments' value is not affected (*).

Here's my question: if I made a payment (the third) ahead of the amortization schedule, by the time the second payment is due my PV is less than that of the original amortization schedule, so the interest rate incurs upon less money so the payment should be smaller. Which contradicts statement (*).

Assuming the statement (*) is true (it could be wrong, or vary by bank, but let's assume it's right), one of the following statements must be true:

1) The early third payment value is calculated as stated, and I'm paying interest over money I don't owe.
2) The early third payment value is NOT calculated as stated, being actually less than the PV at its due date, so as to make the value of the second payment be correct.
3) I'm missing something.

What is happening?

**My Story:**

I am 27 and my fiance is 24.  We both have been working for a couple years. I make $70k and she makes $22k. In that time I have used my money to pay of my Credit Cards from College (about $10,000 I racked up from being depressed and reckless). 

 I am now free of Credit Card Debt.  I put in 5% of my income into my 401(k) which my employer matches and currently my rate of return has been 9% yearly. I now only have Student loan debt at about $47k, hers is at $12k. Combined we have $7k in savings (her 5 me 2). 

My fiance and I are still planning a wedding, that we will have to pay for.  We are also planning to go to grad school, she plans on veterinary school, and I plan on an mba if I get into a top 20 (If not I will wait and possibly get a MS later).  This is about a year or two away.  

Expected income, combined in 5 years, conservatively, would be between $130-$200.  I am at a point now where I am unsure of where I should put my monetary efforts.  


**Questions:**

1. Should I add more % to 401(k), open a Roth, increase savings, or attack student loans?

2.  Will getting married affect her federal aid for vet school, should we wait until after she starts (will there be better financial aid not being married)?

3.  Should there be a pre-nup to split educational loans?

4. Should wait to we're officially married to have a joint checking?

5.  How much to spend on wedding?

3.  Are my expenses to much?

4.  Should I wait to get my undergrad loans paid off before grad school?

5.  When to start saving for a house?

6.  Anything I am completely not thinking about?

I have been working on paying down debt for a while now and had some things drain my emergency fund once my daughter was born.  She is 11 months old now and I have accrued a bit of small debt and wanted a little advice on how to use this refund I just got.

* Bill me later - $262 (0% until 3/2013)

* Lowes card - $275 (0% until 6/2014)

* Tmobile phone installment plan - 330 (0% just adds 30/month to my phone bill)

* Discover - $2290 (0% until 9/2013)

* Capitol One - 3380 (22.99% $39 annual fee)

* Car - $17,400 (4.1% 54 months left) 

* Emergency fund - $300



I know I need put 700 into my emergency fund and I need to pay down the bill me later card now, or else I will owed 6 months of interest at 14.99%.  My questions is how do I disperse the rest?  In Dave ramsey fashion I want to knock out the next 2 on my list which will free up about $55/month but after coming across PF about 2 months ago I feel I may be doing myself a disservice considering my highest card balance is sitting on a high interest card.

The paydown plan as it sits now is fund my emergency fund back to 1k, pay off the first 3 on the list, then drop the remainder onto my discover card.  I recently picked up a 2nd job which will make me about 300/month take home which will give almost 700/month (operating on a zero balance budget) to throw at my CC debt.  That will take me 8 months if everything goes to plan to pay it down to zero.  Should I consider chopping down my high interest card first considering either way I will be paying down everything prior to my 0% intro periods expiring?

* Part 2 (what do I do after my CC debt is gone)

As a secondary question, after credit card should I start working on paying down my car in snowball fashion?  The reason I ask this is that I only just started investing into my TSP at 3% (Gov 401k) and I am 30.  I know that's not good but I want to eliminate bad debt first, then bump it up to the full 5%.  

If I start paying down my car, I would be throwing 850/month extra.  I was thinking that instead of throwing it all at the car that I should maybe start a Roth IRA and fully fund that every year and only throw an extra $300-$400 at the car.  What does PF think of these plans?

* **Edit** Interest rate on cap one was not 24.99, its 22.99, still high but just wanted to be accurate.
* **Edit 2** Captial One card also has a 39 dollar annual fee

personalfinance,an idea for paying off a large amount of student debt...,"Reddit! I think I have come up with a great way to repay my student debt! I have about 65k in federal student loan debt from law school (no private loans). I make around 48k a year (shitty, I know...DO NOT GO TO LAW SCHOOL). I decided that I should be in the income-based repayment plan because I do not make much money and I do not want to commit myself to huge payments because who knows what the future holds! Under this plan, your payments are capped at 15% of your income. Any loans remaining after 25 years are forgiven. Also, the government pays all interest that accrues on subsidized loans for the first 3 years. The biggest problem with the income-based plan is that the amount of money you can put towards your student debt is capped at 15% of your income. In the standard repayment plan, on the other hand, you can put as much as you want towards your student debt. I want the best of both worlds, and I think I can do it... 

step 1. Remain in the income-based plan and make the payments that I am allowed (this will cover interest and a little more). 

step 2. The plan needs to be renewed each year. When I get my renewal notice, elect to go back to the standard plan instead and make one large, lump payment (ie, all of the money that I was going to put towards the student loan throughout the year). 

step 3: After I make the large payment, send in my w-2 and get back on the income-based plan and still get the benefits. I spoke with my student loan provider (nelnet) and they said that this is possible. I wouldn't end up being in the standard plan for more than a few days. Also, with my makeshift ""plan,""  I will not have to restart the 25 year forgiveness clock even though I am out of the income based plan for a small period of time. 

step 4: Reap benefits.  

A few things that I want advice on:

1. Does this seem like a good idea? What are potential pitfalls that I am overlooking?

2. If I do go forward with this ""plan,"" what the hell should I do with the money that I would be putting towards student loans - the money that I will use for my large lump payment? Right now, I have an interest-bearing savings account, but the interest is very small. Should I invest it in something like a mutual fund or an ETF? Maybe a short-term bond? Any ideas here?

investing,Does Buffett's purchase signal inflation ahead?,"Buffett used a levered buyout to acquire HNZ. This is highly irregular for him for two reason. First he still has plenty of cash on hand, he could have used more to have less debt. The other reason is he is typically [highly critical of acquisitions with levered buyouts.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2012/01/14/why-warren-buffett-loathes-the-private-equity-crowd/)

Also consider that normally when a company gets bought, its CDS usually decrease in price. [This time it increased.](http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20130214-717887.html) It increased because, [as currently proposed, the buyout will leave the food manufacturer with a debt load about six times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the most common measure of leverage, according to people familiar with the deal.](http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2013/02/14/berkshire-stomachs-leverage-for-heinz-buy/?mod=yahoo_hs)

The way I see it, Buffett is expecting inflation. In order to protect himself, he is investing in a company that will always do well, and in the event of high inflation, loans now are basically free money in the future. I also like to think about it this way - If Buffett expected deflation, as the Fed fearmongers about, then a loan would be a horrible choice.

Baltimore County politiedetective David Donnelly vergeleken het Internet met een zwart gat: expansieve en nooit eindigende.

Als zodanig, probeert op te lossen van Internet-gerelateerde misdaden — variërend van het stelen van persoonlijke gegevens aan cyberpesten — moeilijk kan zijn te dichtbij onmogelijk. Zelfs de gevallen die de politie kan oplossen vertegenwoordigen slechts een klein deel van de misdaden die zich op een dagelijkse basis voordoen.

""Mensen die Internet-gerelateerde misdaden begaan zijn erg ongrijpbaar,"" zei Donnelly, die werkt voor de county politie financiële/cyber-crime unit. ""Ze kunnen werken van overal in de wereld en kunnen zo snel als ze verschijnen verdwijnen.""

Beveiligen van privacy van Internet en de bestrijding van cyber-misdaden is een belangrijke initiatief van Maryland procureur-generaal Douglas F. Gansler. Als onderdeel van dat initiatief, Gansler onlangs aangekondigd de vorming van zijn kantoor nieuwe Internet Privacy eenheid.

De eenheid zal toezicht houden op ondernemingen om ervoor te zorgen dat zij in overeenstemming met staat en federale consumentenbeschermingswetgeving, met inbegrip van de Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, die in de meeste gevallen bedrijven beperkt van het verzamelen van persoonlijke gegevens van kinderen jonger dan 13 jaar.

Bovendien, zal de eenheid werkt samen met bedrijven om te onderzoeken hun privacybeleid en onderwijs en outreach aan hen en aan consumenten om hen online privacy uitdagingen te helpen.

""De technologie vandaag is lichtjaren vooruit van de wet in veel gevallen als het gaat om privacy van Internet,"" zei Gansler. ""Mijn doel met deze eenheid is om te controleren of degenen die gebruik maken van het Internet veilig tegen alle soorten roofdieren zijn, en zijn wij in staat om te beantwoorden aan de bekommernissen beleid als incidenten zich voordoen.""

Op de stijging
Incidenten met online misdrijven zijn geworden meer en meer overwegend in Maryland, zei Gansler.

Maryland gerangschikt zevende op nationaal niveau in 2011 in gerapporteerde Internet misdaden op een per capita basis of 109 incidenten per 100.000 mensen, volgens de FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center. Dit leidde tot 8 miljoen dollar verliezen aan Marylanders dat jaar, volgens het rapport van de FBI.

Donnelly zei dat veel van deze Internet oplichting betrekking hebben op personen gevestigd in Oost-Europa of Afrikaanse landen preying op senioren en andere kwetsbare personen die niet over een goed begrip van technologie. In sommige gevallen, de politie kan werken met banken om te waarschuwen van slachtoffers van een mogelijke zwendel, maar in veel gevallen is het te laat.

Hij noemde een recent voorbeeld van senioren bedrading geld overzee na wordt verteld dat hun kleinkinderen werden gearresteerd. De slachtoffers voldaan snel zonder eerst dubbele controle van de verblijfplaats van hun familieleden.

""In veel van deze gevallen, is de relatieve echt overzee, maar het slachtoffer maakt niet zelfs een snelle oproep om te bevestigen hun relatieve verblijfplaats,"" zei Donnelly.

Online privacy advocates hebben app-geprezen onderweg door Gansler, zelfs als zij toegeven dat de aanpak van de kwestie van online misdrijven is een zware strijd. Barbi Hyman, CHANA: Counseling, zei hulplijn &amp; steun netwerk voor vrouwen misbruikt curriculum jeugdcoördinator, het uitgebreide gebruik van smartphones, tabletten en laptops heeft het steeds gemakkelijker om een bullebak cyber gemaakt.

Volgens DoSomething.org, hebben bijna 43 procent van de kinderen al gepest online. Bovendien, meer dan 80 procent van de tieners gebruiken een mobiele telefoon regelmatig, waardoor het de meest voorkomende medium voor cyberpesten. Bovendien, 81 procent van de jonge mensen geloven dat het is gemakkelijker om weg te komen met cyber pesten dat pesten iemand in persoon.

""Het gebruikt te zijn dat misbruik begon op 9 in de ochtend en op 3 in de middag eindigde,"" zei Hyman. ""Iemand zou u spullen in de locker, maar op 3 u zou worden verhuurd en naar huis kan gaan en veilig. Dat is niet meer het geval. Op alle momenten van de dag bent u totaal kwetsbaar voor alle soorten berichten. In 2013 is een mobiele telefoon de belangrijkste locatie voor negatieve berichten. ""

CHANA adjunct-directeur Naomi Taffet zei dat outreach in de afgelopen jaren is gegaan een lange weg naar het verminderen van de incidenten van minderjarigen en jonge volwassenen het geven van persoonlijke informatie online.

Op dezelfde tijd, de incidenten van cyberpesten en cyber stalking tegen slachtoffers die de dader weten geworden vaker, Taffet zei, toevoegend dat één op de zes vrouwen en één in 19 mannen in hun leven zal worden gestalkt.

""Als het gaat om cyberpesten, het kan worden moeilijk omdat in veel gevallen we omgaan met voormalige partners of vrienden die uw sofi-nummer weten, geboortedatum, waar je ging naar school, uw werk plannen, enz.,"" zei Taffet. ""Dit was iemand die je hield en u bent dan gevangen off guard omdat u niet denken dat ze zou uw eigen informatie tegen je gebruiken.""

Moeilijk te bewijzen
Waardoor zaken moeilijker is dubbelzinnig wetten als het gaat om bewijzen cyber stalking en pesten, CHANA juridische advocaat Cynthia Ohana zei.

""Er zijn gevallen waarin iemand contact op met een slachtoffer familie, vriend of kennis via Facebook en probeert te krijgen [hem of haar] te laten vallen van een lading in een dreigende geval,"" zei Ohana.

personalfinance,Sort of buying Parents a house and my credit score,"Ok so I am married and live in a major metropolitan area. Wife and I rent an apartment. I work in technology and make good (not great money, startup). 

My parents have been living with my brother for several years and he is at wits end and they need to find a place. Rent where they are is too high and they don't intend to move so it would make sense ( I think) to buy something. Issue being my father became disabled about 10 years ago and that lead to a lot of financial troubles including a bankruptcy. so their credit is not good at all. 

The plan then would be for me to basically buy a house and they can pay me the mortgage/taxes. So first off, am I crazy? (go ahead, be honest).

Also, my credit score isn't amazing right now (630). Unfortunately I had a co-signed card with them years ago when they had their financial trouble and since then I've been living mostly credit free. Got my first credit card since the issues last March. It's only got like a 400 dollar limit. I always pay it in full every month (except December where I was late due to forgetting over the holidays). I recently discovered I should not be using any where near my full limit so I've stopped putting much on it but damage done on that I guess.

Anyway, I dunno. I don't worry to much about these things normally so I'm a ""finance noob"". Any and all advice is welcome. If I'm going to do the house thing I'd like to get my score up a bit so I can get a better interest rate. Thanks.",finance,1361040904
worldpolitics,the absurdity of conspiracy theories,"Why do people believe in conspiracy theories?  Scientific American recently summarized studies indicating that conspiracy theorists fail to think with logical consistency, instead tending to hold contradictory ideas simultaneously.  Some psychologists have gone further, suggesting conspiracy theorists are paranoid, schizophrenic, etc.

My intention here is to outline the general pattern of a conspiracy theory, give an illustrative example, and expose the common fallacies involved.  I think we can agree that a conspiracy theory has three common characteristics:  (1) *Multiple people in positions of power collaborating with an intent to deceive.*  Often the paranoids imagine these players to be so highly placed, up to and including the US President, the UK Prime Minister, etc., it is ludicrous.  The machinations of these nefarious leaders frequently involve the wholesale slaughter of thousands of innocent human lives.  As wikipedia summarizes, a ""conspiracy theory"" is ""a secret plot by exceptionally powerful and cunning conspirators to achieve a malevolent end"".  (2)  *Many confederates who are complicit with the conspiracy, or at least play the role of useful idiots.*  Often the sheer number of these players, typically in the government and the mass media, is implausible to the extreme.  It is of course not in human nature to simply go along with leaders without question or morality.
(3)  *A populace evidently too dense to see through any of the above.*

By way of example, it is roughly the tenth anniversary of a conspiracy theory that, I am dismayed to report, still has many adherents.   I am referring to the theory that a cabal within the US government misled its own citizenry and the rest of the world in regards to the threat posed by Iraq, particularly Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, for the purpose of instigating an unjust war.  It is not hard to see how this paranoid fantasy fits the pattern outlined above.

Regarding the intent to deceive, as a general rule we should always first consider Hanlon's Razor: never attribute to malice that which one might conceivably attempt to explain with stupidity.  This is of course not a mere suggestion, but an actual axiom of life.  However, it does not apply in our particular case, for not only is malice out of the question, of course, but stupidity can also be ruled out.

The decision to go to war is, after all, the most important decision a nation can make.  In order to double check its justification for war, the Bush administration formed the Office of Special Plans, the sincerity of which is now legendary.  They also consulted Iraqi informants who were, already at that time, well-known for their truthfulness -- internationally renowned, in fact -- men such as Ahmed Chalabi and Khidir Hamza.  Do not impugn these men of integrity!

And the Bush administration also consulted with the CIA, to make sure they were on the right track.  Now the conspiracy theorists have alleged that, rather than being consulted, the CIA was instead being pressured to come to a foregone conclusion.  But if that were truly the case, then why didn't CIA analysts leak complaints about this state of affairs to the press on, say, March 23, 2003?

The Bush administration then helpfully passed on their valuable intelligence to UN weapons inspector Hans Blix.  Now, again, if they didn't have valid intelligence to offer on Iraqi WMD, but instead were merely pressuring Blix to follow their agenda, why didn't Blix ever complain about this situation?  

The tinfoil hat crowd goes even further, and alleges that the key piece of evidence the US had for Iraq's nuclear weapon program was in fact fake.  That was the contention of former diplomat Joseph Wilson, after looking into the matter.  But of course we know Wilson was motivated purely by partisan politics.  If the evidence that Iraq procured weapons-grade uranium from Niger was really so questionable, the CIA would have warned Bush prior to his State of the Union Address referencing this evidence on January 28, 2003.  Given this hypothesized warning, then, the implication is that Bush lied -- an unprecedented act of any sitting US president of course.  The gall of these truthers knows no bounds. 

If the Niger document was really a forgery, it would have been publicly exposed as such by the International Atomic Energy Agency, with a report to that effect made accessible on www.un.org by, say, March 7, 2003.  And of course, if that had actually happened, the press would have a field day, and the US government would have immediately halted its buildup to war to investigate and re-assess its evidence.  From the fact that this did not occur, we can of course infer that the document must be authentic.  But conspiracy theorists are not logical like you or me.

The conspiracy theorists instead maintain that the US government and the press  largely ignored the ""fact"" that the Niger document was a forgery.  But think of the sheer number of people who would have to go along with this!  It's preposterous of course.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.  If Iraq really had no WMD capability, this would have been known by the former chief UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter, who operated on the ground in Iraq through the late 1990's.  Why, then, didn't Ritter alert the media and demand an audience with senators?  Or perhaps he did, but was marginalized?  You see, paranoids can always come up with rationalizations to maintain their delusions.

Even worse, the mainstream news media is accused by the paranoids not just of selective reporting, but of actively reporting misleading stories on Iraqi WMD.  But surely if the disconnect between the press and reality became so obviously extreme, papers like the New York Times and the Washington Post would eventually be forced to issue public apologies just to maintain some appearance of journalistic integrity?  

Finally, for such a hypothetical conspiracy to be successful, the average citizen would have to be too dumb to catch on (for at least long enough to support the war effort).  Now, in the alternate reality of the conspiracy theorist, former weapons inspector Scott Ritter tried to inform the public of the absence of WMD in Iraq, not to mention that the IAEA publicly exposed the evidence for Iraq's nuclear weapons program as fraudulent, and meanwhile no tangible evidence for Iraqi WMD was found.  Yet, according to national polls conducted by Gallup, Pew, and other organizations just before and well after the war began, the majority of the US population believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.  (Similarly, a majority of the astute American population believed that Iraq had ties to the 9/11 attacks, and that war with Iraq was justified.)  Why, that would  imply that the majority of Americans do not exercise critical thinking!  It's a dark and twisted world inhabited by the conspiracy theorist.  I wouldn't want to live there.  Would you?  (Conspiracy nuts, on the other hand, are mainly motivated by the satisfaction of believing themselves to be smarter than others, according to expert Michael Barkun, Ph.D.)

tl;dr:  Men do not conspire behind closed doors.  Weapons of mass destruction will be found in Iraq.  To believe otherwise is madness.",energy,1361040769

politics,"Before you grab your pitchfork and torch and join Elizabeth Warren's crusade, just take a second to inform yourself.","So I have been seeing a lot of Redditors lately that seem to have really strong opinions about the financial crisis and the parties involved without a lot of supporting facts (see responses to the Elizabeth Warren video). As a lawyer in the financial industry, I am in a pretty unique position to actually understand the financial crisis from a macro perspective. I haven't seen anyone else do this, so I want to try to explain to Reddit in the simplest way I can how the financial crisis worked. In doing so, I am not attempting to describe the particular facts about what was the exact trigger for the events, just the events themselves. To use a metaphor, I am describing how an accumulation of snow can cause an avalanche and what an avalanche actually is, not how a particular skier started one. When reading this, you should really try to understand each paragraph before moving on to the next, whether that means consulting outside sources or not. Ready? Ok.

First, we must know how banks raise money aka capital. You are familiar and most likely comfortable with how your local retail bank raises capital. They take a customer's money, which we call a deposit, in exchange for providing interest payments on the balance and various services, such as checking. The bank then lends that money long, meaning the maturity date of the loan is farther in the future than the expected withdrawal of the deposit. On these loans, the bank charges an interest rate higher than they are offering on customer's deposits. The difference between these two interest rates is called the interest rate spread. This is how a commercial bank makes money.

Staying with your retail bank for the moment, obviously the bank does not keep all of the money on hand or it would have none available to make loans. Instead, the bank will keep a fraction of the deposits in order to meet depositor demands and lend out the rest. This is called ""fractional reserve banking"" and it has been done since the Sumarians. The problem, of course, is that if enough depositors demand their money at the same time, the bank may not have enough money to fulfill all those demands, and the bank will default. Worse yet, if depositors even think that the bank may not be able to meet their withdrawal demands, then they ""run"" to the bank to make get in line to make a withdrawal in order to give themselves priority. This has the additional effect of making other depositors believe the same about the bank, thus creating a self-perpetuating cycle you we call a ""bank run"". Now is a great time to take a break and go watch the last 20 minutes of Mary Poppins.

Now runs on retail banks still happen occasionally, but they are very infrequent. The reason is that ever since the great depression, depositors of certain participating banks have their deposits insured by the full faith and credit of the United States through the FDIC's insurance program (the current amount of the insurance is $250,000, well above what most depositors hold in cash). To participate in the program, Banks must pay an insurance premium to the FDIC and meet certain reserve requirements (i.e. maintain a predetermined ratio of how much cash they must have on hand to how much they lend). So even if the bank defaults, the Federal government will step in and make depositors whole (typically, insurance premiums are enough to cover FDIC claims, but those historical norms have been tested recently). This is why you and most people you know did not run to the bank when you saw the financial crisis unfolding. You knew that even if your bank failed, the Federal government had already made the promise to pay you.

So lets take a step back and explain a critical difference. A commercial bank operates in the way I just described above. An investment bank does not. Think of an investment bank as doing everything that a commercial bank does (i.e. making loans) but without taking deposits. The investment bank needs other sources of funds besides retail depositors. Keep this in mind as I explain the rest of the story.

So we have a bank that has made a loan, lets say a mortgage (fun fact: the lender is the one who receives the mortgage, not the borrower, thus it is incorrect to say ""I got a mortgage""). At one time, the bank may just hold onto that mortgage until maturity. However, over time this dynamic changed. Instead, a bank will write a mortgage and then immediately sell the mortgage to a third party. The third party will pay the bank the market rate for the mortgage plus a fee for finding the borrower and writing the mortgage. Thus, the bank's profit in this situation does not come from the payments of interest and principal on the mortgage, but instead from the fee the third party pays for originating the loan.

Most of the third parties who buy loans from banks are large, sophisticated investors (think pensions funds, college endowments, hedge funds, other banks, etc.). It simply is not worth the time for these institutions to buy individual mortgages. Instead, the financial industry created the practice called ""securitization"". Effectively, the loans are sold to a special purpose entity (like a trust or an LLC) which is established for the sole purpose of keeping these loans on its balance sheet. There could be thousands of loans placed in one of these entities. The entity then issues securities which promise to pay the same amount as the underlying loans it is holding. In the world of mortgage lending, such securities are called ""mortgage backed securities"" or ""MBS"". The practice of securitization is done to all sorts of loans, such as student loans, car loans, credit card debt, etc. It benefits lenders because it brings in large investors to effectively underwrite the loans, thus allowing the banks to make more loans at lower interest rates.

So getting back to the difference between a commercial bank and an investment bank. Both of these institutions will securitize loans. In many cases, the bank keeps some of the MBS for itself for the purpose of what I am just about to describe. Remember, because an investment bank can not take deposits, they must find another source of funds. To do this, the investment bank will borrow the money from another institution. This is an overgeneralization, but such borrowing is called a ""repurchase"" trade, or ""Repo"" trade. In a repo trade, an institution with extra cash, such as a large corporation, mutual fund, pension fund, hedge fund, etc. will give the investment bank cash in exchange for one of the bank's securities, like an MBS. At the same time, the bank and the institution enter into an agreement that the bank will repurchase the security at a slightly higher price at some time in the near future, usually overnight. The difference between the amount the bank sold the security at and what the bank agrees to repurchase the security at is effectively the interest rate the lender is charging the bank. Most of the time, the bank and the institution ""roll over"" their Repo trade, meaning that the lender agrees to hold the security for another day in exchange for another interest payment.

To understand the financial crisis, it is critical to understand the Repo market. The lenders giving cash to banks act in the same way as retail depositors: they give their money to the banks in exchange for payments of interest, and the bank then makes loans at a higher interest rate. The major difference between a Repo trade and a retail deposit is that the bank does not give you a security when you give it a deposit. Why? Because you do not need the security to protect your deposit, because it is federally insured. The lender in a Repo transaction, however, needs to hold the security in order to protect its cash investment. If the investment banks defaults, (i.e. the lender wants the bank the repurchase the security but the bank is unable to do so) then the lender can go to the market and sell the security an recover some or all of the loan. It is in a sense a private form of deposit insurance.

So with this dynamic in place, the financial crisis set in. A significant percentage of the Repo market was for MBS. Because interest rates were rising and economic conditions were deteriorating, the underlying mortgages backing the MBS began to experience a default rate higher than the historical average. As a result, the market price of MBS began to decline as investors sensed they had become risker. For the parties involved in Repo trades, this was problematic. The lenders, sensing that MBS were not worth as much, began to demand more securities in exchange for their cash. Historically, a Repo trade would be executed for $100 with repurchase at less than $101. But because MBS were considered riskier now, lenders demanded more. So now for a $100 of cash, an investment bank may have to give the lender as much as $150 worth of MBS (the difference between the cash and the repurchase amount is called a ""haircut"") This was hugely problematic for the banks, because they needed the cash from these lenders in order to fund their day to day operations and meet short term obligations. The banks did not have enough MBS on their books to be able raise enough capital in order to fund operations. Worse yet, as the risk of not being able to meet its short term obligations increased, the banks lenders in Repo trades became less willing to rollover the Repo trades to the next day, and if they did it would require an even greater haircut. This situation is akin to a bank run in the commercial banking world, the lenders fear of not being able to get their money back causes them to want to stop doing business with the bank. (remember, no FDIC insurance here).


In order to finance themselves given the run on the Repo market, the banks had only one option: to sell assets. The banks began to sell everything: stocks, bonds, MBS and other securitized loans, derivatives, anything. And because they were all doing this at the same time, prices for these assets were in free fall. This is why the stock of a company that has nothing to do with the financial industry, lets say Apple, went into free fall. There was nothing wrong with Apple itself, but there was a huge demand for short-term cash, so everyone needed to sell immediately. This is what most people call a fire sale. So even though the only security that was seriously flawed were the MBS, the resulting fire sale caused the price of almost all widely traded securities to plummet.
So banks like Lehman Brothers had a terrible problem. First, their Repo lenders had lost faith in the assets they were offering in the Repo trades. Second, they could not make up the difference by selling other assets because there was a world wide fire sale occurring. Eventually, the process played itself out, and banks like Lehman Brothers could not meet their day-to-day obligations. Lehman had no choice but to declare bankruptcy.

So that is the broad strokes of the financial crisis. I left out some aspects of it, such as the role of Credit Default Swaps and what happened in the money market mutual fund market, but in my opinion these were not the fundamental drivers of the crisis. The crisis itself was a run on the Repo markets, which in turn caused a number of other market events. I also did not go into any detail about the bail-out, which I think would require its own separate post someday. Hopefully this helps some non-financial types in understanding our banking system. There are lots of important policy decisions being made right now, and it is important to understand the system before we attempt to regulate it. I would be happy to field any questions Redditors have.",finance,1361029473
personalfinance,Advice on whether or not to consolidate my private student loans. Please and Thank you.,"I'd appreciate advice on whether or not to consolidate my private student loans.

I currently have loans from 3 different lenders at 3 different interest rates.
~26000 @ 7.25%
~20000 @ 6.75%
~42000 @ 7.96%

These interest rates are variable however I can't recall what they're tied to.  I will try and find my promissory notes to verify. I've never had them jump up or down more than .05% though...

I've been attempting to transfer all of my money to a local credit union and such, and have applied for and been approved for a consolidation loan at my credit union.

The terms of the new deal: 6.75% + 3-Month Libor which is currently at .33% for a total of 7.08%.

I'm a little nervous with this rate though.  While the 3-month libor is currently very low, if it were to jump up even a little bit, it appears as though I'd be getting screwed big time.

Here is a chart of historical libor data.  
http://mortgage-x.com/general/indexes/historical_wsj_libor.asp 
I do not know what factors go into play in regards to this rate varying and the fact that there was the global libor scandal just recently is a pretty big turn off to me as well.

The loan would be for 15-years with payments near identical to what I'm paying now.  My goal however is to start paying double if not more every month in which I can then pay off my loans in 5 years.

Any advice is appreciated!",finance,1361026666

personalfinance,Agressive vs Income Based Payment w/ loan forgiveness option,"I have about 60k in federal student loans at 6.8% interest.  I graduated from grad school in may 2012.  I am paying right now on a standard 10 year repayment plan and putting any extra money I have towards it to pay it down as quickly as possible. I am currently living in NYC and the monthly payment is making a bigger impact on my day-to-day budget than I had anticipated.  I am getting married this summer and am feeling pretty strapped for cash.

Another option I have is to do an income based repayment plan -- the interest rate would not change (remains 6.8%) but the time to repay would got to between 25 and 30 years.  Obviously, this would increase the total amount I pay back in the end. HOWEVER -- right now, I work in health care at non-profit, so I qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF) --- If I make 120 payments (10 years), then the remaining balance of my loans would be forgiven, IF I STAY IN A NON-PROFIT for 10 years.  While it is possible that I will do this, I am not 100% sure.

If I stuck with plan A, I would pay my loans off in ten years.  If I did the income based repayment and qualified for PSLF,  I would end up paying less overall and less per month now.  However there is always the risk that I end up getting stuck with the extra interest accrued over time if I do not end up staying in non-profit for 10 years.

Zelfs de gevallen die de politie kan oplossen vertegenwoordigen slechts een klein deel van de misdaden die zich op een dagelijkse basis voordoen. 

""Mensen die Internet-gerelateerde misdaden begaan zijn erg ongrijpbaar,"" zei Donnelly, die werkt voor de county politie financiële/cyber-crime unit. ""Ze kunnen werken van overal in de wereld en kunnen zo snel als ze verschijnen verdwijnen."" 

Beveiligen van privacy van Internet en de bestrijding van cyber-misdaden is een belangrijke initiatief van Maryland procureur-generaal Douglas F. Gansler. Als onderdeel van dat initiatief, Gansler onlangs aangekondigd de vorming van zijn kantoor nieuwe Internet Privacy eenheid. 

De eenheid zal toezicht houden op ondernemingen om ervoor te zorgen dat zij in overeenstemming met staat en federale consumentenbeschermingswetgeving, met inbegrip van de Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, die in de meeste gevallen bedrijven beperkt van het verzamelen van persoonlijke gegevens van kinderen jonger dan 13 jaar. 

Bovendien, zal de eenheid werkt samen met bedrijven om te onderzoeken hun privacybeleid en onderwijs en outreach aan hen en aan consumenten om hen online privacy uitdagingen te helpen. 

""De technologie vandaag is lichtjaren vooruit van de wet in veel gevallen als het gaat om privacy van Internet,"" zei Gansler.

It gives an automated phone number, postal address, and a web address--www.equifax.com/fcra 

However, this site did not work for me, perhaps because my credit was approved, not denied.

I'm the first in my family to have a decent paying career so a lot of this is very very new to me. I am turning to you for advice and tips on removing my student loans and growing my wealth. I just graduated from school and started this job in September. I have put in about $5,000 since then into my Direct Loan and the grace period just recently ended (sadness). I will outline my details as best I can. If you need more information, please let me know and I will provide it.

**Current Funds:**
BOA Checking: $400
BOA Savings: $400

**Income:**
Salary: 60,000

After taxes/benefits: $3,000 per month (I get paid $1,5000 bi-weekly)

**Monthly payments:**
Rent + Utilities: $670 

Cell Phone (helping my family with the family plan until May): $200

After May, I will branch off from the family plan because I can't afford to keep paying for the entire family and start my own single line.

I charge my daily expenses to my BOA Cash Rewards Credit Card (I figure every little bit helps).
I would say my maximum personal expenses break down into this:

Food : $140 per week =&gt; $560 per month

Gas/Travel: $45 per week =&gt; $180 per month

Dates/Entertainment/Clothes/etc.: $25 per week =&gt; $100 per month

So my monthly credit card payment would be: $560 + $180 + 100 = $840

**Total monthly payments: $670 + $200 + $840 = $1,710**

**$3,000 - $1,710 = $1,290 left.**


**These are my student loans as of this moment:**

**Direct Subsidized Loan**
Principal balance: $17,402.29

Interest rate (Average of the 4 loans I got for each year): 4.783%

Repayment (Standard): $ 182.73 per month for 120 months

	Total Payment: $ 21,927.60

**Institutional Loan**

Principal balance: $3,230.00

Interest rate: 0.000%

Repayment: $170.00 Quarterly

My plan is to try to build a 3 month cushion in my savings account and then pushing the rest into my student loans (taking care of the highest interest ones first). I would like to not follow the standard repayment plan and pay it off as soon as possible. As for the institutional loan, I plan to just pay that quarterly since it has no interest. 

**This is what my 401K is so far:**
My company puts in 2% as well as matches up to 4%. Right now I am only putting in 4% to get the maximum match to get a total of 10% each paycheck (bi-weekly). It is with Fidelity. I'm not really sure how it works in detail even after researching, but I just know I have money going into it each paycheck. If I can get some advice for this section that would be awesome. 

I have a couple of questions:

1.How much money should I be putting into my Savings and into my Direct Loan each month? How fast do I need to build up my 3 month cushion? I was thinking of putting in $200 each month for savings and then $1000 for the Direct Loan. Once I have the cushion, can I then push the extra money to pay off my loans? 

2.How do I decide how much my cushion is? I assume it would be my total monthly payment ($1,800.00), but I just wanted clarification.

3.Am I doing OK with my retirement fund? I've researched a bit about IRAs and Roth IRAs. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like I should be opening a Roth IRA account and also try to put in the yearly maximum? Should I wait until my loans are paid off before doing that?

4.If certain emergency purchases come up (car repairs, etc.), should I be pulling money from my Savings account to pay for them or should I also try to increase the money in my Checking account and pay for them using that? If so, I was thinking of putting $200 monthly for Checking, $100 monthly for Savings, $900 for the Direct Loan.

5.I calculated that I should be getting around $1800 back on my tax returns and I was wondering what the best way to spend that money would be? I was thinking of saving around $500 and putting the rest into loans.

personalfinance,"I'm 22 and haven't made the smartest financial decisions in the recent years. My question is, are my mistakes repairable? And if so, how and where do I start? Details inside.","I'll start from the first bad decision. I was 18 and got a credit card. I had planned on being responsible with it and making my payments on time but it didn't work out that way. I maxed it out within a year and didn't make payments. It has been reported to collections. 

My next decision is what really screwed me. My car had broke down on me and I didn't have enough money saved to buy a used car for less than 5k. I went to a hole-in-the-wall car dealer and got royally f'd in my ass. I didn't know a lot about buying cars, interest rates, etc. and didn't have anyone there to help me. I signed a contract for a 2001 Pathfinder with 190k miles on it for sale price of $10995, monthly payments of $340, and an APR of 27%. This is when things really started getting bad for me. With this car payment, I then started having difficulties making rent. I lost my apartment and still owe them $1000 in unpaid fines. I couldn't afford the car anymore, because I realized a little too late that it was a huge scam and by the time I would be done paying the car off I would have paid nearly 25k for it. I had to voluntarily repossess the car (car dealer would not work with me on it) and it is on my credit as well.

I really don't know where to start. As you can tell, I am not knowledgeable about finances and credit and things of the like. I know I made a lot of bad and impulsive decisions, without considering the long term consequences. But I realize now how important credit is and am wanting really badly to start repairing it.

In addition, she is purportedly a Member of the Florida State Bar Association and possess extensive experience in corporate and real estate law.

However, in reality, Ms. Michelle Sides has been kicked out of the Florida Bar for unspecified reasons (rendering her not eligible to practice in Florida). 

She has not been kicked out of the Florida Bar - she is delinquent in her continuted education (CLER) requirements - more info here. She is more focused on running a company than keeping current with her continued education requirements.

Although it is unfortunate that Llamas is involved in the wire fraud case, that is not a securities case. You do have a valid point that Llamas signed as president after stepping down, but I would imagine these documents were already prepared and signed as of 9/17/12 and it was an oversight that Ted Caligiuri needed to sign as President.

personalfinance,Question on credit card balance transfers (from AU if it matters :) ),"Hi /r/personalfinance

Is it always worth doing balance transfers on credit cards?

I currently have a credit card that has $4500 owing on it (with a $5000 limit) and am looking to pay it off completely and go back to only using it for purchases I can fully pay off each statement.

I recently signed up for a 28 degrees mastercard to use as a travel card because it has the lowest fees. I intend to use it on my travels with topped up cash (i.e not use any of the credit limit) and when I return I will probably get rid of it, I do **not** want another credit card to tempt me.

They have given me a $3000 limit on that, with the option to do balance transfers. I think the rate is 4% for 6 months I would have to double check.

I had never thought to use it for balance transfers but now the option is available to me..

The current interest rate on the first CC is about 20%, I am being charged around $100 a month. The normal rate on the second CC is about the same.

I have created a good budget and estimate that I can pay off somewhere between $500-$800 a month. I would hopefully be able to pay off the $4500 in 6-9 months. 

*[I live out of home and pay all my own expenses, the only time my budget is blown is things like unexpected car repairs, unexpected medical expenses etc. I do want to set up an emergency fund but that is a topic for another day]*

The catch then is I would obviously only be able to transfer part of the balance, so I'd have $1500 on one card and $3000 on the other.. Id have no idea which one to pay off first or how to juggle this?

Part of me thinks to just leave it how it is, and its my own fault for getting into this situation. Being charged so much interest IS a motivator to pay it off asap. But I also think I should take advantage of the balance transfer option?

any advice appreciated :)",finance,1361083317

investing,Global Growth in EV Sales Good for Lithium Battery Market,"By Melissa Pistilli - Exclusive to Lithium Investing News

The Obama administration has backed off its goal of putting 1 million electric vehicles (EVs) on the road by 2015, Reuters reported late last month. Yet the federal government has still committed to $7.5 billion in funding for policies that promote electric vehicles, including $2.4 billion in grants to lithium-ion battery makers.

A Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) team working alongside the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory recently received a five-year, $3.7-million grant from the US Department of Energy. The laboratories’ research is focused on improving the performance, lifetime cycle and safety of lithium-ion batteries.

“In transportation in particular, a significant advance in battery performance and lifetime will allow the transition from current gasoline- and diesel-based vehicles to plug-in hybrids and all-electrics with comparable or better power, range and cost,” states the LLNL website. “This, in turn, would greatly reduce the nation’s dependence on fossil fuels and carbon emissions associated with them. An advance in safety will have significant implications for aviation as well, as the grounding of Boeing 787s worldwide due to Li-ion battery fires has made all too clear.”

While North American markets produce the highest amount of revenue from consumer and industrial market-based lithium battery sales, China dominates the automotive sector, according to American research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan. If the US wishes to compete with China in the EV market, it has some serious catching up to do: North America is expected to account for roughly 21 percent of automotive industry demand for lithium batteries in 2016 compared to 40 percent for China, as per Frost &amp; Sullivan.

Lithium batteries to benefit from significant global growth in global EV market

The EV industry has received a lot of unwarranted flak over the years, and the recent string of hiccups plaguing the lithium battery market hasn’t helped. Nor do reports like KPMG’s 2013 Global Automotive Executive Survey, which shows that nine out of 10 auto industry execs believe that fuel efficiency, not environmental friendliness, will continue to be a top priority for car buyers, at least over the next few years.

However, a recent report published by Pike Research indicates that annual worldwide EV sales will reach 3.8 million by 2020. “Sales of EVs have not lived up to automakers’ expectations and politicians’ proclamations, but the market is expanding steadily as fuel prices remain high and consumers increasingly seek alternatives to internal combustion engines,” stated Senior Research Analyst Dave Hurst in a press release. “Indeed, sales of plug-in EVs will grow at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 40 percent over the remainder of the decade, while the overall auto market will expand by only two percent a year.”

Over the next decade, significant growth in the EV market will translate into equally significant growth in the lithium-ion battery market, according to new analysis of Frost &amp; Sullivan’s Global Hybrid Electric and Electric Vehicle Lithium-ion Battery Market research, published earlier this month. The research shows that the automotive segment of the lithium-ion battery market earned revenues of $2.13 billion in 2012, with that amount likely reach $12.84 billion in 2019.

In a recent presentation, Frost &amp; Sullivan researchers stated that they see the total global lithium battery market — including the automotive, consumer and industrial sectors — reaching $22.5 billion in 2016, nearly double what the total market was worth in 2012. While consumer applications (think laptops and cell phones) will continue to account for the highest share of revenues, the fastest growth will be seen in the automotive sector, which the research firm predicts will garner 25 percent of total revenues in 2016, up from 14 percent in 2012.

After paying my rent and utilities (roughly $600/month total) and paying other miscellaneous bills (car ins, credit card, cell phone, netflix, student loans, groceries, gas, etc) I am left with roughly $600-700 extra every month.

For debts, I have two student loans that total 26k.  One loan (5k balance) is a parent plus loan in my fathers name that I am paying off, and the other is a consolidated loan (21k balance).  For the Parent Plus loan the monthly payment is $200.41, and the interest rate on the loan is nearly 9%.  The loan balance was originally 16k when I graduated in 2010, but I have been working towards paying it off.  The consolidated loan (21k) has an interest rate of 5.75% and the monthly payment is $173.  It is on the standard ""graduated"" repayment plan.  Finally, I have 1k in credit card debt, with an interest rate of I believe 9%.  I usually get hit about $10 or so a month in interest charges.

Savings:  I have approximately 11k in a standard savings account.  It earns me about a buck a month in interest. Not very good and I'm hoping to transfer this into something that yields more of a return.  Through my employer I have a TIAA-Cref retirement account which I contribute 5% (max) to, and my employer contributes 9% to it.

I guess my main question is how I should go about tackling my debt?  As it stands, I am on pace to pay off my parent plus loan this summer if I continue making larger payments using the leftover money I have from my paycheck.  I'd be sacrificing putting away extra money into my savings every month to pay off the loan, but I figure I have more than enough put away to keep me afloat in case of any emergency.  I have often thought about taking 5k from my savings and just eliminating the loan but have always been hesitant to dip that much into my savings...is it really worth it or is it just good for satisfaction/piece of mind?  Finally, with the amount of savings I have and my retirement plan, what would be good investment/savings strategy? I know I need to get my money out of the low interest savings account, but what are my best options for it?",finance,1361207773

personalfinance,The most important strategy in Disputing and Improving your credit score.,"*The post below comes from* [here](http://lifehacker.com/5984340/improve-your-credit-score-this-weekend?post=57478970)

*Hopefully it can help you in your credit situation*

The most important strategy in disputing your records is to be ACTIVELY ENGAGED in the process of being in communication and asking for records of the debt. 
If you have defaulted on your primary credit card debt, they have most likely sold off your debt to a third party collection agency that has bought the debt at 5-10 cents of every dollar. They in turn, will contact you and 'make a deal' to settle the debt on 40-50 cents of every dollar and make their profit on that margin - DON'T!

Although many lawyers will tell you otherwise, you are not obligated to pay the debt off as it has ALREADY been written off as a loss by the original lender!

This is one of the biggest scams that corporations have and because many people are under a great deal of stress, they will cave-in rather than push back - however - you can dispute it, but it will take ALLOT of work.

First, get evidence of the debt, by cordially 'agreeing' to work with the collection agency in clearing this up and request that they send you proof that they have incurred a loss from this purchase. Like anyone else claiming that you owe them money, ask for them to show you proof of the debt. They will most likely send you their internal account statement as 'proof'.

Then, write back a second time and ask that they send you actual proof, (accounting and bookkeeping ledgers, and legal agreements or corporate resolutions showing a contractual relationship to the original lender - which all companies are required to pursue in the due diligence of doing business). Ask for these records that show that they TRULY purchased the debt from the original lender.

At this point, they will either refuse (if you are lucky to get their denial in writing), or they will simply ignore your request since most people don't normally push back, and hope that you will not pursue the matter any further.

At this point you will need to write them a third time and state that you have still not received sufficient evidence of a debt and that if they continue to pursue the matter, your stand is that they are committing fraud and that you are contacting your local State Attorney General to notify them of this, (make sure you cc the letter to the SAG).

Now, all of this correspondence needs to be sent via USPS certified mail and it is very important that you get a signature receipt from the person that the correspondence was addressed to. IMPORTANT: you need to address ALL correspondence to the LEGAL AGENT of the corporation you are dealing with! (all of this information is online, but it takes some effort to research).

Make sure you make photocopies of all the correspondence and record all of the tracking numbers and keep all the signature receipts of every letter they received from you!!

If you want an extra weapon in your arsenal, look up what is your state's legal requirement in regards to out-of-state corporations that are looking to collect debts from its residents. Most states require that out of state corps are registered and bonded with the Secretary of State, to do business (collect debts) with local residents. Most of these collection agencies have VERY DUBIOUS registration and business practices!

Your job is to make sure that they are held accountable to proper business practices! Because the way they conduct business is so shady and the amount of people that push-back are so few, they simply continue to pursue dubious scare tactics and harass people in bad economic situations.

After you have attempted to resolve the matter through 'administrative remedy', and the collection agency is not responding, you can then send copies of all of the correspondence to ALL THREE of the credit bureaus as proof that this negative entry in your record is fraudulent and that you are requesting for them to remove it.

Again, they will most likely simply delete the entry rather than investigate it since it takes more time and effort than most people demand - but it is your life and your records matter! I am not suggesting this from a legal perspective nor as an expert - but simply as an individual that has cleared allot of past baggage, by doing my due diligence.

I also worked in tandem by getting my financial situation in order, improve my credit with a secure credit card, then worked up to an excellent relationship with a Federal Credit Union issued credit card with low interest rate, and raised my score in the past 3 years from a low rating of poor to very good (low risk)!

Bottom line is: you cannot get to improve your score if you are passive or fearful of what can happen. You have to take control! Build your savings, clear your records, and maintain a rotating balance no more than 30% of your credit limit and see how quickly your score soars!",finance,1361147622

personalfinance,Is this a viable credit card strategy,"I have a credit card that has a significant balance both on purchases (at 15%) and cash advances (at 21.5%).  This is a result of overdrafts and a couple of cash withdrawals from a long time ago that snowballed due to my poor management.  

Now I'm paying down the card fairly quickly, but after numerous attempts I can't get the company to lower the interest rates at all (despite me just paying off a sizable car loan with them on time with a perfect payment history).  So I'm thinking about, in additional to paying the card down as fast as I can, that I should do the following:

1) Use the card for as many of my routine purchases as possible.  
2) Immediately make a payment to the card in the amount of those purchases

The idea is to help lower the balance being charged 21.5% interest while essentially transferring that debt to the lower interest ""purchase"" rate.  This should work because (at least by my understanding) the law is that all payments above and beyond the minimum monthly payment must be applied to the higher interest rate balances first.  

I just want to make sure there isn't some caveat I'm missing, like a loophole that lets credit card companies avoid this kind of strategy.

TL;DR: Want to make purchases with credit card and immediately pay in order to transfer higher interest ""cash advance"" debt to lower interest ""purchase"" debt on same card.",finance,1361296032

- I didn't file federal taxes last year.
- I didn't file state taxes for the past 2 years.

Clearly this is not good. I think they already put a hold on my drivers license renewal. Basically, I just want to make this right and file all the correct forms, and pay what I owe. But at this point I'm really overwhelmed, and don't know where to start.

Here's my plan: From my google research on the issue, taking care of the federal taxes should be as easy as sending in the old forms through the mail. At this point I assume that will be ok for the MA taxes as well, but I'm not sure.

Does anyone have any tips or advice? I'm not sure that I could handle the raw forms, so I was going to buy some tax prep software.

- Do I have to buy old versions of tax software for the previous years?

- For my state taxes, is it as simple as sending the old forms in?

- Can I file this years taxes before taking care of the old stuff?

personalfinance,Receiving tuition reimbursement from my employer - some questions,"I received my degree in Mechanical Engineering and am pursuing my graduate degree in Aerospace Engineering. My company is paying up to $10,000 in tuition costs.

I understand that after $5,250, all tuition reimbursements will be considered taxable income, but according to publication 15-B, I should be able to write all tuition reimbursements over $5,250 as a business expense because it ""maintains or improves skills needed in the job"" and is not ""needed to meet the minimum educational requirements of the employee's present trade or business, or is [not] part of a program of study that will qualify the employee for a new trade or business.""

My understanding is that even though I am going for Aerospace Engineering, this new degree does not qualify me for a new trade or business because I am still an engineer, not a lawyer or a doctor.

If I can deduct all reimbursements over $5250, I will be able to deduct about $4000 as an itemized deduction.  However, I am fresh out of college with no house, no children, no spouse, and nothing else that I can think of as tax deductible except my property tax that I'll be paying on my car this year (~400) and my student loan interest (~588 because now it's deferred) which still won't get me over the 5950 standard deduction.


Should I make an extra effort to nickle and dime my deductions this coming year, or should I not worry about it and continue what I was doing?

EDIT:  I pay about 3000 in state income tax to SC a year.  I lived in Florida before all of this happened, so I have no experience with state income tax.  Is the 3000 tax deductible from my federal income tax?  If so, this will put me over the standard deduction.

I owe 33k at 5.75%. These are federal loans.

I am 25 and have 750.00 in a rollover 401k and I do not yet have a Roth IRA. 

Current salary yields 2886.00 net per month. I have 797.00 leftover every month after I have already made a 255.00 payment towards my student loans.

Do I pay the 255.00 and my additional 797.00 per month towards my student loans or do I open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum 5500 this year and then use an leftover for the student loans.

economy,Here's a friend of mines take on gas prices going up...comments please,"I realized this morning why gas prices jumped 20 cents practically overnight last week. The fairly steady oil price of $95 tp $97/barrel doesn't support it, so why did it happen? In Febuary! As I drove around middle TN Friday I noticed that every gas station had hiked regular gas to 3.45 or higher -- stations that had sold it for 3.26 the day before. It was clearly a unified action on the part of all gas stations. This isn't normal. Usually there will be hold-outs east or north of town, or in poorer areas, that keep the old price for several days after an oil price rise, but not last week.
 
The reason gas stations all raised the price of gas is this: The Fed no longer has monetary policy (raising interest to slow the economy) as a weapon to control inflation. Interest rates are being kept near zero indefinitely due to the govt owing so much money. So gas prices are the new monetary policy of the govt. Consensus has been building that we are out of danger in the economy, in fact Obama said as much at his State of the Union speech. The stock market has been soaring. With so much hot money having been pumped into Wall St by the Fed, the only way they have to keep inflation at bay, is the price of gas. Also, along with the gas hike, big investors such as Soros sold their gold holdings, taking all the metals down in price on Friday. Normally, gold would go UP with danger of inflation. But there is no talk of inflation. The word on Bloomberg radio was that gold as a safe haven is less attractive and that the 12-year bull market in gold is over. This happened synchronous with the jump in gas prices.
 
If the stock market keeps soaring, you can expect extremely high gas prices this summer. It will not be because the economy is overheating, in fact the recovery is widely regarded as anemic. It will be because the stock market is overheating, and instead of raising interest rates, the govt will have to induce a little recession on Main St to counteract Wall St inflation. This will continue indefinitely. Main St will pay for all (Fed-induced) Wall St inflation, at the pump.
 
It's possible we're lining up for a big stock market correction around March, and if that temporarily takes the gas price down, it might be a good time to store some gas for the summer.",finance,1361281796

investing,Thinking about making some very speculative options purchases...,"Basically I have taken a thousand profit out of one account and am going to start trading options with it. I do not really need the money and I know what I am about to outline will be called gambling here more than investing, but that is okay. There are 4 stocks that I am considering buying OTM options contracts on:

Apple is the shortest term one I would want to buy, a contract for a month out at a strike price of 480+. My thinking on this one is that it hasn't really recovered but it has shown signs that buyers are waiting for good news (example the slight bump it received after Einhorn's action that led many to believe an increased dividend or buyback was coming, or them adopting his plan) to jump in. I think an official announcement of any of the new products rumored to be in development or an increase in the dividend will propel the stock to 500+ very quickly. Id sell when it hit 500 or more.

An obviously risky and volatile stock I am considering buying OTM call options on is Herbalife, in the range of 50+ for about 3 months out. I believe Icahn really might attempt to take it private, or at the least that Ackman made a serious miscalculation here. I was considering a spread also but now I have moved more to Icahn's side after reading up on the company a bit more. I don't think its a pyramid scheme in any illegal sense, although perhaps it is a rip off for most distributors... But the company has a great BBB rating and relatively few complaints, and other companies get away with much worse nowadays, so regulators cracking down hard on this one in this economic climate makes little sense to me.

AIG is another stock I would consider buying OTM call contracts on a year out at a strike of 50. It has been slowly rising and the company is profitable again, beating expectations in their most recent announcement. I think the stock will continue its steady rise and could make a nice run this year if earnings continue to improve.

One of the most speculative plays I'm considering is Altria. There is little volatility now so a big movement could equal huge profit. I would have to buy calls for a year out with this one probably at a strike of 50, just on the possibility that when marijuana is federally legalized they will enter the market. A much larger company than MJNA is  harder to move but seeing the crazy upswings when new legislation passes in states with that stock makes me believe there will be a very large price movement in MO when/if it occurs. 

I think I might go down the line from top to bottom here, starting with Apple, then if that is successful go for Herbalife, then split AIG and Altria. Honestly half the fun of this post was knowing most everyone in r/investing's reaction will be to laugh or tell me I'm going to lose my money, but I like taking some risks with a little bit of capital, and when I get older I won't be able to.

For a more comprehensive retirement spreadsheet, please [**check out this one**](http://calcitout.com/2012/12/forecasting-by-year/) posted by /u/mvnman. He did not make it, but was kind enough to share the link with us. It's incredibly detailed.

_____

*As someone pointed out, the font is kinda big. I didn't realize that I was editing it at 85% zoom, hence why it's so big when you open it at 100%. I would recommend zooming out a bit (use the slider at the bottom right or Ctrl + Scrollwheel Down).*

*Also, don't miss the Car Loan Amortization schedule sheet at the bottom. It's currently only for 60 month loans, but if yours is longer, just highlight the bottom row and stretch it down from the bottom left corner. It'll fill in the formulas for you.*

_____

The state, county, medicare, social security, and federal tax percentages in the upper left are specific to my locale and salary --  I would recommend using one of your pay stubs to get the right federal percentage for your salary. I just didn't want to have to figure out the huge formula for federal withholding.

_____

The **Benefits** section is bi-weekly. Not monthly.
_____

**As it says at the top, ONLY EDIT INFORMATION IN PINK CELLS.** Everything else will calculate for you automagically. (You can actually edit anything on the sheet if you want to...but it's full of formulas, so I wouldn't want you to mess things up for yourself. Just be careful!)

_____

You **can** edit Renter's Insurance, even though it's in the blue section. This amount is *not* split between roommates.
_____

The box for pay bonuses is specific to my particular bonus distribution formula at work. Feel free to customize this to yours if you get an annual bonus. The total gets put into the ""Credits"" table right above it. This is where you'll find the bonus formula.

_____

Feel free to add your own expenses (or delete current rows) to the Expense Type table. I left a bunch of blanks for you guys...the formulas are already linked to the cells, so just edit the Expense Type and Monthly Payment.

_____

The retirement estimates in the center of the spreadsheet are based on a 10% lifetime return. To change this, just edit the ""Estimated Retirement Acct. Return"" percentage.

_____

Keep in mind that this assumes you always contribute the same amount, and you always remain on the same salary. This is obviously not the case, but you can at least see where you’re headed. If we’re lucky (we as in other 20-somethings...I'm 23), we’ll receive about 70% of our SS contributions by the time we retire. This has been taken into account in the **Retirement Estimates** section.

_____

Lastly, Roth IRA and 401k have contribution caps per year. The max you can contribute to your 401k is $17.5k, and the max you can contribute to a Roth IRA is $5.5k. Keep this in mind when you’re playing with the percentages. The row called 401k Contribution is your personal contribution…the row called **401k Contribution + Match** is **Your contribution + Your company's match**. Don’t get these confused. The **New Net Pay** is the money left over after taxes and 401k/Roth/ESPP contributions, but does NOT subtract out for the company match – it doesn’t because it’s free money! WOO!

If you have other IRAs or retirement accounts, just add/edit accordingly. PM me if you need help!

**Loan**                           **Amount**     **Rate**     **Balance**

* US Bank School Loan	         $96,434.14 --	3.25%	-- $781.00 
* VW Loan	                         $18,362.80 --	5.99%	-- $334.97 
* Subaru Chase Loan	         $16,793.00 --	3.99%	-- $300.41 
* Sallie Mae 2	                 $5,129.87 	 --       7.25%	-- $203.56 
* US Dept. Of Education	 $3,095.32  --   	5.60%	-- $50.00 
* Personal loan                     $770.00 	 --       0.00%	-- $185.00 
* Sallie Mae 1	                 $901.25 	--        2.36%	-- $50.00 
* Medical bill               	 $455.32 	--        0.00%	-- $113.83 

Our monthly income is around ~$4,400 and will increase because I just got a new job and raise today (wahoo). Another positive is that we don't have any CC debt. We currently have an emergency fund of $3,000 and I make $1-200 a month extra doing eBay stuff.

Here are our monthly expenses

* Phone -- $120
* Energy -- $120-180 (we're in Wisconsin...)
* Cable / high speed internet -- $85
* Gym -- $45
* Gas -- $120
* Groceries -- $320
* Rent -- $950

Obviously I can cut on internet and cable but I work from home weekly so cutting internet is a no go. In terms of cable, that's my wife's only entertainment really but we can negotiate. We try and stick to a budget but it's our first month on one so we're not doing great. 

My questions for everyone: Should I sell my car (the VW)? I owe $18,362 and it's worth $15,500-16,000 so I am upside down on it. Not sure how I could make that work. Do you have any other debt advice? We're attacking lowest balance loans first based on interest rate. I guess I am just looking for advice and tips.

This is my plan overall with my info and I appreciate any/all comments regarding it. Let me know what you guys think! (Also my GF will be my soon to be fiance although I will refer to her as my GF throughout.)



I'm 24 with a monthly take home pay of 3600 a month for 5 months, 3000 for 3 months, and 2200 for the final 4 months of the year. I work a full time job and another part time teaching job  for 8 months out of the year where the hours are set based on student enrollment. These monthly figures are what an average year will pay. Enrollment is consistently up 5-10% a year.


No student ""loans"" per se but I do have 750 left over from school books on an Amazon rewards card at 18%, 1200 on a store credit card at 0% for the next 16 months and a personal loan for 5.5k at 7.89% that I used to purchase a jetski and motorcycle because I had no idea what personal finance was haha! I have 2k in savings and put 3% (full match) to my 403b at work. 


I am living with my girlfriend of 2 years. We are renting a  nice house very close to where we both work for 1100 a month. The house has it's own private fenced in backyard surrounded by trees with an in ground pool we have to maintain. It is like our own oasis 5 minutes from work. She pays for food (400) and utilities (350). She saves about 200 a month because she is cash flowing prerequisites for nursing school at the moment and has 6k in savings. She has no debt other then $600 on an interest free store card. What I am spending on average right now is :



* 1100   rent
* 170     personal loan
* 170     cell phone
* 170     gas (driving to where I teach)
* 160     entertainment/whatever (this covers our trips to the lake/gas and storage of  jetski in summer months at the lake)
* 120     auto insurance
* 100     Eating out 
* 100     Extra groceries/beer etc
* 50       Pet food
* 50       gym membership
* 60       CC payment
* 50       random costs/pool maintenance

$ 2300 total  


I know this is not optimal at all but I have come a long way in the past couple of years. Going from making $ 8.50/hour to almost triple that now with no idea/care about personal finance. Money is really tight for the 4 months when no teaching money is coming in obviously. The plan right now is as follows:


* Right now is the big pay day months for teaching so I am saving 1-1.3k a month. The plan would be to do this until I get up to around 5k for an emergency fund. 


* Once the emergency fund is set  I'll  just aggressively pay down the Amazon card and store card


* Sell motorcycle come April for $2k at minimum. This is well under for what KBB says I can get for it but I am budgeting for worst case scenario. This would save me about 100 a month on insurance and leave me with $3k left on the personal loan. Very low cost refinance that with the new balance to drop the payments to $65 a month to free up another $100 to help with paying off the rest of the debt I have. We really want to keep the jet ski. I welcome advice on this though. The plan would be to work on paying this one off last.

* Once most of the debt is payed off focus on opening a Roth IRA later this year once the debt is payed and funding it every month.


* Our lease runs out beginning of July and we do not want to re-up. The property mangers have been absolutely horrible (way worse then what I have been used to from renting in the past). I think that now is great time to buy a house with interest rates low and real estate having taken a huge hit around here. I have been pre-approved for a USDA loan at 3.25% for way more money then I want to spend ($240k). 

* Should I be looking at houses right now? We can buy a 2-3 bed 1 bath for so much cheaper then rent around here. We have no plans to leave and both have very stable jobs (healthcare). The contracts are already being talked about for my teaching job for 2014-2015 because the job will be going to year round (hurray more $$$). However, my GF and I plan to take turns going back to school starting in the next two years for our BSN's. There are plenty of local schools around so we will not have to move. The plan would be for me to keep working (not factoring in the 3% raises I am getting every year and have gotten for the past 3 years) while she goes to school for 12 months. Once she is out and has a job as a BSN nurse and can pay the bills I will go back to school for 2 years to get my BSN. Does this sound crazy?

I thought that buying a house now and getting equity in it 4-5 years before I/we would be buying one if we waited to get out of school would secure us a place to live for alot cheaper then we are paying a month and get us into real estate at a great time.  Should I be looking to buy/how much should I be looking to spend? Everything included I am not looking to go over about $750 a month which can get me about a $125k-130k  of a house depending on where it is. My goal is to try to get to the 50/30/20 budget that is so often talked about on this reddit. A mortgage of 750 would easily let me cover utilities (which would be cheaper in a home we buy) and food (which I know we can cut down to $200 a month if we start couponing again) while my GF is in school. I am not naive enough to think there is no other costs involved with owning a home though.


Overall how does this plan sound? Where should I make changes?  Thanks in advance and thanks for all the help I have already gotten from being a reader of this subreddit!

news,Department of State Worldwide Caution report,"&gt;On February 19, 2013, the Department of State issued a new Worldwide Caution which replaces the Worldwide Caution dated July 18, 2012, to provide updated information on security threats and terrorist activities worldwide.   This notification continues warns us of the on-going threat of terrorist actions and violence against U.S. citizens and interests throughout the world.  U.S. citizens are reminded to maintain a high level of vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness.
The Department of State remains concerned about the continued threat of terrorist attacks, demonstrations, and other violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests overseas. Credible information indicates that terrorist groups continue to attack and plan for future attacks against U.S. government facilities, U.S. citizens, or U.S. interests in multiple regions, including Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
In many of these regions, al-Qaida, Taliban elements, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Islamic Jihad Union, the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, indigenous sectarian groups, and other terror organizations, many of which are on the U.S. government's list of Foreign Terror Organizations (FTOs), pose a potential danger to U.S. citizens.  These attacks may employ a wide variety of tactics including suicide operations, assassinations, kidnappings, hijackings, and bombings. 
Extremists may elect to use conventional or non-conventional weapons, and target both official and private interests. Examples of such targets include high-profile sporting events, residential areas, business offices, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, public areas, and other tourist destinations both in the United States and abroad where U.S. citizens gather in large numbers, including during holidays.
The Department of State encourages U.S. citizens living overseas or planning to travel abroad to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). When you enroll in STEP, you will be kept up to date with important safety and security announcements. Enrolling will also make it easier for the Embassy to contact you in the event of an emergency. You should remember to keep all of your information in STEP up to date; it is particularly important when you enroll or update your information to include a current phone number and e-mail address.  For additional information, please refer to ""A Safe Trip Abroad"", which is attached.
U.S. government facilities worldwide remain at a heightened state of alert. These facilities may temporarily close or periodically suspend public services to assess their security posture. In those instances, U.S. embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.
As the Department of State continues to develop information on potential security threats to U.S. citizens overseas, it shares credible threat information through its, Consular Information Program documents, including Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, Country Specific Information, and Emergency Messages.  In addition to information on the internet, you may obtain up-to-date information on security conditions by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada or, from other countries, on a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444. These numbers are available from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm Monday through Friday, Eastern Time (except U.S. federal holidays).

Bitcoin,My bitcoin price conspiracy theory.,"My arguably laughable (aren't they all) conspiracy theory is that competing interests (ie, FED, VISA/MASTERCARD, Paypal, etc.) are inflating the currency and hyping the interest in bitcoins, thus causing a controlled bubble.  They will take profits at the top, crush the currency (thus the competition), and perhaps repeat.  The repeat part is unknown as it depends on how hard they can crush the currency, ie. a lot of people pissed off they lost alot of money who bought in near the top.  These people are likely to NEVER touch bitcoins again.  Since the barrier to entry into bitcoins is rather steep (technology, wallets, strange hashes), it may be difficult to attract masses back to the concept.  The idea is similar to what happens every day to penny stocks on the OTC and Pinksheets.

investing,3 East African Oil Plays to Consider,"By Adam Currie - Exclusive to Oil Investing News

Exploration companies are constantly on the lookout for new and unexplored oil potential, and many are now venturing to less traditional hunting grounds to tap the next groundbreaking play.

While most of the world’s “cheap easy” oil has already been discovered, Africa remains largely unexplored and boasts high potential.

However, that is not the case for the entire continent, as is highlighted by an African Development Bank Group report, which points out that although new resources are discovered progressively, they are not equally distributed; 38 out of 53 African countries are currently net oil importers.

One of the few remaining under-explored regions

“East Africa is one of the few remaining onshore under-explored regions of the world with proven hydrocarbon systems, enormous geological potential, and vast amounts of exploration acreage held by relatively few companies,” states a Cormark Securities Report published in 2011.

This idea is also underlined in The Global Race for African Oil, a recent Casey Research report that forecasts that East Africa will be the world’s most important energy producer in 2040, at which time “trillions of dollars will be pumped in in exchange for its natural resources.”

In the report, the firm describes how geologically, East Africa has not been widely explored until now as it is a regarded as a more complex system than West Africa. Today, the East African Rift system is the largest continental rift system in the world and extends some 3,500 kilometers through Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania and Mozambique. Casey adds that if this area were combined, the potential areas for oil production would be “several magnitudes larger than the entire North Sea,” which currently produces one-third of Europe’s oil and gas.

A new find

The region attracted little notice as recently as 2006, when it was not even a discussion point relating to future energy potential. All of that changed in 2007, when Heritage Oil (LSE:HOIL) and Tullow Oil (LSE:TLW) announced a 1-billion-barrel discovery in Lake Albert, Uganda. Since this find was unearthed, a number of East Africa-focused explorers have reported major discoveries every year.

“In the space of a few years, East Africa has become a feeding ground for most of the world’s oil majors, which have sniffed our resources of oil and gas on a truly gargantuan scale,” wrote Malcolm Graham-Wood, an oil analyst at VSA Capital, in a note to clients.

Here are three East Africa-focused explorers that investors should have their eyes on.

Africa Oil: East African Rift basin

Africa Oil (TSXV:AOI) is a Canadian oil and gas exploration company with assets in Kenya, Ethiopia, Mali and Puntland (Somalia). The company is exploring in the East African Rift basin, and has both operated and non-operated blocks as well as an underexplored proven petroleum system.

The company had a phenomenal run in the markets last year after announcing several new oil discoveries, starting with the Ngamia-1 well in Kenya where the company encountered over 20 meters of net oil pay. On the back of the Ngamia discovery, Africa Oil went from having a $250-million market cap to over $2.5 billion at its peak, ending the year as one of the top 10 performing junior oil and gas companies of 2012.

In November, it announced a second significant Kenyan oil discovery at the Twiga South-1 well, where it encountered 30 meters of net oil play in tertiary sandstone reservoirs. Earlier this month, the company achieved the number one ranking on the TSX Venture 50 for 2012.

Taipan Resources: Kenya

Increased activity in the region lately has created upward market momentum for Taipan Resources (TSXV:TPN), an Africa-focused oil and gas exploration company with interests in 9.7 million acres of exploration acreage in Block 1 and Block 2B, located onshore in Kenya. The company’s land position makes it the fourth-largest oil leaseholder in the country, with no other junior even coming close to the amount of land it holds.

Last month, Taipan began recording 2D seismic data with the expectation of amassing 400 kilometers of seismic data during the first quarter of 2013. This data will be processed in conjunction with a full tensor gradient survey and existing data to determine the location of Taipan’s first exploration well on Block 2B. The company expects to drill its first well on Block 2B later this year, or early in 2014.

“The Anza Basin is one of the largest Tertiary-age rift-basins of the East African Rift system which contains multi-billion barrel oil discoveries,” CEO Maxwell Birley said in the news release. “We continue to believe based on existing gravity, magnetic and seismic data that the ‘sweet spot’ of the Anza Basin is located on Block 2B.”

With Taipan benefiting from neighboring companies’ positive results, some analysts are of the impression it is being systematically derisked. Shares of the company surged in December after Mackie Research initiated coverage of the firm, noting, “Block 1 and Block 2B hold a combined net un-risked prospective resource of 530 million barrels of oil. With recent nearby drilling successes, subsequent to the initial resource estimate, and with the acquisition of new seismic data, we expect the prospective resource estimate will increase substantially.”

“We believe the potential exists for significant share price appreciation once Taipan secures a farm-out partner and we see significant additional upside if a carried exploration campaign results in a new pool discovery,” the firm also stated.

Comparing Taipan to other juniors in the region, Mackie placed the value of its prospective resources at $1.02/share (risked) and $3.02 (unrisked). “With drilling success and the conversion of prospective resources into contingent reserves, we see a potential Blue-sky value of Taipan of $3.95/fd share on a risked basis and $12.95/fd share un-risked,” it concluded.

Emperor Oil: Sudan

Emperor Oil (TSXV:EM) is an oil and gas company with projects in Sudan and Turkey. Negotiations are continuing with Sudan’s oil ministry regarding a production sharing agreement encompassing the Block 7 oil and gas concession in the Rawat oil field, according to the firm’s latest corporate update.

Block 7 is 10,000 square kilometers and millions of dollars have already been spent on the property. It has three discovery wells that have been drilled, capped and are waiting for production. TSX approval has already been granted for the NI 51-101 report on the Block 7 concession and calculates 3P (proven plus probable plus possible) reserves of 94.7 million barrels of recoverable oil in the Rawat oil field, which is located within a 20-square-kilometer area of the Block 7 concession.

Emperor plans to prepare the discovery wells for commercial production after securing the EPSA and that to date it has also identified an inventory of six undrilled prospective oil fields within Block 7 that are geologically similar to the Rawat oil field.

East Africa is on the rise. While the majors might be eyeing untapped resources in increasingly hard-to-reach destinations such as the Arctic, investors know that “low-hanging fruit” in the form of easily accessible land reserves will always prevail.

I calculated 337 days from Jan 30, 2012 to Jan 29, 2013 as being overseas, so I do qualify for the exclusion. I had some vacation time in the US and a few months of military pay that is not eligible for the foreign exclusion. I am MFJ and my taxable income, 1040 Box 43, is $382. Which 'income' is used to determine if i can contribute to a Roth IRA? I used the IRS Roth IRA worksheet (pub 590, ws 2-1) and according to that I can. But I am still unsure of what is right since the worksheet uses MAGI and adds back the excluded foreign income for calculation. I want to contribute the maximum for myself and my wife to our accounts for 2012 since I technically earned money that was taxable. 2013 will be fully excluded though so I want to contribute everything I can while I am eligible.

personalfinance,"Please explain: allowances, exemptions, deductions","Hi /r/personalfinance. I'm fairly new here. 

I want to better understand my taxes and the forms I fill out. I filled out a W4 when I started working in 2010, including the worksheet at the top. That led me to 2 allowances. When I filed my taxes this year, my accountant noticed this and said I should have 0 allowances to get a bigger refund.

I also learned online that a refund is basically a tax-free loan to the government and it's better not to get a big refund because I could have been using that money throughout the year.

So basically, I want to understand what happens when I fill in my W4 differently. I am single, and make $50,000. I have no kids, nor do I have any work expenses except for a transit check. Here are some basic questions:

* What are allowances? At a basic level, what is it and what does it mean? What is 1 allowance (is there a unit? Is it money? Is 1 allowance the same as 1 person?)
* What is an exemption? At a basic level, what is it and what does it mean? What is 1 exemption (is there a unit? Is it money? Is 1 exemption equal to 1 person?)
* What is a deduction? As I understand it, if I make 50,000 at my job, and I spend 10,000 on work related expenses, then I am taxes on only 40,000 of that (50k-10k). But what I am confused about is- aren't I taxed throughout the year on the 50,000, since money is always taken out of my paycheck for taxes? Why do I get taxed again at the end of the year when I file taxes? I'm sure I'm missing something here.
* Related to the previous question: say I get a tax refund at the end of the year. How did that happen? In other words, where was there a mistake throughout the year that caused the state / federal government to take out more money than they should have? And how do they know at tax time that they owe me? Conversely, if I owe taxes, what kind of situation might lead to that? Why did the state / fed gov't take less taxes than they should have? And for either case, what's stopping the gov't from making the same mistake again (ie: say I owe money, they could say I owe even more than what's fair).

personalfinance,"(US) Let's talk retirement taxes, fees, and penalties! (Roth vs Traditional)","##Roth vs. Traditional retirement accounts:

I've noticed more and more people here in this forum blindly suggesting to people that they should max out a Roth account instead of contributing to a traditional retirement account. It seems that a lot of those that are suggesting Roth accounts don't understand the tax implications, and are assuming that a Roth IRA would be better.

In most cases, it isn't. This has a lot to do with the difference between marginal tax rate and the average tax rate. Every dollar put into your Roth IRA is taxed at your marginal tax rate (The highest tax bracket your salary puts you into). Whereas contributions to a traditional retirement account take dollars away from your marginal tax rate which reduces your average tax rate, and when you withdraw them, they are taxed at your average rate.

#Since your marginal rate is always higher than your average rate, in most cases a 401k contribution is the smarter choice.

###Let's do an example:

A single person is living on their own and making $50k salary. This person is trying to decide if he should contribute to a Roth IRA or contribute to his 401k. Fortunately this guy's 401k is managed by Vanguard, and has access to every fund.

He's considering saving 10% of his income yearly, or $5k. How do his accounts look after 40 years?

With the traditional 401k option, all $5000 is taken off of the top of his income, meaning that for tax purposes the IRS thinks that he made $5000 less that year. For 2012 that would mean his total taxes are $4855. **He has $40,145 available to him for the year** ($50k - $4855 tax - $5000 in 401k).

After 40 years of investments making 5% interest, his 401k account has $620,235. He wants this money to last him the next 30 years, so he calculates that he can withdraw $31,140 yearly, and with a 3% interest rate on his account, his account will hit $0 right at the 30 year mark.

#Now, because the money is in his 401k account, and it's not a Roth type of retirement account, the money is taxed. $31,140 of income from a 401k account would be taxed $2775, **leaving him with $28,365 of yearly income.**

**Now let's make Roth IRA contributions instead.**

We need to make things fair, so remember that above we had $40,145 available yearly. So, without the additional deduction from 401k contributions $50k of salary will be taxed $6095. This leaves us with $3760 to invest in the Roth IRA. You have the exact same income available to you ($40,145), but you can only contribute $3,760 per year.

#After 40 years of investments, with the exact same 5% interest rate, you will have $466,417 available in your retirement account. Again, we would like this money to last us the next 30 years invested at 3%, so with some simple calculations we find that we can withdraw $23,417 yearly. Obviously, because this is a Roth account, there are no taxes that need to be paid, **so your actual take home income is $23,417.**

#The difference between these 2 is fairly staggering. In one scenario, you get $28,365 yearly, which is $2363 a month. In the other you get $23,417 yearly, which is $1951 a month. **That's a difference of 20%! You'll have 20% more money available to you, every single year of your retirement, just by picking the correct retirement account to contribute into!**

##Taxes:

Another common topic that is brought up is the thought that taxes will rise in the future, thus it is imperative that you pay your taxes now by contributing to a Roth type account. This will shield you from advancing taxes in the future.

Fear of increased taxes is perfectly understandable, but consider how low your income is likely to be during retirement. In all of the examples above the working/contributing income is in the second or third brackets, and the retirement income is almost wholly in the very lowest tax bracket. It is incredibly unlikely that any political party would increase taxes on the Americans making the absolute lowest income.

Another possibility is that retirement could be taxed entirely differently. With a totally separate set of tax brackets for people that are withdrawing money from a retirement account instead of from paychecks, similar to how capital gains are taxed separately from normal income. In this case it is equally likely that both Roth and Traditional retirees will be screwed.

**The bottom line is that speculation on tax increases is exactly that. Speculation. You don't speculate with your retirement investments, why should you speculate with your tax rates?**

##Fees and penalties:

A common selling point of Roth plans instead of 401k plans is that you can withdraw every dollar that you contributed without any penalties.

This is an excellent benefit to Roth plans, as you can treat them almost like a high interest savings account. I wholeheartedly agree with this, and I believe they should be used in exactly that way.

###Here's an example:

You're making a $50k salary, and, like above, you're contributing to either a 401k or Roth IRA monthly ($5k and $3760 respectively). 3 years into your career your roof collapses, your car's engine seizes, and you trip and break your ankle. All on the same day.

You're going to be out of work for a while, and you need more money than your emergency savings contains. So we need to pull money from the retirement account.

Mr. 401k has $16,186 in his retirement account, and he needs $5000 right now in order to pay his bills. Now you must pay a 10% penalty, plus your full marginal tax rate on the money. Since we're out of work for 6 months we're only making $25k this year, so we're currently in the 15% marginal tax bracket. So we need to withdraw roughly $5k / 90% / 85% or $6535 in order to actually get $5000 in spending money. Now our retirement account is down to $9650.

Mr. Roth IRA has $12,172 in his account. And again, needs to withdraw $5k for this emergency. Thankfully he's contributed more than $5k to his account, so there are no taxes or fees assessed. He pulls $5k out and his retirement account dips to $7172.

**Both people pulled out $5000 in spending money from their accounts, the 401k owner has $9650 still in his account, and the IRA owner has $7172 in his account.**

This shouldn't be terribly surprising, we learned earlier that dollar for dollar the 401k owner will have a larger account balance at every check point along the way to retirement, now what we need to find out is if the extra $2400 he has in his account actually makes his taxable account worth more than Mr. IRA.

Let's work for another 37 years (40 years total) and see how the two compare.

Mr. 401k has $580,486 available at the end of year 40. Nearly $40k less than the guy that didn't have to withdraw $5k in year 3. He gets to retire on $29,140 per year, and is hit with $2475 in taxes, leading to a retirement income of $26,665 yearly or $2222 monthly.

Mr. IRA has $436,010 available at the end of year 40. This is $30k less than the first example where we never withdrew $5k in year 3. 30 years of retirement money would equate to $21,890 yearly, or $1824 monthly.

Yet again, **even with having taken a $5k hit with taxes and penalties, the 401k account still comes out ahead. And, again, we have a difference of nearly 20% in favor of the 401k over the IRA contributor.**

##You can stop reading here if you don't want to math.

All of the calculations in the above examples were calculated in the following ways.

Taxes are based on Standard + Personal deductions for a single person with no children. No additional deductions were applied. Married filing jointly would follow the same patterns exactly with all monetary values doubled for the couple (aka it would be the same math for individuals) for the salaries we are talking about. Tax responsibilities wouldn't shift unless the individual is making over $85k yearly, or the couple is making over $142k yearly. If you are making above that, it should be blatantly obvious to you that you should be contributing to a traditional type of account instead of a Roth account due to the huge disparity between your Marginal and Actual tax rates.

Interest was calculated with monthly contributions and interest compounded monthly (ie, a $100 contribution in January, with no additional contributions, that has a 5% APY was compounded monthly at 0.4074%, leading to an account balance of $105 in January the following year).

Retirement withdrawals were compounded monthly at a rate of 0.2466% (3% APY) with regular monthly withdrawals of the yearly rate/12. There were not calculated as having single large withdrawals followed by a full year of interest. (Basically the same calculations as above, but with negative monthly contributions and a lower interest rate). The withdrawal rate was adjusted by the dollar until the account had less than $100 at the end of year 30, but was still positive.

I'll provide any of these calculations that you may question to anyone interested. Just let me know.

##You can start reading again here

I am open for discussion on any of the assumptions I've made during this incredibly long post. Some of them may seem unintuitive, but I tried the best that I could. The biggest point of contention is probably going to be the low retirement income. After all, who could retire on less than $30k a year. If that's your thinking than you should already know that an IRA alone won't hold you over, and due to all of the above math and examples, you should see that ever dollar you contribute to an IRA instead of a 401k is less efficient than just contributing to a 401k.

economy,The Stock Market As One Giant Ponzi Scheme,"The reason why is when you have the Federal government in the form of the Federal Reserve injecting 85 Billion worth of artificial capital, i.e., capital that wasn`t earned, or created through increased sales, revenues or increased productivity gains.

 
 

The problem is that this ‘artificial capital’ is not real, it is temporary and the Fed will discontinue the artificial capital injections, and even remove the liquidity out of the system when they begin tightening.

You call it Asset Purchases, I call it a Ponzi Scheme

So a Ponzi scheme pays out old investors with the proceeds of the new investors. Well, current retirees right now are benefitting from these ‘artificial injections’ into the stock market at the expense of future retirees who will be left holding the bag on depreciating assets once the fed stops the artificial injections, and asset prices go down. Moreover, when they take the additional step of removing the liquidity from the system, i.e., tightening mode, asset prices will go down even further.

Consequently, anybody who takes money out of the stock market while the fed is artificially raising asset prices is benefitting at the expense of all 401k money that is buying assets now at artificially raised prices.

In short new investors are buying assets at prices higher than they would otherwise without the Fed`s involvement in the markets.

gaming,The cold hard truth...,"The current state of gaming on all platforms has been suffering. We all know this and we all have said this in one way or another. E3 is no longer for gamers but for corporate shareholders. Innovation in gaming is put into half baked touchscreens and motion controls while the latest games released conform into a mediocre and stale presentation which has been dumb down, sold with need for pre-order DLC, and stuffed with quick-timed and scripted events. 

We know these things, we have been victim to these things, and we all at one time or another have proposed to take a stand against this sort of thing. Raised our concerns to publishers and are returned with a banning from their forums and crippling restrictions such as online connection for single player. Regardless of our gaming platform of choice, publishers treat their customers with dishonesty, distrust, and find every conceivable method to have us pay for more with less provided. 

Look at what has happened in the past few months. An AMA with the SIM CITY Development team raised these concerns only repaid in silence. Yes it's not the dev team as much as it is EA, but the point still stands. Why should you have to be online if you are playing single player especially if you have a horrible connection to work with. The recent Aliens game was a blatant con on the customers we have seen the demo footage verses the final product and nothing close to what was there was pitched. You can talk all about how it was poorly developed and had its problems getting released but the fact remains if they were trying to make this game for years they still could have take more time working on it. Sony's Press conference Forget for a moment they never bothered showing the console. Just forget that. Aside from the pretty cgi trailers they passed off as games, and talking how awesome they think it will be boasting about hardware stats and the new controller. Does anyone care about motion controls? Streaming their games? How about using facebook? They know this too but this is all just to appease shareholders. 

You should not have to take their garbage. You should not have to pre-order in order to get dlc that makes a full game. And most importantly we shouldn't take their excuses. The fact of the matter is you do not need to have millions of dollars to make a great game and make a profit. If a guy like Notch can make something just with his computer and free time, you can make a great game safely without fear of going out of business. yes creativity is hard and I will certainly agree Notch is a rare exceptional indie dev, but the point remains quality will beat quantity always. Happy customers will make you more money and they will encourage friends to buy something if it is really good. You don't need a commercial or billboard or popup ads if your game is awesome on its own. 

Some days it just hurts me to be a gamer and see whats happening to it. My frustration has just got to me lately in this field. How can Game publishers do this to their faithful customers? Why have they resorted to such foul tactics and sacrificed innovation for a stale replacement. I've just had it lately. I know everyone reading this is just apathetic about the whole thing, but I can't stay silent about this. Not when it ruins what I love most.

The uranium spot price fell 50 cents, to $43 per pound U3O8, this week; however, according to TradeTech, deals involving delivery later in the year concluded higher than those involving immediate delivery, which means that the market should see higher prices later down the road.

A number of major producers have reported increased production levels for 2012. Total uranium output from AREVA’s (EPA:AREVA) operations reached a record high of 9,760 tonnes in 2012, a company press release notes. Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO,ASX:RIO,LSE:RIO) also posted positive production results for the year, according to TradeTech. Total uranium production from its operations in 2012 increased 38 percent over 2011, reaching nearly 9.8 million pounds U3O8. Paladin Energy (TSX:PDN,ASX:PDN) reported H2 2012 output of 4.12 million pounds U3O8 — an increase of 34 percent compared to the same period in 2011, stated Energy Business Review.

The US Department of Energy (DOE) is set to release a draft environmental impact statement this March concerning 31 uranium mining leases covering 25,000 acres between Naturita and Moab, Utah, reported the Telluride Daily Planet. The federal agency is hoping to overturn an October 2011 federal court ruling dictating that it cease mining-related activities through its leasing program due to a number of environmental concerns. Energy Fuels (TSX:EFR), which operates the Piñon Ridge mill, owns some of the 31 DOE leases, which could supply ore for the mill.

In May, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) officials will be visiting Tanzania to assess preparations for uranium exploration at the Mkuju River uranium project, reported local Tanzanian publication The Citizen. The Tanzanian government is expected to sign a Mining Development Agreement with the project’s developer prior to issuing mining licenses. The project would make the East African nation one of the top 10 uranium mining countries on the African continent.

Hongyanhe, China’s first nuclear plant post-Fukushima came online this week, reported United Press International. One generating unit is now operational and construction of the entire plant, which will consist of four power-generating units, is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. Two additional power-generating units will follow in 2016. Once completed, Hongyanhe will generate 45 billion kilowatts of electricity per year. China has a goal of 70 gigawatts of installed capacity by 2020 and is expected to reach 42 gigawatts by 2015.

Russian and Jordanian leaders are meeting this week to discuss Russian aid in uranium mining as well as in building the Middle Eastern nation’s first nuclear power plant and the necessary infrastructural development, according to the Azeri-Press Agency. Russia’s Rosatom is a contender for a potential contract to build the plant.

The Japan Atomic Power Company and Marubeni Utility Services signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Nuclear Center of the Republic of Kazakhstan for cooperation in building the first nuclear power plant in the Central Asian nation. “Areas covered by the latest MOU include cooperation on project development, human resources development, feasibility studies, and the construction and operation of a nuclear power plant,” a World Nuclear News report states. The agreement follows earlier deals, signed in 2007 and 2010, which arranged for cooperative studies to determine the feasibility of constructing nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan.

South African government officials announced this week that the country, which currently obtains about 90 percent of its energy from coal, intends to construct additional power plants. South Africa is home to the continent of Africa’s only nuclear power station. Speaking at the Africa Energy Indaba conference in Johannesburg, Energy Minister Dipuo Peters said his country cannot underestimate “the role that natural gas and nuclear power can play in the realization of that 2030 low carbon energy vision,” the Global Times reported.

Company news

Uranium Resources (NASDAQ:URRE) restructured its financial surety bonding for reclamation activities at its South Texas projects. Under the new arrangement, the company has secured $9 million in new surety bonds that require only $4.5 million in cash collateral compared to the existing $9 million in fully collateralized bonds. That will allow the company to return $4.5 million to its treasury.

“The restructuring of the bonding on our South Texas properties is a meaningful step forward as we continue to work on recapitalizing the Company, while simultaneously lowering our cost structure,” stated Terence J. Cryan, interim president and CEO of Uranium Resources, in a press release. “The additional capital provides added flexibility to advance our near-term priorities, which are focused on developing our significant New Mexico uranium assets, as well as maintaining our restoration activities in Texas so as to be positioned to restart uranium production in South Texas in the future.”

Alpha Minerals (TSXV:AMW) and its joint venture partner Fission Energy (TSXV:FIS) released additional results from the drill program on the Patterson Lake uranium project in Saskatchewan. “The highest point reading of the high grade was 76,233 cps. The high grade section within the Upper Zone includes: 20 meters from 87-107 meters down hole greater than 10,000 cps [including] 9 meters from 96-105 meters down hole greater than 45,000 cps,” states the press release. Further results will be released when data compiling is completed.

Macusani Yellowcake (TSXV:YEL) announced the first drill results from its campaign on the Tupuramani property in Peru. “The results to date are similar to the drilling intersections obtained within Colibri 2 &amp; 3 with multiple wide intersections of up to 60m thick, from surface, with uranium grades ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 lbs/ton within the first 100-110m from surface,” states the news release. The company is currently operating two drills on the property.

“These new uranium assays from drilling at Tupuramani demonstrate the real economic potential of the Colibri 2 &amp; 3 sector of the Macusani plateau,” commented Dr. Laurence Stefan, president and CEO of Macusani. “If positively confirmed by drilling this mineralization style has the potential to become a significant open pit mining resource,” he added.

gaming,"Watch Dogs or, as I’m calling it, Desmond Miles’ Second Chance","Yesterday we saw some more Watch Dogs gameplay footage as the game was announced for PS4 by Ubisoft. In case you don’t know, Ubisoft is responsible for Assassin’s Creed and I must confess to you that I’ve always been a fan of the series. Also, I’ve always been very interested in everything that is related to history and Ezio, Altair and Connor always fed me the need to materialize and revisit places that only through digital historic recreation would be possible to visit. However, I’ve always felt like the Desmond parts, that sort of connected the whole thing, were kind of rubbish or at least not in line with the quality of the rest of the medieval and modern stuff. In Assassin’s Creed III there was a small level that approached my idea of a modern-day assassin, when Desmond climbed its way up a skyscraper but it wasn’t enough.

Then I saw Watch Dogs gameplay yesterday and I thought: “wait a minute, this is it! Desmond parts should have been like this.” Why did Ubisoft hold this off? Well, probably because they thought they could make another game with it. Watch Dogs has Assassin’s Creed written all over it. You don’t believe me? Watch it carefully and notice the parkour moves in the open world, the image glitches, the UI.

In Watch Dogs you are Aiden Pearce who’s a hacker in Chicago. The gameplay lets you use extensively the open world and interact with it through your hacking gadgets. The quest system appears to be very similar to Guild Wars 2 based on dynamic events happening around you. You invade the privacy of people around you while trying to avoid the cameras that watch your movements around the city. It’s one of those games that makes you think about the world that surrounds you nowadays.

I do believe this could have become the Assassin’s Creed IV. What will become of the Creed after Watch Dogs? in http://overhypedgames.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/watch-dogs-or-as-im-calling-it-desmond-miles-second-chance/",technology,1361460986

personalfinance,What does /pf think about SECU(NC)'s varying interest rate credit card?,"I currently have three credit cards with interest rates of 20%, 19%, and 15%.  Having recently joined SECU in September I have been looking at their 7.75% interest rate credit cards.

The only catch I see is that the 7.75% says that it can vary every 6 months based on the Treasury Bill rate.  I'm not 100% sure what exactly the Treasury Bill rate is, other than it determines interest rates, but I still don't like seeing ""variable"" credit cards.

This is taken directly from their credit card agreement:
""The APR will equal 7.5
percentage points plus the Index Rate. The Index Rate is the 26 week Treasury Bill rate set at the first Auction held in January, 
April, July and October and adjusted up to the nearest 1/4%. Increases in the APR will result in a higher finance charge which 
may result in additional payments over a longer period in order to repay the purchases balance or your cash advance balance. 
The increased APR will apply to any balance outstanding on the effective date of the change as well as to future purchases and 
advances. There is no minimum APR.  The APR will not exceed 18% per year or the maximum permitted by applicable law, 
whichever is lower. The APR and the Monthly Periodic Rate used to compute your finance charge appears on your monthly 
statement.""

Anyone have thoughts?  While the maximum interest rate will be 18%, has it ever (in your personal experience) reached that high?  

Edit:  Perhaps I should have clarified my goals of this credit card.  I use to use my credit cards for every purchase and pay them in full each month.  However, getting married, moving twice, etc etc etc I ended up with balances remaining on them over the years.  I'm now in a position to start paying them down.

Eventually I want to use them for all of my purchases again as I personally don't like using my debit card all the time.  In the mean time, I'm looking to reduce the interest rates so that I can pay them off quicker.  This will probably take 8-12 months.  I'm also not exactly interested in a 0% APR as the interest rate will sky rocket after 12 months and I don't want to keep dinging my credit score bouncing around credit cards.  Additionally SECU offers a 0% transfer fee whereas I see at least 3% with most other cards.

So looking into the future, should I EVER have to carry a balance again, I'd rather it be on a 7.75% interest card rather than a 20% interest card.  I guess I'm looking for a card to hold for a long time that will have a low interest rate incase I have an emergency while building my emergency fund.",finance,1361455380

http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/rs2007-server You can also get to the poll by going directly to the runescape home page

Dear Redditors,

I come to you today with a noble cause.

Many of you, in your earlier years, probably played the MMORPG Runescape. Yes, Runescape - that game with the stick figure esque graphics, strikingly unique community, and oddly addictive game play. Well, in recent months and years, Jagex (the company owning Runescape) has done a serious number on all of the aforementioned. Graphical updates have been prioritized over beneficial updates, the means of getting XP/training has been heavily idiot-proofed, the player-verse-player community within the game has completely gone to shit, and is on the cusp of non-existence.

On top of all of this, the unique combat system within the game (clicking to fight), has been removed. It was replaced with a laggy action bar with incredibly basic and unoriginal abilities, and complete and utter lagginess/massive time delays. Only 12 abilities may be bound on the action bar at a time, and ""shifting"" through them to get access to your other abilities is met with extreme delays and many wasted game ticks, rendering anything but clicking them directly out of your spell-book wholly inefficient.

Now, Jagex, within the last few years, has been incredibly terrible at taking suggestions from their players. For months before the release of the xp schemes, graphical updates, and finally the massive combat overhaul, players within the community have shown their desperation to stop these updates by any means necessary. Through the heavily censored and formerly tyrannical YouTube/Facebook/Forum pages, the community had managed to get their voice out that the direction of the game is not at /all/ what they wanted.

So they came to people like me. Players with moderate to high subscriber bases within the Runescape YouTube community. We realized people were quitting off, not enjoying our content, and we realized we weren't enjoying ourselves too.

I started a player-petition. It read: Jagex Games Studios: Add Pre-EoC Game Servers Back into Runescape

http://www.change.org/petitions/jagex-games-studios-add-pre-eoc-game-servers-back-into-runescape

Within a manner of two weeks we pulled in 45,000 signers, which was extremely good considering the modern ACTIVE Runescape community base (excluding bots) is comprised of only double or triple that number, and many of them never use YouTube to know that this petition was started.

Then, through constant requests, I managed to get into contact with the CEO - Mark Gerhard - to have a conversation about player interests. After an incredibly receptive conversation on Skype, he decided to release a poll to garner support for the idea the player initiative petition I started was backed by. The poll (which is now on the Runescape homepage) is to add 2007 servers back into the game. After searching through their archives, this is the only version of the game they could find.

It isn't ideal for many, but most people within the community are putting aside their differences and voting up the poll regardless of their preferred ""era"" of the game, because ANYTHING (in their eyes) is better than the Evolution of Combat (the live game).

Now, we have ALREADY achieved over 50,000 votes (the first threshold of support to surpass), which means we will be getting the 2007 version of Runescape back indefinitely. The higher thresholds are there to determine if we get any kind of development team, anti-bot technology, and, most importantly, to be able to reduce the ADDED monthly membership fees that supporters of 2007 Runescape would be forced to pay.

If we don't get at least 250,000 votes, we will be forced to pay around $20 per month. If we get at least 250,000 votes, that number gets reduced to $10. But if we get 500,000 votes- that number is reduced to JUST the price of regular membership.

I ask anyone whose played this game in the past- please do us a massive favor and go vote. If you've played in the past, watched the game go to shit and then wished it could be returned to its older state- Please go vote. If you are a member of a different gaming community, but ever liked a previous version of the game more than its live version (WoW players- this would be like if blizzard opened up a poll to add separate, Burning Crusade servers) - PLEASE GO VOTE. You need to be a member to vote. Using a widely popular method I display in this video, you can get membership for less than two dollars:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7DTxpAr3JU&amp;list=UU7cARsAqE8dHhCIRkKJADvA&amp;index=1

For those of you who are concerned about the new players who enjoy the live game more than they would these legacy servers - fret not - the live version of the game is NOT being removed under any circumstances.

These other servers are simply an ADDED bonus to the game which hurts absolutely no one, for if we get to the desired 250,000 votes, a brand new development team will be issued to these servers as to not take away from the new updates to the live game.
I thank you for having read, and I thank you for your understanding in me posting this DIRECT LINK to the poll here- for I found there to be no better way to reach the veterans of this game who have moved on to other games long ago.
Thank you for reading,
Matt (So Wreck3d)

investing,"My new strategy, dividends + Call options. Let me know what you think.","Hi everyone. I have been doing some trading for the last few months, I have been pretty succesful, but quite stressed, I've made a little over 10% on the funds I borrowed to invest (promotional 1.9% for 6 month loan which I've been paying down aggresively with my regular paycheque).

I'm getting ready to cash out a portion of my holdings to pay off the rest of the loan as I'm approaching the 5 month mark, and I have put in an application for a Margin account (4% CAD and 4.5% USD, I'm canadian).

So I don't want to sit there watching day in and day out anymore, it's too much effort and I am tired of losing sleep watching the gold market, and such so here's my new plan, tell me what you think.

So my plan as of right now is to find consistently high paying dividend stocks (higher or equal to my margin interest rate). Buy them, 50% my money 50% their money and then write call options for a 2 month, optomistic position.
Let me give you an example

I bought [Gamestop](https://www.google.ca/finance?q=NYSE%3AGME&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t_0nUdimL4SoqQGNIQ) @ 25.95, it's fallen to 24.85, when it hits 24.44 the dividend will = the interest. 

I would then buy an equal # of shares at 24.44 (if it hits that price or lower), and then write call options with a strike price of 28 $ [which are selling](http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=GME&amp;m=2013-04) for $.52 each.

So when I'm said and done I'll have 500 shares of GME, = 12,220 USD
+590 (every 4 months or 1770 annually) for the options and an annual dividend of 275

Without including compounding from paying down the borrowed money with dividends and writing options on it I should have an annual return of 2,045 or 31.5% annually on my original 6,487.5

Or! it goes up to 28 $ and I make 2.05 $ per share I had and 3.56$ per share I borrowed on or $1402.5 + 590 (at least 1 call writing) = 1992.5 or 30.71%.

gaming,System architecture and Backwards Compatibility of the PS4 - opinions and facts.,"I wanted to get my opinion out there, and see if maybe this is a side of things we forget to consider when our righteous anger flares up at the ""No backwards compatibility"" thing on the PS4.

Think about it. The PS3 used a new, hard-to-program for Cell processor. It took devs years to get used to this, as it made computing handle in ways that were very different from your standard PC or console.

Now, the PS4 comes along, with beefed up stats, but... what's that? It's built to pretty much be a high-end PC?

""Awesome!"" say developers. ""This will be so much easier to program for!""

...but wouldn't it make sense that things developed specifically with the Cell processor in mind would NOT be able to run on a standard PC system architecture/x86 64-bit processor?

I was going to try comparing it to attempting to install/play a Windows game on a Mac, but even that isn't accurate. This is a hardware issue, not software.

So why does it work with Gakai and cloud streaming?

Easy. The servers used for Cloud streaming are basically clump PS3s/PS2s/PS1s. They use the exact hardware architecture from each system, and shoot that to you via streaming. You're not actually ""playing"" the game on your local system, you're playing it thousands of miles away on THEIR system, and seeing the resulting audio/visual displayed in your own home.

It's a pretty ingenious solution, if you ask me. There was no easy way or them to include the necessary hardware in a PS4 to allow for BC AND have a new, easy-to-develop-for architecture. This allows for the best of both worlds.

Am I disappointed by this? Of course I am, a little bit, but only because I know that I, and most US gamers out there, won't have the necessary bandwidth to make Cloud Backwards Compatibility a fun, lag-free, feasible experience. But really, I think it's the best thing they could have come up with in this case. 

There's got to be a middle ground. I realize most of us don't want to keep all our old systems lying around in case we want to play an older game. But really, I think the game industry would be better off as a whole if they focused on one thing at a time.

Easier to develop-for architecture -&gt; better games, more games -&gt; happier customers.

You can't have your cake and eat it too, unfortunately. While we'd like a console that plays PS1-PS4 games, I just don't think it's feasible if they're putting their focus on making games easier to make for developers.

People complained about PS3 games initially being crappy, buggy ports because no devs could fully figure out how to use the hardware. This was their solution. In the end, I think everyone will be better off. 

It makes sense, guys. This is why there's no point in bitching about how the PS4 won't have native Backwards Compatibility. It's a whole different hardware ballgame.

I don't consider myself to be biased; I highly doubt I'll even buy the system. I wanted everyone to try to think with a broader perspective, though.

Does it make sense to transfer high interest student loan debt to a (fixed rate) low interest credit card?,"I transferred $4,200 worth of a 6.8% student loan to my 4.99% fixed rate credit card. Does this make sense? I know I am saving money due to having a lower interest rate but will the impact on my utilization % and therefore my credit score be worth the savings?

I hope this can help others too. My credit Union had a limited offer to transfer debt to their credit card at a fixed interest rate until it is fully paid off.

Possibly residency restrictions as well. (xpost personalfinance)","http://www.citizensbank.com/savings-and-cds/college-saver.aspx

This almost seems too good to be true, so possibly someone else will show where my analysis is wrong.

I've had a tough time figuring out what locations this particular Citizens Bank has, but I know they are in the northeast (PA, MA).  I'm not sure if anyone can open an online account, or if they have restrictions.  You can click the link, but the basics are:

* This is designed as a college savings account and needs to be tied to a kid under 12 years old (you'll need their SS#).  **However, despite the name, the funds are not restricted to educational spending.**

* Make an initial deposit of $500 the day before the kid's 12th birthday, and then make monthly deposits of $50 each month until the kids's 18th birthday.

* The interest rate on the account is variable, but is currently 0.1%, so it really as nowhere to go but up over the next 6 years.

* On the kid's 18th birthday, a bonus of $1,000 will be deposited into the account.

So, by my calculations, you'll deposit a total of $4,050 into the account and at the end of 72 months, you'll have $5,063.69 in the account.  That's the equivalent of a compounded annual return of 6.15%.

They also have an option to start when the kid is 6 years old with no lump sum initial deposit and 144 monthly deposits of $25 each.  My calculations on that one aren't quite as good as waiting until 12 years old.  You put in a total of $3,600 and get out $4,621 - a compounded annual return of 3.99%.

I just started a new job with a 30k salary and I've been at it for a few months now. I started as a contractor and they brought me on full time because they loved my work, so I feel very secure in this position. My fiance has been working for two or three years at an outbound call centre doing surveys for charity. He makes somewhere in-between 10-15k.

We're both students. My tuition is covered for the next few months and I am on OSAP—I do not have to worry about my debt until I graduate and OSAP is famous for low interest rates and ease to repay as long as you graduate and don't drop out. My fiance has a few thousand dollars in credit debt. He won't tell me the exact amount, and he doesn't actually know. Somewhere around 3-4k. He is paying it off slowly.

We are getting our first place together on April 1st. We have paid first and last months rent. We have budgeted our move in costs such as furniture, cleaning supplies, etc.

What we're not sure about is our monthly budget. We could use some help.

I bring just over 2k in a month. He brings in around 1k. 

Our rent is $1375 split three ways (We are going to have a room mate), so about $458 each and $916 combined.

Electricity is not covered. We're thinking it'll be $100-$200 a month, and we are charged quarterly.

We are getting a Costco membership and going once a month for staples (rice, potatoes, meat, bread, pasta, etc.). All three of us will split the Costco costs evenly. After that, anything we pick up from the grocery store across the street comes out of our own pocket. We are assuming we will both spend $500 a month on groceries because this is what a friend recommended. It seems high to us but we're putting the money aside.

My phone bill is $25/month, his phone bill is $100.

We both get a bus pass for $125 for transportation.

Internet and home phone will probably cost us about $40 each.

If we look at all of these costs it seems like our monthly costs will be about $2571, leaving us with about 400-ish for savings, debt, entertainment, and other costs. Is this enough? Where can we cut back? We don't imagine we will spend much on entertainment. We play games, we don't drink, and we don't go out clubbing. Should I continue to build my personal savings, or just throw all of our excess at his card debt until it's vanquished?

personalfinance,Hi personalfinance. The water's starting to get over my head and I could really use some advice,"Hi there, thanks ahead of time for taking a moment to read my post.

I'll try my best to be brief: I've got a fair amount of debt, both from (2) credit cards and a small federal student loan. I got a credit card when I was 18 and maxed it out, and also bought a tv when I was 21 with a best buy credit card. Dumb moves, I know. I haven't used a credit card in at least 4, maybe 5 years- and while I started off making regular payments I eventually was without a job and stopped. I'm in my late 20's now, and have moved so much that I don't actually get any correspondence about any of my debt. I know from getting phone calls that it's all in the hands of collectors now, but I don't answer those. I'm in the dark a bit (intentionally, I guess). While I don't rack up debt anymore, I also only really earn enough to break even month after month, so I'm not super sure there's anything I can do to get out of the hole anyway- but I'm starting to get scared that I might get sued, or worse- that I've been sued already and don't know it. I filed my taxes this year already happily expecting a big refund- only to get a letter that the IRS was re-appropriating those funds to the Department of Education for the unpaid school loan, which is fair I suppose, but I'm worried that someone might come after my paycheck or something. The other time something like that happened was two years ago- I opened a checking account with USAA and deposited $400 into it, only to have them immediately close my account and hold the funds and refuse to explain why. That shook me up, and I still don't know the explanation.

Some other notes that might matter: I'm a US resident, none of the 3 major debts exceeded $4k, ... that's all I can think to say.

Copper slipped to a 2013 low on Thursday after China said it is considering a property tax to rein in sharp rises in home prices. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve signaled that quantitative easing may come to an end, with some board members voicing concerns that additional “asset purchases could foster market behavior that could undermine financial stability” and pose a risk to inflation.

“The Fed minutes and concerns over China’s property sector hurt market sentiment, weighing down China’s stocks market and commodities,” Peng Guoliang, an analyst at Dadi Futures, told Bloomberg.

Still, Wiktor Bielski, head of commodity research at VTB Capital, said he expects brighter economic data out of China as well as evidence of the restocking of copper. “We remain confident that these trends will steadily become more evident through 2013, driving prices higher, although in the short-term, markets are likely to remain pressured by renewed uncertainty,” The Wall Street Journal reported Bielski as saying.

On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three-month delivery closed down 1 percent, to $7,880 per ton, from the $7,960 closing price on Wednesday. COMEX copper for March delivery was down 1.5 percent, at $3.5555 per pound, in mid-afternoon trade in New York.

BHP Billiton (ASX:BHP,NYSE:BHP,LSE:BLT) said Andrew Mackenzie, the current head of its nonferrous division, will replace CEO Marius Kloppers, who is retiring in May. BHP also said its revenue fell 14.1 percent in the six months to December 31, to $32.2 billion, while net impairments and exceptional costs of $1.4 billion caused its earnings per share to drop 58 percent, to 79.6 cents.

Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold (NYSE:FCX) reached agreements with two bank syndicates that will provide it with a $4-billion term loan and a new $3-billion revolving credit facility in connection with its proposed acquisition of Plains Exploration &amp; Production (NYSE:PXP) and McMoRan Exploration (NYSE:MMR).

Xstrata (LSE:XTA) has been granted environmental approval for the $5.9-billion Tampakan copper-gold mine in the Philippines, Reuters reported. The project is currently held up by the provincial government’s 2010 ban on open-pit mining; there are no plans to revoke the ban, but the central government’s environmental compliance certificate puts Xstrata a step closer to construction if the ban is lifted.

Inmet Mining’s (TSX:IMN) board decided to waive a plan that could have given shareholders rights to buy shares at half the market price if anyone attempted to buy 20 percent or more of the company. Inmet said it waived the plan because the February 27 expiration date of First Quantum Minerals’ (TSX:FM) $5.2-billion offer “provides sufficient time for the full review and potential execution of all strategic alternatives being evaluated by the Inmet board.” Inmet said it will “provide shareholders with further information regarding its strategic alternatives as appropriate and prior to the expiry of the First Quantum offer,” and reiterated its recommendation that shareholders reject the offer.

Anglo American’s (LSE:AAL) revenue fell 10 percent in 2012, to $32.8 billion, while a $4-billion after-tax impairment on the Minas Rio iron ore project in Brazil helped push the bottom line into a loss of $1.19 per share compared to a profit of $5.10 per share in 2011.

Coro Mining (TSX:COP) is selling its Chacay property, an early stage copper porphyry prospect in Chile, to Teck Resources’ (NYSE:TCK,TSX:TCK.A) Compania Minera Relincho for $2.5 million plus a 1.5-percent net smelter return royalty. The company plans to use the proceeds to help advance its Berta, El Desesperado and Payen copper and gold projects.

Catalyst Copper (TSXV:CCY) announced plans for a private placement of up to 10 million units at a price of $0.06 per unit to raise up to $600,000. The proceeds will be used to pay the remainder of its financial commitments to secure a 60-percent stake in the La Verde copper project in Mexico.

EMED Mining (LSE:EMED,TSX:EMD) completed an updated technical report on its Rio Tinto copper project in Spain. The report supports the company’s base case of 9 million tons per annum over 14 years for annual production of existing ore reserves from the Cerro Colorado deposit. The report also notes exploration potential peripheral to Cerro Colorado that could potentially provide scope to grow the resource and expand operations within existing permit areas. The net present value of the project is estimated at $427 million per year at a copper price of $3.50 per pound.

Candente Copper (TSX:DNT) is “extremely pleased” with results from the first exploration hole of the 2013 drilling program at the Canariaco Sur porphyry copper-gold system. President Sean Waller said that this hole, together with two previous drill holes, contains copper and gold mineralization extending over 500 meters from the surface to the end of the hole, “indicating that Canariaco Sur has the potential to be a very significant system.”

Nevada Copper (TSX:NCU) expects to receive all the permits required to operate and develop its Pumpkin Hollow copper project in Nevada in the second quarter of this year.

Euromax Resources (TSXV:EOX) said drilling results at its KMC project in Serbia show thick sequences of gold-copper skarns, gold skarns, zinc-lead-copper-gold skarns and volcanic-hosted gold mineralized silica breccias. “We are now confident to proceed with a maiden resource estimate on the copper canyon skarn,” Chief Operating Officer Pat Forward said in a statement.

Copper North Mining (TSXV:COL) said its 2012 exploration program in the Redstone Copper Belt in the Northwest Territories indicates the “geological potential for a conceptual stratiform, sedimentary rock-hosted copper target that spans up to 10,000 m of strike length at Coates Lake.”

Benton Resources (TSXV:BEX) sold its stake in the Stillwater Mining (NYSE:SWC) for net cash proceeds of $5.02 million. The company now has around $10 million in cash and $3.02 million in remaining equity positions.

INTERNATIONAL TYLER GROUP
House Democrats on Thursday recruited experts in the defense, education and healthcare sectors to press their case for preventing the sequester cuts scheduled to hit next week.
At a gathering of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee on Capitol Hill, the lawmakers heard from a variety of voices warning that the automatic cuts would not only kill jobs, but also devastate low-income families that benefit from education, public health and other federally funded programs.
The event was designed to put a face on the obtuse issue of deficit reduction and to pressure GOP leaders to cut short their recess and vote on legislation preventing the sequester cuts from taking effect March 1.
""My students live in poverty and have special needs that federal funding helps,"" said Megan Allen, an elementary school teacher in Tampa, Fla., and Florida's 2010 Teacher of the Year. ""The looming cuts threaten all of this.""
Mary Selecky, secretary of the Washington state Department of Health, said the poorest and sickest people in the state would also be the hardest hit by the blunt cuts.
""This is really about negative health outcomes,"" she said.
And Marion Blakey, head of the Aerospace Industries Association, piled on, warning that the cuts would cause ""great, and in some cases, very permanent harm"" to both the economy and national security.
The hearing — a one-sided affair in which no Republicans participated — is the latest salvo in the increasingly bitter partisan battle over who should be blamed if the sequester cuts take effect, which seems ever more likely with each passing day.
Although President Obama has used his bully pulpit this week to travel around the country warning of the sequester's harmful effects, GOP leaders in both the House and Senate say they're willing to let those cuts take hold rather than accept Democratic demands that tax hikes be a part of an alternative deficit-reduction package.
They are gambling that Obama and the Democrats will bear the blame for the estimated hundreds of thousands of jobs that would be lost if the $85 billion cut takes effect.
""The revenue debate is now closed,” Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement this week.

New Zealand’s dollar depreciated 1.5 percent to 83.42 U.S. cents as the central bank said it’s ready to influence the currency’s exchange rate.
The Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency against six major peers, climbed 0.8 percent after the minutes were released. Fed officials “emphasized that the committee should be prepared to vary the pace of asset purchases, either in response to changes in the economic outlook or as its evaluation of the efficacy and costs of such purchases evolved.”
“It doesn’t take a lot of imagination to think about where the next potential source of weakness or worry is going to be, and that’s going to be when the Fed steps back from their quantitative easing program,” Brian Barish, president of Denver, Colorado-based Cambiar Investors LLC, which manages about $7 billion, said in a phone interview.

Policy Debate

The Fed minutes showed policy makers were divided about the strategy behind Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s program of buying bonds until there is “substantial” improvement in a U.S. labor market burdened with 7.9 percent unemployment, with some saying an earlier end to purchases might be needed, and others warning against a premature withdrawal of stimulus.
The S&amp;P 500 climbed to the highest level since October 2007 yesterday and ended the session trading for 15.1 times reported earnings, the most-expensive level since July 2011.
The benchmark gauge of U.S. equities closed yesterday about 2.2 percent below its record high and was up 7.3 percent in 2013, almost double the gains in the MSCI Asia Pacific and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
“The market has moved too far,” Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at the private-banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland, said in a phone interview. His firm oversees $20 billion. “We need to take a breather. Even good, solid economic reports are probably not living up to the expectations. It doesn’t mean that we’ll see a selloff. Yet we’ll probably move sideways.”
Apple Inc. fell after Foxconn Technology Group, the biggest assembler of Apple products, froze hiring across China, spurring concern demand is slowing. Toll Brothers Inc., the largest U.S. luxury-home builder, sank after earnings that missed estimates. Caterpillar Inc. slid after saying global retail machine sales dropped.
The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is known, jumped 19 percent to 14.60 for its biggest gain on a closing basis since November 2011.

personalfinance,He (US) &amp; She (AT) with 80k EUR to invest in US Market.  But how? and in what? (AT),"We are both in our early thirties and have saved about 80k EUR, which we'd like to invest in a home in the US in 5-10 years.  Currently we're living and working in Europe.  My wife's a Austrian Citizen and I'm a US citizen.

Up until recently we've been leaving the money in saving accounts, but lately the interest rate has been 1% and we're looking for something more aggressive.

I'd personally like to invest in the US market, mainly because I'm more ""familiar"" (which is a *real* exaggeration of that word ;) with the companies and culture.  However, because I'm working outside the US, I'm taxed accordingly and in effect we receive about $1000 USD/child/year.  Anything I earn ""in the US"" is taxed and taken from this amount.  So, to me it actually makes more sense to have my wife invest (and get taxed in Austria), but the question still remains:  In what?

I've noticed Vanguard seems to be quite popular with this crowd, and if we were living the US, we'd be all over it.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like [Vanguard Europe](https://www.vanguardinvestments.de/content/de/en/investments.shtml#pagetab1) provides the same services at its US counterpart.  Unless I'm missing something.

Would it be wise to try to buy US index funds or US Mutual Funds from Europe?  If so could someone offer a cheap broker?  I saw some link (I cannot find it now) that offered really cheap trades, but really required that you be a day-trader or pay a monthly fee (bleech).

Any advice is welcomed, as I feel I can't really trust the banks and their ""advise"".  And I'm not having a lot of luck in finding websites that don't have some sort of self-interest angle ([Motley Fool?](http://www.fool.com)).  **Reddit, you're my last hope!**",finance,1361653065

**Background:** 23 years old. $60K/yr. developer position. I have about ~$36,000 in student loan debt which I start paying next month at $416/mo. Over the lives of both loans, I'll end up paying about $12k in interest.

My student loan payment is factored into my budget, as well as 6% towards my 401K (to max out the company match), and 8% to a Roth IRA (close to maxing it out).

If I were to stop contributing to my 401k and IRA *completely*, I'd be able to pay off my student loans in about 3 years.

Should I do this? Or should I continue contributing to my 401k/Roth (at my current salary and percentages, I'm putting away about $11.5k a year) and just stay on the 'aggressive' loan repayment plan?

My thoughts are that if I just pay it off in 3 years, I'll be able to max out my 401k and Roth contributions per year (which I'm not doing for my 401k right now) and end up saving a lot more over time.",finance,1361638857

1) Have parent (with great great) credit co-sign and pay on schedule for entirety of loan
2) Have Parent co-sign and pay off loan with financial institution nearly immediately (next day or few months later) - taking a loan from my folks for a lower rate than the bank. No penalties for prepayment of loans.
3) Put 50% or more $ down in hopes of getting a lower rate (quoted at 4.9% at dealership while I would like to be at 2.9%) then pay off loan for smaller amount with dealership and separate loan to my parents.

Out of this income we spend make our scheduled student loan payments, cover all our monthly expenses, and have about $700 leftover at the end of the month. 

We contribute 5% to my 401k, have a 2 month ""emergency"" fund, and no credit card debt or car loans. We always follow a budget and are VERY frugal. Our highest financial priorities are paying down our student debt and saving for retirement.

The city we live in has LOTS of houses we'd consider buying in the 60-90k range. Our credit scores are squeaky clean, so I would think we would get a decent mortgage interest rate. So, when will we be ready to buy? 

In another year we will be dual income. Conservatively, this would add $30k/yr.

I have been especially enjoying Final Fantasy IV, Crono Trigger, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and Final Fantasy IX. Somehow I feel like these games are far more enjoyable and memorable than any games of this generation (I'm looking at you Call of Duty). Does anyone else experience this sort of nostalgia?

Bitcoin,My current thoughts on Bitcoin.*,"Bitcoin has been in existence for the last 4 years now, and volatility has been a subject of wariness for a few users ever since. Obviously, movements such as the 2011 bubble were certainly not rational and thus could hardly have been averted, but Bicoins are still a speculative investment.

First, let’s remind ourselves of a few facts:

- The will be a maximum of 21 millions BTC in circulation. Until the last of them is mined, their number will be in constant flux. 

- The price of Bitcoin only matters to those investing in it, but shouldn’t even matter to people using them as currency. The only issue here should be stability, because no one wants to buy something for X one day and discover the next day that he/she could have gotten twice as much. The same goes for vendors  who would rather not have to think about when and how their prices should fluctuate.

- Bitcoin is tied to the dollar right now, but independance from it should probably be seeked for one essential reason: if one of the pillars of a currency is decentralization, depending on another currency which is not defeats its purpose. 

- Bitcoin business is booming, but still in its infancy due to many factors among which lack of information and cryptic mechanisms are the major deterrents. 

- The main market for Bitcoin is still illegal.

- Bitcoin is a scarce resource, and I believe it will continue to grow in value, hence the hoard-oriented economics. 

Now having heard and understood those facts, I think one of the major issues with Bitcoin is that it is mostly used to buy (legal) digital products and services, with good reason : digital goods do not need to be sent through complicated shipping procedures, and this for me is a business opportunity waiting to happen. This of course means someone with funds would have to gamble part of their business model onto Bitcoin. However I think it is of paramount importance that a money with no borders can be used to buy stuff anywhere and have it delivered anywhere else on the globe. I’ll try to get in touch with someone operating in this particular business area soon, but if you want to do it or know someone who can (probably not UPS/FedEx or any other big name, though it could definitely be of interest to those companies).

Another important business which should exist is Bureaux de Change. those places already sell a lot of different currencies and could trade bitcoin with virtually zero adjustments to the way they already do business. In fact, any brick and mortar shop could already sell and buy bitcoins, as long as they are not recognized as money by legal entities. 
Last but not least, Bitcoin needs basic resources. Food for example should be a primary focus of bitcoin-based economy: you can’t make an economy function only on top-of-the-maslow-pyramid stuff because it means Bitcoin would be too narrow. I’d love to be able to buy flour, salt, vegetables with my bitcoins and might even think about launching a French platform delivering those in Paris and the nearby suburbs.

global holdings bp business madrid

Londen-Hoopt dat de eurozone zouden kunnen ontstaan van recessie snel werden vastgesteld terug donderdag als gegevens is gebleken dat een daling van de zakelijke activiteiten in de regio verergerd onverwacht deze maand, met name in Frankrijk.

De cijfers kwam een dag voordat de EuropeseCommissie was te wijten aan kondigen tussentijdse economische prognoses voor de 27-nation bloc, met inbegrip van die landen niet voldeed aan doelstellingen van de Europese Unie op begrotingstekorten.
	
Europese aandelenindices viel, volgende scherpe dalingen in Aziatische benchmarks, en de euro tegenover de dollar viel. De dalingen analisten toegeschreven aan nervositeit over economische groei, met name volgende vermeldingen woensdag dat de Amerikaanse Federal Reserve was verdeeld op het behoud van stimulerende maatregelen.

Economen hadden verwacht dat Markit aankoop managers index voor dienstverlenende bedrijven in de euro-zone, zou een conjunctuurenquête bij de bedrijven en een van de vroegste maandelijkse indicatoren van de economische activiteit, toevoegen aan voorzichtige tekenen dat een herstel was in het verschiet.

Maar de indicator gedaald in februari tot 47.3 van 48,6, markering een jaar die het is geweest onder de 50 drempel voor groei. Analisten hadden verwacht een verhoging tot 49: geen van de meer dan 30 analisten gepolst door Reuters had zo'n slechte lezing voorspelling.

Markit zei het schisma tussen Duitsland en Frankrijk-met de grootste economieën in de eurozone — was op het breedste sinds het onderzoek begon in 1998. Terwijl bedrijven in Duitsland een gezonde groeitempo aanhoudende, ervoeren Frans-dienstenbedrijven hun ergste recessie sinds begin 2009, toen de financiële crisis en de daaropvolgende recessie in het ergste geval waren.

""Als het niet voor Duitsland, dit zou echt dire lezingen,"" zei Chris Williamson, chef econoom bij Markit. ""At ten minste de Duitse economie is nog steeds te helpen houden de eurozone drijven in sommige opzichten.""

Hij zei dat de meest recente enquête wees op de euro zone economie krimpt 0,2 tot 0,3 procent in het eerste kwartaal, na een naar schatting 0,4 procent contractie aan het einde van vorig jaar.

Een enquête van Reuters van economen vorige week stelde dat de economie alleen maar dit kwartaal zou stagneren.

Verreweg was het meest verontrustende aspect van de gegevens vrijgegeven donderdag de sombere prestaties van Franse bedrijven. Mr. Williamson zei dat de gegevens voor Frankrijk waren meer past bij een worstelende ""perifere"" euro zone economie zoals Spanje of Italië, in plaats van de ""kern""-status die Frankrijk traditioneel met Duitsland deelt.

Duitsland heeft daarentegen een goede start van het jaar. Duitse investeerder moreel steeg tot het hoogste niveau in bijna drie jaar deze maand, volgens het ZEW research institute, terwijl het federale statistics office zei dinsdag dat werkgelegenheid het hoogste niveau in het vierde kwartaal sinds de hereniging bereikt.

Toch zijn er grenzen zijn aan wat Duitse welvaart voor de rest van de regio doen kan, verwoest door strenge begroting soberheid en stijgende werkloosheid. Het laatste Markit onderzoek suggereert dat de ""positieve contagion"" opgemerkt in januari door de president van de Europese CentraleBank, Mario Draghi, kan meer in hoop dan verwacht.

Nieuwe orders bij bedrijven in de dienstensector van de euro-zone — waaronder banken, informatie technologiebedrijven, hotels en restaurants — daalde in een sneller tempo deze maand, met de index scherp dalen tot en met 46 van 48,4 in januari.

De enquête ook onderbroken optimisme dat de inzinking in de eurozone fabrieken zou verlichten verder in februari, als de productie index nauwelijks verplaatst naar 47,8 van 47.9 in januari.

Uitvoer daalde in een sneller tempo, hoewel nieuwe exportorders bracht ten minste een sprankje hoop, met de index gestegen tot 51,7 in februari van 49,5, zijn eerste lezing boven 50 sinds juni 2006.

De samengestelde index, het combineren van de diensten en productie enquêtes, gedaald tot 47.3 in februari van 48,6 in januari.

Bedrijven meer arbeidsplaatsen schrappen, hoewel niet zo snel als in januari, wanneer ontslagen steeg het snelste tempo in meer dan drie jaar.

De Euro Stoxx 50, een barometer van euro zone blue chips, gesloten 2.3 percenten lager. Nationale benchmarks ook tuimelde. In Milaan, de MIB viel 3,1 procent en in Madrid de IBEX 35 1,8 procent gedaald. In Parijs, de CAC 40 daalde 2,3 procent en in Frankfurt de DAX was van 1,9 procent. In Londen gleed de FTSE 100 1,6 procent.

In Azië, de Nikkei 225 gesloten van 1,4 procent en de Hang Seng-index in Hongkong 1,7 procent daalde.

De euro was op $1.3207, neer van $1.3340 late woensdag in New York.

-Cars, motorcycles, bicycles, boats, jetskis, planes, helicopters, and submarines will be in the game.

-The player is a highly trained secret agent sort of character that is sent in by a multi-national anti-crime group to fight like a terrorist group or gang or something (that part i haven't decided yet).

-The environment (buildings and the ground) will be 100% destructible. Auto-repair can be turned on or off in the menu (so like if the player blows up a building, there can be one setting that will make it never rebuild itself, one to make it rebuild itself in a few in-game days, one in a few-ingame weeks, and one that only important buildings will rebuild themselves.)

-Several different types of guns customizable with attachments and paint. The player can carry one two-handed gun (ie sniper rifle, shotgun, assault rifle, large smg) at a time, two (dual wielding possible) short guns (pistol, small smg), and one special (grenade, molotov). These can be swapped out for any other gun either via finding a gun on the ground or going to a store or safehouse. Many specials can be carried at a time, but must be swapped out by repeatedly pressing a button. (Let's say that the special button is right directional pad. Press it once, you get a grenade. Press it again, get a molotov. Again, c4. Again, and you cycle back to the grenade.)

-Player safehouses, to store vehicles, guns, and outfits

-Customizable outfits

-A parachute and grappling hook (working similar to Just Cause 2). The parachute is available from the start, but the grappling hook is unlocked later.

-A second grappling hook, on the other arm. This is bought in a store and counts as a special.

-A melee system, kind of like Sleeping Dogs. The player can either use a knife, a machete, a tomahawk, their fists, or a gun for melee combat. To equip the fists, the player must press the equip button the weapon that is already equipped. (So if you have your two-handed gun out, press the two-handed gun button and you will put it away.)

-Civilians that don't just say random stuff like (Oh look! A person running!)

-Fishing

-A black market dealer who will drop of previously purchased items for free.

-A stealth system. Melee kills or kills with a silenced weapon are perfectly silent (for the most part.) The player can crouch to make stealth easier.

-A cover system like Uncharted

-A climbing system, a bit like Uncharted and Assassin's Creed

-Deep, meaningful characters.

-Several different plot lines. The player can decided where the plot goes.

-Multiplayer, just dicking around in the massive world or fighting or capturing the flag

-An overall theme of chaos and destruction. (Like how the main theme of Far Cry 3 was insanity)

-A multi-talented protagonist, with a mostly strong and serious personality, but occasionally makes a small joke. Is daring and doesn't take shit from anyone (unless he chooses to.) Must have an awesome accent.

So that's what I have so far. Please list any other ideas that you have.

Well, my work schedule picked up and it just never happened and I basically just forgot about it after a year or so. 

This year when I got my taxes back, it said that they were taking out the $1600 to pay that federal loan back. I was perfectly fine with that because it needed to be done anyway. 

It got me thinking though, how does this show on my credit report? I was thinking that it would help by showing the loan as paid and not hurting me in that way anymore. Then, I got to wondering if it shows specifically that it was basically garnished and report more negatively than positive.

We are eager to start a family pretty much immediately following our Nov wedding so we are thinking about our forever (hopefully) home.  

Financially this is where we stand: We are getting married later this year and planning our wedding &amp; honeymoon ($16K).  We are both employed full-time with a household income of about $115K.  My fiancé does work for a start-up that is in the process of obtaining Series B funding so there is the risk that if it did not come through she could possibly be out of a job.  She does however have a great resume with several options to fall back on and the start-up she works for also has a non-profit Foundation she would likely continue to work for if Series B did not pan out.  We are typically pretty stable financially, $5-$10k in savings, $50k for retirement, and about $125k in stocks. My fiance also has student loans she pays on monthly with an income based repayment plan- we plan to increase these payments once her job is sorted out but wanted to wait as if she did end up working for the non-profit she has the potential of a 10 year forgiveness under IBR repayment.  Our debt is current mortgage (152K), lease on our car and her student loans (60K).   

 Our current neighborhood is extremely rental friendly-almost every house on our block is a rental.  The owners of the house next door put out a sign two months early when their tenants were moving, and had to take it down right away due to the volume of inquiries to move in right away.  In short I don't think we will have a problem renting it out.  We plan to stay local, but move to a more family friendly area.

We were considering using a rental management company, neither of us are really interested in being a landlord.  We found a company that takes one month rent in fees, plus $65 per month (about 7%).  A friend of ours who is in a similar situation rents their condo, and said for tax purposes it's actually better to take a minor loss annually.  I'd have to inquire more about that, but I'm looking for outside advice.

The next question is about 20% down payment, closing costs, and renovations/changes we would like.   I've always imagined the stocks to be used for a down payment, but now that its getting closer it seems scary to take out a serious chunk of change, but it will take years to save up enough cash on hand, and meanwhile interest rates could go up, and our family may outgrow our current home.

Our plans have been accelerated because we found a house that we are interested in, it has an uncommon floor plan for the area that makes it really appealing to us.  We haven't moved ahead with seriously looking until we figure out what to do with our current house.  The problem is that we don't really like the kitchen, and would prefer to convert it from oil to gas, which could add up to a big expense up front.   We are entertaining cheaper kitchen remodels than custom cabinetry to save money. The monthly cost of the house will be roughly the same, or even cheaper (20% down, no pmi, better interest rates) than our current house, which I could afford on my income alone.

We are concerned that we have a lot of planned expenses upcoming, with a bit of financial uncertainty with my fiance’s job.  Should we be entertaining the idea of a new house, or put it off for a couple more years but run the risk of interest rates and home values increasing?",finance,1361801247

abney and associates technology warning hong kong Experts: China heeft gehackt meeste van Washington

Beginnen met het stellen van veiligheidsdeskundigen die krachtige Washington de instellingen zijn doorgedrongen zijn door Chinese cyberspies, en dit is de gebruikelijke antwoord: bijna alle van hen.

De lijst van degenen die in de afgelopen jaren gehackt omvat advocatenkantoren, denktanks, nieuwsorganisaties, rechten van de mensgroepen, aannemers, Congres kantoren, ambassades en federale agentschappen.

De informatie aangetast door dergelijke indringers, veiligheidsdeskundigen zeggen, zou genoeg te wijzen hoe de macht wordt uitgeoefend in Washington tot op zekere opmerkelijk genuanceerd. De enige vraag, zeggen zij, is of de Chinezen hebben de analytische middelen door de massale troves van gegevens ze elke dag stelen te sorteren.

""The dark secret is er is niet zoiets als een veilige niet-geclassificeerde netwerk,"" zei James Lewis, een cyberveiligheid expert bij het Center for Strategic and International Studies, die in het verleden is gehackt. ""Advocatenkantoren, denktanks, Kranten--als er iets van belang, u moet ervan uitgaan dat u hebt is doorgedrongen.""

De toenemende golf van cyber-spionage diplomatieke speling heeft geproduceerd en praten over actie tegen de Chinezen, die vastberaden betrokkenheid in hacken campagnes hebben ontkend. Een strategiedocument uitgebracht door de Obama-administratie woensdag verlangt dat mogelijk handelssancties. Cyberspying op wat kan worden genoemd de ""informatie industrie"" verschilt van hacks tegen traditionele economische doelstellingen, zoals Lockheed Martin, Coca-Cola en Apple, wiens computersystemen bevatten waardevolle intellectuele eigendom die Chinese industriële of militaire vermogens bijwonen kon.

In plaats daarvan, journalisten, advocaten en mensenrechten werknemers hebben vaak toegang tot politieke actoren wier communicatie kan bieden inzicht te popelen om te begrijpen hoe Washington werkt Chinese inlichtingendiensten. Hackers zoekt vaak voor de onzichtbare krachten die zou kunnen verklaren hoe de administratie een probleem benadert deskundigen zeggen, met vele Chinese ambtenaren vermoeden dat verslagen van tanks of nieuwsorganisaties in het geheim het werk van de ambtenaren van de overheid zijn--zoveel als ze zou in Peking.

""Ze proberen te maken van verbindingen tussen vooraanstaande personen die bij denktanks, prominente donoren die ze hebben gehoord werken van en hoe de regering neemt besluiten,"" zei Dan Blumenthal, directeur van de Aziatische studies voor het American Enterprise Institute, die ook is gehackt. ""Het is een geavanceerde intelligentie-zichverzamelende inspanning op proberen te maken van menselijke netwerk verbanden van mensen aan de macht, of ze nu in Congres of de uitvoerende macht."" Rusland en enkele andere naties ook wordt gezegd om deel te nemen in cyber-spionage tegen privé-ondernemingen en instellingen, maar veiligheidsdeskundigen en ambtenaren van de V.S. zeggen van China inspanning is de meest agressieve en uitgebreide. De informatie technologie staven van privé-groepen hebben krabbelde te neutraliseren het binnendringen, vaak buiten specialisten inhuren om te verdrijven hackers en het installeren van controlesystemen om hen uit.

Maar dergelijke inspanningen doen niet altijd lukt, veiligheid deskundigen zeggen, zoals hackers vaak geheime 'backdoor' toegang tot computersystemen te bouwen of hun inspanningen verdubbelen om te penetreren weer zodra ze hebt is gezuiverd.

Not long after The Wall Street Journal gerapporteerd vorige maand dat de systemen geïnfiltreerd had geweest, de chief executive van het moederbedrijf, Rupert Murdoch, tweeted, ""Chinees nog steeds ons hacken of werden tijdens het weekend."" De New York Times en The Washington Post ook gemeld dat slachtoffers van cyber-inbraken blijkbaar uitgevoerd door de Chinezen.

Het voormalige hoofd van cyberveiligheid onderzoeken voor de FBI, Shawn Henry, zei zijn stoffen die worden gebruikt om te waarschuwen tientallen bedrijven en particuliere instellingen over schendingen elke week, met Chinese hackers de meest voorkomende verdachten.

""Ik heb nog komen over een netwerk dat niet heeft geschonden,"" zei Henry, nu president van CrowdStrike Services, een bedrijf van de veiligheid. ""Het is alsof je een onzichtbare man in uw kamer, gaan door uw archiefkasten.""

De opkomst van doordringende cyber-spionage heeft gevolgd bredere technologische veranderingen: meer en meer informatie is verzameld en online overgebracht. Stijgende rekenkracht, ondertussen, heeft meer van het kwetsbaar aan hakkers bijna overal in de wereld. Dit heeft dramatisch de kosten van spionage--traditioneel een arbeidsintensieve streven dat het risico van een arrestatie of slechter draagt--verlaagd en maakte meer instellingen haalbare doelstellingen.

De Chinese regering heeft consequent geweigerd het soort agressieve cyber-spionage campagne vaak beschreven door westerse ambtenaren en veiligheidsdeskundigen, aanroepen van dergelijke beweringen onverantwoord en wordt niet ondersteund door bewijzen.

Deze week, betwist Chinese ambtenaren een verslag van Mandiant, een bedrijf van beveiliging op basis van Alexandrië, waarin de Chinese militaire eenheid naar verluidt verantwoordelijk voor stealing honderden terabytes aan gegevens van 141 organisaties in 20 bedrijfstakken.

Maar officiële Washington spreekt weinig twijfel over de bron van het probleem. ""De Chinese overheid directe rol in de cybertheft heerst, en de problemen zijn gegroeid exponentieel,"" zei Rep Mike Rogers, R -Michigan, voorzitter van het Comité van de intelligentie van het huis. ""Het is van cruciaal belang dat de administratie bilaterale discussies om ervoor te zorgen dat Beijing begrijpt zijn er gevolgen voor economische spionage state-sponsored beginnen.""

De gerapporteerde inbreken in computersystemen voor de Post op een typische manier gebeurd: een werknemer viel voor mensen die bekend zijn met het incident, die sprak op voorwaarde van anonimiteit om niet openbaar door het bedrijf vrijgegeven details te bespreken wat deskundigen noemen een ""spearphishing"" scam, een nep link die een schadelijk programma gedownload en het bedrijf informatie technologie server, besmet raken zei. (Post Co. ambtenaren hebben bevestigd dat de hack alleen in het algemeen.)

Dat eerste inbraak, dat in 2008 of 2009 gebeurde, toegestaan de hackers toegang te krijgen tot de Post directory van gebruikersnamen, wachtwoorden en computers die gebruikmaken van Windows-besturingssystemen. Mensen met kennis van de infiltratie zei dat het bedrijf geleerd van het toen Mandiant een brief stuurde in 2011 rapporteren dat het een Post computer communiceren met een computer op het systeem van een van de Mandiant van klanten had ontdekt.

De Post later huurde Mandiant tot uitzetting van de hackers en geïnstalleerd geavanceerde controlesystemen om een herhaling te voorkomen. Experts zeggen dat het is moeilijk voor een bedrijf om te weten definitief wat informatie hakkers stelen terwijl zij toegang tot computersystemen hebben--vooral als de diefstal gebeurde maanden of jaren voordat het werd ontdekt.

Nieuws van The Post infiltratie, eerst deze maand, geopenbaard gealarmeerd Texas-based religieuze rechten van de mensactivist Bob Fu. Pas in December, had hij verkregen van een gevoelig document Chinese en doorgegeven langs per e-mail aan een Post correspondent in Peking. Het resulterende verhaal met de naam Fu maar niet oorspronkelijke bron van het document binnen China, die Fu zei kon worden tegengehouden als ontdekt.

Een geassocieerde deelneming werken voor China hulp was korte tijd vastgehouden na het verhaal verscheen en werd ondervraagd over het document. Het is niet duidelijk als alle informatie die was verkregen wordt uit Fu's e-mail uitwisseling met de Post correspondent, dat plaatsvond nadat het bedrijf computersysteem werd beveiligd.

""Oh mijn goedheid, dat maakt me een beetje bezwete,"" zei Fu, verwijzend naar het incident. ""De gevolgen zou zo ondraaglijk.""

Dissidenten hebben lang betrokken bij cat-and-mouse games met de Chinese autoriteiten, accepteren dat veel van hun telefoongesprekken en e-mails worden gecontroleerd terwijl nog steeds probeert te beschermen hun meest gevoelige communicatie tegen interceptie.

Canadese onderzoekers in 2009 ontdekt een enorme mondiale cyber-spionage netwerk gecontroleerd grotendeels door servers in China. De militaire en politieke doelstellingen waarvan netwerken werden gecontroleerd--met inbegrip van de Tibetaanse regering in ballingschap en het Bureau van de Dalai Lama--sterk een Chinese rol in de labelactie voorgesteld. Onder de 1,295 computers besmet in 103 landen waren verschillende behoren tot het bureau van de Associated Press in Londen, volgens de onderzoekers, die met de SecDev groep en het Munk centrum voor internationale Studies aan de Universiteit van Toronto waren.

Dergelijke infiltraties hebben haar de Chinese dissident Gemeenschap, waar de beschuldigingen van spionage gemeenschappelijk zijn, zei Andrew Nathan, een Columbia University professor actief in verschillende rechten van de mensgroepen die werken aan China gerelateerde. ""Er is een paranoia dat wordt ingesteld in,"" zei hij. ""Dat kan zijn een van de functies van dit toezicht.""

Security experts zeggen dat, terwijl de verdediging worden steeds meer verfijnd tegen cyber-spionage, hackers blijven verbeteren van hun vaardigheden ook. Maar als buitenlandse agenten toegang krijgen tot montage palen van gegevens kunnen, zij een inlichtingendiensten overal bekend probleem onder ogen zien: wat te doen met het?

""De meesten van ons niet erg interessant allermeest naar de tijd,"" zei Thomas Fingar, een China-deskundige en voormalig voorzitter van de nationale Raad van de intelligentie. ""U kunt een enorme hoeveelheid tijd en moeite in verwarring brengende afval over iets dat is totaal zinloos.""

I am currently employed as a part time worker at a big box retailer, living with my parents, and trying to save up for school. I average an income of only about $800-$900 every 4 weeks (it varies depending on how many hours I get), however after the few living expenses I have, I'm able to pocket atleast 50% of that every month. Right now, I have $9200 sitting in a non interest bearing checking account with a local bank.

I plan on using this money for higher education, which I actually haven't started, and only plan on doing so this fall at the local community college. At that point, I'll transfer to a large state university (hopefully UT). Anyway, I guess I'm looking for something that bears a bit more interest, yet isn't too risky (from what I've read online, would looking at government bonds be a good idea?)

-----

I'll *try* to keep this as brief as possible while including the most details I can think of.

First, a little background for the unfamiliar: I'm active duty military. My pay grade is E6 and I have been in for 6 years and ~11 months (7 years in April). I have *never* been at my ""maximum"" target weight for the military ever since enlisting but I have pretty much always been below the maximum body fat percentage of 22. (It usually hovers around 17 to 18). When I changed duty stations, the stress of being separated from my fiancée for nearly two years (now my wife) and my resulting complete lack of will to do anything led me to push that number up to 24% for two physical readiness tests in a row (one every six months). In the military, if you fail an exercise performance test *or* a physical readiness test three times within four years, it's an automatic separation, NO waiver. There are less options in this situation than if you were caught smoking pot at work. If you have less than six years in the service, you are kicked out within 13 days with no involuntary separation pay. Period. No redemption. This time is supposed to be spent taking care of paperwork to have your possessions moved back home and any other administrative work required for separation. Luckily in my case, my command has the *option* of extending that to six months, but they've usually limited it to one month for everyone else I've seen separated involuntarily. I *am* entitled to half the amount of involuntary separation pay (full amount is reserved for things such as medical discharge or overmanning a.k.a. getting ""laid off"" from the military). The cost of moving back to my home of record is covered by the military. I am 99.9999% sure I get to keep my GI bill benefits, but I'll have to confirm that later.

There is another catch: I re-enlisted about three years ago for six more years. I was given half of my re-enlistment bonus pay up front, as well as a portion of it every October. I will have to pay a certain amount of that back.

* [Here is my current budget.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjbCTtrTc0AAdFA5elVIYjlDVm5aZkxZYzJSYXpmUlE&amp;usp=sharing) Page two shows my current bills and pay as well as what I **estimate** it would cost me to live at minimal needs while trying to find full time employment.
* [Here is my re-enlistment bonus info, including the amount I would have to pay if I were to get kicked out *today.*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjbCTtrTc0AAdEJpQ0hXTURNR1JXQlJrb3B3S2pCLVE&amp;usp=sharing) (The daily pay-back drops a dollar or so around every ten minutes.) The numbers in blue are my involuntary separation pay and the difference I would receive after paying off the re-enlistment bonus.

I also have a few things working against me:

* I have no degree. I am an almost completely self taught software developer and this was my job before I enlisted. I was *lucky* to land the job I had before by demonstrating my capability to the engineers I ended up working with despite having no professional accreditation of my skill. Everything I have is based on experience. (Because of this, the military has actually treated me very well as far as promotions are concerned...)
* I will be moving back to a very rural west Michigan area, which currently has the fifth highest unemployment rate in the U.S.
* My wife is Japanese. While she can speak English, she doesn't understand a lot of what other people say so finding work for her would be very difficult if not impossible.
* I have *zero* personal savings (spent it all digging out of as much debt as I could) and our current family savings is $810.
* My credit score, last I checked, was atrocious. Anywhere between 532 and 674 depending on the agency. This was due to a lot of bad decisions I made when I was in my early 20s. I'm 29 so a lot of the things are still on my credit report. That said, I have also received reports that the numbers have slightly increased, and paying off my car should have helped, too.

Positives:

* I have a top secret clearance with SCI eligibility that is not set to expire for another four years. This makes it *so much easier* to find federal agency employment.

gaming,The possibility of swapping from the xbox to playstation during the next gen.,"So we all saw the Ps4 conference, and being a big microsoft xbox fanboy, I was impressed. Despite xbox being on the back foot at the moment because they haven't yet shared anything with the public; i'm already starting to doubt my loyalty to my over heating, fragile shell of a games console. 

I've constantly backed up microsoft, despite having to send off my xboxs for repairs on several occasions. 
Even the fact that we have to pay for xbox live, which entitles us to play with our friends and not a lot else really.

But what's finally tipped me over the edge tonight is this amazing sale on xbox live. 

""Oh, guys, bioshock is now only £5! What an amazing discount! RIGHT!?""

For gods sake microsoft, give us something we want to play, for a price that we don't have to sell our kidneys to afford. 

It's going to take something special for microsoft to pull out the bag in my opinion. They need to re-evaluate their approach to the gaming community.

TL;DR

I'm receiving my tax returns today and I want to pay down my CC debt.  I have built up debt over the past year from using my CC at college to pay for the necessary needs.  2 of the three cards are almost maxed out around the following::: ($2400/$2500 -- $950/$1000 -- $650/$2000).  

I pay on time, but I know having these limits this high isn't good for me at all.  I have the opportunity to use my tax return to pay them them down a bit (around $1500 to $2000 to use).

http://i.imgur.com/mvqjI3Z.png

1. We need to pay off these student loans (~$13,000). We have no other debt since we currently rent-to-own our house, own our cars, and paid off the credit card two months ago. We're currently paying off $200/month on these loans.
2. We want to save for a 20% down payment for a $186K house (~$40,000 is the goal and we're up to $6,600). We currently pay $600/month in rent, which goes into a savings account that will be the down payment when we have enough money in there (the house was in our family and it's paid off, so it's a big favor for them to let us live there ""rent free"" until we can purchase the home). Estimating the mortgage payment will be ~$1,500/month (20-year, fixed rate) when we do buy the house, I want to make sure we can afford that payment earlier by increasing our rent payments to $1,500 for at least 4-5 months before we take the plunge.

Does it make more sense, based on the interest rate of this loan, to:

- Pay off the loans first by increasing payments to ~$600/month, while still only contributing $600/month to the down payment? (loan first)
- Contribute ~$800/month to the down payment, and ~$300/month to the loan? (split)
- Contribute ~$1,000/month to the down payment and keep making minimum $200/month payments on the loan? (house first)",finance,1361902053

First off, here is my current situation:

* Car loan | $360/month minimum, with about $9,000 still owed
* Student Loan 1 | $50/month minimum, with $500 still owed
* Student Loan 2 | $100/month minimum, with $8,000+ still owed
* Credit card debt | $19/month minimum, with $1,800 owed

Here's how I got here - I've been paying on **Student Loan 1** for a long time, and then just got my $1,000 tax return and put $500 from that down on this loan. This took the loan from $1,000 owed to $500. My plan was to use all of this money to pay off the loan, but then my car brakes went out, and I had to put $1,800 down on a credit card to pay for the repairs. Now I'm trying to determine what the best course of action long-term would be for what to do with this other $500. Should I...

1. Put it down on the credit card to take it from $1,800 to $1,300
2. Put it towards the rest of **Student Loan 1**, paying it off completely.
3. Put it towards my car
4. Open a new savings account (I don't have one right now) and start it off with $500 cash. 

I am leaning towards opening a savings account, because I'm sick of having to use credit cards every time there's a car repair or other emergency. If I had a savings account, I'd have emergency money to draw from instead of having to use credit. Then again, I could go ahead and pay off the rest of **Student Loan 1** and be done with it, never having to make another payment again, thus opening up available money to me.

Any advice?

Thanks!

personalfinance,"27 and Finishing Grad School - Questions about collections, savings, and impending unemployment.","I’m 27, finishing my MA (public policy) in May, and looking for advice on how to use my savings to best prepare myself for impending unemployment, the job search, and my intermediate future. Here's the breakdown of my current financial situation:

**Debts**:

* ~$32,000 in subsidized student loans to the fed between 4-6%.
* ~$6,000 in Perkins loans to my grad school @ 5%.
* Both can be deferred until 01/2014.


**Accounts in Collections** according to the 3 majors:

* $360 opened on 12/1/2009.
* $514 opened on 3/1/2010.
* $436 opened on 12/1/2011.
* $355 opened on 9/1/2007.

These are all from things that took place between the years of 2006 and 2008. I dropped out of undergrad, made some bad decisions for a bit, and generally acted like an asshole. There's a cable bill, department store card, a cell phone bill, and something else. I don't know which one is which.

**The Good**:

* $10,000 in a standard savings account.
* No credit card debt (I've got 2 cards w/ a combined limit of $3,000 @ ~18%).
* $1,300 tax return on the way. I'll probably save around ~$1,000 of it.

**Current Income and Overhead until the end of May**

* $1,500/mo graduate stipend. Last check comes May 1st. 
* $500/mo rent &amp; utilities.
* $110/mo cell phone bill for both my father and I. 
* $35/mo gym.
* $200/mo groceries.
* $150/mo gas and insurance.
* I'll blow between $50-200/mo on drinks, depending on how I feel. Rest goes to savings. 

The income goes away in June. Rent will probably go up between $100 and $150 as my girlfriend and I move to an area closer to her grad school, but it's in a highly urbanized area and the cost will be partially offset with savings in gas and insurance. The fun will need to be heavily curtailed as well, of course. I'm hoping to get away with laying out less than $1,000/mo in expenses until I find a big boy job.

**My questions to r/personalfinance!**

* Is $10k in the bank enough to keep me afloat through the stereotypical job search? Should I try to pick up a part time gig stuffing envelopes or something during the downtime as well? Do I need to bump up my rate of savings between now and then? Or is it too much? Should I invest some of it? If so, what's the best vehicle for my situation?

* Nothing would make me happier than to make these collections disappear or to put some makeup on them, at least. But with my income being eliminated can I afford it? I don't want a bad credit report to scare potential employers. I also plan on making a wife out of my lovely lady soon and I want to bring as little financial negativity to the table as possible.

personalfinance,Deciding which bill to pay down first. Would really appreciate the advice.,"I recently earned a new job with about $500 more monthly take home than my previous employment. I wanted to throw that extra $500 at one of two debts. I need help in what is the right action:

On my credit card, I owe $1600 at about a 14% APR, my min. payment is  $35.00 a month.

Logic dictates I should pay down the bill with the higher interest rate. However, if I pay down the alma matter debt, I could quickly elimitate the higher montly payments in 4 months. Then turn my attention to my credit card. Essentially:

Should I pay $650 (500 CC +150 AM) for the first few months. Or $535 (35 CC + 500 AM)? The extra cash would be nice, as I'm saying to move out of my parents place (recently out of college). Thanks!

I am 24. Credit score (according to creditkarma.com) is 753.

I signed up for a credit card through my bank (5/3rd bank) 5-6 years back. It was free and there was no real downside to it. I have never missed a payment, and I really only use it for $5 here and $10 there. 

1-2 years ago, I closed my savings and checking accounts at 5/3rd bank and opened an account at a local credit union, because of fees 5/3rd was charging for accounts and the other basic benefits of joining a credit union. Also have a small account at Honda Federal Credit Union, which keeps like $10. I did not close my credit card account at 5/3rd and still use it every couple months for something small that is paid off almost instantly by me.

Recently, 5/3rd have changed my rates on the card and they are now charging me a fee for the card on a yearly basis whether I use it or not. I get ""points"" based on how much I purchase with the card, but it's not really all that exciting (read: junk with one or two *okay* things that I can redeem for). 

Lastly, I don't even like going into a 5/3rd bank location anymore. The whole *vibe* seems different than a credit union.

Is it a good idea to close this credit card? I want a nicer card with better benefits anyway (redeem for flying miles or other benefits). This doesn't need to be said, but I'm gonna say it anyway: I will shop around for the next credit card and get the best option available for my situation.

personalfinance,Marital finances are in a constant unnecessary crisis - WSID?,"Dear Reddit,

I'm a 37-year old man, married with two children, and my wife and I are coming up on our 10th wedding anniversary.  Our marriage has not been without problems, but we're working on most of them diligently.

One problem that seems intractable, however, is how we handle money in our marriage.  I'm a self-employed freelancer, so my income is not predictable, but I generally make good money for someone with a BA who works at home.  My wife was in graduate school for the first few years of our marriage, then working part-time in her chosen field for not terribly much money.  

We never really talked about our expectations regarding money/finances before we got married - I was raised in a two-income family where my mom actually made more than my dad, while she was raised in more of a ""breadwinner"" household (mom worked, but never full time and was home with the kids until they were in elementary school).  I think we each expected our own upbringing to be the model for our marriage. 

Back when she was in graduate school and before the crash of 2008, I made significantly more money than we had expenses so I covered the bills with enough left over to have an emergency fund and fund our retirement accounts every year.  We considered 100% of her income to be savings, and kept it in a seperate account.

Now the situation is different - my industry almost completely dried up in 2009, and is only recovering now, and we went deep into our savings for the downpayment on our house just before that.  Meanwhile, she is coming into her earning potential and making more than I do.  I also get paid extremely sporadically - I might go three months without a cent and then get a check for a third of my yearly total.  With two children and a house, our expenses are also much higher than they used to be.

The trouble is that my wife still considers 100% of her income to be ""savings,"" and deposits her paychecks in an interest-free checking account that she doesn't actually have a checkbook for.  Meanwhile, our household expenses (bills, nothing extravagent) ran to approximately 200% of my pre-tax income last year. Every time I ask her to transfer money to the joint account, we have a huge fight where she accuses me of ""being wasteful with money,"" not being able to ""provide for the family"" and says that she's ""going to have to step in and save this sinking ship.""

The fights are so aversive that I frequently chicken out and take cash advances from the overdraft account or a credit card to pay our bills.  As a result, we now have three nearly maxed-out accounts totalling around $25,000 at between 9% and 13% while we have ~$45,000 in the ""savings account.""  The one concession I do make to savings is that I overpay the mortgage to the tune of one extra principal payment per year.  I haven't written an IRA check in 5 years, and we have no college savings accounts for our children.

She is now starting to talk about taking vacations (which we never do) and spending several thousand dollars on redecorating projects in our house, and when I say we can't afford them, she counters that she's almost 40 and it's time to start living like adults.  I learned to build furniture (which I enjoy) in order to head off a dining room set purchase, and will be illegally renovating our bathroom myself to save on that, but I can't do everything and work and be there for my family.  I should add that other than the above, neither of us are big spenders on luxuries.

I've tried proposing that she make a recurring monthly contribution to the joint account, but she flatly refuses.  As it actually ends up, however, she and I end up putting in about the same amount per year - the difference is that it's a recurring fight rather than an agreement; I never have a cent to my name that I feel OK to spend (my deposits are immediately fed to the roaring fire of our bills and credit card debt); while she feels safe having the number in that checking account being comfortably high.

Yesterday I reached a breaking point - I went all of January and February without transferring any money from her account, and put $12,000 on the credit cards to cover the shortfall.  It wasn't enough, and I bounced our mortgage check yesterday.  I still have time to fix things with the bank as it was before the due date, but I can't stand worrying about money all the time when we actually have enough money to cover our expenses if we weren't manufacturing this ongoing crisis.

I need to find a way to make my wife understand that I will never make enough money to cover even our expenses as they stand now, and find a way to renegotiate how money works in our marriage so we can be financially secure.

(numbers involved: I make $60-$80k pre-tax (but I pay SE tax so my rate is high), although in my worst year, 2009, I made only $20k.  She was making $16k-$20k/year but made $55k last year and is now on track to make $80k or more (W2) in 2013.  Household expenses for 2012 were around $110k - major metropolitan area so it doesn't go as far as you'd think, especially with two young children who need care while we work.)

**TL;DR:** My wife who makes more than me puts 100% of her salary into an interest-free ""savings"" account that I don't have access to; I don't make nearly enough to cover our bills; and this arrangement is pushing us deep into totally unnecessary debt.  What should I do?",finance,1361892407

EDIT:

I finally got through to their phone system, but after over an hour of waiting and no one picking up I decided to use their automated system which I really didn't want to do since there isn't any paper trail about the payment other than the withdraw posting to my bank account.  Hopefully they will get their shit together and I can use the online system next month.  In the mean time I'm going to contact every single person mentioned in this thread and complain.

Its absurd to me that my loans would be sold to some company that cannot handle the increase in traffic.

The mint forum received this post from a KSA employee for anyone interested:


*Dear mint.com users,* 


*I do want you to know that I have been monitoring all of your comments and passing them on to management. Please believe me when I say that they are not falling on deaf ears. And, quite frankly, we do not begrudge you the right to voice and file your complaints. While we certainly do not excuse the inconveniences that you have been experiencing, for all of the planning, preparation, and training we at KSA have undergone, several things have occurred both inside and outside of our control that have drastically affected our ability to provide the quality customer service we are so determined to deliver. Those issues are being worked on as expediently as humanly possible, including the problems with the phone line licenses (why you are receiving a fast busy or call back later message or not getting through at all). However, these issues will not be resolved overnight. We are also requiring mandatory overtime for staff, utilizing back-up staff to assist with the call volume, and performing additional document processing and e-mail queue work on the weekend. This will continue until all issues are resolved and servicing reaches an acceptable level.*


*If you submitted payments to your previous servicer, it will take 60 to 90 days post-conversion for the payments to be posted to your account and will reflect the date the payment was made. Likewise for forms and paperwork. If your paperwork was submitted to KSA and has been received by us, it is being worked in the order in which it was received and processing will reflect that date. Specifically, the correspondence queue currently being worked is on Feb. 1st; the repayment plan queue (e.x. IBR processing) is on February 2nd; the e-mail queue is on February 8th; and the deferment/forbearance queue is on Feb. 18th. Call wait time is still very high, due in part to this problem with phone line licenses, but if you do get through - I *strongly* encourage you to select the option to receive a call back to the number from which you dialed. It may take 24 hours to receive a call back.* 


*Finally, please note that KSA does NOT charge late fees and has no plans to do so unless mandated by the Department of Ed.* 


*If I can be of any other general assistance, I am happy to do so. And again, I apologize for our failure to deliver high quality customer service from the start.*


*Sincerely,*

Question 1

Linda is considering signing up for a pension plan. She will make monthly payment of $850 starting one month from today. The pension will earn an effective rate of 3.5% per month. She plans to contribute for 18 years, then right after the last payment she expects to retire. Assuming the effective interest rate is 3% per month, how much will Linda receive per month for 12 years from the pension fund after retirement (assume that the first payment she will receive starting one month after she retires)?

Question 2

Golden Age Communication Inc. has two different bonds outstanding. Bond A has a face value of $1000, 15 years to maturity, no coupon payment over the remaining 15 years, and a discount rate of 4.75% /year. Bond B has a face value of $1000, 12 years to maturity, semi-annual coupon payment schedule, a coupon rate of 7.1%, and a price of $973.73. Calculate the price for bond A and the effective annual yield to maturity for bond B, respectively.

Question 3

David has just arranged to purchase a $580,000 house in Vancouver, with a 9% down payment. The mortgage has a 4.8% stated annual interest rate compounded semi-annually, and calls for equal monthly payment over the next 20 years.

a) What is the monthly payment of the above mortgage?

b) Calculate the balance of the principal outstanding at the beginning of the fifth month.

c) Assuming that the mortgage rate remains at 4.8% for the remaining time of the mortgage, after you have paid 50% of your monthly payments, what is the amount remaining to be paid on the interest?",finance,1361836802
personalfinance,"Might be a FAQ, but I don't see it in the sidebar: how to use credit JUST enough for a good credit score?","I’ve been making massive payments to everyone I’ve owed money to over the past few years, and I’m damn proud.  Paid off a medical provider, the taxman, and two smaller cards and closed them.

Just got a personal loan at a low interest rate with a former credit union (now a bank) that consolidates my remaining credit (which was all pretty high-interest) at a 8% interest rate.  I’m on the homestretch to being consumer debt-free, hopefully by the end of the year, and it feels great.

My question is this, though.  In an ideal world, I wouldn’t use my credit card at all, but they’d keep it open for me and wouldn’t reduce my credit line or credit rating, so that I’d have it there in case of emergency.  We all know that’s not the way credit card companies work, though.

So … I have a credit card.  I’d like to use it enough to preserve my credit line and build/keep a good credit rating.  (Especially important because I rent, and won't be buying for a while.)  However, other than that necessary usage, I’d like to use it minimally.

Any tips, good resources, etc. on how to walk that fine line?

I'm in a little bit of a predicament. My lease for my Chevy Cruze is coming up and I'll be in the market to buying a used car in the next 5-7 months. I've poked around some subreddits looking for the answer and I haven't really found a clear answer yet....




A little back information 23, making 39,000 after tax a year. Monthly take home after 5% into 401k, 5% into Roth IRA and all expenditures (rent,car,food everything I spend money on) is $1,300. Right now I have $11,000 in retirement investments accounts $15,000 in a savings account and $8,000 in my checking account.  I have two credit cards that I pay in full monthly, I did my CreditKarma credit check and it came out to be 734ish (not sure if this is 100%). I'm going to pull the trigger and get my first real check tonight or tomorrow night. 




But here is the ordeal, I'm looking to buy a used car in the $10,000 - $18,000 range. I'm not 100% on the type of car I'm going to get, leaning more to a small commuter car like a JettaTDI/Golf TDI or a Civic.




I want to keep a $10,000ish fall back emergency fund. So If everything goes right in 5 months I'll have at most $19,000 in cash to spend.




With the cars being in that $19,000 range would it make sense to just walk in with cash on the last day of the month and ask a few thousand less then what they have listed? 




Should I pay 20% with cash and take out a loan for the rest?




Should I pay 50% with cash and take out a loan for the rest?



Just try getting a low interest rate loan for the whole thing?

I have already repayed $134 (not a lot but every bit counts).  I discontinued my studies in December 2012 but am returning to a different institution in the fall of this year.  

My monthly payment is $184 but right now I am in my ""grace period"" and I have to start making payments on July 1st.  I will accumulate $338 in interest during this time (I am planning to have paid that off, and a little more).  

I am applying for student loans again for the fall and my program cost will be about $8000 plus housing, food, etc which will bring the total for the first year up to around 16,000 so about 32,000 for the two year course.  I will only get about %60 of this covered by the student loans, the rest I have to save myself. So I need ~$6400 per year.  My parents have $7000 dollars saved for me that we dip into when we don't have money to pay for my school stuff.

Right now I work part time making barely $500 a pay period ($11.50 an hour).  I'm hoping to get a job with the City here and earn $12.45 (it's a student summer job which starts in May.  There's no way for sure to say that I've got it right now but I thin there's a strong possibility as there are 15 spots and only 6 people showed up for the job fair. anyway)

personalfinance,The financial situation of college kid who makes ~$800/month,"Hey guys. I know very little about the financial world and every time I try to attempt to organize my finances my head starts spinning. I am just going to list all the information I know and see what anyone thinks of anything.

I earn ~$940 a month as a TA in college. Every month I have ~$80 withheld for federal taxes and ~$45 withheld for state taxes, for a total of ~$125 withheld monthly. In the end I get ~$810 in my bank every 15th. I pay rent of $375/mo, have utilities and cell phone bills run around $130/mo, try to budget $200/mo for groceries and $100/mo for savings.

Now I don't know a thing about taxes. I'm pretty sure I have the maximum being withheld and I'd be entitled to a refund (maybe not), but I have never filed and wouldn't know where to start really. My W2 for 2012 I made ~$7085 (box 1) with federal taxes withheld ~$490 (box 2) and state income taxes ~$355 (box 17) (I worked a second job and only TAed for the second half of 2012).

I owe Sallie Mae ~$8000 in unsubsidized loans at 6.8% (no clue what the time rate of that is) and ~$11000 in subsidized loans at 3.4%. I will be graduating May 2014 and hopefully going to grad school, but will probably need to take out more loans next year. I know I've had a few medical accounts go to collection, but I have no clue what I owe or how to find out since they don't contact me anymore. I never looked into my credit score due to paranoia. I had a car in my name (which I never drove, basically I should have never put it in my name) and a family member got a few tickets in the car and never paid them so some of that also went to collections in my name (red light violation).

With all this in mind my simple question is what do I do with this $100/mo savings. Do I open a savings account (I have a free student checking account with no minimum with the bank of TCF)? Do I put it towards my debt (Pay off Sallie Mae or start saving for next years tuition so I can only accept subsidized loans)? Half/half? Are there better alternatives? Or maybe this is so insignificant I should just put it away for emergencies (I don't think this should be the case but again I know zip)?

investing,"A couple of tax tips, feel free to add your own","A plea, really:

1: never invest in anything that reports with a K1.  Just don't do it.  These are mostly partnerships and some commodities ETFs.  Quoth investopedia:

&gt;The Schedule K-1 tends to have a reputation for being one of the last tax documents to be received by the taxpayer when gathering all of their tax documents to file the federal return. To add insult to the wait, the Schedule K-1 can be quite complex and require multiple entries on the taypayer's federal return, including such entries on the Schedule A, Schedule B, Schedule D and in some cases Form 6781.

K-1s are always late.  They are also often wrong and you get a corrected version RIGHT after you finish your return with the erroneous K1.  6781 is a bitch.  It can also complicate your schedule E in addition to A B and D.  You go to a tax preparer with some a W2, a few 1099s, and some other crap, you can be out of there in an hour for $100.  Bust out the K1s and I guarantee your bill will triple at least.  There's nothing like a $500 accountant bill to wipe out a year of good returns.

2: beware DRIP in a taxable account.  I saw a guy the other day who'd been reinvesting dividends in some utility company since the 70s.  He retired recently and began selling the stock.  Thing is, his original broker from the 70s had been bought out resold and the original records had changed hands so many times it took Herculean efforts to track down the cost basis of his 100+ tax lots.  I'm well aware of the ""power of compounding interest and dividends"" thank you.  If you're going to invest in taxable accounts make sure you take your int/div in CASH and then repurchase stocks maybe once a year.  And finally

3: keep good records.  If you're going to buy and sell in taxable accounts for FSM sake you have to keep good records.  It isn't hard: a simple excel spreadsheet, or better yet, a google cloud spreadsheet, will do.  Date acquired, ticker, number of shares, price paid, price sold, profit (loss).  Done.  Whenever you get a tax doc in the mail from anyone stick it inside a folder labeled ""[this year] tax documents"" any put it in a file cabinet.

I see you kids talking about random crap you buy and sell all the time and I don't think you guys are fully aware of the consequences.  Taking a few minutes to understand your taxes, and the taxes of the securities you buy, can save you seriously big bucks and a lot of headache (for you and your friendly neighborhood tax preparer).",finance,1361932148

economy,Beyond Sequester,"Beyond Sequester

By Steven Mller on February 28, 2013 1:48 am / 		http://www.dailycensored.com/beyond-sequester/

 Thinking Outside the Box
                                 Beyond Sequester

In Spanish, the word “sequester” (sequestrar) means “to kidnap”. Do they know something we don’t?

The March 1 Sequester is the plan of the 1%, aided and abetted by both Democrats and Republicans, to kidnap, hold for ransom and cut federal programs for people.

Economist Michael Hudson points out that the idea of using “user fees” to create a fund against future loses is at the heart of the scam. Social Security is currently solvent, but supposedly will run up big debts in the future. Therefore we supposedly must tax the current users to cover future liabilities. This bogus concept is applied only to programs that benefit the 99%. This justifies their elimination.:

“The government’s seashore insurance program, for instance, recently incurred a $1 trillion liability to rebuild the private beaches and homes that Hurricane Sandy washed out. Why should this insurance subsidy at below-commercial rates for the wealthy minority who live in this scenic high-risk property be treated as normal spending, but not Social Security? Why save in advance by a special wage tax to pay for these programs that benefit the general population, but not levy a similar “user fee” tax to pay for flood insurance for beachfront homes or war? And while we are at it, why not save another $13 trillion in advance to pay for the next bailout of Wall Street when debt deflation causes another crisis to drain the budget?”  (1)

The federal government spends billions to aid corporate people. Could we sequester those instead? That’s a lot of money!

** In 2011, the federal government spent $368,876,312,263 on military contracts to corporations. Since military production is generally made to be destroyed, this is unproductive spending that benefits only the corporations that receive the contracts.  (2)

** In 2011, Federal and state budgets gave out $170 billion in corporate welfare as direct subsidies to corporations. Local government kicked in $80 billion more.  (3) These subsidies include income tax credits, property tax abatements, cash grants, tax rebates, loans, and free services, just to name a few.

In 2009, universities alone spent $55 billion in Research &amp; Development. (4) Though there is significant overlap, it is worthwhile noting that the federal government spent $142 billion in R &amp; D in 2012.  (5) Due to various leasing agreements, most R &amp; D money subsidizes corporate research.

Subsidies make up a huge amount of corporate profits, if not all of corporate profits:

“America’s most costly welfare recipients today are Fortune 500 companies. In 1997 the Fortune 500 corporations recorded best-ever earnings of $325 billion, yet incredibly Uncle Sam doled out nearly $100 billion in taxpayer subsidies. These welfare payments come in every conceivable shape and size: government grants, sweetheart business deals arranged by the Commerce Department, cut-rate insurance, low-interest loans, a protective wall against foreign competition, exclusive government contracts, and a mind-boggling maze of special interest loopholes in the tax code.” (6)

Here subsidies were 1/3 of  “corporate earnings”. “Corporate profits” are a much smaller percentage of  “corporate earnings”, which must be first spent to replace materials and machinery, labor, advertising, etc, all before the profits can be determined. So the 1/3 becomes more like 1/2.

In fact, Wall Street banks would be “barely profitable” without their $83 billion subsidy. (7) And these vast sums don’t include the $13 trillion Bail Out of the financial industry Melt Down in 2008.

Since the public is in hock for all these funds anyway, let’s think outside the box! Could we spend our money in a better fashion? We can be far more creative than indulging in shabby sequester scams. As a people, we are better than this.

An intriguing approach has been raised by the movement to restrain the giant petroleum companies. Oil companies’ currently plan to continue oil and gas production, blasting it all out of the ground and into the atmosphere. This will automatically lead to Climate Collapse. Thus some voices have called for paying oil companies to leave the oil in the ground. Interesting.

We only need to go one baby step further. Let’s continue to subsidize the corporations with public money with one stipulation: they must give away everything they produce for free! They like getting free money! The public gets everything free too! Why does this pipeline go only one way?

This step is completely within our capacity. It might even cost less than we are currently paying to subsidize corporate profits. Just imagine all the positive ways how real economics for the 99% could transform society!

personalfinance,"Walmart overcharge, no receipt. Where do I go from here?","On February 13th I made two different transactions from Walmart. One was for a few things of candy, and it showed up correctly on my online bank statement, for $4.55. After that I went to get my friends in the electronics section and saw a card I wanted to get, and bought it along with a pack of gum. The total couldn't have been more than $5. So within the next two days I check my transactions and I see a charge for $188.52 after the $4.55 charge, both from Walmart. I call my bank (Navy Federal Credit Union), and file a claim immediately but they've told me that without the receipt I might not get my money back. They just got back to me, so I plan on going to Walmart today and seeing if I can fix it. Also, the lady in front of me had a declined credit card and just all of a sudden walked out with her groceries, a full cart of them, and I'm wondering if that accidentally got put on my card, although I remember the total being the correct amount on the screen. Any advice is much appreciated, thank you!

investing,Bond funds for emergency fund?,"With banks paying barely above 0% interest, does it make any sense to keep the emergency fund in something like the vanguard total bond index?  
Of course there is the possibility of losing money, but it hasn't lost money year over year since 1999 and that was less than 1%. My emergency fund can take a 1% hit, and i would earn much higher interest rates than keeping the money in the bank.

personalfinance,"Is it better financially to start paying up a larger, long term loan than a short one?","I have two loans (mortgages) with the same interest rates. One is a long term loan with ~32 years left, the other is a smaller loan with ~2.5 years left of payments.

I can start making small incremental extra payments into one of them.

Is it better to pay off the larger debt or the smaller?

It seems to me like in the long term it would be better to pay off the larger debt, but maybe I don't see things clearly.",finance,1362056091
personalfinance,"Questions regarding HSA, 401k, Roth, taxes, and debt.","I'll try to make this short. I got a new job and am well into the 25% federal tax bracket. No state tax. My fiancee makes about what I do, so once we're married, we'll still be in the 25% tax bracket.

We're getting married in May (inexpensive wedding, our parents contributions will more than cover it), and this is our situation:

* $40,000 in fiancee's student loan debt (most of it at 6.8%)
* $3,000 in my student loans (all of it at 2.38%)
* $2,000 left on my car (at 5.5%)
* $0 credit card debt
* $10,000 in my Roth IRA
* $5,000 in fiancee's 401(k)
* Emergency Savings Fund set up
* $1,500 in current HSA
* My company offers a 3% match if I put in 4% on my 401(k)
* My company puts in $750 annually into my HSA 

I don't think we'll be in the 25% tax bracket when we retire (maybe wishful thinking?)

There is no question that I should put in 4% for the 401(k) match first. My first question is, do I max out my HSA as well? If I do and use the money for health reasons, the money is never taxed, which trumps the student loan interest. If I end up never using the money, I can keep it in a mutual fund so it grows, and take the money out at 65 anyway (with it being taxed as income, probably at a lower tax rate than the 25% it'd be taxed at it if I didn't put it in there). 

Assuming I put 4% into my 401k and max out my HSA before paying off debt, I'm still well into the 25% tax bracket...Even with the standard deduction and personal exemptions lowering my taxable income. 

SO, is it better to take money being taxed at 25% and throw it all towards student loans (first paying 25% in taxes), or is it better to take that money and put it into my 401k until I retire and withdraw it in the 15% tax bracket, and then put whatever else I can towards debt?

Is there any reason to use a roth IRA/401k anymore?

We'd EVENTUALLY like to buy land. Should we wait to save for that, or start now?

Brillante Köpfe über die Finanzwelt noch versuchen, die Auswirkungen der italienischen Wahlergebnis auszuarbeiten.
Vorerst, die beste Antwort ist, dass es wahrscheinlich auch bald zu erzählen. Nachdem am Dienstag fällt hat ein wenig Stabilität zu Märkten, möglicherweise zurückgegeben, da jeder immer noch versucht, zu erarbeiten, was Sie denken.Kredit-Rating-Agentur Moodys hat davor gewarnt, dass das Wahlergebnis für Italien--negativ und auch für andere Staaten verschuldete Eurozone negativ ist. Man fürchtet politischer Unsicherheit wird weiter und warnt vor einer ""Verschlechterung des Landes wirtschaftlichen Aussichten"" oder Schwierigkeiten bei der Umsetzung der Reform, sagte der Agentur.Für den Rest der Eurozone riskiert das Ergebnis: ""die Euro-Schuldenkrise entfachen."" Madrid muss mit Angst nach Italien suchen. Wenn Investoren, dass Italien wieder riskante sucht und wieder weg vom Kauf seine Schulden entscheiden, wird dann Spanien in die Schusslinie zu gezogen.
 
Kann der Anti-Berlusconi Italien retten?
 
Standard &amp; Poor ist erklärt, dass Italiens Bewertung wurde durch die Wahl nicht unmittelbar betroffen, aber ich denke, der wesentliche Teil dieses Satzes ist ""nicht sofort.""
Zur gleichen Zeit Herman Van Rompuy Tweets geben einen Hinweis auf die Ansicht aus Brüssel: ""Wir respektieren das Ergebnis demokratischer Wahlen in Italien,"" seine Feed festgestellt.Wirklich? Das ist ein Novum. Der demokratisch gewählte Silvio Berlusconi wurde heraus gezwungen, wenn er nicht mit strenge durch nach der Europäischen Zentralbank Italien trug durch den Kauf seine Schulden im Herbst 2011 folgen.""Es ist jetzt bis zu italienischer Politiker, Verantwortung, Kompromiss und bilden eine stabile Regierung zu übernehmen"", tweeted Van Rompuy.Wahl Blätter Italien blockiertHat er die Ergebnisse gesehen? Die Newcomer und Anti-Establishment Komiker Beppe Grillo weigert sich, ein Geschäft zu tun, und doch ist er der natürliche Königsmacher, polling bei 25 %.Italiens erste Parlament?""Auch für Italien gibt es eine echte Alternative zu anhaltenden fiskalischen Konsolidierung und Reformen,"" fuhr er fort.Wirtschaftlich ja, aber die italienischen Wähler nicht zustimmen. Und vorerst, in Italien eine Demokratie (von Sorten).Schließlich: ""Ich bin zuversichtlich, dass Italien Mitglied der Eurozone stabil bleiben wird.""Er hofft...Der Schlüssel zu, ob die Krise reignites ist, ob Investoren beginnen nach hinten Weg von Kredite an Italien. Wenn ja, wird das der große Test für die EZB Entschlossenheit zur Rettung des Euro.Lesen Sie mehr: Euro-Krise-Abdeckung
Das wichtigste zu betrachten ist italienische Anleihen, da ob Kosten steigen von 4,8 % für 10 Jahre Geld derzeit auf näher 6 % Kredite, dann Italien startet es zu teuer leihen zu finden.Die Billionen-Euro-Frage ist, wenn die EZB Schritt wird in zu helfen, auch wenn es nicht erhalten können, die Reformen und Sparmaßnahmen, die es (aufgrund der politischen Situation) verlangt. Das ist der Haken an der Sache. Und es werden viele in der Stadt, die heute diese Frage nachzudenken.Eindeutig auf den Finanzmärkten ist zu einer Zentralbank eine gefährliche Sache zu tun. Soros abgebrochen hat die Bank of England am schwarzen Mittwoch 1992, Milliarden von zwingen Sterling aus der EWU, aber das war vor langer Zeit.Italien vermeidet Panik bei einer Anleihe-AuktionWas wir aus dieser Krise gelernt haben ist nicht gegen ""die Fed"" (oder der EZB). Im vergangenen Sommer der EZB Chef Mario Draghi setzen eine Linie im Sand mit seiner ""Waffenlieferung"" (zur Rettung des Euro) Rede.Aber als Teil dieser Verpflichtung betont er immer wieder neue Hilfe der EZB kommt an Bedingungen geknüpft. Und diese Bedingungen sind was also nachteilig für die Italiener--Sparmaßnahmen und Reformen erwiesen haben.Wir haben also zwei unerbittliche Objekte zueinander Rast. Das politische Chaos in Italien und den Wählern Abneigung gegen Sparmaßnahmen und Reformen (etablierten Technokrat Mario Monti Befragten nur 10 %).Was passiert als nächstes? Der Status Quo können weiter, wenn italienische Kreditkosten nicht von hier aus steigen und Italien daher nicht EZB-Hilfe braucht.Wenn Märkte glauben an Draghi und Brüssel weiterhin, dass der Euro ""unumkehrbar"" ist, dann weiterhin Investoren nach Italien zu verleihen. Ja, Märkte werden nervös und ängstlich, aber Italien wird schließlich klären sich politisch.
Der große Vorteil für Italien ist, obwohl es viele Schulden hat, ist es nicht schaffen, Schulden schnell (wie Griechenland, Spanien oder auch England). Und wie ich gestern auf meinem CooperCity-Blog, das positive Ergebnis von allen, was das sein könnte, dass Brüssel Rücken aus aus Sparsamkeit, was eine gute Sache wäre.
Die Grundregel der Finanzierung ist jedoch, dass hohes Risiko mit hoher Rendite kommt. Soros hat ein großes Spiel gegen der britischen Zentralbank, aber es angeblich machte ihn ein Milliardär über Nacht.
Es muß ein paar Hecke Geldgeber italienische Verhältnisse mit ähnlichen Gier in ihren Augen zu betrachten. Wenn er den Euro zu retten will, ist es Zeit für Mario Draghi, die Furcht vor Gott wieder in solche Herzen.

investing,A quick question on Google.,"I've got the opportunity here to take a $20,000 loan at a simple interest rate of 2.99% over 5 years. I don't start the payments until July. With Google stocks projected to exceed $1000, and considering how well the company is doing, would it be wise to invest in 25 shares at $800 and then sell once they hit the $1000 mark? 

From my point of view it seems like an easy way to make $5000 and pay off the loan before much interest is incurred.
