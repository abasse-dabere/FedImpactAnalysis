personalfinance,Another Tax Question,"Okay, so this is a little weird and I've never had this happen before.

I received a W-2 in January.  I assumed this had my total yearly income, my salary + my commissions.  Honestly, I did not pay a huge attention to it, this is the most money I've made so it looked legit to me.  So I went ahead and filed my federal taxes.

Today, March 1st, he came in and gave me a 1099.  The 1099 has my commissions on it for the year, completely untaxed.  About $9k.  He said the accountant forgot about it or some crap story.

I understand that I have to submit an ammended tax return.  How much am I going to be looking at having to pay back?  Has anyone ever seen it done this way?  I'm not a contract employee, I am on salary.  He writes out checks to me for everything including my normal salary and my commissions.  

And most importantly, what is the best way to avoid this next year?",finance,1362176673
personalfinance,20k in the bank as of this morning...,"So I have a dilemma, the spouse and I are underwater by over 100k on what was a 280k house. The house is in their name alone, as is the mortgage, we are also in a non-recourse state. The market doesnt look to be recovering anytime soon. Not only did we lose the equity we got by building it, we also put a good chunk down (nearly 35k) we've also done a good bit of upgrades since 2006.
Now the reason we bought in their name alone was I owned a place, and if they bought it alone there were programs that got us a better deal, and qualified fine on income and credit. Fast forward to today. We've made many reasonable efforts to refi from our 6% fixed rate which was good back when we bought to the 3-4% available now, considered even waiting it out although our family has significantly outgrown the space. Being they made good money then, and does even more so today, we've been able to remain pretty debt free, Most of my income goes into retirement accounts, and covers the other monthly bills and our primary savings. We are considering walking from our home. sitting on the monthly payment, adding it to our savings and in 6-8 months buying a new home in my name alone. the credit hit isnt a big deal as our combined income allows us to pay cash on most items and my credit will be fine in case we need it. 
Do we bail on this house, save the money and buy a new one that better suits our family? Or sit on the debt knowing that it will eventually get better although that may be 10-15 years from now. Only to be able to walk away maybe breaking even at sale time with no equity for all the money paid into it? I've always considered myself smart with money, I am really struggling with the continued loss I see happening.

I look at homes as a financial transaction, the emotional attachment part has never really hit me. 

So I assume i'll get flamed for the ""you signed up for a contract""  blah blah blah. In the business world, contracts default all the time, and other than living there, its still just business to me. That and I never signed anything, the spouse did...;)

With house prices likely already slowly starting to go back up from hitting bottom, now is the time to buy. Chances of losing money again due to values plummeting are unlikely. Better interest rates right now also help. That and if I do get stuck again, this time it will be in a home that fits my family and we can stay in for the long haul.

personalfinance,Finance used Prius to get credit score higher so future student loans have lower interest rate?,"So me and my SO are using one car right now a 96 sentra that cost $1,500 and has been a great car probably 26-30 mpg. But the problem is she has to drive me to work and pick me up every day so that means make 2 trips where instead of 1 and waste time that she can have studying while I drive myself. But she needs it for school also but its not that far but on the bus takes 1 hour where driving only 10-15 min. 


Anyways we were thinking of in a year or 2 buying a 05-10 used Prius for around 5k-8k. We were thinking of getting it financed so our credit score will improve. 

We are thinking of getting a 5k-8k used car loan and then once we get it then pay all the money we have saved to that point. probably 3k-5k or maybe full amount If we save enough. 

The reason we want to get a car loan is to build up credit so that when my SO needs student loans for vet school than we will get at least lower interest rate which will save us thousands if we had no credit score like we do now because we never used credit cards or any other loans.

We are very responsible and never been in debt and right now she has a secured credit card with 1,000 limit from our own money that we use 30% a month and pay it off every month.

We have around $1,100 extra a month that goes to different savings accounts and goals.

http://i.imgur.com/UYKxpXh.jpg

Total money we have is $6,000 with $1,100 a month savings to continue. 

monthly income is $2,000
bills $520
Regular spending around $400 (this can probably get cut down way more)

savings and goals $1,100 a month.


Can we afford a loan that will get paid off really fast just for a bump on our credit score so our student loans wont kill us with interest. 

Also what else can we do for a really high credit score?

investing,A Close Above $29 for Silver,"By Michelle Smith - Exclusive to Silver Investing News

Silver headed into the weekend with gains and emerged to begin this week in a similar fashion. By Tuesday, silver’s closing New York spot price was $29.43. That was the first time the metal had closed above $29 since February 19; since then, it has not happened again. On Wednesday, silver gave up all the previous day’s gains, falling to $28.98. As of Thursday, the metal had declined 9.15 percent in 30 days. Some market participants believe that silver is approaching oversold territory, if it is not there already.

There has been significant concern within the silver market about the longevity of quantitative easing. Dovish statements this week from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke seemed to assure market participants that the flow of easy money will not be cut off any time soon. Silver prices rose in response, but not for long.

As has been the case lately, when silver makes gains, it quickly gives them back. The metal simply cannot seem to find a positive role in this environment, which features investors who are flocking to risk.

With the threat of sequestration in the US approaching, there has been chatter this week that suggests some are concerned that the spending cuts will weigh on silver prices. Apart from that, there appears to be limited focus on the metal’s supply and demand fundamentals these days.

For example, on Monday, Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL) announced that its 2012 results indicate that it has achieved a seventh consecutive year of reserve and resource growth. Its silver reserves climbed 2 percent, to 150 million ounces, the highest level in the company’s history. Mineralized material increased 7 percent, to 22.4 million tons averaging 5.7 ounces of silver per ton. Hecla is expecting 2013 silver production to increase over 25 percent, to as much as 9 million ounces.

First Majestic Silver (TSX:FR,NYSE:AG) likewise announced that 2012 marked its ninth consecutive year of silver production increases. The company produced 8.26 million ounces of silver. Pushing for a 10th year of growth, the company expects production of 11.1 to 11.7 million pure silver ounces in 2013.

However, this news of increased supply in a weak market got little attention.

Some believe that silver may have bottomed, and there have been reports this week that could provide encouragement for silver bulls.

Silver demand increased in January, according to the LBMA, while the amount of silver transferred between accounts rose as transfers of gold declined. The month’s 13-percent increase in transferred silver ounces resulted in a daily average of almost 152 million ounces, the highest level since March 2012, but still significantly lower than levels in H2 2011.

Much of that silver was reportedly transferred to London clearers, indicating that ETF activity was a significant cause of the movement.

Silver ETF investors have continued to show their support. Almost 18 metric tons (MT) were added to holdings last week, marking the third consecutive week of additions. At 20,189 MT, silver holdings are approaching the all-time high of 20,362 MT.

Also, CNBC reported bullish option plays. ProShares Ultra Silver (NYSE:AGQ) is an ETF that corresponds to twice the daily performance of silver. On Tuesday, over 2,300 March 42 calls were reportedly traded amid heavy buying. Purchased at $0.95 and $1, these calls are bets that silver prices will make a significant move to the upside. If the ProShares Ultra Silver’s stock price, at $38.29 Thursday, does not not rise above $42, these market participants stand to lose their entire investment in three weeks, CNBC’s article points out.

The futures market, however, shows few signs of optimism. The last Commitment of Traders report reveals that net speculative length fell over 1,100 MT, a 21-percent drop from the week before. This decline includes nearly 800 MT added by speculative shorts.

The close

Silver on the COMEX ended floor trading near the low of the day, at $28.46 with losses of $0.52. Silver lost $0.47 on the New York spot market, finishing Thursday trading at $28.51.

Company news

Huldra Silver (TSXV:HDA,OTC Pink:HUSIF) received the second tranche of a previously announced private placement. That brought its total financing to aggregate gross proceeds of more than $10 million. The company will use the money for debt repayment and general working capital.

Golden Tag Resources (TSXV:GOG) completed an updated resource estimate for its San Diego silver property in Durango, Mexico. Golden Tag is the operator of a 50/50 joint venture with Golden Minerals (TSX:AUM,AMEX:AUMN).

The updated resource estimate shows a very significant increase in tonnage over the last resource estimate, which was released in January 2009, the company’s press release states. Indicated resources increased from 370,000 MT to 16.5 million metric tons and inferred resources doubled in size from 22 MT to 42 MT. Silver ounces increased to 31.6 million ounces indicated and 83.8 million ounces inferred. That’s compared to 76.5 million inferred silver ounces and 3 million ounces in the indicated category in 2009.

Argentex Mining (TSXV:ATX,OTCQB:AGXMF) announced the results of preliminary metallurgical testing at its Pinguino silver-gold project in Santa Cruz, Argentina.

Highlights include indicated silver recoveries of up to 81 percent and gold recoveries of up to 69 percent based on heap leach column test work on oxide samples. These results are based on leaching times up to 45 days. Bottle roll test work on oxide samples indicates recoveries of up to 95 percent for silver and 94 percent for gold.

Earlier this month, Dolly Varden Silver (TSXV:DV,OTC Pink:DOLLF) announced a private placement of up to 83,333,333 common shares for proceeds up to $15 million. It also noted that from February 22 to 26, Hecla, a strategic investor in Dolly Varden Silver,  sold 10 million common shares. Dolly Varden has agreed to compensate Hecla with an estimated $38,000 for the costs incurred. Hecla will reportedly subscribe for 10,000,000 new shares and exercise its pre-emptive right to maintain a nearly 20-percent interest in the company.

personalfinance,Advice for 21 year old,"I'm a college student in my third year. Over the past 6 years I have managed to save about $14000 currently split into 2 accounts; a savings and a checking. I never touch my savings and I use my checking to pay for everyday things like food and gas. Every paycheck I earn goes 50/50 into the two accounts. My savings is at 12000 and checking at 2000.

I am planning on marrying my girlfriend after I graduate and my goal is to take 6 months with her and travel Europe.

Now. This year I will be taking out my first student loans to pay for tuition for university. I am currently in a co-op program and live from home for 6 months out of the year to work from home. In July I am getting an apartment and will be returning to classes. My parents will be helping me throw money at the principles he entire time I'm in school,  but it's likely that I'll still be a little bit in debt when I graduate. 

My questions are as follows:

Right now my savings is growing with every paycheck, but it is getting almost no interest. Should I invest it in something or just continue to grow it and not touch it until I take my trip?

Should I not use my savings for my trip and instead use all of it to take as small a loan as possible? And then if necessary take a loan for my trip in 2 years instead? 

I am planning on working for the next 2 years while in classes, but rent and tuition will add up. I also have my girlfriend's med school to look forward to; my student loans should give me 6 months after I graduate to start paying them in monthly installments; that is when I want to travel. Ill use my savings to both pay for my trip and begin monthly payments while I'm abroad. Is that smart to save it now? I feel like I'm hoarding it and just wondering if maybe I should be just using the money I have while I have it instead of taking loans.

Thanks for any advice. Last question, what student loans can anybody recommend? I think I was a fixed interest rate.",finance,1362156161
investing,Topsy-turvy Week for Gold,"By Andrew Topf - Exclusive to Gold Investing News

Gold this week was buffeted by winds coming from both Europe and the United States — with the end result being that most of its gains were wiped out and the price of the precious metal finished Thursday at almost the exact level as a week earlier. 

The action started on Monday when bargain hunters — still seeing blood in the water from last week’s 20 percent price pullback due to signals from the US Fed about a possible end to quantitative easing — jumped into the bullion markets. A weaker dollar and the prospect of bad news coming out of Italian elections also helped gold. The gold price added more than $25 and came close to breaching the psychologically significant $1,600 level — rising over 1 percent to $1,593 per ounce.

Then it was Ben Bernanke’s turn to weigh in on quantitative easing — a term first coined in 2008 when the central bank began purchasing bonds in an effort to shore up the flagging US economy. Since that year the gold price has doubled on the inflationary implications of QE and its latest round, QE3 announced last year, involves the purchase of some $85 billion per month worth of US Treasuries and bonds.

On Tuesday the US Federal Reserve chairman tried to assuage concerns about QE ending, stating “In the current economic environment, the benefits of asset purchases […] are clear.” Bernanke indicated that QE could stay in place until 2014 and added that “monetary policy is providing important support to the recovery while keeping inflation close to the FOMC’s 2% objective.”

Those remarks were bullish for the gold price, which gained more than $30 to reach a high of $1,620.

The rally wasn’t to last, however, after positive economic news from the United States on Wednesday dampened the spirits of gold bugs and traders began hitting their sell buttons. Housing data turned out better than expected and that had investors thinking the Fed’s ultra-loose monetary policy could end sooner rather than later despite Bernanke’s comments to the contrary. Gold fell as much as $25 to touch a low of $1,591, erasing most of the gains made the day earlier.

Gold remained flat on Thursday with the US dollar hovering near a six-month high and little fresh safe-haven demand in the wake of the Italian election results. Kitco reported the head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as saying the gridlock that resulted from no clear winner emerging will not significantly impact the European debt crisis as was feared.

At the close of the trading session April COMEX gold was down $17.10 at $1,578.60/oz. Spot gold also dropped $17.20 to finish at $1,579.50. On a monthly basis gold futures declined for the fifth straight month; the last time that happened was in 1997. In another signs of gold’s current weakness, holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust (ARCA:GLD) — the world’s largest gold ETF — crashed through a six-month low on signs of an improving global economy, Reuters reported.

Russia, Kazakhstan keep snapping up gold

Waning investment demand for gold does not appear to be affecting the yellow metal’s appeal by central banks. Bloomberg reported that Russia and Kazakhstan expanded their gold reserves for the the fourth straight month in January. Russian holdings increased in January by 8.5 percent over 2012, while Kazakhstan purchased another 1.5 tons to add to that country’s 40 percent increase in gold reserves last year.

In China, gold mines continue to crank out bullion and cement the country’s position as the world’s number one gold producer. China’s Ministry of Information Technology reported that in 2012, China’s total gold production increased 11.66 percent to 403.1 metric tonnes.

Nevada dodges gold production cliff

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Nevada, the world’s third-largest gold producer after China and Australia (2011 figures), could dodge the “gold production cliff” facing major miners after 2017. While Canada’s National Bank Financial has found that big gold companies have found too few large new deposits to sustain current production rates, the paper counters that Nevada could buck the trend:

“For one thing, miners here seem to be bucking the trend away from new deposits. More importantly, an international production slowdown could prop up gold prices, which would make additional exploration and output more feasible in the long run.”

Examples of new discoveries in Nevada include Newmont Mining’s (NYSE:NEM) Long Canyon project and Barrick’s Goldrush mine, both of which have substantially increased their resource estimates.

Company news

Rio Tinto (LSE:RIO,NYSE:RIO) and Turquoise Hill Resources (NYSE:TRQ,TSX:TRQ) had a setback this week when the government of Mongolia revoked the licenses for a key section of their giant Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold complex. Rio and subsidiary Turquoise Hill own two-thirds of the project, with the Mongolian government controlling 34 percent. The companies have often clashed with Mongolia over costs, revenues and taxes, as the Central Asian nation seeks to ensure it maintains substantial benefits from the $6.6-billion mine that has been over a decade in the making. FT.com reported a person with knowledge of the matter as saying ”If an agreement is not reached either the mine will suspend operations or Rio will extend credit to the mine.”

Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX,TSX:ABX) said last Friday it would try mediation to try ending protests at its Lagunas Norte mine in Peru centering around water supplies. Production at the mine, which yielded 763,000 ounces of gold in 2011, has not been affected by about 150 protesters blocking the road to the mine, according to Reuters.

Mineweb reported that Saudi Arabia’s largest gold miner, Ma’aden company, has granted a lucrative contract to build a gold processing plant for its Ad Duwayhi gold mine. The US$271 million design-build contract was awarded to Korean company Hanwha Engineering and Construction.

Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC,TSX:K), the fifth-largest gold producer, has acquired exploration and mining rights for two high-grade gold-silver deposits in Russia. Mining.com reported that a subsidiary of Kinross — Chukotka Mining and Geological Company (CMGC) — won the prospects by auction.

Junior company news

Richmont Mines (TSX:RIC,NYSE:RIC) announced the first inferred mineral resource estimate for the C Zone at the Island Gold Mine in Ontario. The company added a new inferred mineral resource of 508,000 gold ounces at 10.73 grams per tonne (g/t).

Grande Portage Resources (TSXV:GPG) and joint venture partner Quaterra Resources (TSXV:QTA,AMEX:QMM) announced an updated resource estimate for its Herbert Gold project in Alaska. The Deep Trench and Main veins are estimated to contain 182,400 ounces of gold grading 6.91 g/t in the indicated category.

Timberline Resources (TSXV:TBR,NYSE:TLR,AMEX:TLR) increased the resource estimate at its Lookout Mountain Gold Project in Nevada. Gold ounces in the measured and indicated categories increased by 30 percent from 2012, and are now 78-percent greater than Timberline’s initial 2011 resource estimate, Timberline said in a statement.

But the thing is, you're actually more than just a typical shareholder. All a typical shareholder can do is evangalize to their friends and buy the company's products. Ultimately they can do very little to create value for the company and postively influence their investment. 

But this is where Bitcoin is very different. YOU DIRECTLY have the opportunity to influence the value of your investment.  As has been pointed out before, owning a bitcoin is like owning an ETF on the entire economy. When you add value to that economy, it becomes directly reflected in the price of bitcoins. The more companies that accept bitcoins, the more people using and benefiting from bitcoins, the more technologies built on Bitcoin; all of these add trust and value to Bitcoin. 

If you're a programmer, make some apps, or even contribute to the Bitcoin project itself. If you're a FED-hating gold horder, convince your FED-hating  gold hording friends of the unique properties of bitcoins as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. If you're an internet user (going out on a limb here) convince the companies you buy things from to accept bitcoins. And if you are just a general user, get educated and tell your friends and family why this could very well end up being a huge and disruptive technology that benefits everyone.

personalfinance,Figuring out my Future. (Paying last year of College and whatever else comes.),"Hey,

I'm a long time lurker and was looking for opinions. Here's the story:

Both my parents are hoarders and in so doing have put incredible strain on me and my brothers in the past two years. My father (the less hoarder) got fed up with everything that now they live in an apartment [giving up our house (I don't know the full story on that)] and hasn't worked in two years (living on his investments and savings.) Now this is the beginning of my financial situation.

I have completed 3 1/2 years at a four year institution and I need 1 to 2 semesters to graduate. During the semester of Fall '11, I worked 30 hours plus Senior level classes to help support my family. I did not take classes in Spring '12 but instead worked on getting myself financially set. I am now currently a bank teller at a large bank, but I would like to finish my degree since I am so close.

So My father still owes my College 10k from Fall '11. (I am lucky enough that currently I am debt free.) I would like to find the best way to pay for the next semester which costs around 20k, though over the summer I will be talking to them about financial aid.

1) What do you guys think is the most appropriate reaction to deal with this financially? It would be a liberal arts degree. I have done a lot of extra courses which don't offer any work experience but do offer work ethic/intelligence (I've translated half of The Odyssey in a semester.)

2) Should I pursue the MBA after graduating, because I feel like it would be hard getting a banking job without a business degree?

3) By the end of May, I should have enough saved up to put at least 1k into a Roth IRA, should I start that or save it for use in the semester of school since I do not believe I would get any help from my parents.

Ask any questions, This situation has a lot of outliers and I tried to be as brief as I could but I'm a liberal arts major, we write large books. It's a habit.",finance,1362257993

Once I looked up from the law books, I realized I had to attack my debt as aggressively as possible.  I was 120k in debt back in May. After taking the bar (and passing, thank god) and getting a job (again, thankfully) in August, I sold all of my assets- car, possessions, investing accounts, etc.  I've moved back in with my parents, who are nice enough to allow me back and only charge me $200/month for rent and food while I'm trying to get back on my feet.  My dad is working abroad for the next year or so, so I am earning my keep as the man of the house doing some needed renovations at cost.

Minimum Payment on Student Loans: 1045.66/month. I've been paying 1100/month, will do 1600/month once my emergency fund is up to around 10k.  Just to clarify, these are Federal stafford and GRAD Plus loans, and I am aware of IBR, ICR, etc.  I have not applied to those programs for personal, philosophical, (and admittedly, prideful) reasons.  One option I haven't taken advantage of is a 0.25% decrease in interest rate I can get if I link my account for online payments.  Last I checked, when I had more debt, I could save about 200-300 a year in interest if I opted for this.  I will be applying for this later today, and it may take a billing cycle or two to go into effect.  If anyone who has used this option can tell me how to make extra, principal only payments to a specific loan group (and not have it screwed up 90% of the time during payment processing) I'd really value their advice.

Credit Card: 4,000 at 0.0% until Feb 2014, min payment $40/month, but I've been paying $150. 

Parents: 3,000 at 0.0%, but I'd like to pay them asap.

Emergency Fund: $1000, but putting $500/month into it now

Rent: $200

Gas: $150 (my car gets 28mpg, and I drive it as little as possible, but living with the parents for cheaper rent means more mileage on the car and more fuel costs on commutes to work)

Car Insurance/Phone Plan/Bar Fees: $150/Month

Vacation/Christmas/Birthday/Wedding Gift/Bachelor Party Fund: 100/month

Entertainment: 300-500 depending on the month. This includes all ""other"" expenditures as well.

Car: '96 shitbox.  Will be driving it into the ground, which could be tomorrow or could be 2 years from now.  This is the main reason why I've shifted my budgetary focus to the emergency fund.  Once my current auto dies, I can scrap it for around 500, and I'd be happy buying a reasonably priced car (3000-5500), so I'm hoping this car lasts until August or so, but who knows.


TL;DR, had 120K debt last year, and sold everything to make a great dent in debt, its now down to around $80,000, but with no emergency fund, car fund, etc, I can only save 500-700 a month in addition to student loan and other necessary expenses.  I'm getting discouraged, as I was hoping to pay down my GRAD Plus Loans, Credit card debt, and set up an emergency fund by June so I could move back out into the real world, and its not looking possible. 

 I'm feeling strangled by this debt, and I refuse to be in debt until 30.  I prided myself throughout undergrad and grad school (paying my own way) on the fact that I was comparatively young to my peers.  I was a barred attorney at 24.  Unfortunately, it seems all of my peers had everything paid for, so now, as they work and play, their income can go towards savings for homes, weddings, cars, and retirement, while I am living in my parent's basement, with a car that barely runs, not enough money to go out with friends that often, and even worse, feeling like I'm running in place with no end to this existence in sight.  I missed out on my 125k job out of school, and I thought I'd be maxing contributions and making double payments on my loans by now, on the path to early retirement.  Now, I'm feeling hopeless and everyone just tells me to ""be patient"".",finance,1362253470

Bitcoin,I bought my 14 year old nephew some Bitcoins for his birthday. Will he end up in rehab?,"Rather than the usual £50 stuffed inside his birthday card I decided to buy him £50 worth of Bitcoins. I was pretty sure I'd get brownie points once he started to see the value of his gift going up (see kids, deflation is good!). Sure enough, just 5 weeks later his gift has doubled in value and I'm now easily his favourite uncle (I always was but that's by the by).

He didn't ask too many questions as to what he might do with them and, to be honest, I didn't want to be too forthcoming with that info anyway.

He's 14 years old ffs. The temptation of Girls Gone Bitcoin would be irrepressible for him. And after 30 seconds (max) with them he'd be strolling of to The Silk Road to buy some dooby for some post coital relaxation no doubt.

In a drug induced haze he'd realise he's down to his last 2 Bitcoins and wanna try and double up on his stake. 

Straight over to SatoshiDice for a quick 1k multiplier punt and bang. It comes in. 

Back to the girls, max out on higher grade at The Silk Road, hit the high roller tables at Seals.

And for his 15th birthday I'm cashing out all my Bitcoins to pay for a 3 month stint at The Betty Ford Clinic.

Question:
I'd be the first to shoot down those that try and use the sites already mentioned as an argument against Bitcoin and all of its obvious merits and I know he could easily get drugs on a street corner and he really doesn't need girls charging him Bitcoins to get his rocks off on the internet. 

But the gambling side is a tad more difficult to get into at such a young age in a bitcoinless world.

But ""It's for the good of the children"" is the argument that rarely fails when it spews from the mouth of our beloved politicians on the morning news bulletin. 

I've not really seen it discussed at all but are there any possible solutions to this? I can't imagine there are but it strikes me that it will be an obvious angle for TPTB to pursue once they start sticking there noses in.

personalfinance,Paying off loans vs investments,"Hey all, Not exactly a long time lurker, but a lurker nonetheless, first time poster.

So here's the sitrep. I ended up graduating college with somewhere around $66k in student loans at 3.25-3.75% interest. There are quality of life reasons that I went into the field I'm in and I'm OK with that. I'm currently making approx 36k a year and I'm putting $1000/month towards my loans, which currently stand at 60k. I know that I got a pretty nice interest rate when I got the loans and I've yet to meet a refinancer who could get me a lower one, and I've seen that the economy/financial markets look like they're in somewhat a state of growth. 
So what I'm wondering is this. The $1000/month is basically all my spare income, I've got my living expenses down to 1100/month (New York isn't cheap). And I've been looking at IRAs or other fairly ""low risk"" investments and a lot of them project and have a history of better than 4% a year. Would it make sense to open something like that instead of  putting so much towards paying off these loans?

investing,Justice Department decision coming soon on legal marijuana - here are a few scenarios for cannabis investors.,"(Note: This post is geared toward those who have the necessary risk tolerance to invest in the highly volatile cannabis sector.) 

Eric Holder has telegraphed an upcoming decision on how the Justice Department will treat CO and WA's legal marijuana. Obviously this could have a huge impact - both long and short-term - on MJNA and the overall cannabis sector. Let's look at the possible outcomes. But first, a few facts:

- Obama has gone on record as saying there are bigger fish to fry than going after individual users of pot in CO and WA.

- On the other hand, Obama's Drug Czar said last month that the government would go after growers and distributors. http://dailycaller.com/2013/02/20/u-s-drug-czar-we-will-enforce-federal-marijuana-laws/
* Meanwhile, state legislatures across the country have been proposing bills legalizing either medical marijuana or straight-out legalization. Polling in support of legalization has also soared in the wake of the election.

So, what we have here is an indecisive Federal government and a surge of support amongst both citizens and a growing number of legislators at the state level. Against this backdrop, here are three possible decisions and how they might play out.

* *The worst-case scenario*: Similar to what the Drug Czar said recently, the Justice Department takes a firm stance on growers and distributors. They stay as close to the status quo as they can, protecting the law enforcement and prison systems that benefit from prohibition, while maintaining Obama's ""not gonna go after individual users"" policy (they simply don't have the resources.) At the very worst, they could even threaten to prosecute banks and other businesses that deal with pot retailers. The tough language and stance would put the onus on the states to keep on legalizing until the Feds relent.

 * As a result, we'd probably see a huge sell-off in the various cannabis stocks. Once the dust settled, however, it could create a huge long-term buying opportunity; I think it's just a matter of time before the surge at the state level overcomes the Federal opposition.

* *The best-case scenario:* Holder takes a lenient approach to the entire cannabis industry in CO and WA, calling the dogs off of any operation following state law and paving the way for the full retail stores that are going to rolling out in the near future. 
 * The cannabis sector would go bonkers at this news; it would effectively mean that the Feds have given up the war on Pot and left it as a States Rights issue. We could see an explosive rally similar to what happened after the election in November.

* *The Mixed Bag:* Holder issues a vague statement and basically punts, taking a continued wait-and-see approach, maybe with some softer language acknowledging the will of state voters while pointing out that it's up to Congress to legalize on a Federal level.
 * We'd probably see a corresponding mixed reaction in stocks. However, the lack of an iron-fist approach would be a promising sign for investors.

So that's what we're looking at. Unfortunately, I think the worst-case scenario is the most likely. Between the entrenched interests and the ridiculous international drug war treaties, Holder has no incentive to loosen up. The mixed scenario is also a strong possibility. The best-case, I think, is a long-shot.

Whatever happens, though, I don't think these decisions can get in the way of the cannabis sector's long-term growth. What would happen, for example, if CA, OR and other states legalize in 2014? Over time the Feds face an inevitable losing battle against rising support for legal marijuana. That, I think, is what makes the cannabis sector such a compelling investment.

Now to sit back and see what happens.

personalfinance,Paid my car off 13 months early!,"http://imgur.com/a/PK2Zz

Hello everyone! I've been reading this subreddit religiously for a little over a year. It was about that time I decided I didn't want to be saddled with car debt for the rest of my life. The monthly payment on my car was $375 at an interest rate of 15.49% (yikes!).

I tried refinancing but the car was a little too old with too many miles so I paid off my small college loans and rolled that payment into my car payment. On a given month I paid $200 to $300 above the minimum. The timing couldn't have been more perfect as my tax refund and work bonus came through at the same time. I had to pull a little from my emergency fund but now, I'm 100% debt free.

I'm lucky enough to be able to still live at home, so my next goals are to get the emergency fund to $4,000 then save aggressively ($1000 per month) for the foreseeable future. I am unsure of whether this will be for a house or to pay for a car in cash. It feels amazing to have that option!",finance,1362238506

personalfinance,Net Worth since Middle School,"[Here it is](http://i.imgur.com/DH6qdvP.png).

Over the holidays I found all my bank statements since October 2002. At the time I was in 6th grade. I thought it would be neat to graph out my net worth from then to now and share it with y'all.

A little bit of background about myself [note this is a throwaway account]. I come from a upper-middle class family in the central United States. I would guess that I saved over 80% of my income in my younger years. In middle school and high school I held a twice-per-week paper route that paid about $50/mo. I also did chores around the house (mowing, snow removal, cleaning, etc.) and got about $20/mo. In high school I held the paper route for another few years, but during the summer I would work as a lifeguard and would earn $2,000-$3,000 per summer. I still did chores around the house year-round and such.

College rolled around and I did my shopping and found a very cheap out-of-state public school that gave me about a 75% full ride (I had a parent graduate from that state's university system so I received a very good out-of-state deal to start). In the summer 2010 I got an awesome paid internship with the U.S. Federal Government via the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP). I also got a part-time undergraduate research assistanceship in summer 2011. These two combined allowed me file my first $10,000 gross income in the 2011 tax year.

I was able to graduate college 2 semesters early (thank you, AP and university test-out credits!). Last summer I was able to finish up some undergraduate research paid at a graduate-level rate that included traveling to other parts of the country I've never been to. I got accepted into a graduate program at an out-of-state public university in Fall 2012 that gives me a full tuition scholarship, as well as a 50% graduate research assistanceship that pays just over $20,000 a year.
One regret I have is that I didn't open my Roth IRA sooner. I turned 18 in 2009, but I guess we all know that timing the market is impossible. Right now I have about 40% of my net worth in a Roth IRA and/or TSP accounts, and 60% in checking/savings. My checking account earns over 2.5% APY with certain requirements (direct deposit, 12 debit transactions/month, e-statements).

personalfinance,"""hacking"" IBR?","Hello everyone, looking to get some advice from the federal student loan program gurus out there.  

I have significant graduate school debt and I've recently graduated.  My minimum payment every month is around $1000.  I qualify for IBR, but I haven't yet applied, as I've moved back in with my parents and the money that would be going towards rent is going towards the loan minimum.  My understanding under IBR is that, the minimum payment is set to interest only, and if you make even less, your minimum payment is set to less than interest only payments, and the government pays the remaining interest above your minimum payment.

As someone who qualifies for IBR, and can lower my payments from 1000 to 300ish, should I do it?  From what I understand, if I pay, say $1500 next month, and my minimum is 1000, I can elect to pay the excess to the principal of a specific loan (or all loans).  BUT, that 1000 minimum doesn't apply all to interest, it also puts about $600 of the payment towards the principal of all my loan groups evenly.  

I have 2 loan groups, 1 @ 6.8% and 1 @ 7.8%.  If I did IBR, I'd pay the interest, and then if I chose to pay more, I could put ALL of the remainder towards the principal of the 7.8% loan, making it a more efficient use of my funds.  

My question is, am I crazy? This seems like a great way for me to kill off the higher interest loans.  It might not be what the creators of the plan intended, but is there anything about my approach that seems like it wouldn't work?  Has anyone attempted this before?  Thoughts?


EDIT1: Ok, I don't think I was as clear as I could have been.  Current situation is a min. payment of 1000 under standard 10 year repayment. Lets say every month I pay the minimum.  Of this 1000 minimum payment, 350ish goes towards interest, and the rest of the minimum is split to pay down the principle of ALL the loans.  Since it is the minimum payment, you don't have the option to apply portions of the minimum to specific loan groups. So minimum payment = 1000.  350 of this is to interest.  325 goes to loan A and 325 goes to loan B.  

To my understanding, I should apply for IBR.  My minimum payment would be 350ish under this program according to their calculations.  My plan would be to continue paying 1000.  My question is this: if I do IBR, my payment is $350, and I pay 1000/month, does this mean I can pay 350 towards interest, and the remaining $650 can be allocated solely to the higher interest of my two loans?  Essentially, I'm paying the same amount monthly, but I have more power to allocate the money I'm paying, and can effectively pay my higher interest loan 2x as fast.

Bitcoin,"Why Cryptocurrencies will be more stable than any government-backed currency and any commodity, including gold.","When one learns about how to trade FOREX, the first thing they encounter is an explanation of the various factors that cause the relative value of currencies to move up and down.  Mostly this revolves around government-specific news (relating to central bank policies).  But besides that, there is the natural resources found in the geographic area where the currency is issued and used.  Take, for example, the Australian dollar.

The AUD had a much higher interest rate than other currencies partly because it is ""backed"" (albeit indirectly) by the local mining companies and the minerals in the ground in Australia.

The Swiss Franc is ""backed"" (albeit indirectly) by the huge amount of gold in Swiss vaults (relative their population).

The USD is ""backed"" by the powerful military and the OPEC oil cartel's persistence in pricing their oil in dollars.

So it stands to reason that this volatility we see between currencies will simply not exist in a world of internet cryptocurrencies, which aren't bound to any government or any local natural resources.  And that's a very exciting proposition!

personalfinance,Small Loan advice?,"I am looking for a loan of $2400. I currently owe $2400 on a loan but the interest is sky high and my payment is $406 monthly (which i can barley afford). I'm hardly making a dent in the loan itself. The company will not let me refinance under any circumstances. What I am looking to do is find a loan that will cover the $2400, lower my interest rate, and offer payments anywhere from $200-250 monthly. However, I know my credit score isn't pretty. I was out of work for a couple months, ended up taking a part time job for a few months, got a full time job and was released without notice, then worked part time again for a few months before landing the full time I have now. It's been a messy work situation for the past year but I have finally landed something steady. I have pay stubs to prove I'm making enough to make the payments, but is that enough? I know there are some small time car dealerships that say ""no credit, no problem"" and will approve almost anyone for a small amount of money, are these the same banks I should approach? Or do I not have a chance of getting what I'm looking for at all? Thank you in advance for your advice.",finance,1362432027
personalfinance,Using our Cash Savings to pay off Student Loans. Good idea?,"Hi everyone,

Background - My wife (29 yrs) and I (28 yrs) currently have good jobs making a combined gross salary of $190,000. We rent our apartment in HCOL area, no kids, pay into our 401k (roughly 11% of salary), and I also have an employer funded pension of 5%. 

We've managed to build up a cash savings of $55,000. We don't have any debt except for my federal Stafford student loans which currently totals $59,000 at 6.3%. 

I'm currently paying $800 a month towards the loans which should have them paid off around 8 years from now. I'm looking at the payment details and almost 40% of my payment goes towards interest. 

If we kept roughly 4 months of an emergency fund, I should be able to use $40,000 of our cash savings to pay down the student loan to about $20,000. And paying around what I'm paying now, I should be debt free in 2 years.

Am I being dumb for not doing this? This will obviously push back our ability to purchase a home and/or have kids, but I feel like we would be in a better position to do both without my student loans and with an extra $800 a month to spend on daycare/mortgage. 

What do you think? Thank you for your help!",finance,1362431943
personalfinance,How to get rid of repeated/identical hard inquiries on credit report?,"Not that this is a huge issue, my credit score is 730+, but it's still something that bothers me.

Last year I sought financing for a car purchase.  The entities in question are Bank of America and Capital One.  

I primarily was using these banks to get a better interest rate from my primary bank Wells Fargo.  To do this, I just entered my info, the car info and would get an offer from the bank within 24 hours.  It ended up working, as BoA gave me a little better rate, which Wells Fargo matched.

However, when I was looking for the best rates, I would sometimes change the numbers a bit, mainly the car price and loan amount to see if that would help at all in getting a better rate (and because I was unsure of which car I wanted yet).  So now instead of BoA and CO each having one inquiry into my credit, they each have 2 inquiries, with BoA's 2nd inquiry only 1 day after the first inquiry, and CO's less than a week after the initial inquiry.

So now I have 2 extra inquiries on my report, giving me a total of 7, instead of what should be (in my opinion) only 5.  I know the inquiries go away after 25 months, but I'd rather have 5 on my account instead of the 7 for obvious reasons.  Especially because on the chance in the future I apply for any other sort of credit.  I don't want creditors seeing 7 inquiries on my report.

Obviously those repeated inquiries pulled up the same information about me and my credit, so I don't know why they got repeated on my report.  But I'd still like to get rid of them.

Hopefully that made sense.  Any ideas?  I don't think I can just dispute it because freecreditreport.com says I can't dispute inquiries except for fraud, and I don't think that's the case here.

Just looking for any help.  Thanks in advance.",finance,1362427546

business,You Gon' Learn Today about how to create better sales and business relationships!,"You want to read this post ONLY if you're having trouble with your communication skills and want to make sure you want to get better to improve your business associations and sales. This post possesses an insane amount of content, I usually get money(thousands of dollars) to teach in a seminar, and it’s now yours for Free. So take advantage of this, take notes, and start practicing the communication skills illustrations I describe in this post…

If you want to see true communication skills, check out this story about my mentor who started out at the bottom, and has struggled and finally came up on top. Continue reading and click the link at the bottom...

Communication skills-Let me tell you a tale of how great they can really be…

I had been busy within my office performing the usual, just before working with customers, you know just rolling sheets of paper up and shooting three pointers from the back of the office into the small black waste can by the doorway. As I was pretending to become Coby Bryant, and just as I was ready to make the winning shot…

The phone begins ringing… RING… RING…

My eye darted to the phone and I very carefully started picking up the phone, and simply, as I had been putting the device to my ear, and i also started saying “Amir Speaking,”a common voice sang through the mobile phone with a “well, hello there Amir how are you?”

Hmm couldn’t place my finger on it, also it definitely didn’t seem like my ridiculous ex-girlfriend. I asked who had been speaking, and she said “you don’t remember me, It’s Liliana” in that same nice voice from before. Then a light dawned over me, and that i started remembering glimpses of our session together, and how awesome of a person she was…

I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a rainy afternoon when I got what seemed like the same call, that same voice rang in my ear, but it wasn’t as full of life. She explained to me some stuff that was occurring with her, and that she mentioned that she discovered me on the internet and felt required to travel all the way from Spain in order to come see me…

Exciting!

This hypnosis program was marvelous, and she left with a sense that her life would be different, and with a huge smile on her face, she walked out my office.

After zoning out for a bit thinking about this, I heard Liliana say something I really could hardly believe.

Something you'd never dream of in a zillion years.

Who knew after creating one decision a year ago I really could do something THIS HUGE by incorporating simple communication skills. It had been so freakin amazing that it actually started making me believe all this has been worth it. 

Some tears gently rolled down my cheek as I listened ever so carefully…

It made me remember what I’ve learned to get here…

So while you finish that final thought, I really want you to then imagine attaining something beyond your wildest goals. I want you to only pretend for a second, and picture yourself waking up in the morning, activating your computer and going to your internet banking account and find out that money has magically made an appearance there right away while you were sleeping. Well it might be just a little hard to imagine, so why don’t you merely imagine that for a minute more and if you are interested just click the link, read my blog, and click on the big red banner with my picture in it to see what this is all about!

The NLP Communication Model-The answer to understanding communication on a BRAND NEW level…

Let me offer you this example to know the design before I dissect it, and make it much more sensible.

The actual NLP Communication Model:
1. You take in information through the five senses: Seeing, hearing, sensation, smelling, as well as tasting
2. The information goes through your filters which are thinking, values, as well as past recollections and activities which creates our distinctive “map of the world.”
3. These filters Delete, Distort, and Generalize information about our truth of reality.
4. After you Delete, Distort, and Generalize you make inner representations and feel something inside.
5. These feelings develop a change in such things as your body language, facial expressions, voice tone, and skin tone color.

Communication skills instance 1:
Prospect’s Perspective: 1st person

I’m a possibility looking to buy a fresh new car. I see a car inside the lot that I absolutely love, and I believe that this vehicle is going to be the best thing for my family. I like it because it looks really sexy, it's got great mileage, and it also has the best accident safety therefore i know my family will be secure when we drive it together. A smile comes across my face and I inform you really excitedly I want this car and no other automobile, my chest is sticking out very pleased, my eyes are sparkling, my pupils are dilated from excitement. 

This follows the actual communication design: 
1. Very first, the person saw the car. 
2. Then I started to discuss my beliefs and beliefs with the salesman. 
3. After that I removed every other automobile from my thoughts besides the one I saw and liked. 
4. Following that I started feeling good after I imagined in being in that car with my family. 
5. Ultimately I was in the greatest mind-set because I was smiling and sticking my chest out, along with speaking very thirstily about buying it. 
6. The salesman could see In the event that if he has been paying attention i was ready to buy. 

This particular story proceeded to go step by step from the process that everyone goes through in any sale or perhaps creating any business relationship.

However…
It went down hill when the automobile salesman wasn’t focusing on this…

Communication Skills: instance 2

Car salesman’s viewpoint: 3rd person

The car salesperson looks at me personally, and is entirely desperate for the actual sale. He starts picturing his boss’s voice saying he’s terminated if he can’t sell a certain amount of automobiles by the end of the month, then he begins to think about his family and starts to remove the fact that the client is a consumer, he then  commences attacking him with his voice tone.

“You don’t want this vehicle there are still more better ones I didn’t explain to you yet.”

The car salesman actually starts to think about his family, and just how he won’t be able to put food on the table and this makes him start pitching . When he does this the customer doesn’t understand him, and he starts getting angrier because he views the client as somebody trying to destroy his livelyhood, not somebody who just desires to buy a car. This displays in the salesman’s tone of voice tone and the entire body language as the customer instantly feels he's being assaulted, and then refuses to buy virtually any car.

This again follows the actual communication model:

1. The vehicle sales guy sees the client, but really is actually desperate for the sale. 
2. The car salesman hears a voice in his head associated with his employer saying he’s fired unless he sold a certain model of automobile. 
3. This individual starts to distort, delete, and generalize the information he’s getting from the customer, and begins to think about really his own wants. 
4. He’s scared that with no employment he won’t be able to feed his family, understanding that makes him desperate and to start “Pitching.” 
5. He begins to get persistent and even irritated that this person in front associated with him will keep him from giving his loved ones a life, so he starts speaking over the customer 
6. These feelings starts to present in his tone of voice tone, as well as in his body gestures that he is much more attacking the consumer instead of supporting him. 

The prospect’s reaction to the actual communication with the Salesman…

My face starts to crinkle and appear confused, after which I tell him no and that I want this one. The car sales person then starts to try to “pitch” the other cars to me but I don’t like another automobile I want the main one I have my eye on. The salesman still pursues the idea that you will find better automobiles, and I start getting angry, the tone of my voice gets louder, and i also start inhaling and exhaling heavier. This person doesn’t care about what I want, he or she only in fact cares about making money. I get fed up and leave with out buying anything at all.

Two factors of the tale, but now the truth is...

Instance: Communication Skills Aligned

Whenever your communication abilities are aimed, a great connection forms and then the foundation of the particular sales process can begin. Fundamentally it goes such as this:

You will consume some kind of information from one of your five sensory faculties, and then it must go through your own filters which can be your “map of the world,” and another way to explain that is it’s what you believe, what values you have, and stuff like that. You then distort, delete, or make generalizations based on your life encounters and what’s vital to you. Currently this is almost all going on it influences the pictures you make up or imagine in your mind, and then you show what you really are feeling inside by such things as your body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice.

Now, if you can pay attention to one of the 7 steps mentioned compared to you will start to notice how you start thinking and just what things to state that will get people to buy, even when they seem to be difficult prospects to warm up. This is because you are not promoting them, you are actually just aligning with what they want and then you are assisting them have it. Think of being a good Samaritan, as well as helping an old lady across the road 

So What’s the rest of the story…

I’ll let you know in part 2 where I'll show you how utilizing these communication skills instance in this article and demonstrate how to use exactly what you’ve learned and also apply it simply and effectively to any sale or.... !

I know it’s the cliff hanger...

So, here's the situation. My parents have been divorced since I was little. I grew up in a fairly expensive area, and my dad stuck around to stay close to my sister and me. So technically was choosing to live in a more expensive place to be close to us. But now, I've graduated from college and am living in another state, and my dad is still stuck there, trying to get by. He ended up getting about six months behind on rent, and just recently got evicted from his apartment... He landed in an apartment that is actually a little cheaper than the one he got evicted from, but it's about half an hour further from his work and is in an even more expensive area.

I'm really worried about him... The problem is, he is a damn proud man, and won't take money, and what's more, he's still offering to help pay for school loans. It even came to the point where he tried to give my sister and me money for school when we were visiting home, and we had to leave the money stuffed into his car seat just so he wouldn't find it until after we were gone. I have told him that I don't want him to even think about helping for loans until he's okay himself financially, but he just gets mad when I bring it up.

I want to do something for him, but I'm trying to think of a way to help him without just handing him money and having him get mad and give it right back. :-/ Any ideas?",finance,1362403935

12. Buying a home with cash is the best option, if you have the money.
Covering a home purchase with cash is in vogue. With the housing market heating up, the tactic may help a buyer win a bidding war—and the idea of not living under a mortgage can be appealing.


But going with cash isn't always the best financial choice. Mortgage-interest payments can be deducted on your tax return, which can save you a bundle. Then there's the opportunity cost of handing over that much money. Some people prefer to invest the money they would have spent on the home purchase, **betting** it will earn a higher return than the interest rate on the mortgage when considering the tax deduction, says Jimmy Lee, a financial adviser in **Las Vegas, Nev.**

gaming,What was your saddest/most rage inducing experience in gaming?,"Here's mine. Happened when I was 11.

It was a sunny afternoon. The flowers bloomed in their myriad of colors, the monastery was stately, comforting…safe. I stood amongst a quaint cabbage patch, thousands of gold pieces jingling in my pocket, the loot of many goblin raids stuffed into my backpack. I stood there, pensive, reflecting upon the slaughter, the effortless slaughter. Ah, how I would slay the goblins…sometimes I cringe at the sheer amount fear I must have invoked in their souls. My adamantine blade was the thing of nightmares, I’m sure of it. My armor…why I must have been insurmountable demon in their eyes. 

Suddenly, from the edge of the great wilderness, an archer swiftly appeared. He looked strong, experienced, why he had emitted an aura of dominance as he approached. I was weary. Without even the exchange of mere pleasantries, he demanded that I follow him. He turned his back on me, leaving as swiftly as he came. 

I stood there, stunned at his audacity. Yet, at the same time, I yearned for the adventure, I desired to venture into the unknown. What should fear? I was the vanquisher of countless hordes, I was a monstrosity, a blade-wielding demon, a-

“You coming bro?”

That magnetic voice pulled me from my pompous thoughts. Alas, it coaxed me, it beckoned me forward; it was reassuring, it was gentle, it was...safe. For a moment I stood on edge, yet I could feel my footsteps wishing to follow his. A trickle of sweat went down my cheek, my pumping heart slowed.

I had made my choice. My final decision.

But I absolutely loI'm also fed up with the amount of user reviews everywhere that just regurgitate the same points over and over again when it is clear that a lot of these people have not even played the game. I can sum up a lot of these user reviews a few bullet points:
- Online always DRM.
- 2x2 km city lot.
- Origin.
- Can't access servers on launch day.
- 1/10 rating

These are all valid points but there is a big problem, very few people are actually commenting on the actual gameplay. It's either you love the game and get flamed for it or join the EA Hate bandwagon. 

So I implore you, as a long time gamer and huge Sim City fan, can we have a discussion about the pros and cons of the gameplay? If online always DRM really hurts the game that's fine but balance it against the positives as well. 

I am very undecided on the Sim City series because I've been a huge fan since Sim City 2000 but I am wary based on these negative rants. So I'd like to know how the gameplay really is from people who've invested time into it rather than simply saying the game is garbage because of Origin/DRM.",technology,1362527733

Last year I amortized the full maximum of 10% of the loan, and then another additional 10% when the loan period was renewed. Something I have come to realize lately, however, is that I might (?) be fooling myself into believing it's worth paying down my my mortgage any further, expecting relatively low interest rates for a few years - would it be wiser to keep my debt at roughly 50% of asset value, and make longterm investments instead? I'm also looking at the possibilities of saving money to start my own business or support my living for an extended time of voluntary or involuntary unemployment. 

What do you think, should i stop amortizing, or maybe even call the bank and ask to increase my mortgage again, to free some capital? It is worth noting that in Sweden, we can deduct 30% of house mortgage interest. Ideas, opinions?",finance,1362521687

""Who knew the master gaming race was full of a bunch on cry babies. Yes the game has always on DRM. Yes you have to install Orgin. I just don't see the problem. It is 2013 people you should have good internet service. The game is fun and you can play by yourself or other people. I believe game companies have a right to protect themselves from grog drinking skalliewags. Just one true gamers opinion, but hey what do I know I have only been gaming since the commodore 64 days.""




**Reply from N.P.C.:**

Well ""your highness"" I think people are a tad miffed at the fact you have to always be online even if you're playing single player and hooked into EA's servers. Plus you get debacles like *right now*, where people can't play the single player game because servers are screwed up. You can even have situations where one city is on a server, that server goes down or is unresponsive, so the next time you try playing your game and all your progress is *gone.* At that point you can only hope the server is just down temporarily. 

From another ""true gamer"" who's been playing since the 80's, I can tell you this severely limits playability down the road as well, seeing as EA has been known for shutting down servers for games barely even 2 years old if they don't continue to sell and provide them with money. Which makes sense for them. Except you can go and play any other SimCity game right now, years and years later. This thing? Maybe you can play it in 10 years if EA releases a patch. But then that would mean they have to admit being constantly online is purely DRM, and not a requirement due to their servers handling the processing load or whatever like they are now. 

As for this actually stopping pirates? Nope. Pirates are gonna pirate. And this actually makes a strong case FOR driving people to pirate, because I guarantee you the pirated version will run on individual computers and without forcing the user online with no control over their game. And make no mistake this will be cracked within a week or two; no always online DRM has stopped pirates. I don't advocate piracy, but I tell you it's a real kick in the teeth when pirates can play the game better than legitimate users. 

I'm certain this is going to do nothing to persuade EA to change their ways. More people will pirate this, EA will point to that fact as the reason they need harsher DRM, and so in the end they end up screwing only their paying customers with the new harsher DRM while pirates continue to pirate.",technology,1362502428

Mens det er lett å tenke på cyber kriminelle som ansiktsløs, digital lommetyver i fjerntliggende land, realiteten er at er de blant oss.

Au!

Designet for den gjennomsnittlige computer brukeren, denne SANS Institute e-nyhetsbrev (Registrer deg på sans.org) fokuserer på en trussel per utgave og gir folk bør gjøre for å beskytte seg. Det er en utmerket arbeidstaker bevissthet verktøy.

På minst at selskapet hadde en network security plan. Mange andre ikke. Ifølge en 2012 landsomfattende studie av små bedrifter av digital sikkerhet har fast Symantec og National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), 83 prosent av små bedrifter ingen formell cyber sikkerhetsplan, mens 69 prosent mangel selv en uformell. I mellomtiden, 71 prosent er avhengig av Internett for daglige operasjoner, men nesten halvparten tror data hacks er isolerte hendelser som ikke vil ha innvirkning på sin virksomhet.

De kunne ikke være mer feil. Ifølge Symantec/NCSA forskning fra 2011 - den siste år med tilgjengelige--cyber-angrep koster små og mellomstore bedrifter et gjennomsnitt på $188,242, og nesten to tredjedeler av utsatt selskaper blir tvunget ut av business innen seks måneder for å bli angrepet.

Det trenger ikke å være på denne måten. Det beste forsvaret mot nettkriminalitet gjør hackere svette for sine Kandahar. Ifølge en Verizon studie av data brudd i 2011 var mer enn 80 prosent av ofrene mål av opportunity - noe som betyr at de ikke beskytte sine Wi-Fi-systemer med passord og ellers hadde dårlig sikkerhet, hvis noen i det hele tatt. Så gjør deg selv en vanskelig mål og sikre bedriften med disse seks trinn.
Å kryptere dataene.

Enten det er banken ruting sifrene, kredittkortkontoer eller Ansattes personnummer, er denne typen lang-gestating selskapet holdt informasjon hva hackere bruker å stjele penger. – Når som helst du lagrer viktige data, når dataene er i hvile - noe som betyr at det ikke er som overføres over Internett liksom--du ønsker det kryptert, sier Steve Cullen, chief administrerende direktør av worldwide markedsføring SMB og.Cloud på Symantec, som setter ut Norton anti-virus programvare.

Lance Spitzner, en instruktøren på SANS Institute, en Baltimore-basert garanti forskning og utdanning firmaet, anbefaler å slå på full-disk krypteringsverktøy som kommer som standard på de fleste aktuelle operativsystemer. (På Windows-baserte PCer, funksjonen kalles BitLocker, på Macs det kalles FileVault.) Aktivere funksjonen tar bare et få minutter; en gang på, det vil kryptere hver fil og programmet på stasjonen med ingen merkbar ytelse lag. Men det er en catch: krypteringen gjelder bare når brukerne er logget ut av datamaskinen. Det betyr at hackere kan fortsatt angripe gjennom virus og malware mens systemet kjører. Innstillingen datamaskiner automatisk logger etter 15 minutter uten bruk hjelper håndheve dette tiltaket.

Verste fall hvis du ikke følger disse prosedyrene? Du kryptere ikke stasjoner, men en djevelsk hacker gjør. Ved å bryte inn i nettverk og kryptere bedrifter data, har noen cyber kriminelle holdt selskaper gissel nesten, krevende en løsepenge i bytte for passordet.

Sikre maskinvaren.

Av Seattle-området-selskaper som ble hacket, hadde mer enn 40 sine fysiske lokaler som er brutt opp av innbruddstyver som tok elektronisk utstyr. I ett tilfelle nappet gjengen mer enn $300.000 i servere, bærbare datamaskiner, mobiltelefoner og andre elementer. Overvåkningskamera registrert dem ved hjelp av Håndkjerrer for å hale massevis av utstyr til en van firetimers tildelingsperioden.

Tyver som ikke er skremt av av sikkerhetsalarmer og bevegelsesdetektorer, gjør fysisk låse ned datamaskiner jobben sin tøffere. Få folk mate en kabel gjennom datamaskinens Kensington lås porten (små metall loopen funnet på de fleste bærbare og stasjonære enheter) å sikre den til deres pulten. Jada, de er relativt enkelt for en tyv å omgå, men den ekstra innsatsen kan spissen oddsen i din favør. ""Som litt tid er noe kriminelle vanligvis ikke ønsker å ta,"" sier Cullen. ""Tid er fienden for noen bryte inn i en fysiske lokaler.""

Gjøre nettverkslagring tryggere ved hjelp av Kensington-låser eller ansette mer robust løsninger, som rack-montering maskinvare og holde serveren dørene lukket og låst. Vancouver, Wash.-basert CRU-DataPort gjør flere servere som kan være sikret med låser, USB-sikkerhetsnøkler og selv isenkram-basert krypteringen, sikrer at hvis stasjoner er stjålet, vil de være ubrukelig til tyvene.

Det er også sporingsprogramvare - viktig hvis bedriften din drives av mobile bærbare i-feltet. Sporing firmaet Prey bruker en rekke metoder for å finne alt fra en mobiltelefon til en server, passord-sikring maskinen hvis den går mangler og selv knipser og sende bilder av tyven hvis den stjålne enheten har et webkamera. Lav per måned priser gjør små, skjulte programmet en må-Installer for alle enheter som kan få tilgang til data og selskapet bedriftsnettverk.

Låse nettverket.

Mange hacking ofrene er kompromittert via Wi-Fi-nettverk, gjennom en teknikk som kalles ""wardriving."" I biler utstyrt med kraftige antenner, hacker gjenger kjøre rundt byer, skanning for ulåst eller dårlig beskyttet nettverk. Når en sårbar Wi-Fi-aktiveringspunktet er funnet, er skurkene så god som i selskapets inngangsdøren, scouring maskiner på nettverket for passord og økonomiske data.

Det beste forsvaret mot utnyttelser som wardriving er å ha ingen trådløsnettverk i det hele tatt. Kablede nettverk, mens mindre allsidig, er sikrere, fordi brukere har tilgang til dem ved enten koble til fysisk utsalg eller hacking modemporter. Men hvis firmaet må ha et trådløst nettverk, kan du deaktivere funksjonen service set identifier (SSID) kringkasting på den trådløse ruteren. Dette skaper et usynlig eller skjulte nettverk, usynlig for casual Wi-Fi snoops og tilgjengelig bare for brukere med det nøyaktige nettverksnavnet. Små bedrifter som kafeer kan også gjøre dette - bare periodisk nettverkets endringsinformasjon og plassere en liten sign nær registrere deg med gjeldende nettverksnavn og passord.

Hvis du bruker Wi-Fi, kan du oppdatere det til den for nyeste krypteringen. Noen Seattle wardriving ofrene hadde aktivert Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), en enkelt sprakk algoritme som falt i unåde nesten 10 år siden, og tenkte nettverkene var sikker. WPA2, den gjeldende standarden, har en lengre krypteringsnøkkelen som er vanskeligere å bryte seg inn i. For å gjøre dataene enda sikrere, kan du opprette en tull passord med store bokstaver, tall og spesialtegn. Sier Cullen, ""De ville trenger en datamaskin jobber med det for en million år å knekke koden.""

[ Relatert: http://chirpstory.com/li/57190 ]


Installere anti-malware og anti-virus beskyttelse.

Når wardrivers er vellykket i cracking et trådløst nettverk, kan de logge inn og infisere tilkoblede datamaskiner med skadelig programvare eller virus. Men det tar ikke en Wi-Fi-tilkobling for å plante denne programvaren; spam e-post og skadelige nettsteder Skyv den til datamaskiner hele tiden, og hvis innsatsen er vellykket, malware kan installere kode som kjører i bakgrunnen, fange tastetrykk og påloggingsinformasjonen og videresending det for hackere. Ifølge Verizons studie, malware ble brukt i nesten halvparten av data brudd i 2010, og var ansvarlig for nesten 80 prosent av poster stjålet.

""Det er sannsynligvis nr. 1 money-generere teknikken skurkene bruke,"" sier SANS Institute's Spitzner. ""Hver gang du besøker alle typer nettsted som krever et brukernavn og passord - Facebook, banken din, lønn, uansett - malware vil høste din informasjon og sende den til slemmingen,"" sier han. ""Skurken vil ta til høyre rundt, Logg inn som du og gjøre alle hans onde ting.""

De fleste malware installeres gjennom nettverket sikkerhet hacks, men å være årvåken om cyberkriminalitet er like mye om å forutse trusler som det er å forsvare mot dagens. E-phishing, etterligning og apps som tilgang til sosiale medier-kontoer er dukker opp med økende regularitet. Lasting anti-malware og anti-virus beskyttelse på maskiner - som går for mobile enheter samt-- og kjører det etter hver software installert kan bidra til å sikre disse truslene ikke ta. Også, holde programmer og maskinvare oppdatert--fra oppgraderer til nyere rutere og datamaskiner å umiddelbart installere nettleseren oppdaterer--blokker skadelig ormer som trives i eldre utstyr og utdatert programvare.

Utdanne dine ansatte.

Hvis en datamaskin på nettverket blir svekket--om inntrenging kom fra en intern fantasy-fotball på e-post eller via en skammelige Facebook-app som administrator HR klikket på lunsj - er hele operasjonen i faresonen. ""Du ikke skal være eneste årvåken om å beskytte din og din kundenes opplysninger,"" sier Symantecs Cullen. ""Ansatte skal være på utkikk, og du som en small-business eier bør være der for å gi dem noen retningslinjer.""

For eksempel forhindre ansatte fra åpne e-postvedlegg eller klikke på koblinger som ikke hører til Selskapets forretning. Eller begrense personlig e-posttilgang til personlig smartphones via den ansattes trådløs forbindelse, ikke selskapet Wi-Fi.

Leie sikkerhet.

Verve ekspert utenfor kan forbedre dine sjanser til å avlede et angrep. Selv om det kan virke counterintuitive, kan små bedrifter begrense sin eksponering til cyber kriminelle ved å signere på med Internett-basert datasikkerhet leverandører--spesielt som kvaliteten på skybaserte forretningstjenester utvikler seg. ""De kan avlaste mange av byrdene som en liten bedrift, ærlig, ikke vil håndtere,"" sier Cullen, som drev sitt eget selskap før han begynte i Symantec. ""Jeg vet det var ikke noe jeg ønsket å bruke to minutter tenker.""

Men gjør leksene dine: lese leverandørens vilkår og betingelser for å avgjøre hvem som er faktisk er ansvarlig for å beskytte dine data. For eksempel, med online kredittkort-prosessorer, kontroller at de overholder betaling kortet industrien Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) krav; ellers, du kunne være på kroken for kundenes skader hvis du få hacket.

På ekstreme slutten, kan du flytte ansvar for teknologiinfrastrukturen til en administrert tjenesteleverandør (MSP) som vil opprettholde og sikre selskapets systemer eksternt. MSP vil være ansvarlig for sikkerhetskopiering av filer på sine servere, oppdatere brannmurer, kryptere data og gjør at alt er knirkefritt.

Og når ting går dårlig, det vil ta hit for skader.

Tilbake i Seattle, politiet endelig nab gruppen bak utslett av cyber tyverier. Og de gjorde det gjennom gammeldags detektivarbeid. Ett medlem av gjengen ble fanget ved hjelp av en stjålet gavekort, løftet under en office-innbrudd. Han ble arrestert på en vinbar og førte politiet til en antenne montert Mercedes, og til slutt til hans to medskyldige. Dømt sist sommer, tre nå betjener et kombinert 22 år i fengsel, og vil måtte betale oppreisning til ofrene.

""Utover svindel og fysisk skade, er det kostnader uten en prislapp: brudd på følelse av sikkerhet for sine kunder, ansatte og eiere,"" bemerket rettsforfølge U.S. advokat Jenny Durkan. Ikke å nevne drømmene om de mange gründere som ble satt ut av business.

Du har blitt hacket. Nå hva?

Advarselen tegn er klart: Hvis du ser en stor pengeoverføring skal en konto i Russland eller et annet sted der du ikke har virksomhet (i ett Seattle tilfelle, var det North Dakota), ta kontakt med banken din umiddelbart. ""Jo tidligere du identifisere en hendelse, jo mer sannsynlig vil du få tilbake pengene dine eller minimere skaden,"" sier Lance Spitzner, en instruktøren på Baltimore's SANS Institute.

Hvis selskapets datamaskiner er stjålet eller tuklet med, kan du ringe det lokale politiet. De kanskje vet om lignende hendelser, kan undersøke dypere og vil kontakte aktuelle myndigheter, inkludert FBI og Secret Service, som opprettholder en electronic kriminalitet task force. Men det viktigste, ved første tegn på alle forstyrrelse, endre din passord og hold et øye med din saldoer, fra business midler til ansatte og personlige kontoer.

Hvordan å beskytte små bedrifter mot en Cyber-angrep cruse associates tips and reviews

Seattle hacker kjørte en svart Mercedes. Han eide en Rolex. Han likte å hyppig en sentrum vinbar. Mens det er lett å tenke på cyber kriminelle som ansiktsløs, digital lommetyver i fjerntliggende land, realiteten er at er de blant oss. I ett beryktet tilfelle kompromittert en banditt og hans gjeng cyber crooks minst 53 Seattle-området-små og mellomstore bedrifter mellom 2008 og 2010, stjele nok data til å forårsake $3 millioner i erstatning til selskapene, sine ansatte og deres kunder.
""Dette var ikke typen kriminalitet som vi forventet,"" sa tech selskap ansatt Alec Fishburne på en pressekonferanse (der Seattle ofrene avtalt å bli identifisert, men spurte at deres bedrifter være anonym). Gjengen hacket Fishburne firmaet fra en annen kontor i høyblokk. Han ble klar over brudd etter å merke noen uvanlige finansielle transaksjoner. ""Det var svært urovekkende for en liten bedrift... å lure på om det var noen interne misligheter eller underslag skjer, sier han til pressen.
	
En annen Seattle selskapet ble hacket etter sin gamle bærbare PC var stjålet i en office-innbrudd; om en måned senere, var det overførte midler gjennom falske lønnskontoer. Et tredje offer hadde identiteten til nesten alle sine ansatte stjålet når hacker gjengen sprakk selskapets nettverkssikkerhet. ""Det er enraging, fordi du tror du har et system som er til å fungere,"" sa selskapets president. ""Disse gutta er virkelig smart og ambisiøse, og det er en tøff kombinasjon.""Bo Smart.

Krebs på sikkerhet

På KrebsonSecurity.com tidligere Washington Post reporter Brian Krebs Blogger om utviklingen i online kriminalitet, sikkerhetsoppdateringer og data brudd. Ikke Les dette før sengetid; det vil gi deg mareritt.

OnGuardOnline

OnGuardOnline.gov, en e-nyhetsbrev og nettside administrert av Federal Trade Commission, er en stor ressurs for å finne måter å bo trygt. OnGuard forklare konsepter i termer som er lett å forstå, og har informasjon som er skreddersydd for små bedrifter.

Au!

Designet for den gjennomsnittlige computer brukeren, denne SANS Institute e-nyhetsbrev (Registrer deg på sans.org) fokuserer på en trussel per utgave og gir folk bør gjøre for å beskytte seg. Det er en utmerket arbeidstaker bevissthet verktøy.

På minst at selskapet hadde en network security plan. Mange andre ikke. Ifølge en 2012 landsomfattende studie av små bedrifter av digital sikkerhet har fast Symantec og National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), 83 prosent av små bedrifter ingen formell cyber sikkerhetsplan, mens 69 prosent mangel selv en uformell. I mellomtiden, 71 prosent er avhengig av Internett for daglige operasjoner, men nesten halvparten tror data hacks er isolerte hendelser som ikke vil ha innvirkning på sin virksomhet.

De kunne ikke være mer feil. Ifølge Symantec/NCSA forskning fra 2011 - den siste år med tilgjengelige--cyber-angrep koster små og mellomstore bedrifter et gjennomsnitt på $188,242, og nesten to tredjedeler av utsatt selskaper blir tvunget ut av business innen seks måneder for å bli angrepet.

Det trenger ikke å være på denne måten. Det beste forsvaret mot nettkriminalitet gjør hackere svette for sine Kandahar. Ifølge en Verizon studie av data brudd i 2011 var mer enn 80 prosent av ofrene mål av opportunity - noe som betyr at de ikke beskytte sine Wi-Fi-systemer med passord og ellers hadde dårlig sikkerhet, hvis noen i det hele tatt. Så gjør deg selv en vanskelig mål og sikre bedriften med disse seks trinn.
Å kryptere dataene.

Enten det er banken ruting sifrene, kredittkortkontoer eller Ansattes personnummer, er denne typen lang-gestating selskapet holdt informasjon hva hackere bruker å stjele penger. – Når som helst du lagrer viktige data, når dataene er i hvile - noe som betyr at det ikke er som overføres over Internett liksom--du ønsker det kryptert, sier Steve Cullen, chief administrerende direktør av worldwide markedsføring SMB og.Cloud på Symantec, som setter ut Norton anti-virus programvare.

Lance Spitzner, en instruktøren på SANS Institute, en Baltimore-basert garanti forskning og utdanning firmaet, anbefaler å slå på full-disk krypteringsverktøy som kommer som standard på de fleste aktuelle operativsystemer. (På Windows-baserte PCer, funksjonen kalles BitLocker, på Macs det kalles FileVault.) Aktivere funksjonen tar bare et få minutter; en gang på, det vil kryptere hver fil og programmet på stasjonen med ingen merkbar ytelse lag. Men det er en catch: krypteringen gjelder bare når brukerne er logget ut av datamaskinen. Det betyr at hackere kan fortsatt angripe gjennom virus og malware mens systemet kjører. Innstillingen datamaskiner automatisk logger etter 15 minutter uten bruk hjelper håndheve dette tiltaket.

Verste fall hvis du ikke følger disse prosedyrene? Du kryptere ikke stasjoner, men en djevelsk hacker gjør. Ved å bryte inn i nettverk og kryptere bedrifter data, har noen cyber kriminelle holdt selskaper gissel nesten, krevende en løsepenge i bytte for passordet.

Sikre maskinvaren.

Av Seattle-området-selskaper som ble hacket, hadde mer enn 40 sine fysiske lokaler som er brutt opp av innbruddstyver som tok elektronisk utstyr. I ett tilfelle nappet gjengen mer enn $300.000 i servere, bærbare datamaskiner, mobiltelefoner og andre elementer. Overvåkningskamera registrert dem ved hjelp av Håndkjerrer for å hale massevis av utstyr til en van firetimers tildelingsperioden.

Tyver som ikke er skremt av av sikkerhetsalarmer og bevegelsesdetektorer, gjør fysisk låse ned datamaskiner jobben sin tøffere. Få folk mate en kabel gjennom datamaskinens Kensington lås porten (små metall loopen funnet på de fleste bærbare og stasjonære enheter) å sikre den til deres pulten. Jada, de er relativt enkelt for en tyv å omgå, men den ekstra innsatsen kan spissen oddsen i din favør. ""Som litt tid er noe kriminelle vanligvis ikke ønsker å ta,"" sier Cullen. ""Tid er fienden for noen bryte inn i en fysiske lokaler.""

Gjøre nettverkslagring tryggere ved hjelp av Kensington-låser eller ansette mer robust løsninger, som rack-montering maskinvare og holde serveren dørene lukket og låst. Vancouver, Wash.-basert CRU-DataPort gjør flere servere som kan være sikret med låser, USB-sikkerhetsnøkler og selv isenkram-basert krypteringen, sikrer at hvis stasjoner er stjålet, vil de være ubrukelig til tyvene.

Det er også sporingsprogramvare - viktig hvis bedriften din drives av mobile bærbare i-feltet. Sporing firmaet Prey bruker en rekke metoder for å finne alt fra en mobiltelefon til en server, passord-sikring maskinen hvis den går mangler og selv knipser og sende bilder av tyven hvis den stjålne enheten har et webkamera. Lav per måned priser gjør små, skjulte programmet en må-Installer for alle enheter som kan få tilgang til data og selskapet bedriftsnettverk.

Låse nettverket.

Mange hacking ofrene er kompromittert via Wi-Fi-nettverk, gjennom en teknikk som kalles ""wardriving."" I biler utstyrt med kraftige antenner, hacker gjenger kjøre rundt byer, skanning for ulåst eller dårlig beskyttet nettverk. Når en sårbar Wi-Fi-aktiveringspunktet er funnet, er skurkene så god som i selskapets inngangsdøren, scouring maskiner på nettverket for passord og økonomiske data.

Det beste forsvaret mot utnyttelser som wardriving er å ha ingen trådløsnettverk i det hele tatt. Kablede nettverk, mens mindre allsidig, er sikrere, fordi brukere har tilgang til dem ved enten koble til fysisk utsalg eller hacking modemporter. Men hvis firmaet må ha et trådløst nettverk, kan du deaktivere funksjonen service set identifier (SSID) kringkasting på den trådløse ruteren. Dette skaper et usynlig eller skjulte nettverk, usynlig for casual Wi-Fi snoops og tilgjengelig bare for brukere med det nøyaktige nettverksnavnet. Små bedrifter som kafeer kan også gjøre dette - bare periodisk nettverkets endringsinformasjon og plassere en liten sign nær registrere deg med gjeldende nettverksnavn og passord.

Hvis du bruker Wi-Fi, kan du oppdatere det til den for nyeste krypteringen. Noen Seattle wardriving ofrene hadde aktivert Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), en enkelt sprakk algoritme som falt i unåde nesten 10 år siden, og tenkte nettverkene var sikker. WPA2, den gjeldende standarden, har en lengre krypteringsnøkkelen som er vanskeligere å bryte seg inn i. For å gjøre dataene enda sikrere, kan du opprette en tull passord med store bokstaver, tall og spesialtegn. Sier Cullen, ""De ville trenger en datamaskin jobber med det for en million år å knekke koden.""

[ Relatert: http://chirpstory.com/li/57190 ]


Installere anti-malware og anti-virus beskyttelse.

Når wardrivers er vellykket i cracking et trådløst nettverk, kan de logge inn og infisere tilkoblede datamaskiner med skadelig programvare eller virus. Men det tar ikke en Wi-Fi-tilkobling for å plante denne programvaren; spam e-post og skadelige nettsteder Skyv den til datamaskiner hele tiden, og hvis innsatsen er vellykket, malware kan installere kode som kjører i bakgrunnen, fange tastetrykk og påloggingsinformasjonen og videresending det for hackere. Ifølge Verizons studie, malware ble brukt i nesten halvparten av data brudd i 2010, og var ansvarlig for nesten 80 prosent av poster stjålet.

""Det er sannsynligvis nr. 1 money-generere teknikken skurkene bruke,"" sier SANS Institute's Spitzner. ""Hver gang du besøker alle typer nettsted som krever et brukernavn og passord - Facebook, banken din, lønn, uansett - malware vil høste din informasjon og sende den til slemmingen,"" sier han. ""Skurken vil ta til høyre rundt, Logg inn som du og gjøre alle hans onde ting.""

De fleste malware installeres gjennom nettverket sikkerhet hacks, men å være årvåken om cyberkriminalitet er like mye om å forutse trusler som det er å forsvare mot dagens. E-phishing, etterligning og apps som tilgang til sosiale medier-kontoer er dukker opp med økende regularitet. Lasting anti-malware og anti-virus beskyttelse på maskiner - som går for mobile enheter samt-- og kjører det etter hver software installert kan bidra til å sikre disse truslene ikke ta. Også, holde programmer og maskinvare oppdatert--fra oppgraderer til nyere rutere og datamaskiner å umiddelbart installere nettleseren oppdaterer--blokker skadelig ormer som trives i eldre utstyr og utdatert programvare.

Utdanne dine ansatte.

Hvis en datamaskin på nettverket blir svekket--om inntrenging kom fra en intern fantasy-fotball på e-post eller via en skammelige Facebook-app som administrator HR klikket på lunsj - er hele operasjonen i faresonen. ""Du ikke skal være eneste årvåken om å beskytte din og din kundenes opplysninger,"" sier Symantecs Cullen. ""Ansatte skal være på utkikk, og du som en small-business eier bør være der for å gi dem noen retningslinjer.""

Beholde ansatte informert om trusler gjennom kort e-post eller på periodiske møter ledet av IT-ekspert. Det første trinnet, er imidlertid å skrive ut en formell company Internett policy, innstillingen akseptabel og forbudt nettbaserte aktiviteter for ansatte, en øvelse som en distressingly liten 10 prosent av selskapene følger, i henhold til Symantec/NCSA. For eksempel forhindre ansatte fra åpne e-postvedlegg eller klikke på koblinger som ikke hører til Selskapets forretning. Eller begrense personlig e-posttilgang til personlig smartphones via den ansattes trådløs forbindelse, ikke selskapet Wi-Fi.

Leie sikkerhet.

Verve ekspert utenfor kan forbedre dine sjanser til å avlede et angrep. Selv om det kan virke counterintuitive, kan små bedrifter begrense sin eksponering til cyber kriminelle ved å signere på med Internett-basert datasikkerhet leverandører--spesielt som kvaliteten på skybaserte forretningstjenester utvikler seg. ""De kan avlaste mange av byrdene som en liten bedrift, ærlig, ikke vil håndtere,"" sier Cullen, som drev sitt eget selskap før han begynte i Symantec. ""Jeg vet det var ikke noe jeg ønsket å bruke to minutter tenker.""

Men gjør leksene dine: lese leverandørens vilkår og betingelser for å avgjøre hvem som er faktisk er ansvarlig for å beskytte dine data. For eksempel, med online kredittkort-prosessorer, kontroller at de overholder betaling kortet industrien Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) krav; ellers, du kunne være på kroken for kundenes skader hvis du få hacket.

På ekstreme slutten, kan du flytte ansvar for teknologiinfrastrukturen til en administrert tjenesteleverandør (MSP) som vil opprettholde og sikre selskapets systemer eksternt.

personalfinance,"After 4+ years of overwhelming debt, I am finally free!","A little success story about the last 4+ turbulent financial years of my life.  

My Wife and I separated in 2007 for a short while. During this time she got into some legal trouble and things were looking pretty grim. Thankfully, I had a stable job making enough income to work with the aftermath which is as follows:  

* 10k credit card debt to pay her legal fees, avoiding jail (they kept on poping up)  
* 8k court fees  
* 2k misc fees
* 12k credit card  
* 12k car loan  
* 20k car loan  
* underwater mortgage (not by much)  

The plan was when she got out of prison, she was going to get a job and we would work to pay of this debt quickly.  She got pregnant before she was able to find a job. We both agree the amount of money she would make after child care would not be enough to justify having someone else raise our child. During the next 4 years we had another child and I got my degree (tuition assistance and great health care made this not as much of a expense).  

I made sure I made every payment on all of our debt. I paid of the lawyer first. focused on the highest interest credit card. Then used a tax return to pay off the lowest car loan for the feeling of accomplishment and morale. Then finished paying off the other credit card. Refinanced my mortgate last year and got a low interest rate and reduced payments. I just received my tax return for this year and finished off the other car, and I am proud to say I sent my last check to pay off the last debt that we have (besides the mortgage).  

It was a trying time for me, and the one thing I have learned is NEVER again. For anyone overwhelmed in debt, it is possible, and its a really great feeling when you are done, and I like to thing that I have learned more from the experience than never again.

Here are my short term plans for now:  

* Save up 6 mos of expenses and put it away somewhere where I can get a decent return, but can access if needed.  

* put 200 extra towards principle on house a month  

* Put 400 a month in my 401k  

* put half of wahtever is leftover for shot-term discretionary spending and the other half into some other investments

Now, herein lies my problem. I can only envision delinquency rates rising over the next few years. But, the company can simply shove off any bad loans onto the government since all student loans are federally backed. If (or in my mind, when) these loans begin to show higher delinquency rates, I'm thinking Sallie Mae will go the way of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

While I see a great number of parallels to the housing bubble, I worry that the company's ability to offload the bad loans onto the feds and risk-taking investors while hanging onto the lucrative good loans will keep the company solvent and will thus jeopardize a short position. After all, you cannot escape from student loans by filing bankruptcy.

This doesn't count my emergency fund, which is currently $5,400 in I-bonds ($1,100 is available immediately to cash out, the rest have to mature past a year old in order to get the rest of the money out). I'm also putting 5% per paycheck into a traditional 401k, and 2% into a Roth 401k (with employer match of 50% of my contributions).

My car payment is $262.50 a month, the interest rate is 2.9%. My payoff amount is about $8,800, and if I don't change my payments, it will be paid off in February 2016. I am not underwater - according to KBB, my car is worth about 11,000.

What I would like to do is put my savings of $7000 in a lump sum towards my car payment, and the next three months, take the $500 I put in savings and put that towards my car payment. This would mean my car would be completely paid off this June (in three months).

If my car is paid off, I would return to putting that $500 a month back into savings, as well as the amount I was putting towards the car payment (So right around $750 a month). It would take about 10 months to get my savings back up over $7,000.

No longer having a car payment is very appealing to me. I also would be able to decrease my insurance drastically, because I could go down to PLPD instead of comprehensive and collision - because I live in a high crime city, I'm currently paying over $250 a month on insurance (I've shopped around, every other insurance provider is at least $500 a month).

But it internally enraged me that she would recommend paying the minimum as opposed to the full payment---considering interest rates are high on CCs and so low on savings accounts.  

I pay my credit card bills in full every month to not accrue any interest at all. I've done this for the past 5 years since having credit cards and my credit score is great. 

I can just imagine if she tells other folks this who do not really know how credit cards work and they get screwed into thinking ""oh yes, I'm building my credit""",finance,1362598846

gaming,Can we have an honest discussion about Sim City's gameplay?,"Look, I don't like always-online DRM, I don't like micro transactions, I don't like Origin, I don't like most of this bull**** EA (and to be fair a lot of other major publishers) have forced on me as a long time gamer who has been playing PC games since the original floppy disks on an IBM, but I do love Sim City (the older games I've actually played at least). 

And so I'm absolutely fed up with the amount of user reviews everywhere that just regurgitate the same points over and over again when it is clear that a lot of these people have not even played the game. I can sum up a lot of these user reviews a few bullet points: - Online always DRM. - 2x2 km city lot. - Origin. - Can't access servers on launch day. - 1/10 rating

When people don't compare the pros and cons of the games and instead dwell on only the negative, it rarely leads to a constructive conversation.

I am very undecided on Sim City as a long time gamer and huge Sim City fan. So I implore you, can we have an actual discussion about the core gameplay?

personalfinance,Looking for some financial advice on my current situation,"Hi,
I'm looking for some financial advice on how to move forward with my current assets/debts:

Assets:

- Checking: $4,500 

- Savings: $14,000 (negligible interest rate)

- Total ~$18,500

- 401k: $35,000. Current contribution is 10%, with company match of 3% - allocation of 90% stocks (US stocks, international stocks) and 10% bonds - pretty standard

- Vanguard account with ~$3,500 in a mutual fund - international stocks

**Debts** 

- Credit Cards: $0
- Student Loans: - $17K of unsubsidized direct loans @ 6.8% 

My grad school tuition costs approximately $20,000/year - my company covers about half of that - so I've been pulling out federal loans for the balance - is this the right thing to do? I try to pay about a fixed amount of 3-4k of the loans every 4-6 months or so, but I'm not done with school yet - I'm estimating another 40k or so of loans - is this smart?


**Expenses**

Rent: $1400

Utilities: $100/month (split between 3 people)
Groceries: $100/month (split between 3 people)

Lunch/Dinner: $300/month

I make $75,000 annually but I'm only saving about $600-$800 a month out of ~ $3500/month post-tax income, and spend generously on entertainment - bars/going out, concerts, activities.

personalfinance,"PF, please offer suggestions on how I can retire early","PF, can you please let me know how I'm doing to retire at 55 and also what changes I could make to retire earlier than that?  Ideal case would be to work half-time from age 45-55, then retire at 55.

Background info: mid-30s, married, earn $110K on one income, wife has been stay at home mom last 9 years, 3 kids (ages 7, 8, 9), $150K in retirement accounts (401K, Roths), $5K in long-term savings/non-retirement accounts.

Yearly spending is as follows:

* $20K taxes (includes FICA)
* $35K living expenses (food, medical, utilities, gas, travel, etc) - does not include mortage (see below)
* $30K fixed debt repayments (mortgage, student loans, car)
* $10K savings (mostly Roths and 401K), weak on savings and non-retirement accts
* $15K extra - For the last two years, I've been putting this toward snowballing debt, but it could go to savings if needed.

So overall I'm saving about 25% of income if you include the ""extra"" I'm choosing to put towards debts.  Almost all debt is 5.5% interest rate or lower, mostly tax deductable.  If I keep snowballing debt (including the $15K extra each year), I'm debt free in 6 years.  I've been steady at it for two years.

Other retirement income:

* pension (1.8% x service time in years * highest salary) - if I work to 50, it's about $40K/year starting at 65.  I can take it at 55 at half the amount if need be. (there is a scale on when you start drawing anywhere from 55 to 65)
* Social Security - I've always assumed it would never be there for people my age, so let's leave it off the table

Other expenses in the future:

* kids college - we're going to contribute about $15K/year per kid (maybe a little more if high tuition inflation continues), which totals: $180K.  We've only saved $10K of this so far in 529 accounts.  This hits in 2022-2027.  I'm hoping tuition cost is very much a factor on where they choose to go to school.

My wife went back to school a few years ago and is scheduled to graduate in two years.  She will have $25K in student loans and plans on making $50K/year.

Expected yearly budget for retirement (assuming I'll have no debt and will be fairly healthy): $40K/year in today's dollars (this is about $60K/year in 20 years @ 2% inflation).

So let's take this in steps:

* Retire at 65: the safest financially, I feel really good about being able to retire  here, but I want to retire earlier than that.
* Retire at 55: Issue here is that the retirement accounts can't be touched until 59.5 years old, so I have a 5-year gap to fill.  I can take the pension at about $20K/year if needed, but I would prefer to not do that if I can.  I would need to do a lot more contributions toward non-retirement accounts now to fill this gap.  If I moved the $15K extra here starting, now, at a 5% return it would be about $400K at age 55.  This would fill the gap and the kids college contributions, but it would extend how long I have debt.
* Retire at 50: the same issues as above, but bigger gaps to fill.
* Ideally I would like to convert to half-time at age 45 if I can afford to.  I could bring home $50K half-time.  Adding this to my wife's $50K salary means we're bringing home $100K with no debt other than kids college contributions).  My wife has serious issues with this, as she doesn't want us to have to rely on her salary at all.  Also, she has issues with her working full-time if I'm only working half-time, even if we're bring home the same amount of money.

So questions for PF:

1. Is retiring at 50 realistic, and if so what changes can I make to get to retire at 50?
2. Do I keep contributing to debt using the $15K extra, or do I start diverting some of that to non-retirement accounts?  I'm thinking of diverting 50% of the extra.",finance,1362573847

Markets 101: Stocks, Bonds, Currencies and Commodities
Here's a primer on market movement
By John Lansing, Editor, Parabolic Options | Mar 4, 2013, 10:50 am EST
Technical analysis can seem very overwhelming when trying to understand the process and behavior patterns of inter-market relationships and correlations. With technology today, we have the ability to watch every currency, stock market average, commodity, and even the bond markets around the globe.
Let’s simplify how commodities, bonds, currencies and stocks all interact and the consequences they have on one another.
As commodity prices rise, the cost of goods moves higher. The commodity rise increases prices, which is viewed as inflationary, so a natural response to increasing commodity prices is a rise in interest rates because the price action in commodities requires a response. That response, more often than not, is higher interest rates to keep the balance.
Now, because the correlation between rising interest rates and bond prices are inverse, bond prices fall as yields rise, which simply means higher interest rates.

Markets 101: Stocks, Bonds, Currencies and Commodities
Here's a primer on market movement
By John Lansing, Editor, Parabolic Options | Mar 4, 2013, 10:50 am EST
Technical analysis can seem very overwhelming when trying to understand the process and behavior patterns of inter-market relationships and correlations. With technology today, we have the ability to watch every currency, stock market average, commodity, and even the bond markets around the globe.
Let’s simplify how commodities, bonds, currencies and stocks all interact and the consequences they have on one another.
As commodity prices rise, the cost of goods moves higher. The commodity rise increases prices, which is viewed as inflationary, so a natural response to increasing commodity prices is a rise in interest rates because the price action in commodities requires a response. That response, more often than not, is higher interest rates to keep the balance.
Now, because the correlation between rising interest rates and bond prices are inverse, bond prices fall as yields rise, which simply means higher interest rates.
Bonds and Stocks
Bond prices and stocks are, by and large, interlinked. So, when bond prices begin to decline, stocks will eventually follow suit and head down in the same direction. In short, as the cost of borrowing rises due to inflation, a reasonable assumption is stocks will decline as a result of borrowing costs. As with most inter-market relationships, we often see a lag between the “Yin and Yang,” (i.e. rising rates mean bonds are falling). Stocks eventually follow and harmony is restored.
Currencies and Commodities
The fluctuating currency markets also have an effect on all markets and commodities. But the largest impact that currency moves have on any asset class is commodities themselves, as they are the primary beneficiary or, in the opposite case, the sinister target. Commodity prices also have a direct impact on bonds and, subsequently, this all spills over into the stock market – sometimes in bullish fashion and other times in bearish turmoil.
The U.S. dollar and commodity prices historically trend in opposite directions, but that in and of itself should never be a reason to buy and sell anything.  As one of the first advisory services I followed said, “If you think the dollar is rising and you are bullish on the dollar, go long the dollar. Conversely, if you think gold is bearish and is going down, short gold. However, as a rule of thumb, it’s never been a good idea to go long one thing because another thing is falling or vice-versa.”
That said, because so many commodities are priced in U.S. dollars and not in other currencies (for example crude oil) abrupt changes in trend direction like we are seeing now in the U.S. dollar, which has been in a parabolic rise, is causing a negative price response to West Texas Crude Oil (WTIC).
The diagram below shows how each part of the market affects the others, going from left to right.
Bear in mind that the impact lags between how each of the markets react to the sudden fluctuations that start from the left and move to the right. Not everything happens instantly and during those transitions or response lags other factors could come into play, including intervention to divert the natural response. When that happens, think of it as nothing more than an attempt that simply delays and creates a larger lag in the “Yin and Yang” merely to disrupt the natural order in hopes of achieving some pseudo realignment. It never works, but human nature is to think it will “this time around.”
Fed Fiddling with the Balance of the Market
Now, let’s talk about what I am seeing, which is the opposite of what I have discussed so far. I’m seeing a deflationary environment.
I’d describe deflation as good for nothing because when it comes to the stock market, just about everything goes down. With huge swings in the currency market pushing commodities lower, especially at the current speed, the potential for growth is limited when we have conditions that can only be described as the “perfect storm.”
When the falling prices of deflation last long enough, they create a vicious cycle of some or all of these negatives.
    Reduction in the supply of money or credit, harder to get a loan
    Decrease in government, personal or investment spending
    Increased unemployment since there is a lower level of demand in the economy
    Falling corporate profits, which can lead to the closing of factories
    Decreasing nominal prices for goods and services
    And the worst yet – it can lead to economic depression.
Finding the correct amount of inflation to offset deflation is a nightmare for central banks because they have created the largest debt bubble in history. This is why we are always hearing about the fiat money wars versus gold and other precious metals. Each time deflationary forces re-assert themselves to offset inflationary forces, the Fed has to correspond with even more aggressive forms of monetary stimulus to keep systemic failure at arm’s length.
With the rise and fall within all these asset classes discussed above, it’s become more important than ever to watch how all these inter-market relationships affect the next to gauge the future trend changes in stocks.",finance,1362535627

personalfinance,"Regarding tax on 401k, Roth IRA and Traditional IRA","I'm not going to be eligable for my employer 401k plan until April. So, I'm looking into IRA and Roth IRA.

If I'm not mistaking from the wikipedia entries.

401k - Contributions are ""tax-deferred""—deducted from paychecks before taxes and then taxed when a withdrawal is made from the 401(k) account. 
Roth IRA - The Roth IRA's principal difference from most other tax advantaged retirement plans is that, rather than granting a tax break for money placed into the plan, the tax break is granted on the money withdrawn from the plan during retirement.
IRA - the only criterion for being eligible to contribute to a Traditional IRA is sufficient income to make the contribution. However, the best provision of a Traditional IRA — the tax-deductibility of contributions — has strict eligibility requirements based on income, filing status, and availability of other retirement plans (mandated by the Internal Revenue Service). Transactions in the account, including interest, dividends, and capital gains, are not subject to tax while still in the account, but upon withdrawal from the account, withdrawals are subject to federal income tax (see below for details). 

So, my understand is 401k is taking out of my paycheck and tax free until I retired and withdraw the money. While IRA and Roth IRA is not taking out of my paycheck but the money that I earned after tax and when I withdraw it for retirement. It will not be tax, is that correct?

Should I contribute more money to 401k or IRA? I think 401K kind of suck since by the time that I retire the govrt. might want to increase tax to pay for whatever war while my IRA or Roth IRA money is already taxed at the present time and can't be tax in the future.

I have one credit card right now that has an $800 limit with a $220 balance have 2 30 day late payments on it from 3 years ago. In my previous history I have a few car loans all paid on time. One for $7500 paid off in 2 years and one for $10,000 paid off in 4 months. My most recent is from 8 months ago. Its a $20,000 loan on a new car that has a 9% interest rate.

Taking out the secured credit card today with all or part of my $2000, saving up for a few more months and getting the used car in a few months

Getting the used car now with my $2000 down payment and whatever rate I can get then take the secured credit card later

personalfinance,Med student line of credit vs $40k in mutual funds (CA),"I am finishing up my 2nd of 4 years of medical school in Quebec. I am planning on moving out with a friend and purchasing a used car (max $10k) this summer. Once I finish med school and start residency (5 years) in July of 2015, I will be earning a salary that will increase from approximately $40k in the first year to $60k by the 5th year. I anticipate spending about $40-45k in the next 2 years on everything, i.e. rent, car, gas, insurance, food, cell phone, you name it, which comes out to about $1,700 in interest paid in those 2 years (I wrote up a spreadsheet and tried to break down expenses for each month).
  
Now, as a medical student, I can open up a line of credit of up to $250k, with an interest rate of 3% annually (prime + 0%). I can choose to pay the monthly interest payments or have them deferred without any penalty, albeit this will cause the interest to compound. I am still considered to be a student while in residency and even if I choose to pursue a fellowship afterwards, plus there's a 1 year grade period, so this means that I will not have to start paying back the line of credit until at least 6 years after I have been earning a salary.
  
I also have $40k in mutual funds that I have worked hard to build up with summer jobs for the past 7 years. These funds are set up within a fairly stable and secure portfolio that brings in more than 3% annually. Obviously, the extent of the profit (or loss) flucturates year to year, but these are long-term investments, and as such, I do profit from them.
  
Last thing I need to mention so that you guys can get the full picture is that I can also apply from Student Loans &amp; Bursaries from the Quebec Government. I know that I can receive about $11-12k from them for the 2013-2014 year if I do in fact choose to move out. Of this amount, about $8k will be in bursaries, and $3k in loans. The amount is paid to me on a monthly basis, with a larger portion given in September and another in January. The loans DO NOT accrue any interest until I believe 3-6 months after I graduate in 2 years, so if I pay back the loans within this period, I do not pay any interest whatsoever. So assuming I apply for this during my 3rd and 4th year, hopefully I'll get about $20-23k in loans and bursaries.
  
So, my plan is to use the money from the loans and bursaries to pay for my expenses. However, because I am not given the full amount right away, I will need to take out the line of credit and use it as well. I plan on paying the monthly interest payments using my loans and bursaries money, while the leftovers will be quickly ushered towards the line of credit debt itself to lower it as much as possible and as often as possible. Now, the important part is: I do NOT want to touch my $40k in mutual funds during this entire time; I have worked hard to earn these savings and I do not feel comfortable using them at this time. I see myself using them 5-8 years down the line to perhaps put a down payments on a house or who knows what, but I do not want to use them now. If I did slowly start using them to pay for my expenses, I would be making less profit off of them and I would lose at least half if not more of my savings, which I am not comfortable with.
  
My financial advisor recommended that I take out the line of credit and use the loans and bursaries, while not touching my mutual funds. When the time comes to pay back the student loans, I can use part of my salary and then take out money from the line of credit. I think this is the way to go, however I have other people that I know insisting that people who take out a line of credit do so because they have no choice, that getting into debt should not be done by choice, and that I should focus on using my own money (mutual funds) as well as the loans and bursaries to support myself. However, by doing this, I know that I will start my residency with very little money left in these funds, and I'm just not comfortable with that. Plus, given that my mutual funds are bringing in more profit annually than I am losing in paying interest to the line of credit, I should be still coming out on top.
  
Summary:
  
Option 1: Take out line of credit at 3% annual interest rate as well as apply for student loans and bursaries. Graduate from medical school without having touched my $40k in mutual funds.
  
Option 2: Do not take out the line of credit, use the student loans and bursaries as well as money from my mutual funds. Graduate from medical school with at least half if not more of my savings gone.

personalfinance,Is the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program real?  It seems too good to be true.,"I am a recent college graduate (2011) living in a big city on the east coast and I have about $25,000 in student loans spread out across 7 or 8 lenders.  My total current payment is about $350/month and I'm interested in consolidating these loans and lowering my payment for the time being since they are sucking up about 15% of my income.

I inquired about more info at studentloanservice.us and received a call later that day from a lady who (after gathering my loan and current income info) told me she can have my payment lowered to $127 per month and after 25 years the remainder of the loan will be forgiven. (?) The finance major in me kept asking her how this is possible and she just kept saying this is a federal program to avoid something like the housing crisis (?) I asked her who ends up paying for these loans and she kept telling me they are ""forgiven"" (?) 

This has to be some kind of trick.  You're telling me there's a way I just don't have to pay back the money I borrowed for college?  I looked up the Bill she kept referencing and it seems legit but I can't understand how this program exists legally and ultimately I don't know if I can consciously subscribe to this program (despite how much I will personally gain from it) if it will just defer MY loans to taxpayer dollars.  I provided some details below of how this works as it was explained to me:

* I pay a 1 time fee of $300 to this company to enroll me in this federal program 
* I call all my lenders and tell them to put my loans in forebearance (yikes)
* In 30-50 days the Department of Education will go to all my lenders and buy up all my loans
* The Department of Education figures out a ""fair"" amount based on my income for me to pay per month
* After 25 years (or less if I work for the government) all my debts to the DoE are forgiven

**tl;dr - Basically the woman kept telling me I can ""get away without paying the rest of my loans""  I feel shameful but maybe this is what Obama's America is going to be like.  How can I say no if this will generate $2,500 in extra money for me every year?  Somebody please help me out if you know anything about this legislation and process.**",finance,1362669815

personalfinance,Ex girlfriend plans to just walk away from her debts and drop off the radar.  What can she expect?,"TL;DR - she has a mortgage, student loan, and credit card balance, and has quit paying on them, with plans to go AWOL in a couple or three months.  What will happen regarding the debts and how long will she be a hot target by her creditors?

Long version:

My ex girlfriend has become mentally ill over the last year and just isn't relating to the world any more.  She has been unemployed for 2 years, and we split up over the course of the last 6 months as she refuses to recognize her illness, much less seek treatment, with me ultimately moving out in late November.  Since then I've been trying to steer her back on course but she refuses and is just nosediving into a financial pit.

She has a condo to the tune of $9xx/month mortgage and another $250/month in condo fees.  She is severely upside-down on the place, owing about $130K but she'd be lucky to sell it for half that.  Between my rent and her ex-husband's child support, she was able to cover this, but she is just about to miss her 3rd mortgage payment at this point.  Her condo fees are an additional month or 2 behind.  

She has some old student loan debt remaining, I don't recall the exact number but I'm pretty sure it's under $20K at this point.

The mortgage/condo and student loan payments were set up on a auto-payment plan to deduct funds from her bank account, but once they drained it dry and caused overdraft charges, she just closed the account rather than deal with her lender and condo board to stop the auto-debits.

And as I recall she has a $3xxx balance on a single credit card with her bank (that she closed her checking/savings with), and she has recently stopped making the minimum payments on that so that she can keep her phone/data plan going.

She is on state/federal assistance for medical and food stamps, and her only income at this point is child support which covers utilities, auto expenses, phone, and incidentals.

At one point not that long ago she was determined to just let everything lapse including her car insurance (and therefore tags/registration) and utilities (she had a shut-off notice) and she was just going to pack what she could into her Corolla and drive to the midwest and leave her 8 year old son with his father with no notice, and she had no plan beyond that.  I've managed to convince her to stay on top of the utilities and car stuff, but her home is a lost cause and foreclosure is looming.  No idea where in the process it is, probably just getting formally started with the third payment being missed any day now.  I know she's not opening the mail from her lender.

Hopefully she'll be able to stay in the house until the school year ends in June.  Her son is 8 by the way.

I tried to encourage her to file chapter 7 bankruptcy to get her debts formally released, but she's not interested.


Anyway, assuming she does make it until June without being evicted, her son spend summers with family in the midwest and she will definitely be abandoning her house at that point, and will likely find herself somewhere in the midwest as well.  Knowing her, she won't forward mail (she'd ignore it anyway) and will essentially just go AWOL.  What's going to happen with her debts?

I'm assuming the foreclosure will just happen as usual, and the bank will just have to eat it.  Mortgage is backed by Freddie Mac, so the bank isn't going to be too upset.  
The condo board will turn her account over to their collections attorney, but given that she has no money and no assets other than her vehicle, that's not likely to go anywhere.  
Her student loan will also likely go to a collection agency, yes?  
Her credit card balance, I'm not sure how that will be handled.  Collections as well?

I suppose the root of the question is, there's nothing to go after to recover her debts, so the creditors will likely just eat it all, but is she going to be in any legal trouble afterwards?   I think she plans to just go off the radar and either live a quiet life in the rural midwest, or she may just end up homeless.  

Either way, how is this going to haunt her, and for how long?  Is there any criminal risk here that could bite her in the ass, or is it all just civil as far as the legal system is concerned?",finance,1362665913

There's no one to consign a consolidation loan for me either.

Reduce my debt by about $20,000 and be able to consolidate the rest. I thought of trying a zero interest credit card and paying off the smaller loans one-by-one over 12-18 month periods- but my lenders will not accept credit card payments.

Should I consolidate what I can now and risk a high interest rate?
Are there ways to get cash advanced with minimal-zero interest?

I had a few questions I was hoping to gain some insight from you guys and gals.

1.  I had returned to school last year and I did not make any income at all, I paid my entire University Education out of my own pocket.  With that being said my question is if I can ""Defer"" (Dont know if thats the right term) my education credit towards a year that I actually have an income?  The reason is I am only getting $1000 in federal and 25 in state.

2.  Second question, I purchased my condo right when the housing bubble burst.  It is a 5 yr arm loan through first horizon.  When i purchased it it was 114k split into 80k loan 34k Loan (Second loan looks like a home equity loan).  Well now its not worth the 114k and its worth much less than this.  When it armed it went from total 600 a month to 350 a month (I am assuming due to low interest rates).  What do you guys suggest I do?

* ~$10K in a retirement fund that could in theory be cracked for a down payment at no tax loss ( don't wanna)

* ~$35K Student loan debt

* ~$10K Car loan debt

Now, I am tempted to purchase a condo, here in CA, while the rates and prices are fairly low.  After speaking with a realtor, I estimate I could get away with ~$1400-$1500 in mortgage + HOA payments, which might be offset by ~$600 if I rent the second bedroom.  And I would also save a bit on taxes.

On a strictly income/outflow basis, if I can get a renter, this makes perfect sense--  build equity at about the same net cost.

However, I already have a reasonable debt load.  Is it worth it to build up alot of additional debt but lock in the current low prices and interest rates?  Or is the risk too high-- what if I get hit by a meteor and crippled, etc. etc.

business,Business Owners &amp; CFO's (What Is Your Plan?),"Did you know that employers can now choose to offer the new Roth 401(k) plan feature, which will allow employees to voluntarily contribute after-tax dollars to their company's existing 401(k) plan. Because employees make after-tax contributions to their Roth 401(k) accounts, qualified distributions from the Roth 401(k) accounts during retirement are not includible as income for federal tax purposes-a key benefit that is new to 401(k) plans.

With the Roth 401(k) option, employees' after-tax contributions can be made regardless of their income level and are fully vested. Adding the new Roth 401(k) option will require additional record-keeping, payroll system changes, and will create changes in the enrollment and distribution processes.

**The possibilities of a Roth 401(k): A tax-free retirement benefit, a more generous legacy.**

Reward your employees with possibilities of a tax-free retirement benefit and the potential to leave more of their retirement savings to their families, free from federal taxes.

The new Roth 401(k) options, with its after-tax contributions and tax-free qualified distributions, is modeled in part of the Roth IRA, which has become a popular way to save for retirement. But income limits for the Roth IRA prohibiting people with high incomes opening a Roth IRA. The new Roth 401(k) option allows *all* employees to make use of its tax-free possibilities, regardless of income.

With no required minimum contributions, the Roth IRA can continue to accumulate, and ultimately be passed to heirs free from federal income taxes. The potential for freedom from federal taxes in retirement, along with the potential to leave more retirement savings for heirs may have great appeal to some of the employees you value most.

**Who is most likely to prefer the rewards of the Roth 401(k) option?**

* Workers with high assets, who are seeking to manage their taxes in retirement can benefit from the Roth 401(k)'s tax-free qualified distributions.

*  Employees who have already accumulated substantial retirement savings, and are seeking to manage or lower their distribution levels in retirement, can opt to roll the Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA, which has no required minimum distributions.

* People who won't need extra income in retirement, but are interested in bequeathing their retirement savings to their heirs, may also be interested in rolling Roth 401(k) money into a Roth IRA.

* Young workers with lower incomes today, who expect their income levels t rise and to pay taxes at higher rates in retirement, can benefit by paying taxes on contributions now, and later paying no federal taxes on qualified distributions in retirement.

* Workers who are more than five years away from retirement may be interested in the Roth 401(k), since there is a five-year rule on taking qualified distributions. Qualified distributions from a Roth 401(k) can only occur five years after the first Roth 401(k) contribution.

personalfinance,How to invest $50k,"needs some advice (I am very lucky and grateful to be in this position).
after working very hard i have been able to save ~$50k cash.
The money is now earning a cool whopping ~1%
I own a place which I still have a mortgage on about $133k left (i am renting it out)
I have $3k on CCs (I know this is the first thing to pay off because of high interest rate).

*Should I invest the $50k in paying down the mortgage? Mortgage is at 5% VS *I have a friend suggesting for me to buy a house and rent it out to generate an income. 
*just like everyone else I want to get the most bang out of the buck.
I do have a 401k, I do own stock outside of 401k.
I am considering the following:
1. P2P lending.
2. purchasing a second house to rent out.
3. paying down my mortgage and collecting more revenue from the rental.
4. open to other serious ideas.
I think thats it.....",finance,1362619379
Bitcoin,Exchange report: bitfinex - 4.5 star,"Heard user byronbb [talk](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/19r36j/not_trying_to_be_a_negative_nancy_but_are_there/c8qldnd) and Cylta from irc speak about bitfinex and decided to try it out. I believe part of the reason the prices have wildly shot up lately is due to the lack of a good options or margin trading market. Bitfinex aims to solve the latter at least. 

**Features:**

**""Regular"" exchange** - buy and sell bitcoins for USD. The entire exchange works off of MtGox, so there is always liquidity. There is an internal exchange that offers extremely low fees (0.1%) if traded internally. Even if you end up trading on MtGox, you'll only pay 0.4%, which beats the low volume price of 0.6% from MtGox. Funding options are limited, but I like the idea. I only tried using the MtGox codes funding options, which is actually superior. It is instant and you get to keep your money at MtGox for security. 

**Margin Trading** - Up to 5x leverage. Since prices have been going up non-stop, I decided a correction was in order at $47. It kept going up to z$49 after I shorted a large amount, but I decided to short more at $49. The low interest rates provided by other users made that easy. I ended up making a healthy chunk of coins when it dropped to around $43-44. 

**Lending** - All lending is peer-to-peer. When I first got in, the rates were very reasonable (as low as 5.5% APR) and there was nearly 1k coins offered to be loaned. It is a great way for someone to me safely making interest on their bitcoins, and gives opportunity to others like myself, to take risks and make big bets. (If you look now, the rates are much higher, probably because of me, but that's an opportunity for you to offer lower rates and make a great return on your bitcoins).

Basically, in terms of features, I'd say Bitfinex only lacks an options market. Otherwise, it is doing exactly the things I'd imagine an up and coming exchange would do to challange MtGox. Although Bitfinex is basically leeching off of MtGox right now, it has the potential to be a solid second place soon, especially since the fee's would attract many professional traders. 

The only bad things about it now is the UI/UX, which is extremely confusing for a first time user. I recommend playing with small amounts of money first, and seeing how everything works. 


**Final Thoughts:**

Volume for the last 24 hours is 11632.23 BTC, officially making it the 2nd largest USD market, only 1 month afte its release. The site is definitely well thought out, and well executed. We will soon live in a world not dominated by 1 exchange. There's also the additional benefit of located off-shore, in Hong-Kong, for those who might be concerned about the Coinlab move. 

I'm not sure how Bitfinex execute orders on MtGox fairly quickly and discretely. When I submit the order, I never see it show up on the MtGox depth chart, but even with all the lag today, orders didn't seem like they took longer than they would have at MtGox. If anyone knows how they do this, please elaborate.  

I highly encourage you to give Bitfinex a try. It's going to be worth it. And if this review was helpful to you, or made you money, than consider making a donation to: **1wUAhcgT2CgGhsG2zeYeqi2TYx1Efuqb7**

Do I have options?","I graduated college 3 years ago, and now have a little over $100,000 in student loan debt, and don't know what to do. I've been making all payments on time, but the Principal amounts aren't going anywhere. Since so many banks were going bankrupt while I was in school, I was forced to go to a new bank (or two) every year, so each has their own ~$150 payment each month. I'd like to pay more than the minimum, but given the situation, I can't afford any extra after already shelling out $620/month. 
     I've tried looking up loan consolidation to lower the payments so I could pay more than the minimum, but the only bank that seems to be offering anything is Wells Fargo, and they won't work with me. Every other link I find online will only consolidate Federal Loans, which only makes up like $20k of my debt.

I'm just looking for a completely objective perspective on things. 

My question is, what can be improved?

That said...

My biweekly income is $2,752 (annual: $71,552, pre-tax bonus 4%: $2,862 )

My current paystub looks like this:

**Pre-Tax Deductions**

==================

Federal Income Tax: -293.67

Social Security Tax: -169.80

Medicare Tax: -39.71

State Tax: -110.71

Traditional 401k: -550.40 (+ employer match of ~220)


**Post-Tax Deductions**

GTL: -2.80

Stock Purchase Plan: -550.40

Checking Account 1: -193.00

Savings Account 1: -300.00

Checking Account 2: -528.31

Roth IRA: 25,000

Checking 1: ~0

Checking 2: $2,100

Savings 1: $1,200


**Assets**

Early 2000's Vehicle (owned, no loan, carry full coverage)

Partial ownership in new small business (no income or cap contrib on my part at present)


**Bills**

=====

Rent w/utilities: $450 / mo

Car Insurance: $188 / mo


**Debts**

=====

None


**Credit Card Bills**

=================

Carrying $1,400 balance on 0% credit card whose promotion ends in October. Paying $250 / mo.

This month $213 (groceries) on Card 1,

This Month $707 (eating out and gas) on Card 2. This was a particularly expensive month due to Valentine's day.



**Where my Post Tax dollars go**

============================

193 - Checking 1 - This account funds my Roth IRA. I am on track to max it out this year

528.31 - Checking 2 - This account pays my credit cards, and car insurance.

300 - Savings 1 - This account pays my rent via monthly $450/mo transfer to an account that pays the landlord. Net savings: $150/mo


**Stock Purchase Plan**

===================

My company offers a 15% discount with no vesting on shares purchased through this plan. I will have contributed $7,100 to an escrow account by the end of the period in early April. Money is then used to buy shares at the end of the period. Current unrealized total value of this money is $10.400. I cash this out every period as soon as I take ownership of the shares.


I am planning on taking the $10k and rolling it into an personal investment account. I will continue to roll this $8,300+ into this account every 6 months.


**Marital Status**

==============

Getting married this year to partner with ~50k income. We will maintain seperate accounts and use joint accounts for joint activities (paying mortage, investments, whatever)



**Upcoming Events and how they change the above**

================================================

Closing on a home in early April. 


Monthly mortgage payment is: $2,500

Legal basement apartment will fetch $1,300 month in this area.

Average monthly personal responsibility on this mortgage (not including apartment vacancy) will be, for the time being, $1,000 + utilities.

To pay this, I plan on reducing my 401k contribution to 10% to $275 per paycheck, the employer match will not change as a result of this action.

I will then take the $300 I was putting into savings and the $200 additional net cash from my paycheck and move it into another account instead to pay the mortgage.

I will take my bonus (~$1800 net dollars) coming in April and place it in my savings account and make monthly withdrawals to pay utilities at the new house.

Depending on what utilities look like, I may further reduce the 401k to the employer match max of 4% to net another ~$120 in post-tax money. This will keep me safe up to a total utility bill of $550 / month (Partner and I splitting, my max share being $275)

Wedding: My parents have told me they plan on giving us a gift for the wedding as they did for my siblings. I'm sure others will give us something but not banking on this in any capacity.

Wedding Costs: We were planning on a small wedding, without considering other gifts, my parents gift will pay for our total cost.

Any net wedding cash I plan on putting into a joint personal investment account between my partner and I. I plan on doing this with any tax refund money as well. I am looking at a 25k+ deduction this year due to all the house stuff so I have no idea how much this will turn out to be.

**What I already know**

===================

I don't have a significant emergency savings. Any emergencies that occur I plan on evaluating how best to handle them, checking, personal savings, taking 0% credit card offers (to amortize payments for emergencies)... worst case I cash out some of my personal investment account. Hopefully in a few years we can accumulate ~20k in our joint account for the whole 6 months expenses thing.",finance,1362780631
gaming,Angry about Sim City? Take 5 minutes and let EA know via the FTC Consumer Protection Bureau.,"The Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau exists to be a watchdog against ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce"". Maybe EA's botching of Sim City doesn't fall into that category and maybe it does. 

If you feel like having the US government let EA know how poorly a job they've done, I've outlined the steps to file an anonymous complaint below. **Note: You can provide as much or as little information as you'd like in the complaint.**

1. Go to the [Consumer Protection Complaint Site](https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/FTC_Wizard.aspx?Lang=en)

2. Follow the Step by Step process (takes less than 5 minutes)

3. When identifying the type of complaint, choose ""Other - None of these describe my concern"". This will bring you to another option to describe the type of company (EA) the complaint is about.

4. Choose Computer ""Hardware/Software"" and then ""Software"" in the two boxes.

5. When it asks you to describe your situation, again choose ""Other"" and then choose ""Defective or poor quality product"".

6. Fill out the Company Information with EA's corporate headquarters:
Electronic Arts, Inc.
2 Harrison Street #350
San Franciso, CA 94105

7. I'd suggest filling out the information in Step 3 of the complaint process with the amount you've spent on Sim City.

8. Step 5 of the complaint process is where you can go into detail about your particular complaint with respect to Sim City and EA

9. Submit your complaint.

10. ???

11. Profit

In all seriousness, I know a lot of people are saying that if you want to punish EA don't buy their games. I agree with this statement, but just because you've bought the game doesn't mean you don't have any recourse. Let the Feds work for you.

personalfinance,You can use a mortgage amortization calculator for credit card or loan repayment analysis,"If you are looking at your credit card or auto loan or mortgage situation, don't let your Excel skills hold you back!

Just go to an online ""mortgage"" calculator, enter your current balance, interest rate, and how long you plan to be paying it off.

This will quickly show you:

* Your monthly payment
* *A chart with how much of your payment goes to principal and how much goes to interest each month*. Sometimes quite the eye opener.
* How much interest you'll be paying over the duration of your payments (e.g. minimum pmts on a 30 yr mortgage nearly cost 100% in interest and that's with today's friendly rates)
* How much you'll save by paying even a little extra down each month.
* If you paid down the principal by X, how much less would you be paying in interest each month and over the life of the loan

gaming,Can we organize an EA boycott?,"I just did a cursory search over the /r/gaming reddit and have found that basically every 6 months, there are tonnes of complaints about a new EA release, and some of the top posts are always someone chastising the people who bought the game in the first place, all the while knowing it would be plagued with DRM/microtransactions/online passes/what-have-you. 

I'm starting to get really fed up with it. 

EA has made ZERO effort to produce games that have no accessibility issues with the end user. They have shown with disheartening consistency that they are less interested in you, the player, as they are in you, the meat pocket overflowing with disposable income. And the only reason they do this is because we keep giving them money. They have been working harder and harder to live up to their ""Worst Company in America 2012"" award, and despite all the ragethreads and complaints we post here on Reddit, they have decided to stick the course and keep doing all the things we tell them not to because we PAY THEM. We keep preordering their games and paying their microbills for ammo and they take that as tacit compliance. 

I, for one, am done paying EA to mistreat me as a customer. I haven't bought a new EA game since ME3, and I refuse to buy another EA game until they stop with the DRM, the online passes, the nickel-and-diming, and the general shenanigans. I'm taking a stance here and now. There are literally thousands of games that I could be playing that were developed by companies that appreciate me as a customer, and hope to earn my hard-won money by giving me exactly what I paid for, without treating me with suspicion that I might have bought the game used. Those companies deserve the recognition and money we've been giving to EA. 

I would like to ask each of you to join me, as well. Stop handing over 60USD for a game that won't work the week of its release. Just please stop! There are so many other games you could be playing, do you really need to buy the next EA cash cow?

personalfinance,Pay off student loans or start a savings account?,"I am a sort of recent college grad ('11) with about $9500 in student loans. This is split into three loans with 5.35%, 5.35%, and 5.8% interest rates (the 5.8% loan, of course, has the most left to pay down). 

I'm almost a year into my first ""real"" job and in the last few months I have been able to save around $500 a month after rent, utilities, etc. Currently, my mom and I are splitting the loan payments. Mom claims that she wants to continue helping to pay them off as she had always anticipated that she would be able to pay for my college since her parents paid for hers (I went to a public school as an in-state student so the tuition was not astronomical). She is paying the minimum on two and I am paying the minimum on one for a total of $150/month. 

My question is: should I take all of the money that I am able to save and pay down the loans or should I put some (or all) of that money into a savings account?

Also, will I have a problem getting a car loan if I got one last year but changed my mind and paid back right away?  (CA)","Last year around this time, my car started giving me what I thought at the time were transmission issues.  Just in case, I went to the bank and got a $10000 car loan and started looking for cars.  Turned out to only be an minor electrical/sensor problem, so I decided to stick with the car instead of buying another.  Paid off the loan in full a month later.

My situation now is a little different.  I've sunk a bunch of money into repairs already this year (brake lines, power steering lines, oxygen sensor) and I'm thinking it might be time to actually get another car.  Current car is a 2002 Hyundai Accent with almost exactly 200,000km (~125,000 miles) on it.  I have the oil changed regularly and have all the maintenance records.

First off, I'm not a car guy.  All I care about is finding a vehicle that will get me from point A to point B as cheaply and reliably as possible.  So I'm looking at probably getting a 2005-2007 Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic.  I'd like to spend less than $10,000.

I paid off my student loans in December of last year and my only remaining debt is a credit card balance transfer that I got from MBNA 3 years ago, the balance is a little less than $3000 at a 1.99% interest rate for the life of the balance as long as I make a minimum payment monthly (not a typo, it was a promotion that you unsurprisingly can't get anymore).  I recently got my yearly bonus at work and it was larger than expected, so I was really hoping to pay off the remainder of that balance and just be out of debt completely.  But with these recent car issues, I'm thinking it might be a good idea to put that money towards a less troublesome vehicle since the interest rate on my remaining debt is so low.  I don't know if I'd even need a loan, but I'd rather not use too much of my TFSA (which is my emergency fund/building house down payment nest egg).  My job is about as secure as you can get in today's economy and I work for a great company.  

Questions I'd like to hear some opinions/expertise on:

* Should I stick it out with the current car until it completely dies and pay off that last CC balance?
* If I choose to look for another car, does anyone think I would have an issue getting another car loan after getting one last year and paying it off right away? 


TL;dr, my situation:

* 30 year old Canadian
* current car 2002 Hyundai Accent w/ 200,000km (125,000 miles), costing too much in repairs lately
* looking to buy a used car, &lt; $10,000
* $3000 in a tax-free savings account
* $3000 in unexpected work bonus
* roughly $2000 if I sell my current car (hopefully)
* job is secure as you can find in today's economy, work for a great company

personalfinance,Finally having a good year with regards to debt!,"I guess you could call it ""tooting my own horn"" but its nice to finally be having a good year with regards to paying down my student loans. I don't have any CC debt and haven't since I was 19 (I am 27 now). 

I made poor choices with regards to paying for my education that I am now paying for (literally and figuratively). I own my own house (well within my means), have about 110k in student loan debt, and make a very good salary relative to the area I live in. In 2013 I was contributing $127 a month above loan minimums. This year so far its been that, plus an extra $479 in February and will be another $1076 in March, mostly from bonuses and tax return. The extra payments have gone towards the highest interest, highest balance loans and will continue that way until they are paid off. That's after buying some things for my home and planning a vacation in December. I will probably up my extra payments to be whatever is left over in my budget after monthly must-haves.

I know a lot of you would chastise me for buying a home, vacations, etc before paying down my debt but I was in a good position to purchase and got in on the mortgage when interest rates were at their lowest (my rate is 3.25%). However, I feel that I am doing better than most about tackling my loans and my career is really starting to take off. Not to mention, I have about 3 months emergency fund, am contributing enough to 401k to get employer match, and have no consumer debt what-so-ever.

Am I right to feel good about my progress so far? Or am I just misleading myself?",finance,1362708029
personalfinance,"Parents need money, will probably ask me for some soon...","Mom's retired, and gets a pension.  Dad is laid off (he's on the bench, and could get work, but there's also 50 other people waiting for work), and has two years to go before he can retire from there.  Finding a new job isn't really an option, because in order to qualify for the retirement he has to be ""available to work"".  Sounds fishy, but that's not what I'm asking about.

The pile of money they had stockpiled is running dry.  My brother&amp;sister's college has pretty much wiped the last of it out.  I graduated 5 years ago, have no debt, and have been pigeonholing money away so I can retire one day.

They've asked me for money in the past (I have a small amount that was left to me when a birth parent passed).  I was young and dumb, and they offered: a) a higher interest rate than the banks/cds were offering, and b) a lower interest rate than they'd have to pay from the bank.  It was win-win.  They paid it all back, and on time.  No issues.

However, I'm not so sure if I should go down that path again.  Last time, I was living with them, and my only expenses was the gas I needed to get to work... and that job paid those expenses.  Now, I'm on my own, have insurance, food, etc.  Beyond just that, I'm currently at a shaky job that I might not have in a month, much less 6 months from now.  Not to mention the desire to keep a little padding, in case something breaks so it can be fixed.

I currently have a Costco Amex card that I usually use strictly for gas and eating out every once in a while. I was in some deep debt on this card a little bit ago, but I think I'm starting to get the hang out budgeting a little better and have climbed out of that hole. Unfortunately, I do still eat out quite a bit and know I need to severely cut down on that portion of my spending.

Maybe no one cares, I guess I'll see. Any comments or advice are of course appreciated and will be considered.

I graduated from school (Mechanical Engineering) last April, and had three months off before I was due to start my job. When I started work in August my line of credit (interest rate at 4% right now) was just over $26k. It would have been much more but I had a 16-month internship at an aerospace company before my final year, during which I paid my LOC down from $24k to about $3k (so close to getting debt-free momentarily, but didn't quite make it!).

For some additional info, my salary right now is $50k. After receiving my tax refund this morning and putting it into my LOC, I am down to $3700 outstanding. Based on my budget and savings rate, I should have my LOC completely paid off sometime in May. Here is the screenshot of the account activity, if anyone was curious to see the progression (http://i.imgur.com/wif1GXo.jpg).

I'm hugely excited about becoming debt-free for the first time in four and a half years! I have already taken steps towards figuring out what I am going to do with my money once it becomes something that I can get working for me. Earning interest instead of paying interest is going to feel so glorious! As soon as my LOC is paid off, I will be opening a marginal account and a TSFA with Questrade (good review [here](http://canadianprofiteer.com/questrade-review/)), which is a discount online brokerage in Canada. They have zero account fees and they just switched to not charging a commission on buying ETFs, so I can diversify easily and purchase small quantities often without paying tons of commission fees.

I understand that the stock game is more about predicting how investors who don't know much will respond to the market. I.E. uneducated investors who think stock value is dependent on the success of a company, rather than the value placed on it by investors working the exchange.

I also understand that we are talking about international investors so international markets are probably at play. That doesn't make sense, though, because most of the world's major markets seem to be in bad shape as the EU continues to struggle and Japan's economy bottoms out.

The Tribune suggests that the money is mainly coming from new investors.

personalfinance,Investing/retirement saving/debt repayment guidance for a 25 year old.,"I could really use a bump in the right direction.  I finished grad school last May and have been working as a medical resident of some sort (I'm not a M.D.) since July.  Here's my financial situation:

I currently make just over $60k per year...which translates to ~$1700 every two weeks after taxes.

I have $26k in federal student loans (6.8% interest rate)...the minimum monthly payment is ~$330, but I've been paying $500.  

I recently purchased a car and owe about $25k on it (it was financed with a 0.9% interest rate).  My payments on that are $500 a month.  

These are my only debts, as I pay off my credit card each month.

I should note that the only retirement program that is being offered to me by my employer is a tax sheltered annuity, which I have not been participating in as of yet.

After all my bills, including those above, and money I put aside for groceries/entertainment/etc., I am left with just over $1000 each month.  Currently, I've just been leaving that in my checking account, in which I now have about $5000.  

Worth mentioning is that my two year residency ends in July of 2014, which is when I will transition to a staff position, leading to an increase in base salary of about a factor of two (with a standard deviation of about $10k).  I am not overly worried about immediately finding a position upon completion of my residency, as all of the previous residents in my program have had no trouble doing so (all with jobs lined up before they even finished)...though, of course, I plan on having money saved in case it takes a few months.  

Now that I've summed up my situation, could you give me some advice as to what to do with that extra money I have left over each month?  Should I keep doing what I've been doing and just leave it in a checking account as an emergency fund; should I pay more each month on my student loans; should I look into retirement plans; or should look into other investment options?  If you think the latter two are worthwhile, please give me some specific advice as to what to look into, because I really am not too familiar with either.

Generally there are two things:

* They talk about investments and ROI stuff.
* They speak of investments in commodities (metals, oil, etc).

Sometimes also:

* They are worried about printing money and actions of the Fed.

**Bitcoin is able to answer these three main concerns.**

* It is a currency which totally outperfom a lot of investments for several years.
* It is also a commodity.
* It is decentralized and limited.


**So here is an idea I got based on the tipping bot.**


* Make a list of interesting blogs that you follow and you think that the author has never heard of Bitcoin.


* Send an e-mail asking him to look quickly if Bitcoin might interested because you find it has cool features. (Hint: in that specific blog-o-sphere, it's usual to present yourself by giving your age, and professional function)


* Leave a mail adresse/skype if he has any questions + (optional) leave a concrete example of investment that you have made with detailed ROI obtained.

Leave 0.1BTC (or more) on it and tell him that you just give the equivalent of $4 for the quality of his articles you read for weeks / months / years.

cpa hong kong reviews, haney group project
15 Ways To Invite An IRS Audit
There’s no reason to pay more tax than is legally required, but there’s also no reason to make yourself a target for an Internal Revenue Service audit or to get your return flagged by the IRS’ computers, which match billions of documents each year. So consider what situations might make you more likely to invite government scrutiny at tax time.
Be super wealthy.
This may seem like a “duh” moment. But the IRS finally is increasing the percentage of really rich people it audits, on the reasonable theory there’s a lot more potential to uncover big dollars owed. It even has special “wealth squads” looking at all their holdings.
Hide offshore accounts.
It’s not illegal for U.S. taxpayers to have accounts in Switzerland or Hong Kong or some Caribbean island. It’s only illegal not to declare them or their income. Ask the ex-clients (some now convicts) of Swiss banking giant UBS.
Be a tax protestor.
Let’s be blunt. The IRS simply does not like it when you claim you owe no taxes because the income tax is illegal or only applies to weird income categories that don’t apply to you. Such wacky theories landed actor Wesley Snipes in jail.
Claim huge charitable contributions.
Rules require complete before-you-file documentation of your gifts to nonprofits. The IRS’ use of correspondence audits, in which it demands you mail in the documents backing various deductions, makes claims of substantial contributions a tempting target.
Omit some reported income.
IRS computers are very good at matching all the little pieces of paper you get reporting your income with what you put on your 1040. These papers include employer W-2s and independent contractor, brokerage and bank 1099s.
Take a big home-based business loss every year.
The IRS presumes that a Schedule C business losing money three years out of five is not necessarily all that legitimate. You might have to produce evidence of a profit motive.
Claim a loss on a hobby.
By definition, a hobby is not pursued for profit. But that doesn’t stop some taxpayers from trying to write off expenses for their dog showing, comic book trading or other “business.”
Use a sleazy tax preparer.
The IRS’ efforts to regulate all paid tax preparers were just shot down by a federal judge. But that doesn’t stop its ongoing campaign to ferret out and shut down the sleazy ones. When the feds get onto a tax pro playing fast and loose, his or her clients become easy target
Write off big unreimbursed employee business expenses.
They’re only deductible beyond 2% of adjusted gross income. The IRS may use a by-mail audit to ask for back-up paperwork, thinking you are trying to write off ordinary work clothes, commuting costs and other not-allowed items.
Take deductions in round numbers.
The world is an uneven place. So if you file a tax return taking deductions ending in lots of zeros, the IRS might think you don’t have the required paper backup. You risk an audit by mail.
Make math errors.
IRS computers are programmed to check your math. Returns with errors can invite scrutiny that might trigger more IRS requests for back-up information.
Brag a lot.
Laws require the IRS to pay minimum rewards for tips in cases that result in big collections. The neighbor overhearing your expansive claims may become a government informant.
Anger an ex-business partner, employee or spouse.
They might blow the whistle on you too. And it’s possible they won’t do it just for the informant’s bounty.
Make careless mistakes.
These can include not signing a return, leaving off your Social Security number or miswriting it. All are red flags.
Fail to file on time or at all.
The IRS has a special program that will generate a substitute return using W-2 and 1099 paperwork. Don’t expect it to allow your deductions.

My question is this: Should I pay off the loan right now or just keep making payments until it expires.

Here is my situation: I am 24 and working as a design engineer. I have remaining on my student loans about 50k. After all my expenses and my loan minimum are paid I am left over with, depending on the month, 1400-1600 extra. I have been struggling with where to allocate this money. Would you recommend:

1. Using all of it to aggresively pay down the loan to get out of debt (6.875% interest rate).
2. Contribute monthly to a Roth and use the remaining on the loan (would obviously take longer to pay off the loan).
3. Increase 401k contribution to 10% and use the remaining on the loan (I already contribute 6% which my company matches 100%).

Also, I have about $12k in an investment account that I trade individual stocks with. Not frequent trading, but I keep it active as I learn how to be an investor. Another thing I struggle with is should I remove that money completely and make a big payment on the loan? Or continue to have it invested.

I really dislike having the student loan debt and its my goal to get out of it quickly. But I feel like a plan for setting myself up greatly for the future while taking a little more time on the loans might be more appropriate. What does everyone think? Thanks!

 Posted by Jeremiah Luther  |  Feb 26, 2013","For many people, starting the new year with a bunch of new debt is pretty typical, according to the Denver Post. People use credit cards for their holiday shopping, or perhaps for a big night out on New Years Eve, and around the end of January, the bills begin to hit. Many Coloradans find themselves struggling with debt management once all of these bills come in. There are a number of things that you can do to get those credit cards paid off as quickly and efficiently as possible:

    Make sure you know exactly what you owe.

    The first step is to make sure you know exactly how much money you owe, and to whom. It is also a good idea to get your free credit report if it has been over a year.

    Look into transferring credit card balances.

    By consolidating multiple credits card balances into cards with lower interest rate, you can save some money on repayment. You may also be able to get a deal on balance transfers.

    Make a budget, AND FOLLOW IT.

    This is probably the most important part. Creating the habit of making your payments, and sticking with that habit can go a very long way toward successful debt management.

    Use your credit, but don't abuse it.

    Using the credit that you have can help improve your credit rating, so that in the future you are more likely to be extended credit, and at lower rates. However, when you regularly put more money on your credit cards than you can afford to pay off quickly, this does not look good on your credit report.",finance,1363037427

The US Department of Commerce said last week that Chinese graphite producers will not be subject to anti-dumping penalties.

The department had been investigating possible sanctions against Chinese makers of graphite electrodes, according to the Federal Register. The review assessed transactions that occurred between February 1, 2011 and January 31, 2012.

The department determined that the Chinese graphite producers covered by the review did not sell merchandise at less than normal value.

Elsewhere in the emerging markets, major graphite manufacturer Graphite India (BSE:509488) saw its largest operation crippled by labor unrest last week.

Over 500 protesting workers shut down the company’s Durgapur facility, as per information from a local media source. Employees were demanding the company hire more labor to cut down on overtime worked by current staff.

The Durgapur plant is the largest of Graphite India’s four operations. Its annual output is 34,000 metric tons (MT) per year.

The protest was resolved when management promised to look into the overtime issue, but workers vowed that they will stall operations again if their demands are not addressed.

Shares of Graphite India were down as much as 3.1 percent last week, the largest fall since late August.

Graphite uses expand

Graphite producers and investors are eyeing a number of new uses for graphite, with one of the most interesting horizons for the material being pebble-bed nuclear reactors.

Last week, a US patent was issued to inventors in California for a pebble-bed modular reactor, according to VerticalNews.

The novel nuclear design can be constructed using materials such as graphite, chromium and platinum, according to its creators. But the authors note that “[p]referably the body comprises a first layer of graphite.”

If the technology catches on, it could represent a new and significant source of global graphite demand.

The potential of super-material graphene is also expanding, according to news last week from ElectronicsOnline.

The publication notes that research teams around the world are looking into potential uses for the recently discovered graphite material.

For example, Cambridge University is investigating how flexible graphene could be used in optoelectronics, including touch screens and other display devices.

The material could also have aerospace applications, and researchers are even partnering with firms — like Nokia (NYSE:NOK) — that are interested in developing graphene-based mobile phones that are lighter and more resistant to overheating.

Another major research stream is in “epitaxial graphene,” a material that researchers at Royal Holloway believe could replace silicon. Its diverse potential applications include deep space observation, drugs and explosives detection and health screening. 

Company news

Energizer Resources (TSX:EGZ,OTCBB:ENZR) announced the results of a preliminary economic assessment technical update for its quickly advancing Molo graphite deposit in Madagascar.

The update shows a project net present value of over $421 million based on the operation producing 84,000 MT per year over a 20-year mine life.

The Molo project is forecast to create a 41-percent internal rate of return, with a payback period of three years. Capital costs are a manageable $162 million.

Across the ocean in the US, Alabama Graphite (CNSX:ALP) released more drill results for its Coosa project.

Highlights from the latest batch of drill holes include 74.68 meters grading 2.9-percent graphitic carbon. The company notes in its press release that it expects to have all drilling data in hand by late March. At that point, management will move forward with an initial mineral resource estimate for Coosa.

North of the border, Noram Ventures (TSXV:NRM) announced similar results for its Kokanee project in British Columbia.

The company cut 43.3 meters grading 2.02-percent graphite, along with 54.3 meters grading 1.77-percent graphite.

These are the final results from the company’s initial drilling program at Kokanee. Management noted that the program has been successful in establishing mineralization along a strike length of at least 1,200 meters.

Graphite explorers continue to focus on Canada. On other side of the country, in Quebec, Rock Tech Lithium (TSXV:RCK) released encouraging drill results from its Lochaber project. The step-out and in-fill drill program yielded 91.71 meters grading 2.36-percent graphitic carbon.

Eastern Canada also continues to yield new graphite projects. Paramax Resources (TSXV:PXM.H) announced late last month that it will acquire two graphite projects in Ontario as part of an amalgamation with Mega Graphite.

The property package consists of the past-producing Burgess project as well as the Bedford flake graphite project, site of historic drilling over more than 300 meters of strike length.

Interestingly, the new development company — to be named Mega Graphite Resource — will employ successful Alberta oil entrepreneur David Antony as a director. His successes include oil sands player Southern Pacific Resource (TSX:STP).

On the high-grade side of the ledger, Focus Graphite (TSXV:FMS,OTCQX:FCSMF) released eye-catching results from a 12-hole drill program at its Lac Knife property in Quebec.

Results include 66.8 meters grading 14.68-percent graphitic carbon. The company also announced that metallurgical testing for material from Lac Knife shows recoveries of up to 92.2 percent of contained graphite using a phase II locked-cycle test.

Metallurgical results like these are critical for investors as they give some of the first indications of potential mining dynamics for the slew of graphite deposits in today’s market.

Standard Graphite (TSXV:SGH,OTCQX:DARDF) also recently reported that results from metallurgical testing at its Mousseau East project show promising potential. The company notes in a press release that the average value of the produced concentrates is approximately $1,400 per MT based on three-year average prices.

Bitcoin,How Bitcoin Could Revolutionize Email (idea for the taking),"I suggested recently the creation of a P2P encrypted email program which sends bitcoin with each email. If it's an email you like, you refuse the transaction or auto-return it costing the sender nothing, if it's spam, you take the bitcoin, thus making spam finally once and for all costly.

(I initially suggested a bitcoin-infused email program [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/19jvkr/im_a_web_developer_looking_for_ideas_to_build_a/c8ouedi), and then [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1a20a9/bitcoin_as_a_currency_for_a_united_internet/c8th9zv).

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/19jvkr/im_a_web_developer_looking_for_ideas_to_build_a/c8q8z5s) is highly relevant too, a proposal from a ~decade ago to defeat spam in email called [E-stamps](http://www.templetons.com/brad/spam/estamps.html), which didn't get off the ground because, *""The main drawback was ""There's no digital money infrastructure for small transactions"". Not a problem any more. :)""*)

It's been [requested](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1a20a9/bitcoin_as_a_currency_for_a_united_internet/c8tjduh) that I make this idea a post of its own, so here's the idea :)

There's a couple main problems with email as it currently exists. 

Probably the biggest is that it's not at all private (the NSA is almost assuredly reading your emails), cannot be natively encrypted, relies on a 3rd party, and spam protection relies on AI filters also from a 3rd party, making leaving that service difficult. Also, your 3rd party provider treats you as a marketing vehicle, and earns money off advertisements to you, whereas in my proposal you'd earn money directly off anyone trying to advertise to you or could shut off all adverts easily.

How can we do this?

We need a natively [PGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)-encrypted [peer-to-peer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) email program that requires you to send bitcoin to the recipient along with any email.

If the recipient knows the sender, they simply refuse the transaction, thus costing your friends and loved-ones absolutely nothing.

But if it's a spammer or a scammer, you can collect their fee, thus costing them, or you could elect to *raise the minimum price* to send you anything, resulting in far few spammers being willing to jump the bar.

Imagine if you set your read-limit to say 0.5 btc. If you actually got an email from an advertiser willing to buy 30 seconds of your time to read their advert at that price, you might just be willing to do it happily.

*Spam is no longer a waste of time*, you could actually earn money by reading it if you so chose. Thus, instead of being Google's billion-dollar advert monkey, you start earning fees from advertisers directly, or you can use a mechanism to strongly discourage all spam by setting your unknown-sender fee to, say, 100btc. 

Meet a new friend and want to whitelist them instantly? Whitelist their public BTC address by adding it to your address book just as you'd add someone's email address. Now they can email you cost-free, meaning they can also send risk-less emails to you with zero bitcoin fee without worry that it will be rejected or that you'll take their coin. In practice they'd have to send one-satoshi I think, so that it couldn't be spoofed.

I don't know how you would do this on the technical end in a P2P fashion, honestly, perhaps using some instant-messenger protocols.

Also, bitcoin can help with fake and phishing emails, since spending out of a known bitcoin wallet is one way to verify a person's identity, since only they should have control over that specific address. Perhaps you could even replace email addresses entirely with block-chain address? Or at least verify them behind the scenes using btc addresses.

Maybe we could revolutionize email this way. I think a lot of people would be interested in a final solution for spam, one that shifts the costs to the spammer, vastly increases privacy and eliminates snooping, and stops a 3rd party from reading your emails. Maybe we could go for the *coup de grace* and implement self-destructing messages too :)

Gmail killer? Maybe.

We need to move beyond 3rd party trust. That's what bitcoin has done for finance. Continue the revolution, do it for email.

I leave the details to you, as I am a neophyte programmer.

---

*For some challenges to this idea, perhaps that may need to be overcome, see [here](http://www.templetons.com/brad/spam/estamps.html#bad). The most significant of these is how do you deal with strangers that want to do you a favor by sending you a quick note without costing them money?

Perhaps you can simply refuse their transaction upon reading it and it costs them nothing, and auto-refuse the transaction of any email that you don't read after a time. But it would raise the bar of random-stranger emailing, since some people would just take the payment regardless.*",cryptocurrency,1362995654

personalfinance,Trying to dig myself out of debt with another loan. Advice needed.,"I can provide more details if needed. I will try to be brief. Basically after a divorce I am stuck with a car that I can't pay for. I would like to sell the car, but I owe more than it is worth. I owe $20,000 - I can private sell it for between $13,000-$15,000.

Plan 1. Borrow $20K, pay off car, get title, sell car - repay most of loan on the spot.

I also have around $11,500 in credit debt. This also is the amount of actual credit that I have. As in, I have maxed out all of my cards.

My credit was great until last year. I just checked my credit through the three main providers in the US - all showed that I have paid on time, forever. This isn't exactly true. This year I have been late 2-3 times - late about 4-5 days. I have always paid more than the minimum. Still, my credit should still be above average.

Plan 2. Consolidate both the auto loan and credit debt into a single loan for around $30,000. Sell car, pay back potentially half of loan.

I called my bank today to try to do that and was, of course, denied. I figure they look at the debt ratio / amount I earn and figure it's a bad idea. And if I wasn't planning to sell my car and get rid of the $500 car payment, insurance, and gas costs, I would agree. On paper - with the car in my possession - I obviously cannot afford payments on another loan. Without it, I can.

Basically I understand these loans - specifically the programs that say ""yes"" or ""no"" - don't really take my plan into consideration. Does anyone have any advice on how I can demonstrate my plan and have them take that into consideration? Because without the car I free up close to $1000 in monthly expenses and I can literally get myself out of a major jam. 

I am not even concerned with higher than average interest rates because I am sure I can sell my car. Any advice will be appreciated.",finance,1363132561

Best way to do it?","Hey all,

Here's my situation. I appreciate any advice.

I recently came into some unexpected money to the tune of 130,000 USD. I'm trying to figure out the best way to use it.

I've got a $200,000 mortgage on a $200,000 house (I used the VA loan to purchase it last year and have just paid off the origination fees). The payment is $1250 on a 30-year loan at 3.75%. I've got the house rented out for $1500 a month, so the payment is covered comfortably.

I'm thinking that my best option at this point is to refinance my mortgage into a 5/1 ARM so I can take advantage of the better amortization schedule and lower interest rate. I could put a chunk of my cash towards it as well. I've never refinanced before, so: any input on what the ideal lump sum amount would be? 20%? More? Should I pay the lump sum towards principal on my current loan then refinance, or do it the other way around (refinance it and pretty much use it as a down payment)?

I'll use whatever remains of the 130k to start looking for a second rental property, so I don't want to use any more than is necessary to get ideal terms. I really think a refinance is the right move as it will save me a ton of interest in the long run and help me build equity at a much faster rate.",finance,1363124575

When I was a child, my mother died and I inherited a few thousand dollars; the money stayed in my grandmother's name (as my legal guardian).  Years ago, my grandmother cashed the CD without my knowledge to bail herself out of some debts and spent $6000 of the $16,000 that was in the deposit.  When I confronted her, she admitted to it and said she had been trying to figure out a way to repay me some of the $6k, but didn't know how.

In 2010, again without my knowledge, she ended up taking out a life insurance policy for herself with me as the only beneficiary (she was 81 at the time).  The premium was $10,000 and, in reviewing the paperwork, the 'initial specified amount' is about $14,000 and it has an 'initial interest rate' of 3.5%.  I can appreciate that she is trying to do the right thing and I'm grateful, but I don't really know the first thing about life insurance and neither does she.  I am also wary of letting the money stay in her name considering her history.

* Can somebody help me understand what actually happens to the money in this policy?  Is it earning interest, or do I simply receive $14,000 upon her death?
* In the event of her death, what kind of taxation should I expect?
* Would it make more sense for me to ask her to break the contract, gift the money back to me, and invest it in something else?

Thanks in advance.  Dealing with this money has been incredibly stressful, I'll just be glad to get it somewhere safe until I need it.",finance,1363119649

The history of mining in Quebec stretches back over 300 years, to 1686, when Chevalier de Troyes discovered the province’s first lead deposit in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region. However, Troyes’ discovery wasn’t exploited for nearly 200 years, when Quebec’s first mines opened in the 1840s and 1850s.

Today, mining is a key contributor to the province’s growth: Quebec is home to 200 active mines, quarries and sandpits, according to its natural resources department. That includes 20 metal mines, such as Xstrata’s (LSE:XTA) Raglan nickel project and Agnico-Eagle Mines’ (TSX:AEM,NYSE:AEM) LaRonde gold mine, which also hosts significant reserves of silver, zinc, copper and lead.

There is also huge exploration and development potential, notably in the Labrador Trough, which straddles the border between Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, where 15 billion metric tons of iron ore are currently being explored. In all, the provincial government states, 50,000 Quebecers rely on the mining industry for their livelihoods.

Mining execs cool on Quebec

Even so, the last few weeks have seen the release of surveys that indicate that both citizens and mining firms are exhibiting changed attitudes toward Quebec.

On February 28, the Fraser Institute released the results of its annual survey of mining companies, under which it queried 4,100 exploration, development and otherwise mining-related firms from around the world. Based on the data it collected, the think tank assigned each jurisdiction a rating, which it calls a policy potential index score.

The result? Quebec finished outside the top 10 mining destinations in 2012, coming in at number 11 of 96 jurisdictions. That performance comes after the province held the top spot from 2007 to 2010 before slipping to number four  in 2011.

“Falling from No. 1 to 11th in just three years tells us that the mining policies of the Quebec government, particularly uncertainty around changes to the provincial mining act and proposed royalty hikes, are a serious concern to the global mining community,” Kenneth Green, the institute’s senior director of energy and natural resources and the survey’s director, said in a press release.

PQ’s election raises concern

Green’s statement refers to the province’s Parti Quebecois government, led by Pauline Marois, which was elected in September 2012. During the campaign, the PQ proposed a 5-percent minimum royalty on the value of all minerals mined in the province. It also advocated adding a 30-percent tax on mining company profits above a certain as-yet-undetermined level, similar to a tax currently in force in Australia.

In addition, Marois threatened to “redo” Plan Nord, the previous Liberal government’s strategy to bring infrastructure to the province’s north and spur the progress of various mining projects there. The Liberals felt the plan, which involves $80 billion in public and private investment over 25 years, would generate about $14 billion in revenue over that period and contribute $162 billion to Quebec’s GDP, according to an August 2012 Globe and Mail article.

The province didn’t introduce the new royalty regime in its first budget following the election, but Finance Minister Nicholas Marceau remains committed to doing so. However, he now plans to hold consultations with miners before the government unveils the new royalty scheme.

“We want to bring in these changes in an orderly and responsible manner to ensure the stability of the mining sector,” he told the Montreal Gazette in November. “We will consult the industry and the stakeholders concerned about this issue so that everyone benefits from the changes that will be made.” These consultations will be held at a meeting on March 15, according to a recent Forbes article.

The government’s approach to Plan Nord also remains unsettled, though Marois’ view appears to have softened somewhat. “We are committed to the Plan Nord, but we will do the thing differently,” she told Bloomberg in December. “We will respect the First Nations, and we will protect the environment because it’s important for us.”

Quebecers favor higher royalties: poll

Meanwhile, recent polling from Leger Marketing for the Canadian Boreal Initiative shows that the PQ’s position on royalties appears to be resonating with the province’s population. Leger polled 1,000 respondents from across Quebec. Of that sample, 55 percent said mining royalties are too low, 11 percent said they are fair and 6 percent feel they are too high.

Moreover, 82 percent of respondents said that mining companies shouldn’t be granted claims on private land without first getting landowners’ consent, as is the current practice in Quebec. And 82 percent feel that municipalities should be able to restrict mining on certain parts of their territories.

Opinion split on uranium mining

Leger also polled Quebecers specifically on uranium mining. Results show that just 24 percent of respondents were aware of plans to mine uranium in Quebec. When asked about their approval of these operations in the province, 35 percent were in favor and 39 percent were opposed.

In Northern Quebec, where Strateco Resources (TSX:RSC) is focused on expanding the uranium deposit at its Matoush property in the Otish mountains, opinion was similar, with 55 percent not in favor of such a project in the province’s north and 35 percent supporting it. Awareness of the issue ran higher in Northern Quebec, at 66 percent.

“The findings show that more than three-quarters of respondents [in the province as a whole] haven’t heard of this issue,” said Strateco spokesperson Denis Boucher in a March 11 phone interview. “That lack of awareness allows people to fill the void.”

“Uranium mining has been done safely in Saskatchewan for 50 years,” he added. “We have to make sure we are present with science-based information that uranium mining is safe. The more we explain what measures are being taken, the more we can raise awareness. People are intelligent; the more we communicate, the more they will understand that uranium mining can be done safely and that they can rely on the judgments of experts — including the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.”

The company has been waiting for the province to issue a decision regarding the project’s advanced exploration phase for two years, according to a recent press release. The delay has prompted Strateco to file a motion with the Quebec Superior Court to force a resolution.

“The next step is to get an answer from the provincial government,” said Boucher. “We have had favorable responses from all regulatory bodies to this point — including the federal government, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and the provincial review committee — and we are waiting for one last decision from the province. But it is taking a very long time, which is why we turned to the tribunals.”

business,Gilford Securities Issues Research Report on VirnetX Holding Corporation,"Gilford Securities, a full-service investment firm, headquartered in New York City, reiterated their Buy rating for VirnetX Holding Corporation (AMEX: VHC) in a research report issued to clients. 
Updating the buy rating and thesis on the company, the analyst wrote, “Judge Leonard Davis issued his opinion regarding all post-trial motions last evening, February 26th. Overall the ruling was as expected and favorable for VirnetX and its shareholders. It was stern but not extreme in any manner, the best outcome possible in our opinion – assuming the decision is appealed, we believe it will be considered “reasonable” in the eyes of a panel/Federal Court of Appeals. Because the final opinion issued last evening was very reasonable, in our opinion, Apple must consider whether it is worthwhile to pursue the matter via the appeals process. As indicated in prior research, if AAPL were to appeal the decision, we do not view this to be an impediment.”
Highlighting other key points in the favorable ruling, the analyst further stated: “An injunction was not imposed, nor did the Judge “assign” a royalty rate, which we expected – however, the Judge has required the parties to meet via mediation and attempt to establish a licensing arrangement within a period of 45 days – net, the Judge took a constructive/firm but not extreme tack, instructing the two parties to determine a reasonable arrangement on their own terms, the best outcome in our opinion – again, we feel a partnership is in the best interests of both parties. The Judge did conclude VirnetX provided “substantial evidence” supporting a 1% royalty rate – net, this is significant at it sets a precedent for any potential deals established with remaining litigants and non-litigants in the future – investor concern/debate related to future negotiations/applicable royalty rates should now abate.”
In conclusion, the analyst said, “Finally, as major litigation efforts appear to be winding down, investors should focus on the company moving forward in an effort to establish licensing arrangements with non-litigants in the coming months. We anticipate the core strength of the company’s model emerging during 2013.

Update: it looks like I can use ""KwikPay override"" to force it to pay. I suspect this is more of a technical issue.  It happened because I was paying more than the minimum, but elected to pay the minimum for the current month.",finance,1363094349
personalfinance,Progress since Dec. 2012,"I started tackling my finances in December. My CC debt, 13K, had gotten out of hand and I was fed up. I started using mint for tracking/budgeting and have really turned things around. I have paid off my car loan, 2400, and a personal loan 1800 and have just started to pay down the CC. More info:

    * I am 57, my wife is older and will retire in a year or so.

    * Combined net income 6k/mo, my income accounts for 80%

    * Mortgage 86k balance, 770/mo

    * CC debt 13.5, just started paying 1200/mo, interest is 160/mo now

    * No other debts

    * Budget is 4k/mo

Budget breakdown:

    * 910 - Home mort/ins

    * 716 - Gifts and donations

    * 565 - Bills/Utilities (fuel oil, electric, internet, phones etc)

    * 150 - Auto

    * 500 - Food

    * 400 - Shopping

    * 330 - Taxes (property tax)

    * 100 - Health (pharmacy)

    * 180 - Fees &amp; Charges (CC interest)

Total budget 4K/mo

I ditched cable TV and am saving 100/mo doing that. Personal loan and car loan payments were 700/mo.  Drastically reduced food/shopping, one month (before dec.) we had 1200 in food alone.  I bring my lunch to work, we are cooking more, eating out less.  Analysis of our spending the months prior to Dec. was that we were pretty much spending every cent we had. Both my wife and I are also being very careful of spending money.  She is planning on retiring when the CC is paid off, so she hardly buys anything now. :)

Much of this turnaround I owe to you all, so I just wanted to say thanks.  Any comments/suggestions are welcome.

personalfinance,Need help identifying what student loan my parents are paying.,"My parents have been paying about $350/mo to Great Lakes, a federal loan service provider for the past two years on my sister's and my behalf.  Trouble is, I have absolutely no idea where this money is going - it certainly isn't being funneled into paying any of my debt.  However, my parents insist that they have been making regular payments on ""their share of the debt"" - something that they never cosigned for (explained by them as something just part of the FAFSA application).  During the process of applying for and getting loans, I made sure to educate myself on the subject - but I've never heard of anything like this.  Can you help me ID what they are putting their money into?

Things I know:
* The loan that they are paying off is ~4%
* They never took out any PLuS loans for either kid.
* The payments are made to the same company that services my Stafford loans, but the payments have NOT been applied to any of my student loan debt.
* They insist that this debt is their share of both my sister' and my consolidated debt - one fund for both of us.

I already have an emergency fund, and a roth IRA which I am contributing towards. I have about $10,000 of money that I simply don't need in my emergency fund (savings) nor do I need it in my checking account. I don't want to invest it in the stock market and I already basically maxed out my IRA for this year. (Just $300 short of maxing it out) 

I was looking on treasurydirect.gov and interests rates are so low on T-Bills, T-Notes, and TIPS that I feel like the best place to store this sum of money for the time being is in a CD. Are there any other alternatives? I want the money to be fairly easy to liquidate if need be, be in a safe investment, but I'd like it to earn the best interest rate possible. I am leaning towards opening a CD at Ally. I know that I forfeit 60 days worth of interest for an early withdrawal, but I'm ok with that because if I did need to withdraw the money it would be for a good reason like in an emergency scenario.",finance,1363053814
personalfinance,"A little over $60k in student loans, some money saved up, what to do?","I've been putting off asking this question here for a while because I'm somewhat dreading what the outcome will be. I graduated from college 2 years ago with about $70k in loans which I have been slowly paying off but at the same time I have been saving cash because I wanted to buy a new car or put a down payment towards eventually buying my own place.

I am 27 right now, and also due to my student loans and not having a credit card before I went to college, I cannot get any type of credit card due to my debt/income ratio. I have not missed a single payment for my loans since I had to start paying them, yet my credit score still isn't that great, and again, equifax or whatever says its due to my debt/income ratio.

Anyways, I've got close to $25k in my savings account right now and after seeing how many people are paying off their loans, I'm wondering what I should do with it. I have a number of different loans which have interest rates from 4.5%-6%, the crazy part is my government loans have a higher interest rate than my private student loans.

Should I pay off as much of the loans that I can, should I try to invest the money, or should I do something else with it? I currently live at home, but in about 2 months I may move out and rent somewhere, although I'm not certain for sure yet.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

**Edit:** 

And yes, correction, by ""new"" car, I meant ""new used car."" Although the reality is I probably won't be buying any type of car since my current car is perfectly fine and since I take the train daily, I use only use the car on the weekends, and even then, I end up driving it maybe twice a month. I'm a car enthusiast and I always dreamed of buying a car that I wanted once I was done with school and working, but it really breaks my heart not being able to do so due to the debt I'm in.

I have about $12,500 in student loan debt spread across 5 government loans and almost $17,000 left to pay on my car.  The student loan interest is higher than the car loan, so my strategy for paying everything off is to make all my scheduled payments, and then make extra payments to one student loan at a time (choosing based on interest rate and size of loan) until that loan is paid off, and then moving to the next one.


My emergency fund is only $1000 (not enough to cover one month of expenses) but I have a secure, well-paying job (already contributing to 401k up to max company match).  I am using Mint for budgeting.  

My question related to net income is, since I am focusing on paying down the debt, and I have an emergency fund, is it ideal to keep net income every month at $0, where I am spending every dollar I make per month, and every extra dollar not spent toward a budget item is contributed to the loan I am focusing on?",finance,1363209872

personalfinance,Chances of getting a paid tax lien completely removed from the 3 CRAs.,"I was just discussing with a friend about if it was possible that the 3 CRAs would remove a recent paid tax lien with a goodwill letter explaining that the State did not disclose the consequences of not paying his state tax bill. Just a little information on that; Long before the tax lien was filed, the state department of revenue informed him that the owed state taxes (owed because of a screw up with state withholding paperwork by his employer), could just be taken out of his next federal return. He could have paid it in full anyway, but he just figured, just let them take it from the federal return. Well come January he gets another letter from the state saying that if he doesn't pay them by the end of February, it will go to collection. He paid before the deadline. Upon checking his credit, he finds that a tax lien was placed in public record before they sent the notice of intent to send to collection. Again, no mention was ever made of a tax lien going to public records. Now granted ignorance of the law and all that is not an excuse, but we are just wondering if explaining to the 3 CRAs with a goodwill letter that his previous credit history is excellent and he wants to buy a house in a year and doesn't want what was a misunderstanding make it more difficult when he could have easily just paid it off could get the negative information removed from all 3 credit reports.

financialindependence,Thoughts on Vanguard Tax-Exempt U.S. State Municipal Funds,"I am currently in the mode of maxing out all tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Eventually I will shift to the mode of non-tax-advantaged savings for the purposes of early retirement. Assuming I am investing in a fund (rather than say, real estate), I am trying to assess the best place for the money. 

I have read this Bogleheads article on tax efficient asset placement (great read by the way): http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement

But I keep coming back to the Vanguard Tax-Exempt State Municipal Funds. (I live in a state that Vanguard offers. Here is an example for Florida: https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0518&amp;FundIntExt=INT) They seem to have many advantages: federally tax exempt, state tax exempt, decent return/risk for a bond fund, low expense, etc. 

Am I missing something? Are these funds a bad idea for some reason I am not seeing? I understand they may not have as high of a return as riskier investments and are still subject to inflation risk, but I like the tax-exempt side of it.

My tax-advantaged accounts are low cost index funds of about 80%/20% stocks/bonds and my Roth IRA is mostly in REIT's. I wouldn't put all non-tax-advantaged money in the municipal bond fund, but I was considering putting a majority there. Is this a bad idea?

They found a company called ""National Legal Services"" ([http://www.nlservicing.com](http://www.nlservicing.com)) that told them they could, for a fee, remodify their loan (not refinance) down to a 2.*something* interest rate and keep it still a 30-year loan (they currently have a 30 year FHA loan, with a low 5% interest rate) and they could save $800 to $1000 per month. They told my family member it would only take 60-90 days to go through, and if they went through the bank it could take up to a year.


This deal seems too good to be real. Combine that with I can't really find anything online about this company (except the occasional ""ripoff report"" which I'm not positive is tied to them or not), and I'm just feeling skeptical about these guys.


Has anybody heard of these guys before, or what they are trying to help out my family member with? Is there another reputable company out there that does this?

1. I realize this was stupid. I was 17, naive, had no guidance, and parents willing to sign anything to help me ""follow my dreams"" who were also uneducated.

2. I realize that is not an excuse, I am simply stating the circumstances.

3. Hindsight is great. The debt is here, so I don't need a ""scolding"" on my life choices. I want to fix this, that's why I am trying to think and discuss it more.

4. Please spare us all the discussion on how I ""could have done it cheaper"", believe me I know...now.

So, to spare the details the fact of the matter is I am an airline pilot with student loans around $210000. Contrary to popular belief, we do not typically make tons of bucks. I have been doing this for 7 years almost (I am 29 now) and FINALLY broke 40k Gross last year. The prospects for making more and or ever getting past the 100k income mark is indefinitely far in the future or not at all.

Right now the payments on this loan are ~$1400/mo mostly interest, a shit ton of my net income. The lender will not provide any relief or help or refinancing or any kind of deal whatsoever. I do not own a house, I have a cheap car which was a gift given to me. I live with my parents rent free to dump cash into this. I still have made 0 headway. The interest is variable at 6.7%. My last payment is scheduled for 2042. My Mom is cosigned and in her own financial straights.

What kinds of advice or solutions or ideas or really just anything might you all have? I think talking about this is a good first step. I set up a lame ""gofundme"" page, but I doubt I can get 200,000 people to give me a dollar (or any combo thereof). I have a girlfriend whom I would love to marry one day, have kids, have a house, and all that normal stuff that my friends who do not have debt are doing. I would like to at least move out of my Mom's house. It's beyond frustrating/depressing/etc and I have been through all those ups and downs on and off for years over this.

business,"Sentralbanker Pause, men ""Valuta krig"" ikke Over","Sentralbanker Pause, men ""Valuta krig"" ikke Over, the avanti group latest articles
Forrige uke så en bemerkelsesverdig fem av gruppen av 10 sentralbanker holder politikk styremøter: Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Bank av Canada (BOC), Bank av Japan (BOJ), Bank of England (BoE) og den europeiske sentralbanken (ECB). Alle som var på vent, og ingen gjort noen policy beveger seg. Likevel var hint om at de ga nok til å antyde at dette er bare et mellomspill i det som har blitt kalt ""valuta krigene.""
Møtene gjort det klart at den ""valuta kriger"" er fortsatt med oss, og avklart hver sentralbankens holdning i disse krigene. Det har ennå ikke klart som vil ""vinne"" krigene ved å svekke sin valuta mest, men USA synes satt til å være en ""loser"" ved å ha sin valuta stige i verdi mot de andre.
RBA var første av blokk. Guvernør Glenn Stevens var litt mer fengende om økonomien, noe som økte den australske dollaren. Men han igjen åpne lettelser døren av gjentok at benign inflasjon outlook ""ville ha råd til omfanget for å lette politikk videre, bør det være nødvendig for å støtte etterspørsel.""
(Se: vil RBA brukervennligheten i 2013?)
Vi tror det er nøkkelen til australske dollar / US dollar: RBA beholder sin lettelser bias, og med dens kontanter rate fortsatt på relativt astronomiske nivå med 3 prosent, er det eneste store sentralbanken som har fortsatt betydelig rom for å lette. Det er vårt inntrykk at RBA bruker denne spillerom som et verktøy for verbal intervensjon for å holde sin valuta fra å verdsette, og dermed slik at det å lette uten lettelser, som det var.
BOC, den eneste G-10 central bank som har vært truende å vandre priser, fortsatte å gå tilbake den trusselen. Siden April i fjor det har vært truende ""noen beskjedne uttak"" av sine monetære stimulans en gang i fremtiden, men i januar det myknet sin holdning ved å si at timingen var ""mindre nært forestående.""
Rygg-det pedalled videre denne måneden, sa at den eksisterende politikken ""vil trolig holde seg passende for en periode."" Denne uttalelsen kommer nær ""politikk varighet effekten"" som sentralbanker har begynt å stole på: lovet å holde prisene lave i lang tid til å forbedre effektiviteten av deres politikk. Det er nøyaktig det motsatte av trusselen å trekke stimulans i fremtiden.
Kunne denne endringen av hjertet være relatert til et annet punkt sentralbanken har gjort for måneder er det ""vedvarende styrken i kanadiske dollar. I oktober og desember det skylden styrken på ""trygg havn flyter og søl-overs fra globale pengepolitikken;"", selv om den har siden falt disse kommentarene, kan BOC begynner å tenke, ""Hvis du ikke kan beat 'em, bli med 'em.""
BOJ var ikke forventet å ta noen nye tiltak siden dette var det siste møtet under utgående guvernør Masaaki Shirakawa. Likevel var det betydelig at to styremedlemmer legge fram sine egne lettelser forslag.
(Les mer: Kuroda vil være Carlos Ghosn av BOJ)

Selv om de begge var beseiret, forslagene ble et offentlig tegn at innkommende guvernøren, Haruhiko Kuroda, har minst to allierte på eksisterende styret. Han vil også uten tvil kunne regne med støtte fra hans to nye nestleder guvernører, minst i starten. Som gir ham et flertall på ni-person styret og betyr at BOJ kan starte løsne politikk rett fra sin første møtet på den 4 April.
Det var ingen kunngjøring etter BoE-møte, som er tilfelle når komiteen gjør ingen endringer. I alle tilfelle, er den neste endringen i BoE politikk trolig komme fra kansler George Osborne, som er angivelig vurderer å bruke budsjettet sitt mars 20 h for å gi den gamle damen i Threadneedle Street mer spillerom.
(Les mer: Bank of England mislykkes å utvide eiendelen kjøp)
Alternativene som er sagt å være under diskusjon inkluderer gir at BoE mer tid til å bringe inflasjon tilbake innenfor rekkevidde mål; gi det et dobbelt mandat å målrette både Sysselsetting og inflasjon, som Fed har. Noen av disse endringene vil forsterke Osbornes melding ""finanspolitiske konservatisme og monetære aktivisme,"" som bare skjer for å være den standard lærebok resepten på hvordan å svekke en valuta.
Ved å slippe en tidligere kommentar han hadde gjort om styrken av euro poserer en nedsiderisiko til inflasjon, igangsatte ECB President Mario Draghi noen kort dekker som sendte euro/amerikansk dollar rocketing (midlertidig). Men han innrømmet at ECB rådet hadde vurdert en rate cut, og siden de revidert ned sine inflasjon prognoser for neste år til 1,3 prosent - farlig lavt i lys av den europeiske Sentralbankens inflasjonsmålet på ""mindre enn, men nær 2 prosent"" - beslutningen om ikke å kutte prisene synes å være hovedsakelig basert på håp om at deres prognose av en oppgang i andre omgang blir virkelighet.
I tillegg var Draghis uttalelse i sin pressekonferanse at ""vår pengepolitikk vil være imøtekommende så lenge som nødvendig"" en bemerkelsesverdig endring i tone fra noen som til nå har insistert på at ""vi aldri pre-commit."" En eventuell løsne av holdning på ECB virker sannsynlig hvis forventede utvinningen svikter å ankomme i tide, som jeg forventer.
Et motiv og et våpen
Kort sagt, forrige ukes fem sentralbanken møter bekreftet at minst fire av den industrielle verden 10 store sentralbanker er fortsatt vurderer lettelser, og femte en (BOC) synes å være å flytte på den måten. I noen tilfeller, som Japan og britiske synes valutaen å være en uuttalt mål for pengepolitikken; i andre, er som Australia og Canada, valutaen naturlig kommer til å bli påvirket av pengepolitikken uavhengig av om det er en bevisst mål.
For forex handelsfolk, det viktige poenget er at alle disse sentralbanker har begge grunner til å lette videre og plass til å lette videre: et motiv og et våpen, man kan si. Den amerikanske Federal Reserve, derimot, er debattere om, når og hvordan å slappe av sin stimulans politikk.
Mens Fed styreformann Ben Bernanke har forsikret markedene at kvantitative lettelser vil forblir på plass, det er ikke mye snakk i dag av tilføyer å den noen radikale nye lettelser tiltak, er slik som tilfelle i Storbritannia og Japan, eller selv på å løsne eigedomsprisane, som vi hører fra Australia og Europa.

Vi får mer avklaring av det amerikanske synet fra neste Federal Open Market Committee møte på mars 19-20. Med mindre noen uforutsette endring er annonsert da, ville jeg forventer å se dollaren fortsetter å rally som andre land løsne eigedomsprisane.

personalfinance,"Wanting to take out a big loan for a post-graduation trip around Europe, will banks/CUs do this?","I'm 22, and am finishing my Master's degree in a technical field this semester. I have about $20k in federal student loan debt, like $5k left on my car payment, and maybe $2,000 in savings.

Basically what I want to do is get a loan for $10k, go to Europe for 6-8 weeks, then come back and get a job/start my career. I feel like in a simple world I would be able to be like, ""Look bank, I'm going to make a pretty great living when I get a job, I'll be able to pay you back, so just let me borrow a bunch of money for a nice vacation in between my school career and my career career.""

My credit score is like 750, but what they called a ""thin file,"" because I've only ever had one credit card and one (non-student) loan (my car).

So will a loan like this be hard to get? I know it can vary a lot by region, but what sort of interest rate would be considered low? Also I know I should just go into some different banks and credit unions and apply, but I want to see if anyone in the subreddit had some advice first. So thanks in advance!",finance,1363295034
personalfinance,Advice on paying off a school loan,"My husband and I have paid off all our debt except our school loans. His will be paid off next month but I still have about $8K left on mine. The interest is a standard federal school loan around 8%-ish.  My mom told me that I should go to my bank &amp;amp; take a loan out through them to pay off my school loan. 

Basically so I would make payments on a lower interest loan to the bank &amp;amp; my ""official"" school loan would be paid off. Is this smart? I've paid off other loans before but I've never gone about it this way so I'm in unfamiliar territory &amp;amp; let's just say I don't really look up to my parents for advice on money. 

One final thing to consider, we are planning on buying a house next January. Would this lower my credit by closing the school account and taking out a new loan?

gaming,My Tale of EA Customer Support (Non-SimCity),"IN-COMING WALL OF TEXT!

On Saturday, March 9th, I purchased the Mass Effect Trilogy. Skip forward to Monday, March 11th. I've just beaten Mass Effect, all is going well. I begin installing ME2, at around 5 PM. I should be done by 8, be able to play for an hour, and go to bed! Well, hmm, the game seems to be taking awhile.

Now it's 9 PM. Ah well, I can play for a few minutes, the game is finished installing. Well shit, it's not letting me import my saves. Fuck it, going to bed!

Tuesday, March 12th: Got up, had cereal, took some time to woke up, and contacted the EA Live Chat Support. 30 minutes later, I'm told they can't help me, so they give me a number to call. I call up EA Customer Support. We managed to get around to importing my saves. Keep in mind that I launched the game ONE TIME. It's important, remember it!

I go to launch the game, still on the phone with Customer Support. The woman over the phone seems nice, and speaks english to boot!

""Syncing Cloud Saves"". -short pause- ""Syncing Cloud Saves"". That's odd. The game doesn't even launch. It synced my cloud saves twice, then nothing. I try to launch again. Syncing cloud saves, then pause, then syncing again, then nothing. The woman tells me to reinstall Mass Effect 2... Yes, okay, let me spend the next 4 hours installing my game, then sit through your hour-long queue again if it doesn't do shit. But of course, I'm optimistic at the time, and in no hurry to be a dick to the nice EA lady.

We say goodbye, and depart. I spend the next 2 or 3 hours reinstalling Mass Effect 2. It's about 2:30 by the time it's finished. I launch one time, my save is still there, decide to close the game to mess with the settings in the Config. I launch the game a second time. ""Syncing cloud saves"". ..No. No come the fuck on no no why fuck why no fuck no.

So of course, as fate would have it, I sit through the queue again. About an hour later, I am met with a man who I can't quite determine if he is British or Middle Eastern. Whatever, just wanna play my fucking game. I tell them my problem, and you'll love this. ""Er... This.. This is the FIFA 2013 queue. We can't do anything about your problem, I'm afraid"".

Wait... What the fuck? This is the same number I called at 11 AM. Not that long ago, so why the fuck am I suddenly in a different queue? Whatever, the guy is polite, he sends me to the website to set up a callback number so I don't have to wait in a queue on Speaker Phone. But guess what? The only option is ""Live chat!"" We go on for a good 20 minutes trying to figure out THEIR FUCKING WEBSITE, but come to the conclusion I'm just going to have to wait in the queue. I'm losing my patience, but fuck, I'm desperate to play fucking Mass Effect 2. It's kinda sad, really..

About 10 minutes into the queue, the music starts to fade, and soon, there are only a few electrical noises coming from my phone. The battery is fine? It says I'm still in the call? I hang up, because fuck, what am I going to do? Call back, and I'm suddenly going to the Bahamas! What luck, right? Did they fucking disconnect the number and somehow have their number changed with a contest line? What in THE FUCK is so god damn problematic about playing Mass Effect 2 that the Universe and God themselves are conspiring against me?

I finally get fed up and contact the Live Chat as a last resort, just to try and figure out what is going on, even though they can't help me in any way. I tell them something along the lines of ""Okay, it's been long enough, I've lost my patience, just fix my game."" They say they're going to escalate it to their specialist team, and email me. FUCKING SWEET! We're getting our shit together!

About 2 hours later, they finally email me one time. Ask me a few questions, I reply. Time passes, shit happens, no reply. I go to bed defeated and broken. The next day, a reply! More questions, and useless answers. ""Try turning off cloud saves"" being one of them. I reply back that I've already tried this. Honestly, it's my fault though, I should have told them that I already tried that.

Wednesday, March 14th. It has been 3 days since I last played Mass Effect 1, and since I first installed Mass Effect 2. I feel like this is karma for all the people I laughed at who cried about SimCity not working for this long. They haven't even messaged me today, it's 4:12 PM. I replied twice, one time telling them more information in response to yesterday's email, and once today to tell them ""Fuck it, take the game from my library and give me a Steam Code. Literally every other game on my computer works, so CLEARLY, YOUR platform is BROKEN.""

Still no reply.

personalfinance,Assuming a mortgage,"So, I'm looking at a house that has the option to assume the mortgage. The interest rate on that mortgage is 3.25%. The current owner purchased the home in 2005 for $172,900 in June, 2006. She still owes $154,000 (guess she didn't put much/anything down). The house is currently valued at $167,000 and is on the market for $174,000. so, the difference between assessed value and paid principal is $13,000. I've read that assuming mortgages is worthwhile if you can meet two criteria. First, the principal paid down should be less than 20%. In this case, it is less than 10%. The other consideration is the future of interest rates. If they are expected to go up, assuming a loan is a good idea, as I can also sell the house with the loan assumption (it is transferable). However, I see no reason to believe that interest rates will be rising in the near term.

So, what are your thoughts on this situation? Is an assumption worth considering, or should I just get a regular old mortgage. Thanks, PF!",finance,1363272403

2. generate response histogram from vocabulary given descriptors of image N
3. Response histograms and class labels fed into training matrix
4. training matrix fed to SVM

With 300 images, I get 70% accuracy with the algorithm (Clusters 186) 
With ~500 images, it goes down to 52% (Clusters 186)

So, with the 300 images and 186 clusters, im at 70%. Then I can chance cluster amount to 180 and it'll go down to 50%. Or I can change it to 500 and it'll be at 66%

Bedragare sova aldrig, det verkar och Better Business Bureau vill vara säker att konsumenterna resten lätt i vetskap om att de inte har fallit för de senaste systemen. Här är några av de senaste bedragaren tomter som har kommit till ljuset:
— Den falska FTC konsumenternas klagomål anmälan
Ett senare försök att phish för konsumenternas personliga och bankinformation är i form av en Federal Trade Commission ""Anmälan av konsumenternas klagomål."" Det mejla meddelandet levereras komplett med en riktigt snygg FTC logotyp. Meddelandet anger att ett klagomål har lämnats in mot ditt företag, som kräver dig att svara på anklagelserna. En länk som du uppmanas att klicka på för att ladda ner en PDF av klagomålet är faktiskt en länk till skadlig kod som kommer att skanna din dator för personlig information.
Meddelandet bör tas bort utan att någon av länkarna som klickade på. Kom ihåg att vem som helst kan kopiera och klistra logotyper på deras e-post för att få dem att verka officiella. Oväntade e-postmeddelanden som innehåller länkar är alltid misstänksamma. Prova googla organisationen, med hjälp av den exakta ordalydelsen i mailet. Detta kan ofta avslöja varningar som har bokförts om bluff. Kom också ihåg att ordet blir om en specifik bluff e, förövarna kommer att göra ändringar så att meddelandet inte läsa exakt som en som har konstaterats.
— ""Fri rättegång erbjuder"" som har förbehåll
Ibland en produkt eller tjänst som påstår sig ha en fri rättegång erbjudande kommer hamna kostar konsumenten riktiga pengar. Det beror på att det kan finnas dolda tidsfrister eller avgifter på ""erbjudande"". Konsumenten måste brukar ta några åtgärder för att avbryta med företaget. Inte göra det är en överenskommelse att köpa fler produkter eller tjänster. Oärliga företag gör det svårt för konsumenten att avbryta. Detta kan göras genom att dölja villkoren för erbjudandet i mycket liten typ, stämma förmarkerade sign-up lådor som standard inställning eller sätta alltför stränga villkor på återvänder och avbokningar som gör det nästan omöjligt att stoppa leveranser och fakturering.
Dessa tips kan hjälpa dig att utvärdera en fri rättegång erbjuda:
 
• Skydda dig själv genom att forska i företag på nätet för att se vad andra kunder har att säga om dem.
 
• Titta noga på erbjudandet att ta reda på villkoren. Kan inte hitta dem? Då inte registrera dig.
 
• Klocka för förmarkerade rutor som kan ge företaget grönt ljus att fortsätta förbi den gratis varuprover.
 
• Markera din kalender så du inte glömmer att avbryta innan tidsfristen är över.
 
• Läs noggrant för information om hur du avbryter framtida transporter eller tjänster. Se om du kommer att behöva betala något och vad tiden är.
— Skuld samling bedrägerier
Bedragare har kallat konsumenter som nyligen hävdade konsumenten skulle bli arresterad i en nära framtid om de inte remittera betalning för en avlöningsdag lån tas ut månader eller år innan. Vanligtvis dessa lån inte var någonsin tagit och bedragare förlitar sig på att konsumenten har en defekt minne. Dock enligt uppgift människor har fått betala hundratals dollar, skrämda av utsikterna till gripandet. Scammers kan kräva upprepade gånger hemma eller på jobbet för att pressa potentiella offer att betala.En variant på denna bluff är en där den som ringt lämnar ett meddelande där de påstår sig vara en inkassobyrå. Offret appeller numrera och instrueras att ange sitt personnummer i ett automatiserat system. Bedragare kan då vill den som ringer att göra en omedelbar betalning via bankkontoinformation som de sedan har (tillsammans med personnummer) att lura ytterligare offer.
Fråga alltid efter officiell dokumentation av en skuld som du är osäker på. Om du har bekräftat att ett samtal är legitim, lämna aldrig ut personlig information via telefon. Rapportera missbruk samtal till Federal Trade Commission. Försök att betala den verksamhet som du är skyldig pengar till direkt i stället för genom en tredje part.

personalfinance,"Balancing investments, transportation, retirement: what am I doing wrong?","I am setting up a budget to meet my goals of long-term retirement, big spend savings, and daily life comfort. I need a little help in prioritizing, especially as it comes to my debt. I am 30 years old, single, working in this position for 3 months. I can expect a 3-5% yearly raise + inflation. Here is the breakdown:

**Assets**:

A. $4000k a month net take-home, *after* these savings reductions:

*  4% on 401k (annual avg. nominal return is 8%)
*  6.75% in an additional work benefit trust (avg. annual nominal return of 12% since 2009, split 20/80 between IRA and Roth IRA. Employer matched, fully vested after 10 years).
* FIT deduction (1 or 2 on W-2). No social security deduction, since public sector job.

B. $3,200 in emergency savings account

C. $2,000 in checking account

**Debt**: 

* I have one major loan, a federal student loan of $57k at 6.7% annual interest.

* I have a single credit card with no balance, at 9.0%, max limit $2,500k.

**Current Spending**:

* Rent, Utilities, Phone/Internet, TV services (Netflix): $975
* Food ($250 Groceries, $450 restaurants): $700
* Drink (Alcohol/Coffee): $350
* Entertainment (Event fees, gifts, one-off items): $450
* Transportation (taxi/zip car/car2go): $60
* Misc Necessities (laundry, household goods): $75
* Donations/Charity: $50
* Loan repayment: $660 (roughly 10 year plan)

**Goals**: 

* I currently do not own a car, and I would like to. Also a bicycle.

* I would like to set up a broad market index fund, and stash a little a month. I think I need $3-$4k to get started with Vanguard.

* Ideally, I'd like to make $80k a year in retirement, but can't see having many assets (including Social Security) at that time.

* I'd like to boost my emergency savings account by about $3,000.

My obvious move is to hit the restaurant, alcohol expenditures by a ton. I could probably save $400. The challenge with restaurants is because I don't own a car, my commute destroys my waking hours to cook (I have 3-4 hours of personal time each night, due to a 2 hour commute and overtime). Combine that with weekly non-work obligations and exercise, and there just isn't enough time to cook for the entire week all the time. I manage to load a weekend up with cooking to eat for 3-4 days about twice a month.

My big questions are about my loans. Does it make sense to reduce my loan payment to save for the emergency fund, buy a bicycle (will reduce my commute by 20-30 min, after buying weather gear), and build a starting investment for an index fund? Where else might I be off base?",finance,1363223653

According to the bitcoin wiki there is a limited supply of bitcoins that will run out at approximately the year 2140. 
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply

I understand limits and can understand why this happens. But, what bothers me most is the only thing that is said about Deflation is that it believes a different Economic structure than what all economics is based off, Keynesian economics.

There is a battle between ""Classical"" and ""Keynesian"" Economics theories. The Classical economic thought believes in a self-regulating market. By pursuing their own intrestes, people end up serving the intrests and needs of others. This is known as the ""Invisible Hand"" that leads people to promote others' well being.

""Classical economic thought argued that wages and prices would decline, reducing unemployment, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Keynes contended that falling wages and prices would slow consumer spending by reducing people's incomes. In such times, Keynes argued that governments should step up their purchases to stimulate the economy. Keynesian economics provided the theoretical argument for government fiscal policy as a tool for stabilizing the economy, according to the Federal Reserve bank.

TOKYO — The restart of Japan's nuclear power industry is proving pivotal to the economic vision of the country's prime minister as soaring fuel bills after the Fukushima disaster threaten to keep the country's trade in a deeper deficit for longer.
As Japan marks the second anniversary this week of a crisis that scarred the nation, the fuel bills to pay for lost atomic output are leaving their own scars on the economy, partly owing to Abe's own making.
His mix of economic policies — dubbed Abenomics by the media — has driven the yen down sharply, thus raising the cost of imports that will weigh on the revival of a nation that has traditionally relied on exports to drive growth.
The sooner that pro-nuclear Abe can restart atomic power stations, the sooner he will return the country's record trade deficit to its long-term standing of a trade surplus and so mark a milestone in the recovery of the economy.
But in Abe's way is the country's new, independent atomic watchdog, which has said it will take as long as three years to approve restarts under safety guidelines it is drawing up.
""It's a problem for Abe because his economic policies depend partly on an export led recovery to really deliver growth and he needs to get the trade balance back to positive,"" said Tom O'Sullivan, a Tokyo-based energy consultant.
""He also needs to stimulate domestic demand in parallel with improving exports,"" O'Sullivan said, adding he believed Abe had made up his mind to restart reactors.
The Fukushima disaster, triggered by a huge earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan in March 2011, led to the shut down of the country's entire nuclear power industry, which was producing 30 per cent of the country's electricity supply at the time. Only two reactors have resumed operation, sparking huge protests against nuclear power.
Japan's fuel imports bill jumped immediately as power companies ramped up production of oil and gas-fired generators. Just as quickly, the trade balance swung into a deficit.
Abe's push for more aggressive fiscal and monetary policy since he won a big election victory in December has added to the fuel bill by driving down the value of the yen to a 3-1/2 year low of 96.71 per dollar on Tuesday.
Japan, the most energy-import dependent of the world's major economies, spent about 24 trillion yen ($250 billion) in 2012 on fuel imports including for electricity generation, based on the official average yen rate of 79.55 to dollar, finance ministry figures showed.
That made up a third of Japan's total imports bill and towered over a record trade deficit of 6.9 trillion yen.
Should the yen fall to 100 to the dollar and stay there for the next year, Japan's purchases of oil, gas and coal from overseas would rise 25 per cent to just over 30 trillion yen, in the unlikely scenario that import volumes hold steady.
But energy imports are likely to rise as Japan faces a second complete shutdown by September when the two running nuclear plants must be idled for regular maintenance.
Abe's Liberal Democratic Party is seen as more pro-nuclear power than the preceding Democratic Party of Japan government. Abe plans, for example, to review from scratch his predecessor's plan to exit atomic power.
""Abe will surely use high import costs after the summer to argue that Japan needs to get restarts simply because the cost for doing business in Japan is prohibitive,"" said Martin Schulz, a senior research fellow at Fujitsu Research Institute.
Like Abe, utilities have strong economic reasons to restart nuclear power stations as they see costs soar. Imports of liquefied natural gas, the main substitute for nuclear fuel, cost 6 trillion yen in 2012 and utilities are desperate to restart other units to reduce costs and cut losses.
They are betting they will be able to get just over a fifth of Japan's 50 reactors restarted by the end of March 2014, although some critics say that is ambitious given the regulator's more cautious view.
If utilities were able to get half the country's 50 nuclear reactors back online, they would save as much as 1.8 trillion yen in fuel imports over the next year, the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan, a government-linked research institute, said.
Tokyo Electric Power Co, Kansai Electric Power Co , Kyushu Electric Power Co, Shikoku Electric Power Co and Tohoku Electric Power Co have included the restart of 11 reactors as part of applications to raise electricity prices.
Out of the country's 10 nuclear operators, the five account for more than 70 per cent of fuel oil, crude and LNG use for power generation in Japan and 40 per cent of coal burning. Together they operate two-thirds of the country's reactors.
""Nothing has been decided yet about the restart of nuclear reactors, but my guess is that the current government is supportive of restarts, although in a low-key manner, since the resistance among the population is substantial,"" said Gerhard Fasol, Chief Executive officer of Eurotechnology Japan KK, a Tokyo-based consulting firm.
The big five are forecasting a 50 per cent increase in coal use in the year to March 31, 2014, while their LNG use is expected to decline 9.4 per cent. Reflecting the currency impact, the volume of crude oil imports fell 4.7 per cent in January but their value rose 5.9 per cent. Average benchmark Brent crude prices in the month were only 0.8 per cent higher than a year earlier.

personalfinance,Loans vs. Nest Egg...keep saving or start chipping away?,"Important Bits:

* 24yrs - Gross $55K last year, ~~probably~~ hopefully will make ~70-80K+ this year (commission-based job).
* Student Loans: ($41K @ 11.375%, $36K @ 10.125%, $26K @7.25%), $1040 payment/month
* 10K sitting in a savings account (.08%). 2-4K revolving in checking
* ~$1200 in a 401K
* Never go over 20% of my credit card, there is always a balance but I have not paid a single bill late. 

So to sum it up, loans are killing me.  I pay a grand a month, which I never thought I'd be able to afford, but luckily I got a nice, commission-based job.  I lost my first job out of school and had to rely on my parents 100% because I had only worked for 3 months and it scared me shitless.  So since I started my last job in Nov. of '12 I've saved up 10K that I don't touch.  

Common wisdom seems to be PAY OFF THE LOANS RIGHT AWAY, but I didn't want to get stuck in a similar situation without a job, and be making good progress on my loans just to find myself without income again and no savings.  

I also have tried to get them consolidated twice, once with my parents co-signing (they've had credit troubles, hence my interest rates) and once by myself (I've only had a credit card for a year and a half - credit rating is somewhere between 670-740 according to the big 3).  

Looking for some basic guidance.  I could easily be making six figures within the next 24 months (or maybe not, nature of commission), and part of me says ""hey, you can afford 1K a month now, just wait until you're making the big bucks to take them out in chunks).  Is 10K saved enough of a cushion for me to start taking a good percentage of leftover income and putting it towards the loans? Any other advice based on the info I gave is well-appreciated. 

EDIT:
Finally consolidated my loans. Credit score of 810 got me the lowest rate possible (4.9%), down almost 5% from the average of the 3.",finance,1363318172
Forex,Discipline for Day Trading: The 25 Point Mantra,"[I came across this article and felt like sharing.](http://lcchong.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/25-rules-of-forex-trading-discipline.pdf)

Here it is transcribed for easy reading:

**By Douglas E. Zalesky**

February 2003

**The success that a trader achieves in the markets is directly correlated to one’s trading discipline or lack thereof. Trading discipline is 90 percent of the game. The formula is very simple: Trade with discipline and you will succeed; trade without discipline and you will fail.**

I have been a trader and member of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) for 20 years. During my successful pit-trading career as a scalper, I traded in three different contract markets: 30-Year Treasury bonds at the CBOT, the S&amp;P 500 at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Gilts at the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE). Currently, I also trade the electronic $5 Dow futures contract on the CBOT as time permits.

Although my formal academic education consists of a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Denver, I never considered myself to be an extremely gifted student. I have no formal training in market technical analysis. I’m unable to even set up a Fibonacci study or Moving Average study on a charting package, let alone know how to trade with such data. I have no formal training in market fundamental analysis. I don’t understand the economic causal relationship between the actions of the Federal Open Market Committee and Treasury bond prices or equity prices.

How, then, have I been able to succeed, day after day, trading the markets for more than 20 years? The answer is simple: I trade with discipline, and I respect the market. When I’m wrong I get out immediately, and when I’m right, I don’t get too greedy. I’m content with small winners and I’m accepting of small losers.

Just as I now mentor my trading clients regarding performance, discipline and profit/loss management, I was mentored by one of the best traders ever to set foot on the CBOT trading floor, David Goldberg. David was a long-time spread scalper in the wheat pit and a principal of Goldberg Bros., at the time one of the largest clearing firms at the CBOT, CME and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). David taught me the rules of trading discipline. I listened to his guidance and gradually, over time, became more and more successful. The student has now become the teacher.

**The Wheel of Success**

There are three spokes that make up, what I call the “Wheel of Success” as it relates to trading. The first spoke is content. Content consists of all the external and internal market information that traders utilize to make their trading decisions. All traders must purchase value-added content that provides utility in making their trading decisions.

The most important type of content is internal market information (IMI). IMI simply is time and price information as disseminated by the exchanges. After all, we all make our trading decisions in the present tense based on time and price. In order to “scalp” the markets effectively, we must have the most live and up-to-date time and price information seamlessly delivered to our PCs through a reliable execution platform and/or charting package. Without instantaneous time and price information, we would be trading in the dark.

The second spoke is mechanics. Mechanics is how you access the markets and the methodology that you employ to enter/exit your trades. You must master mechanics before you can enjoy any success as a trader. A simple keystroke error can result in a loss of thousands of dollars. A trader can ruin his entire day with an inadvertent trade entry error.

Once you have mastered order execution, though, it is like riding a bike. The process of entering and exiting trades becomes seamless and mindless. Fast and efficient trade execution, especially if you are trading with a scalping methodology, will enable you to hit a bid or take an offer before your competitors do. Remember, the fastest survive.

The third and most important spoke in the Wheel of Success is discipline. You must attain discipline if you ever hope to achieve any level of trading success. Trading discipline is practiced 100 percent of the time, every trade, every day.

**Review the following 25 Rules of Trading Discipline. You must condition yourself to behave with discipline over and over again. Many of my traders and clients read through the rules every day (believe it or not) before the trading session begins. It doesn’t take more than three minutes to read through them. Think of the exercise as praying — reminding you how to conduct yourself throughout the trading session.**

**1. The market pays you to be disciplined.**

Trading with discipline will put more money in your pocket and take less money out. The one constant truth concerning the markets is that discipline = increased profits.

**2. Be disciplined every day, in every trade, and the market will reward you. But don't claim to be disciplined if you are not 100 percent of the time.**

Being disciplined is of the utmost importance, but it’s not a sometimes thing, like claiming you quit a bad habit, such as smoking. If you claim to quit smoking but you sneak a cigarette every once in a while, then you clearly have not quit smoking. If you trade with discipline nine out of ten trades, then you can’t claim to be a disciplined trader. It is the one undisciplined trade that will really hurt your overall performance for the day. Discipline must be practiced on every trade.

When I state that “the market will reward you,” typically it is in recognizing less of a loss on a losing trade than if you were stubborn and held on too long to a bad trade. Thus, if I lose $200 on a trade, but I would have lost $1,000 if I had remained in that losing trade, I can claim that I “saved” myself $800 in additional losses by exiting the bad trade with haste.

**3. Always lower your trade size when you're trading poorly.**

All good traders follow this rule. Why continue to lose on five lots (contracts) per trade when you could save yourself a lot of money by lowering your trade size down to a one lot on your next trade? If I have two losing trades in a row, I always lower my trade size down to a one lot. If my next two trades are profitable, then I move my trade size back up to my original lot size.

It’s like a batter in baseball who has struck out his last two times at bat. The next time up he will choke up on the bat, shorten his swing and try to make contact. Trading is the same: lower your trade size, try to make a tick or two — or even scratch the trade — and then raise your trade size after two consecutive winning trades.

**4. Never turn a winner into a loser.**

We have all violated this rule. However, it should be our goal to try harder not to violate it in the future. What we are really talking about here is the greed factor. The market has rewarded you by moving in the direction of your position, however, you are not satisfied with a small winner. Thus you hold onto the trade in the hopes of a larger gain, only to watch the market turn and move against you. Of course, inevitably you now hesitate and the trade further deteriorates into a substantial loss.

There’s no need to be greedy. It’s only one trade. You’ll make many more trades throughout the session and many more throughout the next trading sessions. Opportunity exists in the marketplace all of the time. Remember: No one trade should make or break your performance for the day. Don’t be greedy.

**5. Your biggest loser can’t exceed your biggest winner.**

Keep a trade log of all your trades throughout the session. If, for example, you know that, so far, your biggest winner on the day is five e-Mini S&amp;P points, then do not allow a losing trade to exceed those five points. If you do allow a loss to exceed your biggest gain then, effectively, what you have when you net out the biggest winner and biggest loss is a net loss on the two trades. Not good.

**6. Develop a methodology and stick with it. don’t change methodologies from day to day.**

I require my “students” to actually write down the specific market prerequisites (set-ups) that must take place in order for them to make a trade. I don’t necessarily care what the methodology is, but I do want them to make sure that they have a set of rules, market set-ups or price action that must appear in order for them to take the trade. You must have a game plan.

If you have a proven methodology but it doesn’t seem to be working in a given trading session, don’t go home that night and try to devise another one. If your methodology works more than one-half of the trading sessions, then stick with it.

**7. Be yourself. Don’t try to be someone else.**

In all of my years as a trader I never traded more than a 50 lot on any individual trade. Sure, I would have liked to be able to trade like colleagues in the pit who were regularly trading 100 or 200 lots per trade. However, I didn’t possess the emotional or psychological skill set necessary to trade such big size. That’s OK. I knew that my comfort zone was somewhere between 10 and 20 lots per trade. Typically, if I traded more than 20 lots, I would “butcher” the trade. Emotionally I could not handle that size. The trade would inevitably turn into a loser because I could not trade with the same talent level that I possessed with a 10 lot.

Learn to accept your comfort zone as it relates to trade size. You are who you are.

**8. You always want to be able to come back and play the next day.**

Never put yourself in the precarious position of losing more money than you can afford. The worst feeling in the world is wanting to trade and not being able to do so because the equity in your account is too low and your brokerage firm will not allow you to continue unless you submit more funds.

I require my students to place daily downside limits on their performance. For example, your daily loss limit can never exceed $500. Once you reach the $500 loss limit, you must turn your PC off and call it a day. You can always come back tomorrow.

**9. Earn the right to trade bigger.**

Too many new traders think that because they have $25,000 equity in their trading account that they somehow have the right to trade five or ten e-Mini S&amp;P contracts. This cannot be further from the truth. If you can’t trade a one lot successfully, what makes you think that you have the right to trade a 10 lot?

I demand that my students show me a trading profit over the course of ten consecutive trading days trading a one lot only. When they have achieved a profitable ten-day period, in my eyes, they have earned the right to trade a two lot for the next ten trading sessions.

Remember: if you are trading poorly with two lots you must lower your trade size down to a one lot.

**10. Get out of your losers.**

You are not a “loser” because you have a losing trade on. You are, however, a loser if you do not get out of the losing trade once you recognize that the trade is no good. It’s amazing to me how accurate your gut is as a market indicator. If, in your gut, you have the idea that the trade is no good then it’s probably no good. Time to exit.

Every trader has losing trades throughout the session. A typical trade day for me consists of 33 percent losing trades, 33 percent scratches and 33 percent winners. I exit my losers very quickly. They don’t cost me much. So, although I have either lost or scratched over two-thirds of my trades for the day, I still go home a winner.

**11. The first loss is the best loss.**

Once you come to the realization that your trade is no good it’s best to exit immediately. “It’s never a loser until you get out” and “Not to worry, it’ll come back” are often said tongue in cheek, by traders in the pit. Once the phrase is stated, it is an affirmation that the trader realizes that the trade is no good, it is not coming back and it is time to exit.

**12. Don’t hope and pray. If you do, you will lose.**

When I was a new and undisciplined trader, I can’t tell you how many times that I prayed to the “Bond god.” My prayers were a plea to help me out of a less-than-pleasant trade position. I would pray for some sort of divine intervention that, by the way, never materialized. I soon realized that praying to the “Bond god” or any other “futures god” was a wasted exercise. Just get out!

**13. Don’t worry about news. It’s history.**

I have never understood why so many electronic traders listen to or watch CNBC, MSNBC, Bloomberg News or FNN all day long. The “talking heads” on these programs know very little about market dynamics and market price action. Very few, if any, have ever even traded a one lot in any pit on any exchange. Yet they claim to be experts on everything.

Before becoming a “trading and markets expert,” the guy on CNBC reporting hourly from the Bond Pit, was a phone clerk on the trading floor. Obviously this qualifies him to be an expert! He, and others, can provide no utility to you. Treat it for what it really is…. entertainment.

The fact is: The reporting that you hear on the business programs is “old news.” The story has already been dissected and consumed by the professional market participants long before the “news” has been disseminated. Do not trade off of the reporting. It’s too late.

**14. Don’t speculate. if you do, you will lose.**

In all of the years that I have been a trader and associated with traders, I have never met a successful speculator. It is impossible to speculate and consistently print large winners. Don’t be a speculator. Be a trader.

Short-term scalping of the markets is the answer. The probability of a winning day or week is greatly increased if you trade short term: small winners and even smaller losses.

**15. Love to lose money.**

This rule is the one that I get the most questions and feedback on by traders from all over the world. Traders ask, “What do you mean, love to lose money. Are you crazy?”

No, I’m not crazy. What I mean is to accept the fact that you are going to have losing trades throughout the trading session. Get out of your losers quickly. Love to get out of your losers quickly. It will save you a lot of trading capital and will make you a much better trader.

**16. If your trade is not going anywhere in a given timeframe, it’s time to exit.**

This rule relates to the theory of capital flow. It is trading capital that pushes a market one way or another. An oversupply or imbalance of buy orders will push the market up. An oversupply of sell orders will push the market lower.

When price stagnation is present (as typically happens many times throughout the trading session), the market and its participants are telling us that, at the present time, they are happy or satisfied with the prevailing bid and offer.

You don’t want to be in the market at these times. The market is not going anywhere. It is a waste of time, capital and emotional energy. It’s much better to wait for the market to heat up a little and then place your trade.

**17. Never take a big loss. Only a big loss can hurt you.**

Please review rules #5, #8, #10, #11 and #15. If you follow any one of these rules you will never violate rule #17.

Big losses prevent you from having a winning day. They wipe out too many small winners that you have worked so hard to achieve. Big losses also “kill you” from a psychological and emotional standpoint. It takes a long time to get your confidence back after taking a big loss on a trade.

**18. Make a little bit everyday. Dig your ditches. Don’t fill them in.**

When I was a young bond trader, my goal every day was to make 10 bond tics. A tic is $31.25, so if I made 10 tics on the day, I would be up $312.50.

It may not sound like a lot of money to you, but it surely was to me. My mentor, David Goldberg, told me that if I could make 10 bond tics every trading day of the year, at the end of the year I would be up $72,500 in my trading account. Not bad for a 23-year old kid in 1982.

It is amazing how quickly your trading account will build up over time just by making a little bit every day. If you are a new e-Mini S&amp;P trader try to make just 5 or 6 points per day. If you can do that you’ll have that $72,000 at the end of the year.

**19. Hit singles not home runs.**

Just as I don’t know of any successful speculators, I don’t know of any trader who goes into a trade expecting to hit a home run and then actually having it happen. You should never approach a trade with the idea that it’s going to be a huge winner. Sometimes they turn out that way, but the times that I have a hit a home run on a position is most definitely luck, not skill.

My intent on the trade was to produce a small winner but, because I had the trade on, and at the same time (as luck would have it), the Fed unexpectedly entered the market, I unwittingly had a huge winner. This probably has happened to me less than five times in 20 years.

**20. Consistency builds confidence and control.**

How nice is it to be able to turn on your PC in the morning knowing that if you play by the Rules, trade with discipline and stick to your methodology, the probability of a successful day is high.

I’ve had years where I could count on one hand the number of losing days that I had. Don’t you think that this consistency allowed me to be extremely confident? I knew that I was going to make money on any given day. Why would I think otherwise? Making a little bit everyday (Rules #18 and #19) will allow you to trade throughout the trading session with confidence and control.

Remember Rule #9: If you make a little bit every day, then you have earned the right to trade bigger. Thus, by following the Rules of Discipline, your “little bit” can soon turn into much more profitable days.

**21. Learn to sweat out (scale out) your winners.**

The net effect of scaling out of your winners will be an increased average win per trade while keeping your losses to your pre-defined risk parameters.

You should never scale out of your losers. If your trade size is more than a one lot and your trade is a loser, you must exit the entire position en masse. If your trade size is more than a one lot and your trade is a winner, it is best to exit one-half of your position at your first price target.

If you trade with protective stop-loss orders, you should amend the order to reflect the change in trade size (remember you have exited one-half of your position) and raise or lower the stop price, depending on whether it’s a long or short position, to your original initiating trade entry price. You now are essentially “playing with the house’s money.” You can’t lose on the remaining position, and that’s obviously a fantastic position in which to put yourself. Place a limit order a few tics above or below the market, depending on your position, sit back and relax.

**22. Make the same type of trades over and over again – be a bricklayer.**

A bricklayer shows up for work every day of his working life and executes with the same methodology—brick by brick by brick.

The same consistency applies to traders, as well. Please review Rules #6 and #20. I have not changed my trading methodology and execution strategy in 20 years. I guess I’m the bricklayer.

**23. Don’t over-analyze. Don’t procrastinate. Don’t hesitate. If you do, you will lose.**

I can’t tell you how many times traders have come into my office terribly depressed because they “knew” the market was going one way or another; however, they failed to put a position on. When I ask them why they did not put the trade on, their responses are always the same: they did not want to chase the market. They were waiting to be filled at the absolute best possible price (and never got filled), or only two out of three of their market indicators were present and they were waiting for the third.

The net result of all this procrastination and hesitation is the trader was correct in deducing market direction but his profit on the trade was zero. We don’t get paid in this business unless we put the trade on. Don’t over-analyze the trade. Place the trade and then manage it. If you’re wrong, get out. But you’ll never be right unless you actually make the trade.

**24. All traders are created equal in the eyes of the market.**

We all start out the day the same. We all start out at zero. Once the bell rings and trading begins, it’s how we conduct ourselves from a behavioral standpoint that will dictate whether or not we will make money on the day. If you follow the 25 Rules, you should do well. If you do not, you will do poorly.

**25. It’s the market itself that wields the ultimate scale of justice.**

The market moves wherever it wants to go. It does not care about you or me. It does not play favorites. It does not discriminate. It does not intentionally harm any one individual. The market is always right.

You must learn to respect the market.

The market will mercilessly punish you if you do not play by the Rules.

Learn to condition yourself to play by the 25 Rules of Trading Discipline and you will be rewarded.",finance,1363309759
personalfinance,Tricky situation... Seeking IRA Allocation Guidance,"Hello r/personalfinance,

First off I want to thank every one of you for all that you have done for this community as I check this subreddit quite frequently and have found boatloads of amazing advice. I'm actually currently looking for some advice from you guys regarding the allocation of funds in my IRA. The catch on this part is that none of my funds can be located in any type of bank or savings association securities.

I am currently in the hiring process with a federal financial bureau and part of the conditions of employment require me to not possess any banking or savings association securities due to potential conflict of interest or insider trading. The securities include those of national banks, state-chartered banks, federal savings associations, state-chartered savings associations, and any subsidiaries or affiliates (including holding companies) of these institutions, directly or indirectly. So basically if the bank is federally regulated, I can't touch it.

I currently have my IRA in a retirement fund with Vanguard (&lt;3) which is as far as I know one of the easiest ways to go; however, all the target retirement funds have holdings in financials. So basically what I'm getting at is, does anyone have any suggestions on where else I should allocate my funds in my IRA to a fund that does not hold any financials?

Thanks to all of you in advance and I love each and every single one of you.",finance,1363306601
personalfinance,What's the quickest way out of this hole? (CA/USA),"Here's the deal, like most college students I've had the fortune of getting a degree, however in the process I've accrued a total of $30,672.97 of debt. To further complicate the matter I'm living in Canada and in the process of immigration and can't work until December. In the mean time my wife and I would like to start paying off my loans. Here's our current breakdown:

$5,355.00 Subsidized Loan (3.4% interest rate after deferment) 

$22,645.00 Unsubsidized Loan + $2,672.97 (accrued interest) = $25,317.97 (6.801% interest rate)

At the moment my wife and I are thinking about pulling out a $15,000 loan in Canada and paying off around half the unsubsidized due to the interest on the unsubsidized loans will diminish. In the mean time my wife will be making payments of around $500 a month until I can start contributing.

I'm 22, still trying to get my feet underneath me and make sense of all this. Any help/suggestions are more than appreciated.

personalfinance,Need advice using Home Equity to pay off credit card debt.,"Over the years my wife and I racked up some serious credit card debt. (~$40k) We have never missed a payment, and we generally pay 50%-100% more than the minimum payment, but it isn't going away. We both have great credit. (over 740) We have about $60k in equity in our home. (based on what our Realtor told us)

Does anyone have experience with using home equity to pay off credit card debt? We are much more disciplined now (most of the debt was from when we were younger and dumber) so I feel like we wouldn't just pay off the cards to rack them back up. (I understand closing account is bad for your credit score so we would just keep them open)

Any advice for this? Right now we have a 72% LTV ratio. We would need to get a ""High LTV"" equity loan to make it worthwhile - something like 90-95%. Since home prices are going up nicely where we live, and we have never been underwater, I feel comfortable doing this. Also we live in a neighborhood that is very desirable so I know if we did move we would be okay. 

Any advice would be great, including banks or companies who do these types of loans. 

Another though might be to refinance the house to get rid of the mortgage interest payment first, and then look at a HELOC? Interest rate on the house is 4.5% so I'd imagine we can get that down a bit as well?

personalfinance,Buying Car - Financing fees?,"I will be buying a new car in the future - 

I have enough assets to pay off the car in cash (selling bonds that are yielding about 5% div/yr) 

my question is - in such a low interest rate environment, is it worth it to take a 0% (or 1%) loan on the car and keep my money in my current investments? or is it better just to sell the assets and pay off the car up front?

I've only bought (used/craigslist) cars with cash in the past - so i'm not sure how car financing works - are there 'loan origination' fees or other junk fees besides the interest charge?  how much are these extra charges?  Will it eat up the interest differential between the rate im paying on the car loan vs. the dividend income?

business,Japan faces higher fuel bill as nuclear shutdown enters 3rd year-Slideserve,"http://www.slideserve.com/acenagile1987/japan-faces-higher-fuel-bill-as-nuclear-shutdown-enters-3rd
 
TOKYO — The restart of Japan's nuclear power industry is proving pivotal to the economic vision of the country's prime minister as soaring fuel bills after the Fukushima disaster threaten to keep the country's trade in a deeper deficit for longer.
As Japan marks the second anniversary this week of a crisis that scarred the nation, the fuel bills to pay for lost atomic output are leaving their own scars on the economy, partly owing to Abe's own making.
His mix of economic policies — dubbed Abenomics by the media — has driven the yen down sharply, thus raising the cost of imports that will weigh on the revival of a nation that has traditionally relied on exports to drive growth.
The sooner that pro-nuclear Abe can restart atomic power stations, the sooner he will return the country's record trade deficit to its long-term standing of a trade surplus and so mark a milestone in the recovery of the economy.
But in Abe's way is the country's new, independent atomic watchdog, which has said it will take as long as three years to approve restarts under safety guidelines it is drawing up.
""It's a problem for Abe because his economic policies depend partly on an export led recovery to really deliver growth and he needs to get the trade balance back to positive,"" said Tom O'Sullivan, a Tokyo-based energy consultant.
""He also needs to stimulate domestic demand in parallel with improving exports,"" O'Sullivan said, adding he believed Abe had made up his mind to restart reactors.
The Fukushima disaster, triggered by a huge earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan in March 2011, led to the shut down of the country's entire nuclear power industry, which was producing 30 per cent of the country's electricity supply at the time. Only two reactors have resumed operation, sparking huge protests against nuclear power.
Japan's fuel imports bill jumped immediately as power companies ramped up production of oil and gas-fired generators. Just as quickly, the trade balance swung into a deficit.
Abe's push for more aggressive fiscal and monetary policy since he won a big election victory in December has added to the fuel bill by driving down the value of the yen to a 3-1/2 year low of 96.71 per dollar on Tuesday.
Japan, the most energy-import dependent of the world's major economies, spent about 24 trillion yen ($250 billion) in 2012 on fuel imports including for electricity generation, based on the official average yen rate of 79.55 to dollar, finance ministry figures showed.
That made up a third of Japan's total imports bill and towered over a record trade deficit of 6.9 trillion yen.
Should the yen fall to 100 to the dollar and stay there for the next year, Japan's purchases of oil, gas and coal from overseas would rise 25 per cent to just over 30 trillion yen, in the unlikely scenario that import volumes hold steady.
But energy imports are likely to rise as Japan faces a second complete shutdown by September when the two running nuclear plants must be idled for regular maintenance.
Abe's Liberal Democratic Party is seen as more pro-nuclear power than the preceding Democratic Party of Japan government. Abe plans, for example, to review from scratch his predecessor's plan to exit atomic power.
""Abe will surely use high import costs after the summer to argue that Japan needs to get restarts simply because the cost for doing business in Japan is prohibitive,"" said Martin Schulz, a senior research fellow at Fujitsu Research Institute.
Like Abe, utilities have strong economic reasons to restart nuclear power stations as they see costs soar. Imports of liquefied natural gas, the main substitute for nuclear fuel, cost 6 trillion yen in 2012 and utilities are desperate to restart other units to reduce costs and cut losses.
They are betting they will be able to get just over a fifth of Japan's 50 reactors restarted by the end of March 2014, although some critics say that is ambitious given the regulator's more cautious view.
If utilities were able to get half the country's 50 nuclear reactors back online, they would save as much as 1.8 trillion yen in fuel imports over the next year, the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan, a government-linked research institute, said.
Tokyo Electric Power Co, Kansai Electric Power Co , Kyushu Electric Power Co, Shikoku Electric Power Co and Tohoku Electric Power Co have included the restart of 11 reactors as part of applications to raise electricity prices.
Out of the country's 10 nuclear operators, the five account for more than 70 per cent of fuel oil, crude and LNG use for power generation in Japan and 40 per cent of coal burning. Together they operate two-thirds of the country's reactors.
""Nothing has been decided yet about the restart of nuclear reactors, but my guess is that the current government is supportive of restarts, although in a low-key manner, since the resistance among the population is substantial,"" said Gerhard Fasol, Chief Executive officer of Eurotechnology Japan KK, a Tokyo-based consulting firm.
The big five are forecasting a 50 per cent increase in coal use in the year to March 31, 2014, while their LNG use is expected to decline 9.4 per cent. Reflecting the currency impact, the volume of crude oil imports fell 4.7 per cent in January but their value rose 5.9 per cent. Average benchmark Brent crude prices in the month were only 0.8 per cent higher than a year earlier.

personalfinance,Recent College Graduate.  Please Critique My Financial Plan.,"Hi PF.  I’ve been lurking a while and am just now posting.  I’m hoping to get some outside opinions on my current financial situation.  Some background: 22 years old, graduated college last December with a degree in engineering, have been working for approximately 2 months, and I believe I have very good job security.  I travel about 80% of the time for my work, so most of my costs are covered (gas, food, hotel, etc.).  I do not own a credit card.  My belongings are currently being stored at my parents place and I don’t plan on moving out for the time being.  Here is my financial situation:

* Salary: $61,200

* Monthly, pre tax:  $5,100

* Post Tax:  ~ $3,300

Expenses (per month):

* Phone - $50

* Car Insurance - $80 (my personal car is paid off, I drive a company car)

* Everything else is variable, depending what I end up buying (clothes, alcohol, hobbies, etc).

What I have:

* Checking: ~ $10,000

* Savings: ~ $6,600

* Cash: ~ $2,000

* Bonds: ~$1,000

* Mutual Fund: ~ $2,000

* 401k: ~ $750

* Incoming Tax Refund: ~$3,300

I am currently waiting on a few more bonds to reach maturity before I cash them out.  Not really sure what the mutual fund is all about, my parents had that money put away for some time.  As for the 401k, my company contributes 3%, then 50% of my contribution up to 6%.  Currently, I am contributing the 6%.  There is 3 year vesting on this.  The 401k is through Vanguard 2055 Retirement Fund.

Student Loans:

* $2,188 @ 3.4%

* $1,729.71 @ 6.8% (currently accruing interest)

* $3,500 @ 5.6%

* $2,458.34 @ 6.8% (currently accruing interest)

* $3,500 @ 6%

* $2,595.20 @ 6.8% (currently accruing interest)

* $9,000 @ 6% (private loan)

All of these loans are federal loans, aside from the 9k.  I have to start paying on the federal loans in June.  The private loan repayments start in April.

My Plan:

1.	Continue contributing 6% to my 401k.

2.	Keep roughly $6,000 as my emergency fund.

3.	Start paying down the highest balance, highest interest loans first while making minimum payments on the 
others.  Hopefully, I will have the loans paid off in full by the end of this year.

4.	Once loans are paid off, max out a Roth IRA, and then contribute more to my 401k (probably 10% or more).

5.	Start saving for a down payment on a house with a goal of purchasing in roughly 7 years.

6.	If there is money left over, I will either use it for further investments or vacations, etc.  (this currently is not relevant)

So reddit, if you managed to read through all of this thank you!  I’d like to hear your opinion on my plan and what you would do differently.

finance,How to Convert Your Real Estate Notes into Quick Cash,"How to Convert Your Real Estate Notes into Quick Cash                    It can happen to anyone.
Maybe you have to handle an emergency or simply want to free up funds to invest elsewhere.
Selling mortgage notes allows you to convert small monthly payments into an almost immediate lump-sum of cash.
Plus, you can avoid the risk associated with owner financing.
Mortgage note buyers purchase a wide variety of privately-held mortgage notes, including promissory notes, land sale contracts, deeds of trust, contract for deeds and other debt instruments secured by virtually every type of property.
Some examples of the type of notes you can sell, include:
Residential Notes – For houses, townhouses, condominiums, apartment buildings, and mobile homes Commercial Notes – For office, retail and industrial
Vacant Land Notes – For developed land, undeveloped land and land not designated as a specific-use property (such as farm land or waste storage).                                                                      How It Works

Selling mortgage notes simply allows you to receive cash now for your future payments.
You could be cashed out in two to three weeks, receiving the funds by check or electronically.
If you have a second lien–where there’s a bank or another investor with a more senior lien against the property–you may be able to sell the note.
Here’s how the process of selling notes works: You need to contact several mortgage note buyers and request a quote.
If there is no recent appraisal or title policy available, they may be ordered at the note buyer’s expense.
These factors include the purchaser’s equity, payment history, seasoning of the note, credit rating of the buyer, term of the note and the remaining balance due on the note.
That could be the best route if the note represents a high value and this is the best fit for your financial situation.
This could be ideal if you like the interest rate you’re earning on the note, but just want to receive part of the cash now.
For example, let’s say you sold a house for $120,000, the buyer gave you $20,000 as a down payment, and you have a $100,000 note at 7 percent for the next 15 years.
You could opt to receive that $30,000 in exchange for buying the next 30 payments, after which the note would go back to you for the balance of the term.
If you’re not sure which option would be better, don’t worry.            Name The Price
This tells us exactly how much $$$ you need (to buy a car, start a business, pay a bill, whatever it is), and we will show you the least amount of payments you need to sell to generate that amount of cash. Contact: sales@seniorsfirstdirect.com 585-323-9194.",finance,1363551885

Could somebody educate me as to the pros and the cons?","I tried Googling this a bunch, but a lot of the information I received seemed dubious/terrible/blogspam/""buy our product!"".

The interest rate is 8% (versus between 16-22% for my credit cards) over 5 years. So, it would effectively cut my interest in more than half. It's also from Discover, a legitimate company, so it's not a scam. And the offer was direct mail, which, if I'm not mistaken, means that it's probably as decent as I could get if I asked, if not better.

Saving that much money on interest, and having a smaller monthly payment (I would put the difference into savings, and forgo the use of my credit cards completely), seems too good to be true. Is it?

I want to keep my credit cards in order to maintain my credit. I got them well before 2008, and they have ridiculously high credit lines for somebody of my income, despite the significant interest rates. I want to have that ""available credit."" (My first credit card had a $40,000 credit line. I was 18. It was the roaring 2000s. I still kick myself for cancelling it, because I *never* should have been offered it.)

**So, what are the risks, advantages, and disadvantages of consolidating my credit card debt into a personal loan at reduced interest and monthly payments? Is the offer that I received a decent one, or could I do better (I have good to excellent credit, but a lot of debt)?**

I imagine that the number one risk is that the personal loan would essentially be an artificial increase in my credit line and might tempt me to take on more credit card debt. However, my number one goal is to eliminate my credit card debt, so I'm not *too* concerned about that. And I'm not even close to reaching my credit line as it is. I already do not use my credit cards for purchases anymore.

**Edit:** The offer also indicates that it has a ""fixed"" monthly payment. Does that mean that they won't increase (or decrease) it, or does it mean that I have no option to pay *more* than the fixed payment? I would prefer to pay it down well before the term of the loan ends.

One thing to note:  Mr. B is rather good at what he does and is known as a.k.a, The Butcher in the marketplace.

From the perspective of Mr. T, he is also quite a happy fellow because here is what he observes:

    He has been fed for every single day in the past 3 years
    His weight and welling being is positive correlated, and has been growing in a nice trajectory (a mildly extending straight line)

Being a little smart, Mr. T would rightly observe the past 3 year history and then attempt to project that he would just keep growing fatter and fatter.  After all, only the sky is the limit.

Then come a few days before Thanksgiving, Mr.T suddenly finds it quite odd that he has no longer been fed in the past few days, and there has been no sight of Mr. B.

We all know how this story ends on Thanksgiving Day!

Doesn’t this story sound all so similar to all of us whom we have a Mr. B(oss) we have to face and please every day?  After all, we feel rightfully so that we deserve to be rewarded after all the hard work we have done.

Recently I got a job online doing Google Search Query Analysis that pays $13.50/hour. I plan to work at least 40 hours a week(which I think is feasible even though I'm in college.) So that leaves me with ~$26000 a year before taxes. I used [this](http://www.hrblock.com/free-tax-tips-calculators/) to calculate approximately what I'll have to pay in taxes at the end of the year and I got $1853 in taxes, so that means I'll put away at least $2500 for taxes purposes which leaves me with ~$23500.(I live in Florida so I think I only pay federal tax)

So now I'm left with ~$23500 and almost no expenses. I have $400 left until I pay off my car(luckily my neighbors whom I bought my car from are letting my pay it off in $200 payments every month), right now I have $3500 in student loans @ 6% and next year I'll have $7000 then I'll go to a state school to get a BA. And I have $500 dollars in credit card debt right now at like 15%.

Obviously I'm going to pay off my car and credit card debt right away, so that leaves me with $22600. This year I can pay off both my student loans but I'm not sure if it's the best thing to do for my credit score but if I do I'll have ~$15600 left over and nothing to put my money into. 

I'm a contractor so my company doesn't offer a 401k so the next best choice is to set up a IRA fund, I'm not sure where to set one up or whether it should be traditional or Roth IRA fund. But I'll assume my max for it will be about $5000/year, which leave me with $10600 extra.

Sorry for the wall of text, I just wanted you all to see my thought process(maybe it's wrong).

gaming,The (imo) HUGE problem with reviews of all sorts,"--tl;dr at the end--

Hey redditors!

I think lots of us (including myself) usually read some sort of review or recommendation before making an investment (not only games), because we want to get the best for the amount of money we spend. The idea behind it is very simple: when lots of people buy a product and rate it good, it's most likely good and I will be satisfied with the purchase.
Now comes the problem. Companies are aware of the fact that a lot of customers read reviews before buying something. Logically they care about those ratings and they want good ones. Where demand is, there will be offer. So businesses established which started to sell reviews to promote a specific product. Products which are shit, excuse my language, get nice ratings and people begin to buy them. Through google i found lots of sites that sell positive reviews on pages like amazon, metacritic, ebay or even advertise with posts through 4chan and reddit.
It's a bit costlier to fake customer reviews so what's the next step? Sites like metacritic.com aggregate reviews from various ""journalism"" sites which themselves are often being sponsored by shady businesses and tend to write good reviews for games/films/whatever that are truly bad. Lots of you have probably read about it by now.
I think you get the point I'm talking about and I'm really worried about it. I was thinking for the last two days what we, the real consumers, could make or change to not get manipulated by the industry. Some things that came to my mind are:

* Don't blindly trust reviews!
* Do some extra work and compare products by specs etc on your own instead of just comparing the ratings
* Games need demos so everyone can make his own mind instead of relying on reviews


I come from Germany and we have something called ""Verbraucherschutz"" which can be translated into customer protection. This protection is a right that says that you have a two week trial period on new bought products and can give them back if you're not satisifed. Obviously you can't do that with things like music, games, films etc but I think we need something similar. I remember the days where I went to a local store to buy a games magazine just to get the CD with the demos on it so I could actually test games myself instead of blindly trust reviews from sites that likely recieve money from the gaming industry. I would really welcome more demos of newer games.

personalfinance,What should I link to Fidelity Amex? Newbie to the card and investing in general.,"I have a regular cheapo Amex Blue Cash that I never use (except for one very small recurring expense just to keep it ""active""), and have been using a Chase Sapphire Preferred for the vast majority of my purchases. The 2% restraurants is what sold me on that.

I'm looking to maximize the 2% back I get from this - so don't want to squander it all away on transaction fees for the funds and such...not really knowing about the account, it looks like theres roughly an $8 fee per transaction?

I was imagining a situation where I could more or less use this care passively and have 2% deposited in to an account I could forget about for a few decades, and have a small bit of extra coin one day. Is this possible, or did is this just a fantasy that isn't what this product actually is?

This is my first post on this section, and even on reddit as a whole so feel free to correct me if needed :)

I am a french guy, now living in the netherlands with a permanent contract. My girlfriend and me are both engineers so we make quite a decent living.

I read the blog of MMM for some time now, and started to apply some of his advices. We dropped the car, reduced my phone/cable/internet/energy bills, changed my work schedule to reduce commuting costs, . . .
I want to keep putting some money on the side in case something happens, but combined we could invest a monthly amount around 800 euros without problem.
We don't have any loan or mortgage, but we still rent our house though.

For now, the money is all going to our basic saving account, with a net interest of 1.60%.
We want to do better with that money, and invest in something and obvisouly better than the current 1.6%.
Thing is, we plan to change country every 4/5 years (it is our own way to discover the world :)).

I considered buying a house in France a few months ago and rent it(as this is the only place where I am sure to have reliable people for a long time), but my banker said that in this case I would be taxed in both the netherlands and France. Basically, that would mean something like 40% from the rent to the netherlands system, and 35% on top of it for France (yeah, I love my home country :S). That would reduce the interest rate to something equivalent to the current saving account, so far from beneficial :s.

And we don't really want to buy a house in the netherlands and end up in the same situation in a few years when we'll relocate.

So far, bankers have been less than able to give us good advice about investment, and basically stop at ""put all the money on the simple saving account"".
The only thing is that I would like to avoid going into stocks, not so much for the crisis or else, but simply because I am against the current stock exchange system as a whole. Other than that, I am quite open to anything that could bring us more than those 2% and even started to look at peer lending and bitcoins ^^.

Bitcoin,"""There is no inherent value to bitcoin."" Wrong - this is why.","A system which prevents government control of money is an inherent value. No commodity can claim that. 

**Update:**

Conceded that from a strict subjective theory of value perspective there is no inherent value to anything and we all live in an empty void debased of worth and subject to the whims of the capriciousness of others.

Okay with that out of the way. In the specific context of money as a medium of exchange wherein the ability to store value, purchase goods, secure transactions, etc are all foundational prerequisites, moneys may then be judged according to what characteristics distinguish them from each other and what values they bring to people who use them. While the values are all subjective, values which provide the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people will be weighed heavier in the analysis. 

With this in mind Bitcoin carries a unique value that other conventional commodity and fiat currencies do not. Gold is the usual comparison - how would a government confiscate BTC as it did gold? How would it prevent transactions? How would it set interest rates? 

We are accustomed to hearin people sheepishly say that bitcoin has no inherent value - usually they are comparing it to gold and confining their analysis to physical properties such as the use of gold in electronics and jewelry. The immunity of bitcoins to government influence is an important characteristic of bitcoin which gives it value above and beyond the fact that people may use it as a means of exchange. It is sort of the conceptual analog to facts such as gold does not tarnish or degrade.

Now this is just a suggestion and I want people to think about different ways as well and if you don't believe this will work please tell me.  I think that we should start a petition or something to ask the CEO of EA to resign.  Yes you heard me correctly.  I feel that there are enough gamers to make this work.  Now like most big companies like EA they usually have investors.  Investors usually think best about the company and want it to be more profitable.  Now if we were to make this a thing.  If we could get some media time and have every news, internet source talking about this and EA in a negative image more than usual. This will catch the attentions of the investors.  Imagine what they will think when all the major news titles say consumers wants EA CEO to resign. If we could make ourselves vocal we could hit EA from the top and get the CEO to resign.

Step 1: Purchase as many preorders of Dragon Age 3 as you can afford.

Step 3: Cancel all preorders 30 days before game releases.

If this is illegal somehow I would appreciate someone describing how; I'm pretty sure it's simply ""unethical"" which, considering it's EA, is kinda oxymoronic.

Also, this would obviously still have an effect if we all bought lots of preorders for lots of different EA games, but I think that having one gigantic punch in the wallet makes a bigger impact than a bunch of smaller ones; any economists that would like to disagree, please do.

I'm just fucking sick and tired of feeling fucking helpless while being abused by giant megacorporations that are dominating my hobby/love.  Everyone says that EA (and Ubisoft and Activision etc) only respond to money and losses...  So let's fucking do it.  Stop fucking crying about it and fucking DO something about it.

Yeah, I'm getting militant about it.  I bought a copy tonight.  I'll buy a copy every paycheck for the next year if I can.

I don't ever plan on carrying a balance so the interest rate shouldn't matter right?  Do I just pick one based on the rewards?

Also, because I've never owned one, do I have a chance at getting a non-secured card?  And is it best to apply for a card through your bank (USAA in my case), or does it not matter at all?

personalfinance,"I'm about to file my taxes online, comparing Turbo Tax &amp; HR Block. Both have tiered options for a free version or a paid tier to maximize your refund. How big of a difference will it make in my return if I go with the paid version and is there any way I can estimate if it will be worth it?","Essentially, my main questions are: would I be missing out on many potential return-increasing opportunities by going with the free version, how big of a difference might this make, and is there any way I can try to estimate upfront if investing $20 (HR Block) or $30 (TT) would be worth it? For a little context, I graduated college this year so I do have tuition payments in 2012, I got married so I will now be filing jointly, and I started working full-time. I simply know nothing about how tax returns work or are calculated to know if this would increase my refund by much more than the initial investment, or if I'm better off just using the simpler free version, so I'm hoping for some insight from people in the field or with experiencing using these services. We are on a tight budget, so even the $20 upfront cost is worth considering to me at this time. Any and all help is much appreciated, thanks for your input in advance!

**EDIT/UPDATE:** ^(I realized I should probably put this in the post so that it's actually noticable ... commenting probably wasn't the best course of action, in hindsight) Thanks *so* much for your input everybody, I really do appreciate it. After doing some research and considering all of the other options you guys provided (although sadly, I did them before the IRS list of free options was posted) I went with the $20 HR Block service and am actually quite pleased with the results. Since we had several major purchases this year (two wedding rings, a new couch, a new bed set, a hutch, etc.) I wanted to be able to itemize, and HR Block made it really simple. In regards to the American opportunity credit, it was definitely available to me through this service and helped bump up my return nicely. I also found it worth it to pay the $20 (which was simply deducted, I didn't have to provide credit card information or anything of that nature) in order to take advantage of HRB's ""Emerald Prepaid MasterCard,"" which arrives in 7-10 days and comes with much better benefits than I would have anticipated -- free ATM withdrawals, no fees, is replaceable if the card is lost, comes with an app, and (best of all!) is probably going to bag us a trip to Vegas this summer at the tune of $49 for two nights! We have been strapped for cash so I spent a long time making sure I went through each checklist and every single receipt from the year carefully, but in the end I was satisfied with the service and now I'm starting to get excited for the vacation we're going to get to take that wouldn't have otherwise been possible.

**Last question for you fine folks at home:** any words of wisdom about HRB's free second look program? What happens if, for example, they whiffed my return online and it turns out I'm supposed to get way less -- would they just correct it then/would I be at risk of the IRS figuring that out and taking it anyway? I guess all I need to know is, is it wise to have get a second opinion from them?",finance,1363575085

business,Agile Financial Tokyo shares likely to extend rally on US hopes,"Tokyo shares are likely to extend their rally next week as investor sentiment is buoyed by a strong showing on Wall Street sparked by rising optimism over the US economy, analysts said. For the week to March 15, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 2.26 percent, or 277.33 points, to 12,560.95, its highest finish since September 2008. 
The broader Topix index of all first section shares rose 3.05 percent, or 31.15 points, to 1,051.65. 
Japanese and US shares have been surfing bullish waves as investors embraced news that the US jobs market and private consumption are improving, and as Tokyo's pick to head the Bank of Japan won approval Friday, stoking speculation of aggressive easing measures to jumpstart the economy. 
Policymakers could boost bond-buying and other asset purchases or adopt a specific time frame for a two-percent inflation target set by the bank in January which is aimed at reversing years of falling prices, analysts said. 
""Whatever the bank does it has to do fast,"" said Chris Tedder, research analyst at Forex.com in Sydney. 
""Investors are expecting a lot from the BoJ and if it doesn't live up to its promises then we may see a flock back to the yen, making an economic recovery in Japan ever more difficult."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, has hit repeated record highs over the past week, while the S&amp;P 500 also flirted with an all-time high. 
A weaker yen has also helped lift the Tokyo market, giving a boost to shares of major exporters. ""For the time being, we expect (US shares) to continue to stand on solid ground on optimism about the economy,"" Daiwa Securities said in a note. 
""We expect Japanese shares to continue to stay firm for the immediate future,"" it added. 
Next week the market would focus on a US Federal Reserve policy meeting and housing-related data. In Japan, investors will be keeping a close eye on trade data and other figures for signs the economy was mounting a firm recovery. 
""It would provide stock-buying incentives if a recovery of individual consumption, exports and land prices is confirmed,"" Daiwa said. 
The Tokyo market will be closed on Wednesday for a public holiday.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin for charity! Help me get the attention of local charities with BTC by helping out the homeless,"Just a little background... 

At the age of 16 I was forced to leave home due to physical and sexual abuse. I lived on the street for 6 months and during that time relied on local soup kitchens and charities to eat and keep clothing on my back. I have since graduated highschool, become an electrician, started my own successful company, found a fantastic wife and we have our first child on the way. I have always felt that without the help of others when I was at my lowest I wouldn't be where I am today, and it's always driven me to volunteer/donate at the same places that fed/clothed me. I have also started making bagged lunches and handing them out around the city.

These lunches are extremely inexpensive and the real charity here is just taking the time to put it all together and hand it out. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1am36s/today_bitcoin_fed_43_homeless_people/) post caught my attention as essentially Sean is doing the same thing I do.

I have been speaking with some of the larger charities I work with (Good Shepherd Ministries) (North York Harvest Food bank) and trying to convince them that they should accept BTC for donations. I have had very little luck so far but have decided to try and expand what I'm doing on my own partly to show them the value of adopting new ideas early. 

So I'm asking for (small) donations to assist in my efforts to feed homeless around my city with packed meals. I want to run this entirely in bitcoins to show the larger guys that funding from sources like this is entirely possible. This is a great way to get some big names involved in bitcoins and help a few needy people along the way.

It only costs about $1 per meal, so there is no need for large donations, but if I could get enough buzz around this I could easily open more talks with large charities to accept BTC.

Here is the address we set up for the donations, anything helps!

I was inspired to write a script for a long-ish trailer, so this is going to be a wall of text. From here on out, everything will be written as if you were watching the trailer. Clicking links is recommended, as I'm going to do my best to set the scene in text.

*Please note that the entire scene is frozen in time.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trailer starts focused on a door, slightly ajar, with a bit of blood spatter. The door is a [light, creamy yellow](http://www.colorcombos.com/images/colors/FFFFCC.png), with white trim.

Frank Sinatra's ""[Last Night When We Were Young](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvZvLIlcwIo) begins to play, as the camera slowly zooms out to reveal a house the same color as the door. The house is nearly brand new, with whitewashed shutters and window boxes full of [pink petunias](http://0.tqn.com/d/landscaping/1/0/a/H/pink_petunia_big.jpg).

As the camera continues to zoom out, it shows a perfectly manicured lawn, with a [baby blue, 1953 Chevrolet Bel Air](http://oboia.org/data/media/429/1953_Chevrolet_Bel_Air_4d_Sedan_blue_2.jpg) parked in the driveway. The noonday sun reflects perfectly off of the rear window. The last thing shown of the house is a short, white picket fence.

The camera passes a zombie's head, as a bullet blows its way through the rotting bone and brain matter. Several other zombies are shown walking on the sidewalk, as zombies will do - arms forward, heads lolling to the side. These zombies are also being shot, about to fall next to a few corpses on the ground. The camera pans to the left, looking down a cul-de-sac which serves as the main road for a formerly-idyllic, typically colorful early 1950s neighborhood. Several cars are either abandoned or up-ended in the street, while other are still parked in their respective driveways. Bright pastels abound, in blues, reds, yellows, greens, and more. A veritable rainbow of a neighborhood. Zombies fill the street, ambling around the wrecked cars.

The camera begins to move backward through the horde, showing more and more corpses littering the ground the further back it moves. Finally, it passes yet another zombie's head, only this time, the creature's skull is being crushed by a [massive pipe wrench](http://home.comcast.net/~ervina2/pipewrench.jpg). The camera pans down the handle of the wrench, eventually showing a delicate and feminine hand gripping it tightly. The camera follows the arm toward its source, revealing a young-looking woman in a yellow dress and apron, her hair carefully coiffed, and her face locked in a grimace. She has the slightest bit of blood on the shoulder of her dress, as if she has taken care to remain clean. The camera begins to look behind her, revealing several other women of varying ages (although the majority are under 40), wielding everything from chainsaws to revolvers, axes to frying pans. They are all similarly dressed, wearing their best flats, with hair and makeup done with care. 

The women are surrounded by zombies, although they appear to be holding their own fairly well. There is a [1947 Ford pickup](http://local.aaca.org/bullrun/images/welch47fordpickup.jpg) hanging in midair, along with several zombies. A few of the women are looking in that direction, and the camera follows their gaze to a massive zombie, heavily muscled and mutated beyond recognition. 

The camera begins to zoom out once again, but moves vertically instead of horizontally. It shows a top-down view of the cul-de-sac and the surrounding neighborhood, revealing other streets similarly filled with zombies. The trailer cuts to black revealing the title and perhaps a launch date as ""Last Night When We Were Young"" fades slowly into the background.

personalfinance,Paying off student loans to get $2500 tax deduction,"Hi All,

After reading some posts on here advising people to pay off the loans with the highest interest rate first, I took to my own student loans.  I'm in a situation where my next due date on the student loans in March 2015 (I was gifted some money to put towards the loans).  This means I can hit the high interest loans first, without having to even pay a minimum on the lower interest ones for the time being.  I also know I can deduct $2500 of interest every year on my taxes.  If stick to paying off the higher interest rate loan, I'm estimating I'd only pay about $2000 in interest.  Is there any reason I should put money in the lower interest loans at the end of the year, solely for the purpose of capping out the $2500 tax deduction?  

Monthly payments are $800, may be upped to $1000 shortly.

After a huge blow up about finances by my husband, he finally revealed just how bad it is.

**$75, 600**

My hands are shaking typing that.

After pulling up our credit report, I saw we have 5 credit cards which were all opened between 2009-2011 and  we have *never* been late with a payment.

However, due to many circumstances, the most recent being an 8 month period of being unemployed and now being underemployed, we are now living paycheck to paycheck and have resorted to using credit cards to pay for things like gas so we can pay our monthly bills.  This is the first time in years we have added to the debt.


Our mortgage is $1,144/month.
Revolving credit minimum payment of $1,396/month.

Interest on cards:
AE 13.24%
Upromise 12.4%
Capital One 7.15%
Chase 13.24%
Citicard 13.24% (on $7,856)
and 28.4% (on $3,174)- don't understand why it would be 2 rates?

The cards are maxed out and we cannot keep this up and I don't know what our alternatives are.

There were times over the years I was unemployed due to two difficult pregnancies- both with preemies.  The last pregnancy was with unexpected twins requiring me to be on bed rest and the babies in NICU for 2 months.

We have been on a vacation once in our 16 year marriage and hardly ever eat out, or even go out, for that matter.

We have used money for home remodeling and send our children to private school due to the horrific conditions of our public school.
This is the last year for our oldest- who will be going to public high school next year. The twins have 2 more years until they go to public high school.

After a tearful conversation with my husband, I now realize we are sinking and can't live with this debt any longer.
I am now seeking a second job.

I have set up an appointment to speak with a non-profit debt counselor, and have tried calling the CC companies myself- they won't go any lower with the interest rates, because to them we are ""good customers"" since we have always made our payments on time.

Reviewing our statements- we have paid most of the principal on this debt and are now being crushed by compounding interest.

This is not my husband's fault and I am not blaming him.  Due to issues with postpartum depression and lingering depression, he has tried bringing this up over the years- but I would shut him down due to my mental state and inability to cope.

**What can we do now?**
I am now fully awake to this situation. While I can't change the past, I want to move forward without this monster over our heads.
Please, any advice is very appreciated.

**TL;DR- $75,600 of credit card debt and now can't keep paying our monthly living expenses without being late on the credit card payments**

**edit to add:**
**Total monthly income (net)=  $6,300**

Monthly Expenses:
*Mortgage- $1,144;
*Revolving credit- $1,396;
*School- $800 (3 more months only, then will resume at 550 in September); 
*Bills (oil, water, electric,...)-$400; 
*gasoline- at least $100; 
*Internet and 2 phones (we have cancelled cable a year ago)- $150;

One said that the ratio of debt I have vs my current income isn't good enough. Of course it isn't, I'm a college student. The amount of debt I have isn't crazy - I'll be graduating with about 20k in federal loans, and no private ones. I think my income was about 5K a year when I had applied last year, now it's about 7K. The number of hours I can work while keeping up my grades is limited, and it doesn't help that my job is minimum wage and the freelance I do work oftentimes less than that. I make enough to fully cover all my living expenses though. 

I don't need one with a high maximum - I'd pretty much just use it for groceries, supplies and such, paying back the amount from my checking account pretty much immediately once I got home. I'm very good with budgeting. I've been living off around 500 a month for a while now. That includes rent, food, and everything.

But with the debt for individuals being almost impossible to get out of, isn't this the type of policies that government is uniquely suited to say no, if you loan $100, you should expect to get back $200- $1000 back. Isn't this what government is supposed to do, protect us from being exploited at a national level?

personalfinance,Effect of taking a car loan and paying it off immediately on credit score,"Hi - I just bought my first car.  I don't have great credit, so I saved enough money to pay for the car without taking a loan.  When I went to buy the car, my parents offered to co-sign on a small loan to help me build a credit history - so, I borrowed $5,000 over three years at about a 6% interest rate.

I would like to buy a house in the future, which is why I am worried about building credit, but I don't have enough money for a down payment and don't expect to buy for maybe 4-5 years.  

I have enough money to pay off the loan right away, and there is no penalty for early payment.  What I am wondering is what part of taking this car loan helps build credit?  Is the history of making payments the important part, or is it just having had different types of loans?  Does it matter that the loan will be payed off before I would buy a house anyways?

Throwaway -- too many personal details will be revealed in this discussion.

I've been lurking for years and have never posted. It feels bad to post seeking advice since I've already gained so much from r/allthesubreddits, but hey, it's a throwaway I guess?

I'm employed making good money so I don't have to worry about feeding myself anymore.  I went through that hell earlier, and I sympathize with all of you who may have been through a disaster.

I'm recovering my finances rapidly and am looking for advice on the best ways to really amp up my growth.  I have a very high risk tolerance (no wife/kids/debt/etc) and am open to some crazy options.

What I'm trying to decide is my plan of attack to tackle my recovery in a take-no-prisoners kind of way.  Is buying another income property the best move (as my intuition is telling me)?  That feels... conservative, and the mortgage terms may be lousy given my credit situation.  Is selling everything and putting a ton of cash into a specific fund/investment vehicle going to be better over 3-5 years?  F*ck it all and start a business? (this seems the highest reward and risk [and is very appealing], but I'm struggling with business ideas that meet my skillset)

I'm new to aggressive investing so am not fully sure of the options available.  Do your worst and tear me to shreds with your warnings, but I'm serious about unloading both barrels to catch up.

Some stats:  
* $80K/year salary income  
* $800 rent includes utilities, figure $1100 fully loaded monthly expenses  
* crappy car worth about $1500.00.  Should probably buy a more appropriate/reliable car (station wagon or pickup) but am trying to eke all the value out of this junker.  
* $15k in cash in the bank, adding to this month-over-month  
* $70k mortgage on an income property that barely pays for itself (planning to sell for zero gain)  
* 2nd income property (free and clear) generating $500/month after properly budgeted expenses.  This property isn't a slum but is in a depressed area.  If I choose to sell it I could put about $45k in the bank.  
* One credit card with a $4k limit and crappy interest rate (but no annual fee)  
* $4k personal loan that I took out recently for credit building purposes (funds are untouched, loan is being paid automatically out of a dedicated savings account).  
* Chapter 7 bankruptcy in early 2010 (disaster, insurance problems)  
* 660 FICO score  
  
Thanks to all if you've read this far.  Reddit has helped me in so many passive ways; again, I feel somewhat guilty actively asking for advice... someday I'll be able to give some back.

personalfinance,I am a US government employee who is about to get furloughed... how do I handle this?,"I am currently working as a DOD civilian and it is all but certain that due to sequestration that I will be furloughed 16 hours per pay period beginning in April, lasting until the end of the fiscal year (possibly beyond.)

I have borderline monumental student loans and I am faithfully paying them off (I won't get in to balances or ask for help with that because that starts nasty discussions on this subreddit), and a car payment. I pay off credit cards each month. I am married and my wife is a graduate student (some, but not a lot of income) who is starting work in May/won't be paid until June, and even then the job is only a small step up from her graduate student pay. We rent, as we are trying to be flexible about careers and trying to sell a house right now is a nightmare we don't want to deal with.

That being said, my pay is set to be reduced by more than 20% (withholdings for healthcare do not decrease proportionally despite the 20% reduction in hours) for quite some time, at least 22 weeks. (Bear in mind federal pay has been frozen for more than two years - no COLA, nothing. We were scheduled for an 0.5% raise which Congress is voting to throw out.)

Is it worth pursuing a part-time job? I am a civil engineer with a master's degree and I highly doubt anyone will hire me part time if they think I'll bolt after the furlough is over (which I will.) I do not have my P.E. nor do I have contacts to do consulting, so that is not an option. I'm not good looking enough to be a male hooker and I can't dance. That's off the table.

personalfinance,In a deep financial hole at 25.,"I apologize if this is frowned upon, but I'm not sure what else to do. Reddit is generally helpful in figuring just about anything out, so I thought I'd seek some help here rather than continue to ignore my financial situation.

I am a 25 year old single parent of one in the US. For the last 3-5 years, my debt has spiraled out of control, and I'm unable to pay any of it. I live in a one-bedroom apartment with my daughter, do not pay daycare (she stays with the other parent while I'm at work) and pretty much live from paycheck to paycheck. I'm completely lost as to what to do to get out of this hole at this point. I've considered seeing a credit counselor, but I believe they would just try to consolidate my debt and arrange payments I cannot make... and probably bill me for it.

The point at which my credit started getting so bad was upon leaving college. I never qualified for grants, so I just racked up 2-3 years of tuition debt. (My parents' income was apparently too high for me to qualify for the grants, though their income was not actually relevant to me.) I also managed to mess up my academic career (bad prioritizing) and ended up being placed on academic probation. During this time, I owed my school $2-3K of late residence fees. I was unable to pay that back, so a hold was placed against my account and I was never able to resume classes. (I of course want to go back, but I'm prevented from doing so because of my debt).

I make less than $2000 /month. The following is a list of my debts and expenses.

DEBTS

* ~$25000 federal student loans. Was in default, currently on hardship deferment, but payments are scheduled to resume soon and I can't pay the minimum payments.

* ~$3000 debt owed from student housing, probably currently charged off and with a collection agency.

* ~$3000 private debt from car repairs I had to finance. Charged off.

* ~$300 private loan from another sticky situation. Charged off. (Recently they offered a settlement for around $100.)

* ~$1800 credit card debt, appears to have been transferred to a collection agency. Probably charged off.

EXPENSES:

* $700 rent /month

* $125 utilities /month (electric, water, and internet lumped together)

* ~$200 /month spent on food

* $375 / month car payment (the car is in my parents' name, for obvious reasons. I pay it to them.)

* $50-100 /month spent on myself. Seems reasonable to me.

Plus whatever unexpected thing comes up each month.

After all my monthly expenses are accounted for, there's nothing left to try to handle my debt. I really want to rehabilitate this mess, but I have no idea what I can do. I would like to go back to school (I would now qualify for grants since I'm no longer a dependent) and secure a better career, but I'm locked out by debt.

personalfinance,"Question about transfer of debt, legalities, and credit score.","I have spent a lot of time on r/personalfinance and it has helped me tremendously. I have recently overheard a buddies situation and before supplying advice, I would like an opinion.

My friend has a student loan out for around 20k for school, 3k of that was saved from overestimating the cost of tuition. This loan has an interest rate 6.1%. He also has a credit card where he has accrued a debt of 2300 over the last few years. When I asked if he knew what the interest rate was, he had no idea. After enough pestering, he found that his interest rate was 23%.

After what I have learned on here, it sounds like a smart idea to use the leftover student loan money and pay off that credit card and then cancel it. I haven't read many experiences on here similar to that and I wanted to know if there were any legalities or consequences involved. Is there any negative affect on his credit score if the debt is transfered from the credit card to the loan? Does transferring the debt sound like a good idea since the interest rate of the loan is so much lower? Are there any legalities I should make him aware of if he does pursue this course of action?",finance,1363819295

(x-post from /r/financialplanning),"I tried my luck in /r/financialplanning, only to realize later that that subreddit doesn't receive much traffic. If you find that they have free time to kill on Reddit, I'd love your help! 

I am a third-year graduate student who will begin a fourth-year externship in the Summer. My girlfriend and I will be moving out of state from May until...well, until we decide to relocate again. My year-long externship is at a hospital, which has historically hired on externs after they have graduated. I would estimate my starting salary to be ~$60-65k

My financials from a glance:

- Student loans after 6 years of school: ~$38k + 6k in interest so far (two loans are subsidized, the others are federal unsub at 6.8%. I have no other loans or debts. 

- Tuition is covered by my university, and I receive a stipend of ~$500/mo. This stipend will end at the end of May and will pick up again in August, likely at a rate of $5-7k/year. 

- Rent (including utilities) for us will likely be ~1300, split two ways. This means I will likely need to take out an additional ~$8000, if I wanted my loans to fully cover my living expenses (spending stipends on groceries, gas, leisure, etc.).

- I currently have three accounts: a new Ally online savings account (0.84%); a BofA checking account, which currently holds my loan money; and a checking account from a regional bank, which I hold my stipend money in. The two checking accounts separate my spending money from my rent/utilities money. The move, however, will put me out of the region covered by the one checking account, so I will likely transfer the funds over to the BofA account, or open an account at a local credit union once I make the move. 

- I recently opened a BankAmericard Cash Rewards Platinum Plus Visa w/ the usual waived introductory rates (ending 3/14). $1500 CL. My plan is to cap my spending at ~$100/mo (6-7% utilization) on gas and groceries, earning 3% or 2% cash back on the two, respectively. 

I already manage my money in a fairly frugal manner, so I cannot curb my spending much more than I already do. 

I've considered moving my loan money into my savings account until I need it, which may put a little extra money in my pocket by the end of the year. I know the total earned interest amount would be relatively little, and interest would taper as I depleted my funds over the course of the year. Also, I'm not sure of the legality of earning interest off loaned money.

Really, any and all advice would be greatly appreciated! I'd be happy to provide more information, if necessary.

I was inspired to write a script for a long-ish trailer, so this is going to be a wall of text. From here on out, everything will be written as if you were watching the trailer. Clicking links is recommended, as I'm going to do my best to set the scene in text.

*Please note that the entire scene is frozen in time.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trailer starts focused on a door, slightly ajar, with a bit of blood spatter. The door is a [light, creamy yellow](http://www.colorcombos.com/images/colors/FFFFCC.png), with white trim.

Frank Sinatra's ""[Last Night When We Were Young](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvZvLIlcwIo) begins to play, as the camera slowly zooms out to reveal a house the same color as the door. The house is nearly brand new, with whitewashed shutters and window boxes full of [pink petunias](http://0.tqn.com/d/landscaping/1/0/a/H/pink_petunia_big.jpg).

As the camera continues to zoom out, it shows a perfectly manicured lawn, with a [baby blue, 1953 Chevrolet Bel Air](http://oboia.org/data/media/429/1953_Chevrolet_Bel_Air_4d_Sedan_blue_2.jpg) parked in the driveway. The noonday sun reflects perfectly off of the rear window. The last thing shown of the house is a short, white picket fence.

The camera passes a zombie's head, as a bullet blows its way through the rotting bone and brain matter. Several other zombies are shown walking on the sidewalk, as zombies will do - arms forward, heads lolling to the side. These zombies are also being shot, about to fall next to a few corpses on the ground. The camera pans to the left, looking down a cul-de-sac which serves as the main road for a formerly-idyllic, typically colorful early 1950s neighborhood. Several cars are either abandoned or up-ended in the street, while other are still parked in their respective driveways. Bright pastels abound, in blues, reds, yellows, greens, and more. A veritable rainbow of a neighborhood. Zombies fill the street, ambling around the wrecked cars.

The camera begins to move backward through the horde, showing more and more corpses littering the ground the further back it moves. Finally, it passes yet another zombie's head, only this time, the creature's skull is being crushed by a [massive pipe wrench](http://home.comcast.net/~ervina2/pipewrench.jpg). The camera pans down the handle of the wrench, eventually showing a delicate and feminine hand gripping it tightly. The camera follows the arm toward its source, revealing a young-looking woman in a yellow dress and apron, her hair carefully coiffed, and her face locked in a grimace. She has the slightest bit of blood on the shoulder of her dress, as if she has taken care to remain clean. The camera begins to look behind her, revealing several other women of varying ages (although the majority are under 40), wielding everything from chainsaws to revolvers, axes to frying pans. They are all similarly dressed, wearing their best flats, with hair and makeup done with care. 

The women are surrounded by zombies, although they appear to be holding their own fairly well. There is a [1947 Ford pickup](http://local.aaca.org/bullrun/images/welch47fordpickup.jpg) hanging in midair, along with several zombies. A few of the women are looking in that direction, and the camera follows their gaze to a massive zombie, heavily muscled and mutated beyond recognition. 

The camera begins to zoom out once again, but moves vertically instead of horizontally. It shows a top-down view of the cul-de-sac and the surrounding neighborhood, revealing other streets similarly filled with zombies. The trailer cuts to black revealing the title and perhaps a launch date as ""Last Night When We Were Young"" fades slowly into the background.

hardware,Wifi Security PSA: Don't trust your network security to manufacturer defaults.,"The current state of WIFI security for home devices is quite awful, almost all devices with default settings have 100% probability of crack success. Some manufactures modems still default to using WEP, which is easily crackable in under 5 minutes, others come defaulted with weak and guessable WPA keys. Rainbow tables exist for most default SSID network names drastically shortening the time required to crack, and even worse is any router with WPS enabled is vulnerable to a Reaver attack (a program which recovers any length WPA key in about 5 hours).

Basically if you just plug your AP in and go, your security will be cracked without a sweat, from there an attacker can work on accessing your files and personal info stored on your PC, or they could use your connection for other illegal activity. Creating a simple password is also not enough, a dictionary attack will find it quickly, or it can be recovered through the WPS exploit. You need to make sure you cover all the holes that cut down the time required to crack.

 So what can you do? Here is a short checklist:

* Choose a router with more advanced control features.
* Create a unique SSID, that's not on the [top 1000 list](http://pastebin.com/h4YqvR0y)
* Create a unique password for your routers web interface
* Switch your router to use WPA2/AES, and disable WPS (if you can't disable WPS get a different router)
* Create a WPA2 key at least 12-20 characters long using lower/upper case and numbers (adding symbols is even better). Making your password a long sentence is a good idea, its easy to remember and would be almost impossible to crack, and brute forcing would take decades.
* Enable MAC address filtering on your AP to block any device that isn't yours from being able to communicate. (Note: MAC addresses can be spoofed)
* **DISABLE WPS!**

If you follow all of these tips it should keep your network safe from most recreational crackers, by virtue of making it take a really really long time for someone to crack it and therefore not worth the effort.

personalfinance,Deciding between 15 and 30 year fixed rate... So many opinions!,"Hi again /r/pf! My first post with this account was about a month ago when I was deciding whether to buy or keep renting. Well, I took the plunge, and now I'm under contract on a $270k house. I am very fortunate to have enough saved to put down 20%.

I have discussed the 15/30 year approaches with my friends and family, and there are some very strong opinions that 15 year mortgages are foolish because there is less flexibility, along with the argument that I'd be better off saving the extra cash from a 30 year mortgage each month and investing it. Personally, the frugal side of me disagrees because not only do I like the idea of having a lower interest rate, but I like that it essentially forces me to pile more income into principal on an asset rather than being tempted to spend it on luxuries.

The rates I am being offered are 2.65% for the 15 year and 3.65% for the 30 year.

A simple mortgage calculator shows that with the 30 year I will pay about $1,200 a month for a sum of $342,400 over 30 years. With the 15, it would be about $1650 a month with a sum of $252,200 over the course of the loan.

This is a savings of around $90,000 in total with the 15 year.

~~If I invested my extra $450 a month in a high-yield mutual fund (assuming 10% growth a year, which is optimistic), it could potentially yield around $80,000 over 30 years.~~ EDIT: (Did the math completely wrong on this one, it would yield way, way more). If I paid it towards the 15 year I would be debt free in 15 years, and could then use the entire $1,650 to invest in a similar mutual fund. That could yield around $55,000 in the 15 years after the mortgage was paid off. Seems like the 15 year is the easy winner to me. What do you guys/gals think?

TL;DR - 15 year seems like a clearly better deal. A lot of people disagree. Am I missing something?

investing,Question for the option traders of investitt!,"Hey all,

I've been studying put options for a while (and am experienced with having executed some long put/call strategies in the past for hedging purposes - I fully understand the purpose/risks of options), but now I'm doing some heavy research into this strategy:

http://www.cboe.com/micro/buywrite/Pap-AssetConsultingGroup-CBOE-Feb2012.pdf
http://www.cboe.com/micro/put/PutWriteMethodology.pdf


tl;dr: sell cash secured puts on an index to slowly (but consistently) profit from the slight mispricing of volatility (see page five [here](http://www.cboe.com/micro/put/PUTIndexEnnisKnupp.pdf)) that occurs at the start of every month on put options. This strategy has yielded annualised gains of 10.8% over 25 years, compared to 9.1% on the S&amp;P 500. The returns are also far less volatile.

My returns will be about the same as the above, if not higher - the amount I lose from brokerage and spreads will be more than offset from the higher returns on my cash compared to the interest rate received on the PUT index in the documents above. (much higher interest rates in Australia - the cash used as collateral was invested into treasury bonds in the index above).

I have a few questions that I'm sure some of you options gurus can help me with.

I plan to execute this strategy on the ASX 200 (XJO), which as of now is at 4951.7 - if I were to write puts now (pretend this is the start of a fresh options month) - I would do so at a strike of 4950 (just below), and I would write no more put options than the cash I have backing my account (i.e. if I had 100k, I'd only write puts that give me an exposure of no more than 100k to the index).

That particular option right now is trading at 75/77 - which is a premium of 1.51%, not bad given the VIX is at 14.4). Given the participation of market makers, I'd say that the 'fair' value of these options lies somewhere in between 75 and 77, so I'm losing roughly 0.25% of my annual returns due to this spread (1/76 * 19.6% average yearly premium collected). I lose another 0.35% p.a. due to brokerage, so I'm down 0.6% from the hypothetical index per year. 

However, this is more than offset by the higher rate of return on my cash. It's earning 4.91% p.a. right now in a bank account, I assume this is far higher than the current 1 and 3 month treasury yields that the PUT index uses.

My questions are thus, all input would be much appreciated.

1. What are the option spreads like on the US markets? Is the spread 75/77 ridiculous (index is ~4951)?

2. Instead of writing put options that expose me to not more than 100% of my cash, if I wrote options that expose me to say, 150% (slight leverage - i.e. write options that expose me to 150k of the market with a cash backing of 100k), would this increase my returns by approx. 1.5x, or is there a tricky logical fallacy that I'm making here involving compounding? (I realise the interest from my cash stays the same - but both the option premium AND any loss from getting assigned are both increased by 1.5x - given the premium collected every year is ~6.1% greater than the loss in the overwhelming majority of years, this slight leverage could play well in increasing this gap to 9%+, is my reasoning anyway). I realise some people write 500k options over 100k cash backing, but 1.5x is the most risk I'm willing to take.

3. Any other pointers? Reckon this could work over the long term? I've tried my best to consider all fees and possibilities where this could go wrong. If another GFC happened right now, I would live to tell the tale - I'd outperform the market every month by a huge margin (as the VIX goes up, so does the option premium).

Thanks guys, much appreciated!",finance,1363741757
personalfinance,"Alright PF, talk to me about my car","So, nearly 3 years ago I needed to replace my car.  I was a young well-paid professional with no debt, good salary, but not a ton of cash, so I leased a Honda Fit.  My thought was this would be stress-free (no chance of a lemon), frugal as a new car can be, and would let me save up for a more desirable car in three years.  All in all it's been fine, no regrets.

And now, here we are three years later.  Time has come.  Let me tell you where I'm at, and you guys can tell me if I'm crazy, thinking of spending too much etc.  And, I'll either take the advice or I won't :-) 

I'm 27.  I make about $68k, around $78k in 2012 after bonus (expect similar for the coming few years).  I have $50k in my IRA and another $45k in my self-directed investment account, plus around $15k cash.  With my employer contribution I'm putting 25% into 401k, so I certainly don't feel like I'm NOT doing well on savings.  

So, here's what I'm thinking: my budget will be $25k after tax.  I will plan to pay cash - I know I could probably get better return vs. the interest rate, but I like the idea of having no debt...  

I'll be looking for used (barring a great alternative), under 40k miles (lower the better obviously), and good fuel economy - definitely 30+ mpg highway, at minimum.  The Fit is way too spartan (not fun to drive, no features like bluetooth or cruise control, don't even have a remote to lock the doors), and I want something sufficiently luxurious that I will still like it for the next 10 years, but I also want to be financially secure my whole adult life.  

So talk to me.  Stupid?  Too much?  Can budget more?  Cash a bad idea?  Any cars that fit the bill?  Help me firm up my plan here.  Thanks in advance!",finance,1363741657
personalfinance,A question regarding value of retirement savings as a percent of total income.,"Hi, I was reading an article today which said you should have between 1 and 3 times your annual salary in savings/retirement fund/whatever by the time you are 40.  My question relates to 401(k) (...and more specifically, TSP for Federal Workers).

My retirement fund is mostly in the C-fund, which is basically a big mutual fund of US stocks.  The value of it is currently 0.82 times my current annual salary, and I am age 34.  However, most of that is pre-tax money.

I am wondering how you are to factor the pre-tax value of your retirement fund into consideration.  Should I assume a roughly 25-33% tax penalty and use ~~that~~ **the resultant** as the real number?  Or is the 1-3 times your salary based on something else (purely liquid or even Roth contributions)?

Ultimately, I am trying to pay down debt, while saving as much as possible.  Other than that, I don't really know too much about retirement planning beyond some basics.

Thanks!

Bitcoin,It's nearly impossible to buy BC in US...,"True story. I've been trying for about a week to buy modest (U$10000-20000) amount.  It's been hell.  First, mtgox requires scary amount of ID to receive wires.  What has this world come to - to put your money somewhere you have to prove who you are! I get it about withdrawing, but depositing? WTF?

Then to sending wires.  Scary.  A branch manager of a local etrade branch, without asking me for any ID pulls up my account, says there is plenty of money there, and proceeds for an hour to browser through the etrade website looking for the right form, not finding it, making me handwrite a 'to whom it may concern', finding the form, filling out a wrong one twice anyway, waiting for 'his guy in seattle' to get off the other line, finally announcing that they can't do it without additional signatures and notarizing more documents, which they can't do as they have no notary on staff...

Fellswargo bank.  At least they checked my ID.  Worked through filling out the forms.  After 30 minutes of doing that, the banker announces that federal regulations require me to declare my address in Japan.  What?  No address in Japan, no wire.  Very surprised that anyone can have a bank account in another country without living there. And ' by the way, we couldn't send it anyway without the Fellswargo debit card.  Also your incoming wire hasn't cleared'.  Thanks for wasting my time.

Entire day shot.  I have no reason to think my wire would clear at mtgox either, since I am #3277 on the verification queue, whatever that means (not promising).

Is this the famous banking system that needed to be bailed out, or the world collapses immediately? I can't imagine Chinese banks being less competent, or monkey banks for that matter.

gaming,Why is it ALWAYS someone else's fault? LOL Match/ Discussion,"I just recently got into League of Legends. As I progressed, my friends (who have been playing much longer than I) told me that I had a surprisingly high number of wins for my level. Now I am level 30 and am getting matched with ""better"" players. However, the more I play, the less I want to. 

The picture included is from a match I played a while back (I was Amumu). My team and I lost the match, but surprisingly my teammates insisted that the loss was ALL MY FAULT. I found this quite puzzling, because I thought that I had played a decent match. 

Almost every game I join now there is some form of a ""negative player"" in the room, in the form of either a 1)troll (some1 playing but not taking the game seriously at all, which isn't always bad, but when it turns into 1 of the other 3 choices it is a bad thing) 2)feeder (some1 so fed up with the game and possibly of life in general that they have nothing better to do than help the other team, not cool) 3. Afk/Leaver (People who had no intention of playing the game, but just felt the need to make it not fun for everyone else who does want to play) 4) Jerk. 

The last category ""Jerk"" is a player who is so fed up with these ""negative players"" appearing in so many of their matches, that as soon as they get a wiff or a sniff of some characteristic of any of these things (auto locking, troll names, giving up 1st blood, missing a single ""skill shot"") this ""jerk player"" will instantly call them out, and rage at them, regardless if the behavior was intentional or not. 

The problem with this system is that it feeds off itself. Since it is so common to join a game with one of these ""negative"" players, the community in general gets fed up with the game too, causing more and more ""positive players"" to turn ""negative"". 

League of Legends does have a ""summoner's code"" system of ethics, but I feel that hardly any1 takes it seriously, and why should they? 

This is a problem for LOL as well as gaming in general. 

The biggest problem I have with this is the following: A player who generally does well in his/her matches (on average) when this player comes to lose a match (because you CANNOT win them ALL, that's NOT HOW COMPETITIVE GAMES WORK) that player says to himself ""The loss cannot possibly be related to any of MY actions, I am God at this game, MY TEAMATES MUST SUCK"". They then proceed to cuss out their teammates, as if their teammates skill level is the only variable here (which it is obviously not). They don't even stop to consider: team composition, strategy, the skill levels of the opposing team, luck, circumstance, or even their own actions having SOMETHING to do with losing a game.

I'm not really sure where I'm going with this, all I know is that it's a real bummer that so many gamers have to make gaming not fun. It is supposed to be fun, isn't it? Anyway's tell me what you think.",technology,1363891910

personalfinance,"How do we determine our monthly ""play money?""","My husband and I are very open with our finances and, for the most part, we agree on all aspects of it. Here lately, however, we are constantly arguing over any extra spending that isn't related to paying a bill or debt. I can see his point, but I want to be able to enjoy myself. So I'm looking for advice here on what would be an appropriate amount of ""play money"" for the two of us each month. I'm thinking about $30/month for each of us. Based on our finances, what do you all think?

Here is a breakdown of our finances:

**Income: $4004** *(this is after tax and his retirement contribution; I have health insurance taken out of mine and will begin contributing to retirement this summer when I become eligible at work, which also happens to be about the time I'll get a raise, so the net effect will be about the same)*

**Rent: $325** *(through December, then it will be $600 -- moving into a renovated apartment in the same complex)*

**Groceries/Household Items: $400-$450** *(we are both gluten-free since my husband has to be, so our food is more expensive than it used to be; this also includes cleaning supplies, cat litter, cat food, and hygiene products)*

**Internet: $54**

**Phones: $61**

**Utilities: $95**

**Car Insurance: $166** *(3 vehicles with full-coverage)*

**2 vehicle payments: $610 + extra $325/month** *(we have a 3rd vehicle that is paid for; it's our spare and it has been needed, so we aren't selling unless we absolutely have at some point in the future; the extra $325 is the extra payment we make each month towards one of the vehicles, which we'll have paid off in December)*

**Gas: $150**

**Misc.: ~$200** *(this is our ""unplanned for account;"" basically all extra stuff goes here; for instance I just had to pay to retake two CPA exams, so that went into our misc. group; and this is where we put the deposit for our December cruise vacation -- will be $2k total for the week)*

**Student Loans: $1000** *(starting in July -- see below)*

**Total Expenses: $3500**

**Savings/Emergency Fund: $4900** *(my husband was unemployed for 11 months until April, so our savings was depleted; I only worked part-time and was in school until December, but we've managed to replenish it to the previous level)*

A note about the savings account. We don't plan on adding to it for the near future since we are focused on paying off my student loans. We have no credit card debt. The only other debt is two vehicles, of which one will be paid off in December. Both of our jobs are very stable -- he's a research associate with a university and I'm an accountant with a CPA firm.

I also have $57K in student loans which are all still within their grace periods since I graduated in December. We paid off a $1600 private student loan in January and we'll pay off my last private student loan of $5000 this month. The other ~$52K is being federally consolidated and will begin repayment this summer. The IBR minimum payment will be $285, but we will be putting $1000 a month towards them to get them paid off as quickly as possible.

**TL/DR?: What is a good amount for play money?**

EDIT: The extra payment is $325, not $385.",finance,1363867294

personalfinance,Hoping for some personalized advice (student loan repayment).,"I would like to start off by saying that I have read the FAQ (which have been very helpful so far), searched around for situations similar to mine, and visited some other recommendations (unbury.me, mint.com, etc) that have come up frequently. However, finance in general is not my strong suit and I just want to make sure I am handling my loan situation as efficiently as possible. I also extend apologies if the format for this post is atrocious, I have been lurking various subreddits for a while but this is my first post.

Long story short: I dicked around and paid way too much for a degree I could do nothing with fresh out of HS and just recently completed an accelerated second degree program for my BS in nursing. I now have a job and am looking to pay off my debts at efficiently as possible.

Loan Details (a mix of fed and private loans from my 1st degree 2004-2008 and 2nd degree 2011-2012):


Great Lakes $83,278.77 at 3.61%


Sallie Mae $50,502.54 at 7.25%


AES (Fed Subsidized Staff) 4 in total:
$4,568.91 at 6.55%
$4,523.19 at 6.55%
$2,705.20 at 2.14%
$1,013.80 at 2.14%


FedLoan (Direct Subsidized) 3 in total:
$5,500 at 3.4%
$3,500 at 4.5%
$231.32 at 2.39%


FedLoan (Direct Unsubsidized):
$7,515.34 at 6.8%

I'm currently making about $50,000/year working 3 12hr shifts a week after factoring in night shift and weekend differentials. I'm also taking any extra shifts available and looking for additional work since I only work 3 days a week. 

I pay $1,715.34 a month total to meet all minimum loan payments. My other monthly expenses are about $133 (gas, gym, etc.). I save a lot of money living at home without car payments, credit card payments, etc. 

It is my understanding that I should be paying Sallie Mae back first (highest interest rate). I currently have all my loans automatically paying the minimum, but am ready to start adding more towards them. I read about IRB, but I have no idea if it would be of benefit to me. Is there any other way/should I lower my other monthly payments in order to pay more money to Sallie Mae? I'm not sure if that would save money in the long run. I also don't know if I should be dedicating money towards retirement (I get a 3% company match on 401(k)) at this point or if my money is better spent knocking down my loans.

TL;DR I wasted a lot of time/money bullshitting with my friends in college and now I want strangers on the internet to advise me on paying it all back.

gaming,All This EA Hate Needs to Stop,"At first, I went along with what the internet said about EA being terrible, and i'm not saying that's completely untrue, but it is to an extent. After the recent Sim City fiasco I went and did some research. There is very little solid reasoning behind the hatred for EA, and it really just became a fad in my opinion. The only reason they are getting 'worse' as you people are saying is because reddit, neogaf, and other forum sites are just making up some bullshit about them to make them look bad. Really though, do you're research and most of the big things like EA supposedly 'hiring chinese spammers to make sim city look better' have NO real evidence behind them, and could easily, easily be faked. However, as I said before, i'm not saying they are perfect. They did put microtransactions in Dead Space 3. That sucks, no matter how you look at it. But they are not the only ones doing it. Tomb Raider recently added microtransactions, and nobody hated crystal dynamics for it. Don't even get me started on Valve, though they do it well. DRM is bad no matter how you look at it. Ubisoft used to have it, but the overwhelming rage over it made them stop it. This is one of EA's first offences (if i'm not mistaken) so they may learn just as Ubisoft did. Then when they offered a free game to make up for Sim City's terrible launch, all of you ungreatful rats on the internet here that said ""dont believe it its a con so youll like them again"" Well guess what? THATS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. Its an apology for their mistakes. They are losing HUGE amounts of money because of this deal they are giving everybody, and yet you still sit here and scream about it. But then, when the devs of Elemental: War of magic gave everybody who bought their game a copy of the 2nd, everybody praised them for it. I don't understand the logic there. Please people, think a bit after you read those reddit posts about EA, or do a little research, because a lot of it is faked. Although EA has had a few blunders, so has many other companies, and there's no real reason to only hate EA and nobody else for it. I'm sorry if this is really ranty, but I just got fed up after my friend made a remark about dlc quest being ""EA simulator 2013.""

personalfinance,"[US] Sorry, taxes question. Health bills + COBRA?","*edit* Oh, my question is answered. Thanks :) Y'all the best!

Hey,

I'm sorry for the taxes question. I was going to take it to a real person, but reddit search has informed me that apparently H&amp;R Block are shitty real people... and I don't know who else to talk to... so... here I am. Hello!

I'm doing my taxes, and I've got a good handle on them, except for the medical bills (I have Crohns). 

TurboTax says: You can deduct medical and dental expenses that are more than $4,084 (That's 7.5% of your adjusted gross income).

The internet says COBRA counts.

So, I didn't get a job until April 1 - so I paid 2,121.40 for COBRA for the first half of the year. So I put that in Insurance Premiums.

Totaling up my bills, I have about $180 in prescriptions, 403.40 in doctors' fees/copays (it's actually more like $1,000, but I only have receipts for that much and am terrified of being audited and not having receipts), 2,996.21 in actual bills, and 389.33 in xrays/labs.
Or, a total of 3385.54 here.

And a total of 5506.94 altogether.

So that's more than the cutoff turbotax gave me, but whether I enter the numbers or not, my federal refund and state due doesn't change.

On a side note, if it matters, I moved to a different state when I started the job - but I don't think that has any relation to this since it never asked.

Can someone explain to me why this is and if I'm doing it wrong? If it's really not going to change, then I'm not going to enter it. But I'm wondering if I just screwed it up.

And if no one knows, I'll take it to a person.

Bitcoin,Why Krugman is wrong about deflation...,"In the article posted here in the BTC subreddit, 
http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/why-is-deflation-bad/,
Krugman has 3 points which he proposes are the reasons why ""deflation"" is bad...

1. So first of all: when people expect falling prices, they become less willing to spend, and in particular less willing to borrow.

2. A second effect: even aside from expectations of future deflation, falling prices worsen the position of debtors, by increasing the real burden of their debts.

3. Finally, in a deflationary economy, wages as well as prices often have to fall – and it’s a fact of life that it’s very hard to cut nominal wages — there’s downward nominal wage rigidity.

I'll address these points in the order above.

1. People being less willing to exchange their money for goods under the expectation that goods will be relatively cheaper in the future is not a problem.  Let's look at the obvious examples where Krugman is incorrect.
Computers, TVs, technology in general...  If i buy a computer today for $2000, i got a reasonable laptop by today's standards.  However if i wait until 6 months from now and spend the same $2000, i get a much more powerful computer (relatively) because of the progression of technology over that period.  So essentially, i'm getting more for my money by waiting.  Same applies for TVs and lots of other goods.  

  If Krugman was right, why would ANYONE buy a computer today?  we would all wait for 6 months, but under that rationale, no one would EVER buy a computer because they would be waiting for the next better one to come out.  Obviously this is not the case, there is replacement cycles and economic life to assets which need to the replaced.  Someone is always willing to exchange their work (money) for goods, the exchange rate is simply a function of supply and demand.  

  Willingness to borrow in my opinion shouldn't matter because the same rationale above applies.  When i decide the price is right, i will buy something.  If i think the price is too high, I will wait.  This is how a competitive economy is meant to function. 

  Deflation is a natural process in the business cycle in a correctly functioning economy.  Deflation signals that there is too much production, and not enough demand.  Deflation leads to lower prices on goods which will drive the less competitive businesses out of the market.  Once they're out of business because their costs of production are too high, supply will have been reduced in the sector, and prices will reach a new equilibrium.  On the flip side, inflation is an indication of demand outpacing supply, prices increase, leading to more companies entering the sector, which increases supply, putting a halt on the inflationary pressure, (basic supply and demand). 

  IMO, the only things which would naturally be in a state of inflation would be rare non renewable commodities without a substitute.  Oil is a somewhat rare non renewable resource, but at the right price, a switch to Natural gas will occur, and as non renewable fuel sources become more scarce, their price increases will simply lead to a higher value for alternative energy sources (i.e. solar, nuclear, hydro electric, wind...).  If there is a demand for a product or service, there will always be a price for it, as I want to exchange my ""work"" for that of someone else.  Deflationary spirals are only an issue for over leveraged systems (like ours), but it is not an issue with deflation, it's our current system which is in error.  Don't hate deflation, hate the system.

2. Worsening the position of debtors without the offsetting positive of creditors.  This is not a problem.  It's a signal that debtors took on too much debt or the wrong type of debt (variable vs fixed) without a long term perspective on interest rates or the economy.  

  In a REAL economic system, interest rates are the Traffic Signals for the economy (read Jim Grant).  When there is a glut of savings, rates should go down, which will cause some people to save less and spend more, balancing out the economy.  Vice versa, when there is insufficient savings, rates should rise, stimulating people to save more which would balance out the pressure on the interest rate rise over time.  This would occur naturally because people would understand that investing their money at 2% for an investment they perceive to be risky would not be sufficient reward for the risk of their savings.  Thus people would say no, we want &gt;2% to compensate for their investment (parting with their savings). 

  In a properly functioning economic system, there would be no interest rate fixing by central banks or governments, savers and borrowers would face supply and demand for their money and borrowing costs.  Artificially low borrowing costs at the expense of savers does the most terrible thing possible, causes mis-allocation of capital.  Instead of slowing down the growth of sectors of the economy which are not sustainable, NZIRP (near zero interest rate policy) and rate fixing pushes more money into these sectors as the companies try to invest more in capital to try to lower their costs or increase efficiency.  The supply of credit is not able to change due to interest rate fixing and money printing.  

  Over-investment in capital and industries without sufficient demand for their goods causes a net loss to the overall economy (i.e. housing, US auto makers, Solar Cell companies...) as the same capital should have been invested in other projects or companies which would pay sufficient returns to compensate for their risks (new industry, technology...).  

3.  Wages, there's nothing wrong with dropping wages when overall prices are dropping.  If you believe in a ""minimum wage"", then you shouldn't advocate for a true market system because in the market system needed to have deflation, prices of wages would have to change along with the economy in general.  

  Deflation of wage prices would occur when there is a glut of workers willing to work for less than the current salaries.  On the flip side, when there is a worker shortage, wage inflation would occur, something you would see in specialized industries experiencing growth.  

  As overall population growth occurs, there would be a natural trend of deflation on wages in ""low skill"" jobs.  This is kind of a moot point though, as anyone who looks at the statistics will see, the minimum wage in the 60's is equivalent to $10/hr in inflation adjusted dollars today, where the US gov's is suggesting $9/hr in min wage today.  

  So we're ALREADY experiencing relative wage deflation, this should be a natural trend in an economy where the supply of labor (population), is growing compared to the demand for labor.  Nothing wrong here.  Nominal wages are hard to cut, I agree, but right now the government just stimulates inflation instead to cause the EXACT SAME OUTCOME.  In a market system, all prices would be simply a reflection of supply and demand, wages, interest rates, medicine, computers, food...


Deflation is a natural force, embrace it and we can all be more prosperous.  Government mandated inflation is an indirect tax on the economy.

personalfinance,"Quick question about my pay withholdings, need help!","The company I work for just switched from paying us as independent contractors(they are sketchy people) to being actual employees of their business. My original rate was $15.00/hr. They recently sent an email saying that they will be withholding 15% ($15/hr to $12.75) of my rate for Federal Income, Social Security, Medicare, State Income, and ""Various local taxes"". 

With that said, I just received my first paycheck as an employee and it states that my rate has been reduced to $12.75, AND that I am getting Social Security, Medicare, and CA Disability withheld. It also does not state where the 15% they took out is going. It does not say ANYTHING about my 15%.

gaming,GoWJ is a HUGE dissapointment!,"I initially was not going to purchase Gears: Judgement, but many of my friends on XBL were getting it and hyping it up so i broke and went and bought the game+season pass. **HUGE** mistake. As of now there are only 4 maps and 4 game modes(3 traditional). The plot behind this was to entice players to get the season pass(which i stupidly did).

  Gameplay wise, the game feels too much different than gears, More like a COD if it was a TPS. Now i am not saying that change isn't a good thing, but they have done too much. Traditional gears fans will absolutely hate this game. here are a few points.


* There is a semi auto sniper rifle now.
* The DBS has 2 fucking shots per clip.
* The ammo is auto pickup.
* You have a one weapon and a pistol now, not 3... And you can spawn with a sniper rifle.
* You can spawn with a frag grenade
* Getting hit by bullets no longer slows you down.

* Wall tagging grenades has been removed.
* You can overhand throw grenades with high velocity (Get ready for noobs spamming them.... Also all grenades stick on impact).
* The lancer has been buffed AGAIN with a higher rate of fire.
* The boomsheild can be used with any weapon, other than power weapons (so, DBS/lancer/retro/hammy/gnasher e.t.c can be used with it)
* The gnasher only spawns with 8 shells (rather than the 16 you get in gears 3)
* They removed the boltok and gorgon pistol.
* They have removed the locust from multiplayer
* and worst of all.... There is no DBNO (downed state) and there are ALWAYS ON CROSSHAIRS!!! You no longer need to shoulder the weapon to get them. Everyone can just hipfire.   

Anyway, no need to upvote but i would love to see some discussion, thanks guys

personalfinance,$7k Tax Return: What debt to pay off?,"Ok, I'll give you all the relevant info, and please ask if you think there are other variables I should be taking into account, and then let you know my plan. Please let me know if this is a good plan or a bad plan. If you think it's bad, please let me know what you think I should do instead.

We're getting about $7k from our tax return. I will use it to pay off debt, but we have lots of different kids of debts at different interest rates. Here's a run down:

    What				Interest	Month Pay		Month Int	Balance	Notes

    Home Mortgage 		4.5%		$1,750			$825		$220k
    Rental 1 Mortgage 	5.5%		$285			$200		$45k
    Rental 2 Loan 		13%			$140			$50			$4.6k
    Car Payment 		2.5%		$300			$?			$15k	Didn't feel like finding the monthly interest
    Loan 				1%			$210			$5			$5.8k	Home Energy Improvements
    Credit Card 1 BoA 	10%			$100			$15			$2k
    Credit Card 2 Dsc	0%			$75				$0			$3.6k	0% expires in June
    Credit Card 3 Amex	15%			$40				$25			$1.8k
    Student Loans 		2%			$360			$?			$20k	Didn't feel finding the monthly interest
    Back Condo Fees		0%			$300			$0			$650

So, my plan is this:

    Debt		
    -$4.6K		Pay off Rental 2 Loan.
    +76			Transfer credit card 1 and 3 to a 0% 12 month card. @2% fee that's $76 to transfer the $3800.
    -$2.4K		Pay down $2.4k of principal on the Rental 1 mortgage, now highest interest.

Some reasoning:

Other than being the highest interest after the balance transfer, we'd also like to refinance the Rental 1 mortgage, but we need to get the principal down to $40k (80% of appraised $50k appraisal) first. This will get us about half way there.

I should also mention we'll be transferring the credit card balance to an existing card. So there'll be no new card to shorten our average account age or credit inquiry to negatively affect our credit score.

Thanks for reading this far, I look forward to your advice.

Generally, you must repay the entire credit for the year you sell the home or it is no longer your main home. There are some exceptions to this rule, however, and you do not need to repay the FTHBC for a home you purchased in 2009 or 2010 if it remains your main home for the three years after the purchase. 

You bought the home in 2009 or 2010 and  received the first-time

Obviously I can put the whole return towards the debt, which I am considering. We were considering IBR because we would like to use some of the money for car repair and an extremely modest wedding. What does personalfinance think about putting 2 or 3k towards my loan, and going ahead with IBR? Your interest rate freezes for the first 3 years you are on IBR. We would be using it to stop the interest for the next three years while we still pay off the rest of the principal in thirds. 

IBR is a controversial subject around here, but I think if it is used to our advantage it could help us do the things we need and want to do in the next 3 years. I'd like to pay off the debt at once but the car is a priority here. Is this plan feasible? I am reluctant to use IBR since my loan is so small compared to some but if we use it the way I am imagining it seems like we would save on having to pay more interest.",finance,1363972903
personalfinance,Looking for an objective view on this financial decision,"So before I continue I will say that I know the ""best"" thing to do here is save my money, however, how far off am I in thinking that I might be okay?

Background:

25 year old single guy, renting.
$2900 net income per month
$2000 expenses.

No money invested and $10,000 in my checking account.

Of all things hated in this forum I am looking to purchase a car that is more of a want than a need. It is $19,000 and mostly depreciated.

I am approved for a 1.74 interest rate which will add a $330 car payment to my expenses over 60 months.

How irresponsible is this?

I would also add that I am a mechanic by hobby and have always had a sports car of sorts. I miss it in my life. It is a fulfilling thing for me to have as oppose to something that is only there to get me from A-B and I know I will get a great deal of enjoyment out of it.

The way I look at it, I can save the money and come out in 60 months with enough to pay cash, or get it now and have a 10-15k asset instead + 5 years experience enjoying it.

I told myself that if I get the loan I will also setup a Roth IRA simultaneously and contribute $300 a month to start.

personalfinance,"Should I pay off my car loan early, strictly from a credit improvement standpoint?","Ignore the interest rate, monthly payments, etc. Let's just focus on the credit improvement aspect.

I'm really concerned about the Average Age of Accounts (AAoA) on my credit report (average of 11-ish months). This is because I've only had a credit card for a little over a year, one car loan that was closed after 10 months (accident, total loss, and insurance paid off the loan), and now my current car loan that I have had for a year. 

How much bearing on my credit score does the AAoA have? CreditKarma is currently giving me an F for this section because my accounts are less than 2 years old and even then they only give you a D until they're 5 years old - stingy!). 

I don't want to pay off this loan early if it's not going to help me improve my credit score. As it stands, I can have it paid off in another 8 months if I tried, but then I'd only have 20 months of payment history, and that (coupled with my credit card) would bring my AAoA up to somewhere around 16 months. I think that's still too low.

personalfinance,"I am at my wit's end trying to finance a flight. Any help, please.","This has been a month-long process. The entire time I have felt played, underhanded, and straight up lied to. I will make it as brief as possible, but still cover all the details. I want to know what is my fault and what isn't.

My profile: I am employed full time making 11/hr. I make anywhere between $17-21,000 a year. I live on my own. I am 21. I am also a full time student. Besides Federal Student Loans and a Macy card, I have only the line of credit in question here. My student loans are issued to me. I don't have any co-signers, but I make all my payments on time.

I have a scholarship to study abroad to Argentina. The only thing I need to do is pay for the flight. The flight is about 1200 dollars depending on the day, but will approach 1500-2000 dollars the longer I wait.

I went to the bank, Wells Fargo, and asked to take out a student loan toward the trip. They told me that I cannot do that, because Student Loans have to be dispersed via the school, and I wouldn't get the money in time to finance the flight. So, the teller recommend I take out a credit card for the cost of the flight. I asked if it would be enough to cover and she said ""I don't see why it wouldn't. If it's not, just call back and we can negotiate the limit.""

So the credit line opens up, I get the card, and I notice that the credit I have been given is only for $1000. Not enough for the flight. I decided to NOT activate the card at all until I can be sure it can cover my expenses. I only want to use this card for this flight.

I called back on the 19th to negotiate the limit and they gave me. I explained the situation, what I was paying for, and the guy on the phone put in a request to raise my limit to $1500.

Two days later, I called back to check on it, and they told me I was denied. The reason was this was my only line of credit. I explained that I have had my own place for a year, pay every bill on time, have student loans and the macy's card that I make payments to. The lady on the phone said ""Those don't count."" I said, ""Sure. But what I'm trying to do is paint a picture. I can pay it back. The issue I have is not how much I'm given--I'm trying to make an investment here. You're giving to my education, I get smarter, more successful, and get a better job. I am fully employed, and I don't see the major issue here. Sure, it's my first line of actual credit, but I have the record to show I can be trusted with it.""

She waited for a few moments then said, ""Is there anything else I can help you with, sir?"" really sternly. 

I said ""I'm just gonna get rid of the card. You can close the account.""

She said, ""Sir, if you do that it will show up on your credit score.""

I said, ""I never activated it.""

She said, ""Uhm. It was activated on the 19th.""

I never authorized, or was asked to authorize, activating the card. I specifically told the customer service rep. to NOT activate the card. She told me that there's nothing she can do and offered to transfer me back to Wells Fargo to talk about the ""accidental activation"". I was in tears by this point and just hung up.

I have to book this flight. I don't know what I can or should do. I just need this limit raised. I just want the opportunity to talk to somebody. I feel like if I were a reckless spender they'd be more interested in giving me credit. 

I don't have much time. This process has eaten up a month and I need to book this flight before the prices raise. I have a scholarship. I am very proud of it. I just need this one purchase.

Where do I start?

From what she told me the agent was mostly talking to her about a fixed annuity where she would put in around $400-$450 a month until it reached $5000 and then it would begin earning interest. It's a pre-tax plan so it would take a few years until that was paid. I'm afraid I don't know any more specifics than that (the fixed interest rate etc).

Bitcoin,BTC Futures Market - controlling the volatility,"I haven't heard anyone talking about this, but we better.

Those of us who are familiar with traditional futures markets get it.  For those who aren't here is a quick summary.

There are different kinds of market participants.  We have miners who mostly work to secure steady income streams to amortize equipment and generate a profit.  We have users, who need stability for their currency in order to conduct transactions.  And we have speculators who are there to provide the 'slack' to the system by supplying spikes of demand and demanding supply.

In order for the system to not jump up and down like a yoyo, we need a way to equalize, over time, the different pressures on the system.  The futures market is just the thing to do it.

Future contracts are very simple: they are agreements to buy or sell BTCs at a fixed price some time in the future.  

Why is this helpful?  It gives the miner the ability to sell his wares over time for steady cash to match the production capacity.  It gives the speculator the ability to fill in the tiniest cracks in the supply-demand chain.  And it steadies the value for the merchants and the users, giving them a fixed price to buy or sell the currency as they need it.

 In a spike like this, the futures market gives you a way to sell now to buy at a later date, very cheaply.  This creates a pressure on the current price to go down, and the future purchase creates a buying pressure for the price to go up later.  This action serves to average the spikes.  It also attracts more capital to the game as a liquid futures market is pretty much essential to the correct functioning of the free market (and I don't mean what currently passes for a free market).

A healthy futures market (and probably options markets) are necessary if we are to survive the hoards of hedge funds that will eventually come and stomp on our grounds.  These guys have brought down the economies of entire countries, and without an equalizing valve that futures provide, we are in for a roller coaster that will not end well for anyone, not to mention render the monetary use of bitcoin impossible.

The abuses we've seen on Wall St. have to do with regulatory collusion and the constant goosing of the markets by counterfeit $ from the fed.  The actual tools - the futures and derivatives markets are valid, and can be constructed with the same checks and balances and no active regulatory body as bitcoin itself enjoys.",cryptocurrency,1363913263
personalfinance,"Help! Massive Debt, Low Salary, Expensive City.","Hey, r/personalfinance. Longtime lurker, first-time poster.

I am a 26 year old medical student about to graduate from an American med school in May (woo!). I waited to make this post because I needed to know where I'd be doing my residency (affects both salary and expenses). Well, I just received the news and I will be doing my residency in NYC, quite possibly the most expensive city in the world (although they somewhat offset the expenses by paying ~150% more than residencies in other cities).

I want to hit the ground running. Medicine is one of those crappy jobs that causes you to accrue insane debt, and prevents you from earning anything until very late (a double whammy). I have basically had no income my entire life, and have been living in relative poverty off loans for the duration of medical school. What I want is to manage my finances during residency properly so that when I earn an attending physicians's salary, I'll have a great foundation to build off of.

**Some stats:**

Age: 26

Wife: No, but I have a LT GF who is fiscally responsible. She is also a student, so her income is exactly $0.

Children: None

Projected salary: $58,900

Current Assets: $800 in a savings account and a car valued at ~$12k (a gift from my parents)
CC debt: $0 (thanks, r/personalfinance!)

Student loans: $205k @ 6.8%

**Projected expenses/Rough budget:**

Rent: the cheapest dorm is $1000/mo and the alternative is $1500/mo. I think we can bank on $1500 because the $1000 dorms are hard to get.

Loan repayment: $2359.15 @ 10-year rate; $1336.45 @ 30-year rate

Misc expenses (groceries, phone, transportation, cable/Internet, etc): ~650/mo at my current rates.

Disposable income: 300/mo

There are definitely things I am not considering in my rough budget: 1. I have never lived in Manhattan before, but given the prices and distraction it offers, I am almost certain that I am lowballing my figures. 2. I also lurk bogleheads and all the physicians on there recommend taking out a life-insurance plan as well as disability-insurance, both of which I have little knowledge about. 3. I haven't accounted for a health insurance plan.

My goals: 1. Avoid accruing any more debt 2. Pay all bills, including life-, disability-, and health-insurance regularly. 3. Build up 6-month emergency fund 4. Pay down student loan as quickly as possible.

With anything left after this, I suppose that I'll: 5. Decide between paying down more debt or put money into a savings account (IRA/403b).

How am I doing? What can I expect? What adjustments can I make? Where have I made any errors in my calculations? It's mainly the mind-boggling student loans that really gives me the heeby-jeebies (and who knows what the rates will be once the Fed Govt sells it to other institutions). Should I pay down my loans at the 10-year rate, or request the 30-year rate and put my money in other places?

business,Banks cut deposit rates as CPI declines,"http://www.tuoitrenews.vn/cmlink/tuoitrenews/business/banks-cut-deposit-rates-as-cpi-declines-1.100630
Wednesday saw many banks simultaneously slash deposit interest rates, while the Ho Chi Minh City Statistics Office announced a slight decrease in the city’s consumer price index.
The interest rate for deposits of a term between one and three months at Vietcombank was lowered from the rate cap of 8 percent a year to 7.5 percent a year.
The country’s third-largest partly-private lender also dramatically cut the rate for deposits of a term of over 12 months, dropping it from 10.5 percent to 9.5 percent.
ACB meanwhile imposed a 0.2 percentage point cut on rates for one- to six-month terms, while offering a 7.6 percent a year rate for 9-month term deposits.
Some industry insiders, however, believe the unexpected interest rate cuts were a sign of banks embracing another order to slash rates by the State Bank of Vietnam.
The banking system is likely to see another interest rate adjustment, as the government has recently asked the central bank to continue lowering deposit interest rate in order to reduce lending rates. The deposit interest rate was capped at 8 percent last year under the government’s bid to assist businesses with lower lending rates.
CPI declines
Other insiders said the rate cuts came since banks have anticipated the development of the CPI in March, which saw a slight decrease of 0.29 percent, according to the statistics office. The city’s CPI rose 1.15 percent in the first quarter of this year.
Six out of 11 commodity baskets posted slight decreases, the office said.
The deepest decrease -- 0.62 percent -- was recorded in the commodities and services basket, followed by food and restaurant services (0.6 percent), and culture-entertainment-tourism services (0.47 percent).Beverages and cigarettes dropped by 0.35 percent, while transport saw a 0.34 percent decline, and garments and textiles-headwear-footwear, 0.08 percent.
In the increase group, housing-electricity-water-fuel prices, and construction material prices respectively rose by 0.38 percent and 0.07 percent.
However, local consumers said they have not seen any price cuts on the products on sale in citywide markets.
“Prices of pork, vegetables, and other essentials remain almost unchanged,” said Thanh Xuan, a market-goer from Binh Thanh District.
Meanwhile, economic expert Ngo Tri Long said the lower CPI does not mean good news for the economy.
“In fact, it proves that the economy remains in crisis with poor consumption and manufacturers in trouble,” he said.

Yahoo!'s email system hacked by criminal spammers abney associates news

As the world's third largest email provider recovers from a hack attack, Technology Producer Geoff White has the details of the scam and how Yahoo! users can protect themselves.

Yahoo!'s email system has been hacked by criminals who have hijacked users' accounts for a global spam email campaign.

The FBI has moved to shut down the operation after a Channel 4 News investigation revealed accounts around the world had been broken into. We understand the hacker lives in the Russian Federation.

Yahoo!, the world's third largest email provider, was hacked in January and claimed it had fixed the problem. But this new vulnerability has raised fresh concerns about security at the internet giant.

Suspicious log-ins

From as early as 1 March Yahoo! users' accounts began to show suspicious log-ins, apparently from a mobile phone, from locations around the world.

Within a minute of the hacker logging in, the users' mailboxes had been hijacked and used to send spam email. The hackers covered their tracks to leave their victims none the wiser.

Holly Willis was one of many victims. ""It looks like there was a log-in to my account from Romania - but I've never been there,"" she said. ""The first I knew of it was when people started contacting me asking why I'd sent them strange emails.

""I do have friends and family who don't use computers that often. They see an email from me, they trust me, so they click on the link. I feel terrible that I might have led to people's computers being compromised.""

Yahoo's automated systems highlighted the suspicious log-ins, but three weeks later it seems the company has been unable to stop the attacks and has not informed its customers of the problem. It has around 13m UK users.

We're committed to protecting our users and their data

Yahoo spokeman

Until today, the company's Twitter feed has for the past month carried the same message: a link to a safety update from last July which does not mention the email flaw.

When first approached for comment, Yahoo issued a statement relating to the January hack. When asked for an updated response, a Yahoo! spokesman said: ""We take data protection very seriously and are currently investigating reports that some Yahoo! Mail accounts may have been compromised.""

Random recipients

Once inside a user's account, the criminal sent an email containing a single web address to a handful of the victim's contacts - seemingly chosen at random from emails they have sent or received.

The links appear to lead to a legitimate website, but in fact, those legitimate websites have themselves been hacked. The spam link leads to a hidden page on the legitimate website, which immediately redirects to the hacker's website - a get-rich-quick scheme which promises thousands of dollars of income before asking for a credit card payment.

But Spamhaus, a UK organisation which tracks spammers, believes the website may also have contained a trojan - malicious code which can infect the computers of those who visit it.

""A trojan is a piece of software which is transferred silently from the criminal's computer to yours,"" said Richard Cox of Spamhaus. ""It changes the settings on your computer, reduces its security, and it can allow the criminal to track the keystrokes you make, for example when logging into your bank account.""

The hacker's site is based on a server in California, and following Channel 4 News's investigation the FBI has moved in to shut it down and seize the vital evidence it holds, in the hope of tracing the culprit.

Channel 4 News is not naming the suspected hacker, but we understand he is based in the Russian Federation and has a long history of computer crime.

""He's been involved in cyber-crime over a number of years. We've built up quite a comprehensive file on him. If it's handled correctly, the chances of an arrest are high,"" said Cox.

If you think you've been affected, Channel 4 News's technology producer Geoff White would like to hear from you - you can find him on Twitter: https://twitter.com/geoffwhite247. 

How to protect yourself

	Change your Yahoo email password immediately. A strong password includes upper and lower case letters and numbers, and should be unique to the account. Non-dictionary words are best: for example, take the first letter from each word in a line from your favourite song.
	Check for suspicious log-ins to your Yahoo account here.
	Spam links take the form of a legitimate web address followed by random code - for example: www.legitimatesite.com/afafn9234/?21qwerp. Do not click on the link.
	If you did click on the link, update your anti-virus software and run a virus check.
	Yahoo gives good security advice here and here.

personalfinance,Should I pay more than the minimum each month on my student loans?,"I have about $226,000 in student loans: $20,000 at 2.25%, $91,000 at 6.8%, $46,000 at 7.9%, and $69,000 at 8.5%. (For those wondering how I racked up such massive debt, $20,000 is from undergrad, $176,000 is from law school, the rest is accrued interest.) I graduated a little over a year ago and was fortunate to get a job, albeit not a well-paying one. The legal job market is atrocious at the moment, and most of my law school friends are either unemployed or doing contract work, and I feel lucky to even have a job. Finding a better job is a distinct possibility for the future, but for the time being I'm stuck where I am.

When time came to begin repaying my student loans, the lender told me that the monthly payments would be $2,500 a month, which in a sense is comical because I make $17/hr and I work 40 hours a week, and $2,500 is more than I take home in a month. I applied for the income-based repayment program, which allows borrowers to pay the lesser of their regular payment (in my case the $2,500) or 15% of their monthly income. The 15% calculation is based upon your prior year's tax return, and since my 2011 tax return had a negative number in the AGI slot, I am currently paying $0. However, the payments will be recalculated in a few months. 

My 15% minimum monthly payment starting in a few months should come out to be around $425 if I did my calculations correctly. However, around $1,000 in interest is currently accruing on my loans per month, and unless I pay over $1,000 a month (which is really not possible considering my income) any payment I make will never touch the principal and the loan balance will increase rather than decrease every month. 

The deal with IBR (income-based repayment) is that as long as you pay as agreed for 25 years, any balance remaining on your loan will be forgiven. Logically, you would think that if the balance will be forgiven after 25 years, I should just pay the minimum and who cares how large the balance gets, right? But from what I understand of tax law, I'd have to pay tax on the imputed income from the forgiven debt, which could be somewhere around 25-30% (who knows what tax bracket I'll be in 25 years down the road though, so this is just a guess). 

Here's my question for the financial gurus: Is it worth it to pay more than just the minimum each month on my student loans? 

**Tl;dr: I've got $226,000 in student loans at varying interest rates which are accruing about $1,000 of interest a month in total. I take home around $2,200 a month, and my minimum loan payment is soon to be around $425. Is it financially smart to pay more than the minimum?**",finance,1364012809

Hass and Associates Reviews
Hvordan hetta ut små bedrifter skal om cybercrime? Plenty, ifølge en forfjamset av siste advarsler fra offentlige tjenestemenn, forsikringsselskaper, og investorer, samt din mer tradisjonelle alarmists som datamaskinen sikkerhet bedrifter. ""Teknisk sett, har helvete brutt løs,"" sa Bessemer Venture Partners' David Cowan i går, som beskriver tilstanden til datamaskinen hacking under et intervju med Bloomberg Television.

I et hus subcommittee høring i dag om trusselen mot småbedrifter, Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) sitert studier som fant 20 prosent av cyberattacks er på bedrifter med færre enn 250 ansatte, og at 60 prosent av små bedrifter Lukk innen seks måneder etter en cyberattack. Han sa de siste angrep på behemoths bør tjene som en oppvekker for små ventures.

Hackere, selvfølgelig, kan slå de samme teknikkene som brukes til å invadere dypt-senket institusjoner som Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Federal Reserve og U.S. Department of Energy (for å nevne fire av enhetene Cowan sa var rettet i februar) på små bedrifter, som ofte er enklere byttedyr. ""Dessverre SMBs [små og mellomstore bedrifter] er mindre robust enn større selskaper fordi de har færre IT-ressurser i form av personell, maskinvare og programvare for å bekjempe angrep fra daglig cyber trusler og angrep som mange SMBer støter på en daglig basis,"" sa Dan Shapero, grunnleggeren av digital markedsføring tjenesten ClikCloud, under vitnesbyrd i dag.

Forsikringsselskaper har også tatt til etterretning. I går, rapportert Noah Buhayar og Elizabeth Bunn for Bloomberg News på det voksende markedet for politikk som dekker små bedrifter mot datakriminalitet:

""Mindre selskaper lærer at, som mer data er delt online, de, også, kan være mål for typer angrep som større bedrifter tåle. American International Group Inc. (AIG) og reisende Cos. (TRV) er blant selskapene skreddersøm cybersecurity produkter til kunder.

""Små og mellomstore bedrifter er""hvor skal vi se noen av de mest aggressive veksten i de neste par årene, fordi det har vært en del av markedet som ble ignorert,""sa Bob Parisi, nettverkssikkerhet og personvern praksis leder på Marsh Inc., forsikring megling av Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos.""

Datamaskinen sikkerhetsselskapet McAfee (INTC), i mellomtiden, sier småbedrifter bør være spesielt forsiktig med svindelforsøk (phishing) denne tiden av året.

""Skatt sesong, jul, utgangen av året, når du er lansere en ny bedrift-de er gangene når små bedrifter er trolig få målrettet,"" sier Monica Hamilton, som arbeider på en liten bedriftsprodukter for McAfee. ""De vet at du skal sende økonomiske data, og de er latterlig god til å gå etter det på Internett.""

investing,Should we be saving when times are good so we can borrow and spend when times are bad?,"I've been mulling this over for a few weeks. 

As I see it, when the economy is good and people have plenty of income, they spend like crazy. They buy new cars, new houses, take vacations, and throw money around because they feel secure that their income won't be interrupted. Then, the economy crashes, people lose their jobs, and everyone goes into panic mode. People start saving every dime they can and cut back on expenses wherever possible. 

Yet, look at interest rates historically. During boom or even just good economic years, interest rates on savings accounts are high, around 6%-8% a year. Why? I think it's because people don't see the need to save when times are good. So banks have to make savings and retirement accounts attractive by offering higher interest rates. Also, times are good, people see it as a good time to get a new home or small business loan. To pay those high rates for savings, the banks have to charger higher interest rates to borrowers. 

Now, if you find a bank willing to give you 1% or 2% on a savings account, you'd be lucky. People would be willing to flip tables and knock over grandmas to sign up for that rate. Why? Because banks are flush with money. The can borrow money from the fed at stupidly low rates. People are saving money like mad because of the recession, so banks don't have to offer much in the way of interest rates to lenders to get them to sign up. And interest rates to qualified borrows are low too. You can get a business loan or home loan for 3% or 4%.

So, wouldn't it make more sense to save when banks offer higher interest rates during good economic times; then borrow and spend during down turns when banks offer lower interest rates? And why do people have it backwards and spend when times are good and save when times are bad?",finance,1364005618
Bitcoin,Experience at Federal Reserve,"I recently went to a nearby Federal Reserve branch as part of an economics highschool competition. Besides getting to stand two feet from $30 million worth of hundreds in a single tub, not knowing how much was in the entire vault, we got to ask questions to the VP of the branch. Being a BTC fan I decided to ask about it. To quickly summarize his answer, he only mentioned a single article he had read on the internet which mentioned a guy who lost $200K when he lost his BTC wallet. Other than that, he seemed almost completely ignorant on the subject.

Funny thing, on the same trip we all got packs of shredded money. They told us that they don't know what to do with all of it and typically toss it in the dump. If someone has a use for shredded money, they said that they're willing to give it to them for free.

personalfinance,I will build you a financial model,"So as we all probably understand by now, budgeting and keeping track of expenses is an important part of having healthy finances. I think having a financial model for yourself (which is essentially an excel sheet with some fancy calculations) is a good next step. A model can help you answer questions like ""How long could I survive without income?"" or ""How quickly should I pay down debt?"" or ""When should I buy a house?"" (or whatever other financial questions might be interesting/important to you), and is tailored to your particular circumstances.

If you give me a breakdown of your current financial situation, I'll build you your own financial model in excel. Info I'll need:

* Your high-level circumstances (age, married/single, employed/unemployed/student, kids, etc)

* Income, from all sources. If it's from a job or is otherwise taxed or has deductions (like health insurance, 401k, etc), let me know about all those too

* Monthly expenses

* Bank/investment and debt account balances and interest rates. Include things like property and mortgages, car loans, student debt, credit cards, etc.

* Any major financial goals you have for the next few years

* Anything else you'd like to know about your finances

You can either post this info in a comment here and I'll give you a link to download your model once I'm done with it, or you can email me at jglh99@gmail.com if you prefer privacy (I won't share your info with anyone).

So what's in it for me? Several things:

* Having made a financial model for myself, I've found it to be really insightful, and I'd like to see if others find it as useful as I do

* If others do find it useful, I'd like to know what types of questions are especially important to them

* I'd like to get a better idea of what the typical person's financial situation is, as well as what some of the more obscure situations could be. I'd eventually like to build a tool that can help automate the model building process, and I'd like to make sure I'm covering as many use cases as is feasible

To try to be as  brief as possible:  

*  About to get married to a fantastic, working, frugal girl.

*  Able to save around $2k per month living frugally.  This is after all expenses, including the *minimum payments* on our student loans on a 10 year repayment plan.  Weighted average interest rate is about 6% for all loan groups.

*  If we dropped all of our 2k/month ""extra"" into student loans, we could get them paid off in 4 years instead of ten.  

*  I have been obsessively researching investment real estate, and want to save the ""extra"" for a down payment on a four-unit house.  Live in one unit, and rent out the other 3.  I'm quite conservative with investments and would not do this unless it was cash-flow positive.

Bitcoin,A few suggestions for easy and secure storage of Bitcoins,"Bitcoin is like digital cash, which brings many advantages. But there is also a big disadvantage: 
 
To handle bitcoins securely, you really must be in control of your computer.

With a normal windows computer, this is surprisingly hard to reach. It is, for example, insufficient, if you got sometime a virus and ""removed"" the virus using some scanning software from your system - your machine is still compromised and would need a full reinstall to get clean. Think about it - the virus might have changed the system in any way, and you do **not** longer control it. Sure, your wallet might be encrypted, but the next time you type your encryption password, some hidden program can send the password to somebody else - the real owner of your computer. Or nothing happens, until you buy a car and attach your savings wallet - and when you send the money, pang, it simply goes to another address, because your bitcoin client is not longer your bitcoin client - and hasn't been for a long time.

So, my personal conclusion at this point is: **Windows is just not secure enough.** (This isn't valid, of course, for real experts which recognize for alterations of the cursor blink frequency if some system is running malware.)

One key idea for a high security is: Don't use the system for anything else than managing bitcoins: It is far better to use a dedicated computer for this purpose. I, personally, do not believe it is best to store everything on paper, as that makes your keys somewhat inaccessible. You should also be very, very careful with encryption - bitcoin provides no password reset. Moreover, regardless how strong your encryption is, once you access your funds, their security cannot be better than the security of the computer you use.

Much better is a **dedicated secure device**, such as a small netbook running Linux. The less software such a system runs, the more secure it is.

Many people still find Linux difficult to set up. So, here I have a few suggestions for easy and secure bitcoin devices.


1) A small, cheap netbook with Linux pre-installed. This could be a Asus F201 or an ASUS eee PC which comes with Ubuntu Linux pre-installed. Generally, with a price between 200 and 300 USD you should be fine.

2) You can also buy a small computer and install Linux yourself. I tested an Acer Aspire One 756 and installed Lubuntu, a lightweight version of Ubuntu. This was very easy, and has the benefit of less software - and consequentely fewer security flaws. (It also supports harddisk encryption which is good as measure against theft and manipulation).

Other small computers in this class are, for example: The Lenovo Edge E135, Samsung NC10,  Asus Eee PC X101CH.

3) if you want more security, you could buy some Laptop with CDROM device and use a read-only system. Lenovo Thinkpads work traditionally very well with Linux and one can buy an older, used one for about 300 USD.

There is a live CD system made specially for banking porposes which is called ""c't Bankix"". It is distributed by the renowned German computer magazine c't and can be downloaded without charge here:

http://www.heise.de/download/ct-bankix.html


4) The preceding suggestions are focused on ease of use. For more security, one can do many more things, depending on your personal skills. Instead of Ubuntu, one can, for example, use the Fedora Distribution which contains a very strong, military-grade security extension which is called SELinux. Or, it is possible to use one of the new Samsung Chromebooks with ARM processor and run Ubuntu on it - running the system on a different processor will thwart many security exploits. On the high end, there are specific hardened Linux variantes like Alpine Linux. Just install only what is absolutely necessary.

If you want to have good security, you also need to screen the software you are running - especially the bitcoin software itself, of course. Doing this and communicating the results is also a service to the community, as phishy client software can cause real mayhem.

I am curious for improvements and suggestions.

What if they dropped them to about 4% and 2% of that must go back into public spending for health or schools or roads etc, the bank still gets to keep 2% and the interest rate cut from 7.5% down to 4% would allow people to have so much more money to spend on the countries economy... why wouldn't this work... or is it just bank greed that would make it impossible?",finance,1364121967
investing,UK All share index tracker - buy now or wait.,"I have used the last 4 years cash ISA allowance and have a reasonable amount in an everyday savings account. With my savings account maturing later this year and interest rates so low, it's time I started looking longer term and invested for the long haul.

I have about £11k that I'm not going to need in a hurry, and want to make use of 50% of my ISA allocation in an S&amp;S ISA this year and the next. Obviously with the 5th April looming, I need start thinking if I want to use this year's allocation. 

Having never invested in the stock market before, I did a lot of research and there seems to be a consensus in using cheap index trackers for beginners. I have settled one of the following:

* Vanguard FTSE UK Equity Index Accumulation Shares
* SWIP FTSE All Share Index (SWIP Foundation Growth
* HSBC FTSE All-Share Index (Inst)

The plan is to invest £5.5k before April, then a subsequent £5.5k after, with monthly top ups outside of the ISA (because I'm going to use 50% of my allowance for cash next year) 

Now, that's a lot of waffle, so I'll get to the point. My concern with this is when to drop the first 5k, or if indeed I should do it. There is lots of talk about the FTSE heading for a correction, which would immediately wipe out a portion of my investment. Should I wait a few months (and miss the current year's ISA) or jump feet first?",finance,1364112294

""Teknisk sett, har helvete brutt løs,"" sa Bessemer Venture Partners' David Cowan i går, som beskriver tilstanden til datamaskinen hacking under et intervju med Bloomberg Television.

I et hus subcommittee høring i dag om trusselen mot småbedrifter, Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) sitert studier som fant 20 prosent av cyberattacks er på bedrifter med færre enn 250 ansatte, og at 60 prosent av små bedrifter Lukk innen seks måneder etter en cyberattack. Han sa de siste angrep på behemoths bør tjene som en oppvekker for små ventures.

Hackere, selvfølgelig, kan slå de samme teknikkene som brukes til å invadere dypt-senket institusjoner som Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Federal Reserve og U.S. Department of Energy (for å nevne fire av enhetene Cowan sa var rettet i februar) på små bedrifter, som ofte er enklere byttedyr. ""Dessverre SMBs [små og mellomstore bedrifter] er mindre robust enn større selskaper fordi de har færre IT-ressurser i form av personell, maskinvare og programvare for å bekjempe angrep fra daglig cyber trusler og angrep som mange SMBer støter på en daglig basis,"" sa Dan Shapero, grunnleggeren av digital markedsføring tjenesten ClikCloud, under vitnesbyrd i dag.

business,Banks cut deposit rates as CPI declines-Topix,"http://www.topix.com/forum/world/germany/T2M014EL6A60RSA9S
 
Wednesday saw many banks simultaneously slash deposit interest rates, while the Ho Chi Minh City Statistics Office announced a slight decrease in the city’s consumer price index.
The interest rate for deposits of a term between one and three months at Vietcombank was lowered from the rate cap of 8 percent a year to 7.5 percent a year.
The country’s third-largest partly-private lender also dramatically cut the rate for deposits of a term of over 12 months, dropping it from 10.5 percent to 9.5 percent.
ACB meanwhile imposed a 0.2 percentage point cut on rates for one- to six-month terms, while offering a 7.6 percent a year rate for 9-month term deposits.
Some industry insiders, however, believe the unexpected interest rate cuts were a sign of banks embracing another order to slash rates by the State Bank of Vietnam.
The banking system is likely to see another interest rate adjustment, as the government has recently asked the central bank to continue lowering deposit interest rate in order to reduce lending rates. The deposit interest rate was capped at 8 percent last year under the government’s bid to assist businesses with lower lending rates.
CPI declines
Other insiders said the rate cuts came since banks have anticipated the development of the CPI in March, which saw a slight decrease of 0.29 percent, according to the statistics office. The city’s CPI rose 1.15 percent in the first quarter of this year.
Six out of 11 commodity baskets posted slight decreases, the office said.
The deepest decrease -- 0.62 percent -- was recorded in the commodities and services basket, followed by food and restaurant services (0.6 percent), and culture-entertainment-tourism services (0.47 percent).
Beverages and cigarettes dropped by 0.35 percent, while transport saw a 0.34 percent decline, and garments and textiles-headwear-footwear, 0.08 percent.
In the increase group, housing-electricity-water-fuel prices, and construction material prices respectively rose by 0.38 percent and 0.07 percent.
However, local consumers said they have not seen any price cuts on the products on sale in citywide markets.
“Prices of pork, vegetables, and other essentials remain almost unchanged,” said Thanh Xuan, a market-goer from Binh Thanh District.
Meanwhile, economic expert Ngo Tri Long said the lower CPI does not mean good news for the economy.
“In fact, it proves that the economy remains in crisis with poor consumption and manufacturers in trouble,” he said.

We're debating dropping the 12k to knock out most of her loans above 5% so we can target the variable rate loans while rates are still low.  We had also talked about using the 12k for a down payment on a small starter home (100k-125k) since we want to settle down in the area we're living in plus the added cash flow.

personalfinance,"Advice on complicated 3 job, freelance work, WFH tax filing questions - help me avoid paying for an accountant!","I have the most complicated tax situation I have ever had, but really want to file taxes by myself (I have a discount on TurboTax) rather than engage an accountant. If you guys can help me answer a few questions then I think I can - although if your advice is ""Get an accountant"" then I'll take that on board too.

So, this is my tax situation for 2012:

  1. First 3 months of 2012 - FT job with employer A, good bonus, lots of tax withheld (federal and CA state) so may be due a refund there
  2. Next 2 months - unemployed/jobhunting
  3. Next 5 months - employed working from home FT by employer B, tax withheld by employer. Unfortunately they withheld MA state tax (where they are based) instead of CA state tax (where I lived and worked)
  4. Last 2 months of year - employed FT at employer C AND continued to work freelance for employer B to finish up a few projects (total earned maybe ~$500)

I have three W-2s from each period of FT employment, and am ready to get started, but have three questions:

What do I do about the states mixup? Do I just file a non-residential MA tax return and claim it back, then include that income on my CA return and owe extra tax there? Any way to avoid paying Turbo Tax for two state filings?

What do I file for the two months freelance work? 

Can I deduct rent or anything from when I was working from home FT (I currently don't itemize)? Or can I deduct it from the period I worked freelance to avoid paying tax on that income? I was working from home, using my own computer, heat, light etc.

Thanks very much in advance - let me know if you need any more details.",finance,1364255731
personalfinance,Any consensus on whether to pay down student loans quickly?,"Like a lot of folks, I'm going to be graduating lawschool with student loan debt around $120K. The average rate is around 7.6, but the interest is tax deductible to a certain level, making the effective rate closer to 6%. Admittedly, still fairly high.

However, Income Based Repayment is a pretty sweet deal. For those unfamiliar:

* it caps your required monthly payments at (Your AGI - 150% Federal Poverty line) * .15.  

* You can adjust your payments if you lose your job/salary goes down.

* If your payments don't cover accruing interest, the government will pay the difference for the first three years.

* If you still can't cover interest, the interest will accrue, but won't be added to the principle (no compounding interest).

* Any remaining balance is forgiven after 25 years.

* The only downside is that the forgiven balance is taxable, although a number of folks are working on changing that. I also hope that my payments under IBR would still pay the whole off by year 25.

More details here: http://www.ibrinfo.org/faq.vp.html

(I don't qualify for pay-as-you-earn due to pre-2008 undergrad loans).

I feel like these are a unique sort of loan where payments will never be crippling, and I will never be at risk of out-of-control debt from spiraling compound interest. Given that, I feel like I should prioritize building personal capital over paying off this debt.

Is this the consensus view or am I in the minority?

The problem is that she has a mixed credit report with her brothers. We orginally identified this problem on 2/15, we filed a dispute and were told it would take 30 days. On 3/15 the dispute showed up as 'resolved' online - so we had our mortgage guy pull our credit score - apparently they removed all the credit accounts so she didnt even have a credit score.  I've been calling back and eventually we got put through to the office of consumer affiars and now someone else has the file and said they are looking into it and it can take up to 30 days.

We already lost a house due to these delays (when they were first identified) - and now we have another contract - and my concern is that another 30 days will lead us to lose this house (or cause us to have to pay a higher interest rate) - her credit score via experian is 750+.. so I would expect her credit score to be fairly good with equifax as well. Our credit scores are also slowly dropping because we have pulled our credit so many times (so far, it seems to drop about 10 points each hard pull) - so we may pay a penalty with a higher interest rate due to their incompetence.

I've filed a FTC complaint  but I doubt they will do anything soon - does anyone else have any ideas on how to expedite equifax fixing her credit report?

personalfinance,How (and Whether?) to Save for a House?,"Hi r/pf!  Thanks in advance for reading this wall o’ text. Just for fun, this one isn’t about calculating taxes, debt collection, or how to interpret employer matching formulas :)  But it (kinda) is related to “how much house can I afford” (sorta). 

**tl;dr: Would love this subreddit’s thoughts on my goal of buying a house in a few years, and how to structure my budget to make this happen.  Should I consider cutting back on retirement contributions to save money for a downpayment?**

About my situation: 

* **Me:** mid-30s, single, stable employment. Make about $96k/yr. Enjoy walks on the beach. 
* **Goal 1:** To be financially independent by the time I hit retirement age. Preferably much sooner than that. 
* **Goal 2:** Would like to buy a house in a few years. There are no houses available in the areas I’d be interested in that are available for less than $300k (and even that’s a tough order), so I’d need more than $60k for a 20% down payment (plus closing costs, etc)
* **Current housing:** Live in a very high-cost of living area. I own a condo. Recently refi’d, which frees up a nice chunk in my monthly budget but also took a bite out of my savings (I paid down a decent chunk of principal in order to get better terms on the loan). 
* **Why a house if I already have a condo?** Looking toward the future, I’d like more space, and a house is a better investment than this condo. For one thing, the HOA fees are ridiculous. I’d like my housing to be 100% paid off when I hit retirement, and at the current rate, my HOA fees are going to be untenable when I hit 60. Whatever maintenance costs I would have on a house will be lower than my monthly non-mortgage costs for the condo (no, really, you have to believe me on this). The condo is fine for now, but incompatible with my goal of having very low fixed costs down the road. 
* **Retirement:**  Retirement savings currently at ~$135k. Currently maxing out 401k and ROTH IRA. Was previously contributing mainly to ROTH 401k, but switched to traditional 401k to get more of it back in my paycheck for cash flow purposes. 
* **Debt:** No revolving credit card debt. Only other debt is a student loan with a very low interest rate. 
* **Car:** Paid off, but insurance/registration, etc. are pricey due to where I live.  Strongly leaning toward selling it. If I do, I’d need to factor in costs of car rentals/car sharing, taxis, but it would be cheaper overall (albeit slightly inconvenient).
* **Emergency fund/savings:**  Have an emergency fund of ~12 months expenses, plus an aggressively invested brokerage account. 

My budget has been a bit in flux since the last few months have been very unusual (mostly due to refi-related expenses). But this breakout below should be a pretty accurate/conservative representation of ongoing expenses. 

||Monthly…|
|:----|:---|
|Gross pay|$8,000|
|401k|($1,460)|
|Housing|($1,200) (4% for 30yr fixed; includes HOA fees, insurances, taxes, utilities)|
|ROTH IRA|($460)|
|Food (groceries and eating out)|($450)|
|Misc.|($300)|
|Min. student loan|($220) (2.8% interest)|
|Avg. travel|($200)|
|Avg. car expenses|($120)|
|Pets|($100)|
|Charity|($100)|
|(Non-restaurant) Entertainment|($50)|
|Internet|($60)|
|Pre-paid phone|($55)|

Misc = dry cleaning, books, taxi, website hosting, gifts, annual membership fees, personal care products, household goods, random things that come up irregularly. This category could be as low as $10 and as high as a couple hundred, any given month.

I should easily be able to save $500-$700/mo. (I haven’t had a full month with the new, lower mortgage payment and the new retirement allocation, so I’m not yet sure how much extra there will be at the end of every month. It could be higher, but I want to be conservative).

However, if I wanted to put down 20% on a townhouse in 3 years, assuming I was starting from scratch (not touching my emergency fund/current investments and assuming I wouldn’t use equity from my condo … in case I decide to rent it or the condo market crashes, who knows, just playing it safe), I’d need to save $1700/mo!! Ouch. 

I realize I could cut out discretionary costs in categories like charity, food, travel and entertainment but some of these things are tied to a level of quality of life that I really value. (More than having an extra $10k in 3 years to put down towards a house?... Maybe?) 

So… how should I budget/plan to accumulate $60k in two to three years? Even if I have some windfalls, pull principal out of my Roth, find a place that would sell for less than $300k, etc, I still see needing at least another $40k.

In addition to saving what’s left over after my budgeted costs, should I also cut back on my retirement contributions to make this happen?  Just how cringe-worthy is the idea of losing several years worth of maxed out tax-advantaged growth? Should I consider putting down less than 20% and just deal with PMI for a few years?

Bitcoin,"If I had bought Bitcoin at $1 and did the following, would it be possible to completely avoid paying income taxes in the US?","**Edit: A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding the central point of the scenario. That central point is: if you buy a good or service with bitcoins after they have substantially appreciated in value — and WITHOUT CONVERTING BACK TO FIAT — do you have a taxable event?**

*For all you conscientious objectors to income taxes, I totally sympathize, but I am not brave enough to violate US tax law at this time. Please take your anti-income-tax comments elsewhere.*

*For all you feds in the audience, note that I have not done any of the following. Please do not arrest me. This is all for the sake of discussion.*

For tax lawyers, tax accountants, and other tax wonks reading this, consider this scenario:

Say I bought 13,333 bitcoins when the exchange rate was $1/1BTC. Say the current exchange rate is $75/BTC. I now have $1,000,000 worth of Bitcoin. Say I also have $100,000 in my savings account.

Feeling flush, I decide to quit my job. I know my expenses in 2013 are going to be exactly $50,000. And I have a neighborhood Bitcoin gift card dealer who is able to sell me gift cards for Bitcoin for everything I need for the year (Trader Joe's, Amazon, Walmart). I even convince my landlord to accept my rent payments and utility payments in Bitcoin.

If, every time I purchase a $100 gift card from the Bitcoin gift card dealer, I also buy $100 of Bitcoins from MtGox at the going exchange rate, I keep the total $-equivalent balance in my Bitcoin wallet constant (or increasing, if the exchange rate increases). Since I don't want to increase my exposure to fiat, that's what I do.

At the end of the year, say the exchange rate has gone up sufficiently that my $1,000,000-worth of Bitcoin is now worth $2,000,000, and I have $50,000 in my savings account. My net worth on paper has now increased $950,000 year-over-year.

**Question: Do I owe any income tax and/or capital gains tax to the IRS.**

===== ANSWERED =====

Thanks to resonate59 for what appears to be the best answer so far:

&gt; ""If you have a gain on a personal foreign currency transaction because of changes in exchange rates, you do not have to include that gain in your income unless it is more than $200. If the gain is more than $200, report it as a capital gain.""
&gt;  — IRS website http://goo.gl/Oeh6p

So all $50,000, less your cost basis, would be subject to capital gains.

Anyone using Bitcoin to buy stuff had better take note! Given how fast the exchange rate has been climbing, most purchases made with bitcoins that have been sitting in your wallet for more than a week could end up being subject to capital gains.",cryptocurrency,1364228379

This leaves a net of about $300/month to put towards paying off debt, investing, or accumulating savings.  We currently have an emergency fund of ~$10,000.  

So we’re “fine” financially in the sense that we don’t lose money.  Though I wonder if I ought to take the extra I put towards our mortgage and instead pay off student debt which has a higher interest rate (6%) at the expense of having to pay mortgage insurance for a longer duration.  Is it reasonable to just exist in this stasis for five more years (we’re both 25) until some of the student loans are paid and we are able to invest further in our savings?

I am looking to obtain a credit card with a better interest rate and I remember hearing American Express can help with this.  My current FICO score is a 680.  Its taken me a long 6 years to pull out from the damages which I had done in my youth!  I am a full-time college student, 32 years old and have 2 part time jobs.  The only debt I carry right now is a student loan and a car payment which ends next year.  My credit cards are paid off (credit limits are VERY low anyway &gt;$500)... I have 2 cards with First Premier Bank (the first cards I got just to build my credit).  I plan on closing my Sears Mastercard this week because Orchard Bank is purchasing them out... I've heard nothing but negative commentary about them so I figure I'd jump ship before it's too late (have to leave before 4/1). 

So here are my questions:
1a. Is it worth applying for an American Express Credit Card?  
1b. If so, which one?  If not, where should I apply?  
2. What advice could you offer someone who's trying to get their credit into the mid-700s range within the next year or two?",finance,1364181675
personalfinance,What's the best bank with the highest interest savings?,"I'm looking to move a six figure sum out of a miserably near 0 interest BofA account to somewhere else.

So far I've looked at Discover, American Express, Ally bank and Barclay's.

From what I understand Discover is strictly savings. American Express is also solely an online bank, only has savings (no checking) and doesn't give you a debit/ATM card. Ally has checking/savings both with good rates and gives you an atm card with unlimited reimbursement fees. Barclay's is only savings online for US customers, has no atm cards/reimbursement fees but has the best rate at 1% advertised. The other 3 are between .75% and .85%.

I'm leaning towards Ally but I also read some things about Ally bank failing the Fed's stress test [and they recently got bought out](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2012/10/23/td-target-royal-bank-ally.html).

I understand there are some federal loans I can apply for and some private loans with some tough interest rates. However, is income based repayment the best option? Or just taking out regular loans and paying them on a 30 year plan? For those of you who may have gone through a similar process, what sort of advice do you have? How long did it take you pay it off?

Bonds have been doing extremely well for the last 5 years, but a lot of people I have talked to about this seem to think we are approaching the time to make the switch to inflation-protection.  I feel that the time for bonds may not be quite over, but like I said I'm not as educated in the fixed-income sector as most others probably are.

**Implications of the FinCEN guidance if you haven't already read about it**

The primary uncertainty of bitcoin was that one day, the government may declare payment of goods and services using bitcoin count as electronic money transmission. After all, you are transferring something that looked like money via electronic means, and that sounds like it could possibly be a regulated activity. It was always believed that the greatest vulnerability for bitcoin on a regulatory level was that the government could nail everyday bitcoin transactions as money transmission. 

FinCEN, the agency in charge of money transmission (such as Western Union), has clarified that activities such as purchasing goods and services using bitcoin does not qualify as electronic money transmission. Adding the fact that banks are exempt from most federal AND state money transmitter laws, having Mtgox partner with a bank means that the largest questions on whether (the executive branch of) the US Government would declare common bitcoin transactions as illegal money transmission has largely been resolved.

It's no surprise that while the tinfoil hat brigade were whining about government paying attention to bitcoin, big players on the market figured out the FinCEN guidance was an incredibly positive step for bitcoin acceptance.",cryptocurrency,1364288752

bradley associates financial solutions blog Hedge Funds Most Bearish Ever on Copper, Favor Gold: Commodities

Hedge funds are making the biggest bet against copper on record as global inventories expand to a nine-year high, while concern that Europe’s debt crisis will spread spurred the biggest gain in gold bets since 2008.

Speculators raised net-short positions in U.S. copper futures and options by 53 percent to 25,719 contracts in the week ended March 19, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data that begins in 2006. A jump in bullish bets on corn, gold and natural gas boosted overall holdings across 18 raw materials for a second consecutive week.

Copper prices are heading for a second consecutive monthly loss in what would be the longest slump since the end of 2011. Stockpiles monitored by exchanges in London, Shanghai andNew York stand at about 873,000 metric tons, or almost five months of North American demand, and Barclays Plc is forecasting a second annual surplus. Gold climbed for three weeks, the longest rally in six months, amid turmoil over Cyprus’s efforts to win a bailout to avert its financial collapse.
	
“We’re sitting on unprecedented stockpiles of copper and other metals,” said Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank in Chicago, which oversees about $66 billion of assets. “Demand has been pretty tepid for industrial metals. In the global economy, we’re seeing improving growth, but it’s still at a slow rate.”

Copper dropped 1.5 percent to $3.466 a pound on the Comex last week, the biggest retreat in a month. The Standard &amp; Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities fell 0.9 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities declined 1.1 percent and the dollar rose 0.1 percent against a basket of six major trading partners. Treasuries returned 0.4 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.

LME Stockpiles
Inventories of copper monitored by the London Metal Exchange jumped 77 percent this year to 565,350 tons, the highest since October 2003. Supplies tracked by the Shanghai Futures Exchange are at the highest since the data begins in January 2003. Chinese imports of the refined metal declined in February to the lowest in 19 months, while exports rose for a sixth month, government figures showed March 21.

Prices dropped along with most commodities last week as Cyprus neared the brink of financial collapse, reviving concern that Europe’s debt crisis will erode global growth. The continent accounts for 18 percent of copper demand, Barclays estimates. Overnight, Cyprus dodged a disorderly default and unprecedented exit from the euro currency by bowing to demands to shrink its banking system in exchange for a 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout.

Air Conditioners
Sales of air conditioners and orders for electrical equipment suggest improving demand inChina, Rachel Zhang, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said in a report last week. The nation’s passenger-vehicle market rose 20 percent to 2.84 million units in January and February in the strongest start since 2010. The transportation industry accounts for about 11 percent of the country’s copper use and household appliances 15 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.

“The risk appetite has certainly improved over the last several months,” said Nelson Louie, the global head of commodities at New York-based Credit Suisse Asset Management, who helps manage $11.3 billion. “The overall U.S. economy has shown resilience, and China seems to be improving as well.”

Investors withdrew a net $929 million from commodity funds in the week ended March 20, saidCameron Brandt, the director of research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based researcher EPFR Global, which tracks money flows. Gold and precious metals had an outflow of $978 million.

Gold Gains
Gold prices have risen 1.8 percent in March, heading for the first monthly gain since September. The metal is still down 4.1 percent this year as the U.S. unemployment rate fell and assets in exchange-traded products backed by gold dropped 6.7 percent. Investors increased their bullish bets by 63 percent to 70,193 contracts, the biggest expansion since September 2008.

The precious metal has jumped 81 percent since the end of 2008 as central bank measures intended to stimulate economic growth increased speculation that inflation will accelerate. TheFederal Reserve on March 20 left unchanged plans to hold its target interest rate near zero percent as long as U.S. unemployment remains above 6.5 percent. The jobless rate last month was 7.7 percent.

Money managers increased their bullish bets on natural gas to 46,148 contracts, from 2,995 a week earlier, the CFTC data show. Oil wagers climbed 3.2 percent to 172,268 contracts, and those for gasoline rose 1.4 percent to 77,801 contracts. Natural gas advanced 18 percent this year as production gains slowed and cold weather bolstered heating demand.

Farm Bets
A measure of speculative positions across 11 agricultural products from wheat to coffee to cattle increased 9.1 percent to 265,475 contracts, the highest since Feb. 12.

Wagers on higher corn prices increased 66 percent to 145,535 contracts, the biggest gain since July 2010. Speculators reduced their negative outlook for wheat to 33,457 contracts from a net-short position of 41,519 a week earlier.

Corn stockpiles before the next harvest will fall to 632 million bushels, the lowest since 1996, theU.S. Department of Agriculture said March 8. The agency raised its forecast for use of the grain in animal feed by 2.2 percent to 4.55 million bushels. Soybean inventories may drop to the lowest since 2004.

“Prices are going to be driven by supply-and-demand considerations and technical factors for each commodity,” said Walter ‘Bucky’ Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion of assets at BB&amp;T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “Crop inventories are creating support in prices for corn. The copper flows show there are still doubts about global growth.”

That weekend we went to one of those car dealerships that tell you they will help everyone regardless of their credit history and bankruptcy. We also had no money to put down and we would have loved to pay a car with cash. But we did not have that kind of money.

We had bankruptcy finalized in February of 2009. Due to our medical debt. We walked in to the dealership and walked out with a car payment in July 2011. We owe more than what the car is worth. Yes we are upside down unfortunately. The finance manager kept telling us that a ""year from now you can refinance and get a better interest rate and a lower monthly payment"" foolishly we thought he was right. WRONG! We made a mistake of not negotiating. Because we both have really bad credit due to the bankruptcy and no money to put down.

The car loan is with Capital One Auto Finance at $332 a month with a interest rate of 14%. We still owe $13,500 on the vehicle. It's a 2008 Mazda Tribute with close to 100,000 miles on it. We have never been late.

So are we stuck with a car loan if not what can we do? It would be nice to have that $340 extra a month and build up our savings instead but we don't have that luxury. 

The positive side to this is that it's a good vehicle. Reliable and nice to drive. 

I hope someone here can help and give us good sound advice. Thank you.",finance,1364282439

Inntjening sterkt selskap styrket aksjer på Wall Street i går. Investorer så også en sjanse til å legge til deres beholdning etter avtar tidligere i uken.

Nike rapporterte en bølge i kvartalsvis profitt, sende sin aksjekursen til en post. Tiffany toppet inntekter spådommer, styrket av etterspørselen fra kundene i Asia.

Investorene ble også tegnet av en pause i markedets store oppkjøringen. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-indeks logget sin andre ukentlige nedgangen av året, til tross for Fridays gevinst.

Demper på amerikanske aksjemarkedene ble forårsaket av et annet bekymringsfull kapittel i Europas gjeldskrisen og noen skuffende corporate nyheter.

FedEx endte uken 10 prosent lavere etter at den rapporterte en nedgang i kvartalsvise overskudd og kuttet sin årlige inntjening prognose på onsdag. Selskapet er en gauge av økonomien, fordi så mange shoppere og bedrifter bruke sine frakt-tjenester.

I går, investorer tok fordel av markedets ned uke og ramped opp deres lager kjøpe.

En spenstig verdensøkonomien har oppmuntret investorer til å plukke opp aksjer på fall, sier Ron Florance, administrerende direktør i investeringsstrategi i Wells Fargo Private Bank.

""Vi har fortsatt en forbløffende mengde penger sitter på sidelinjen,"" sa Florance.

Dow Jones industrial average steg 90.54 poeng, eller 0,6 prosent, til 14,512.03 i går. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 indeksen steg 11.09 poeng, eller 0,7 prosent, til 1,556.89. Nasdaq composite fikk 22.40 poeng, eller 0,7 prosent, til 3,245.

Dow kaste en brøkdel av et prosentpoeng denne uken.

En pause i forkant av aksjemarkedet er nå grunnet fordi gevinster i år overdrive forbedring i økonomien, sier Terry Sandven, sjef egenkapital strateg hos oss Bank Wealth Management.

Største risikoen til markedet oppkjøringen i år vil komme når Fed står overfor økende press for å avslutte sin stimulans programmet. Det kan skje hvis økonomien fortsetter å forbedre og aksjemarkedene stiger, sa Sandven.

Avkastningen på 10-års Treasury note steg til 1.93 prosent fra 1.92 prosent.

Someone with my goals has a projected salary of 50-60k out of school, with growth to 90k+. My state school (UCLA) would run me about 45k. Columbia would cost me around 90k after everything is said and done. That said, Columbia's MPH program is a much better fit for my goals and appears to have a huge leg up over UCLA in terms of landing a job and professional network on the east coast and/or abroad. UCLA's program is fantastic, but their focus and connections are largely limited to LA (judging from the program faculty and students I've spoken with). If this weren't the case, I'd go with UCLA in a heartbeat. But as it is, I feel I'd be throwing out the opportunity of [my] lifetime by walking away from Columbia. I know I'd regret my decision every day spent working on a degree at UCLA.

My question is: am I about to make a glaringly obvious and unnecessary mistake? From what I've heard from others, the federal loans packages don't cover Columbia's full tuition, so some students may need to take out private loans. This prospect, while aversive, is something I'm willing to do if it's necessary to get me where I want to be (post-degree). I'd greatly appreciate any input from someone who has more financial savvy than I do (everyone here). I apologize if this came out as jumbled word vomit -- take it as a manifestation of where my brain is at right now. Again, thank you for reading this.",finance,1364423929
Bitcoin,Dear Ben Bernanke,"I offer you sound advice in regard to the current situation regarding the production of American dollars en masse. Perhaps it would be a wiser idea to say, pay some of the debt with China, with bitcoin? But on a more serious note, perhaps REALLY pay some of it back with REAL assets, some of that gold sitting in the Fed perhaps. Then, you could always go ahead and have the ruling party allow for the legal destruction of tender by authorised government entities,.

I think the signs are pretty clear that another boom (or bubble) is coming.

*  People that got out of bad home loans through short sales or other means are nearing the end of the 3 year waiting period to jump back in and buy a house.

*  Inventory is low from the slow down in building the last 5 years (although it's picking up) and the reduction in short sales and foreclosures.

Report from Dubai
March 26, 2013
 
 
The slides used at the Global Interdependence Center conference in Dubai on March 26, 2013, are now posted under the “Special Reports” section on Cumberland’s website. Here is the link http://www.cumber.com/content/special/32613GICDubai.pdf. The guide to the slides follows.
Slide 1 is the asset side of the Federal Reserve (Fed) balance sheet. Notice that the size of the Fed’s balance sheet has grown from slightly over $900 billion before Lehman-AIG to approximately $3.2 trillion. The Fed continues to increase assets pursuant to its current policy.
 
Slide 2 is the liability side of the Fed’s balance sheet. The key to that slide is the green section labeled “Currency in Circulation,” which totals approximately $1 trillion. The red component is the excess reserves deposited at the Fed through the US banking system.
 
Slides 3 and 4 come from a 2013 special paper entitled “Crunch Time: Fiscal Crises in the Role of Monetary Policy,” by Greenlaw, Hamilton, Hooper, and Mishkin. We have used the slides that the writers placed in their paper. Those slides show the projected peaking of the Fed’s balance sheet at about $3.5 trillion and the gradual decline through 2020. The color codes match those of the slides we showed of the Fed’s current balance sheet, so viewers can track them more easily.
 
In slide 4, you can see that, according to the authors’ projections, by 2020 the Fed’s mortgage backed paper will also have shrunk. The Fed will have permitted the excess reserve liability to run off as it reduces the asset side. Thus slides three and four depict that in 2020 the Fed’s balance sheet size will be approximately $1.7 trillion. The holdings on the asset side will be Treasuries, and the liabilities will be currency in circulation. These are just projections that may or may not occur. The authors of the paper made assumptions on future Fed policy that would result in a successful exit strategy.
 
Slide 5 lays out some simple assumptions to help us project the answer to the question: When will the unemployment rate hit 6.5 percent?
 
Slide 6 is a table that was designed by Cumberland’s Chief Monetary Economist, Dr. Robert Eisenbeis. Dr. Eisenbeis used historical data in order to translate estimates of GDP growth into job-creation rates. The table projects job growth for both high- and low-confidence intervals.
 
Slide 7 shows how much time it would take for the unemployment rate to fall to 6.5 percent, depending on GDP growth rate (vertical axis) and certain baseline assumptions. The estimates range from 2015 to 2017.
 
Slide 8 shows the number of jobs the US economy needs to produce per month in order to hit a 6.5 percent unemployment rate. This too is an estimate based on a lot of assumptions.
 
Slide 9 shows the U3, U4, U5, and U6 unemployment rate measures and the definition of each. The Fed has selected the U3 unemployment rate for its 6.5 percent target. The parallel structure of these curves derives from the fact that these measures of unemployment are built one upon the next.
 
The results of disaggregating this data and drilling into it in detail are depicted in slide 10. Here the large green band shows the percentage of the labor force that is part-time workers who want full-time work. In other words, about four percent of the labor force consists of part-time workers who want full-time work and cannot find it. That is what is different about the current economic cycle, and this particular composition issue is not addressed by the Fed’s 6.5 percent target. Think about what this means. The labor force in the US comprises approximately 135 million people. Five to six million people fall into this category of part-time workers who cannot find full-time work. That is a huge overhang not addressed by the Fed’s policy of targeting 6.5 percent on the U3 measure of unemployment.
 
On slide 11 you see a Beveridge curve, named for economist William Beveridge. The curve tells you about the regime change that took place between the previous expansion, from December 2001 to November 2007 (shown in blue), and the present expansion (shown in green). The ’07-’09 recession is shown in red. The curve is created by taking the job vacancy rate and dividing it by the U3 unemployment rate.
 
Beveridge curves tell you a lot about expansions and recessions and how difficult it is for recovery to take place in the labor force. Clearly, the recession was a regime change, according to these Beveridge curve calculations. The U3 unemployment rate is used in the curves on this slide. When you use the U6 unemployment rate, which the Fed is not doing, you find that the regime shift was actually much greater.
 
Slide 12 tracks the Phillips curve, or inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and inflation rate. The concept was introduced to me by Thomas Synnott, a colleague at the National Business Economic Issues Council (NBEIC). Synnott uses the tracking system shown, with monthly data points. He describes it as an “under-damped oscillatory system.” The idea is to show the difference in shifts in duration, slope, and composition of the Phillips curve. One can see the pre-crisis levels in blue, the shift during the crisis in red, and the current green expansion period, through February 2013. The Fed’s target is marked with an “X.” Clearly there is a large gap between the current situation, in February 2013, and the Fed’s targets of 6.5 percent for the U3 unemployment rate and 2.5 percent for the inflation rate. Again, if we were to use the U6 in this curve instead of the U3, the gaps would be much more extreme.
 
Slide 13 lists the total assets of the major central banks. Those are the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and Swiss National Bank. We have added the Swiss National Bank since Switzerland now practices a policy maintaining a pegged floor in the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the euro. Essentially, these central banks started pre-crisis with about $3.5 trillion in total assets, in US dollar terms. Their assets now exceed $10 trillion and are growing. We have broken out the individual central banks for tracking purposes.
 
Slides 14 and 15 show the assets and liabilities of the European Central Bank. Slides 16 and 17 show the assets and liabilities of the Bank of England. Slides 18 and 19 show the assets and liabilities of the Swiss National Bank.
 
Slides 20 and 21 depict the assets and liabilities of the Bank of Japan. Note that Japan is the only major country that has experienced extraction from quantitative easing. That happened in 2006. At the time, the Japanese quarter-end extraction shocked world markets quite seriously. This is the only case in modern history where a large extraction at quarter-end occurred. We have noted it for both the assets side and liabilities side in slides 20 and 21.
 
The conclusion of our remarks in Dubai outlined the various factors that world markets and economies confront as this immense expansion of central bank balance sheets, along with massive liquidity injections, runs its course. We do not know how long this game of monetary quantitative easing will continue in the world. We do not know when it will stabilize. We do not know what will happen after that period, and we do not know how extraction will occur. What we do know is that world monetary affairs have never been in a situation like this before.

personalfinance,maximize your credit score by paying student loans in specific order,"So I had 6 student loans (3 subsidized, 3 subsidized) for undergrad.  My credit score (transunion estimate via credit karma) was 738 (the biggest ding being average age of credit (avg 36mo). 

I want to buy a house soon, so I was interested in getting my credit score pushed up just a bit. I figured the best thing I could do with the cash I had was to take a bit out of the loans.  Specifically, I paid 5k out of my 30k debt, and called them and had them reallocate the payment  to pay off the newest unsubsidized loan. Not only does this reduce my debt ratios, but it also reduces the open accounts with balances AND increases my average age of accounts. My scored jumped up to 752 with this one payment. 

Just thought this would be useful to someone else.

investing,$250k windfall. I want to invest in (buy 100%) an established business and run it full time. 18 month timeframe. What would you do?,"This might get long, sorry. Thanks in advance for reading all this, it's appricated.          

Background on the windfall. The company I work for was acquired by a larger company. I have founder's shares, and own 1.33% of the company which will net me around $250k after taxes. It will be 18 months until I have liquid access to the funds (long boring unimportant tax related story). Basically, I've won the ""wage slave lottery"".         

A short bit about me. I'm 30, married, we just had our first child this month. I own a home, owe ~$200k on the mortgage, which is just about what the house is worth. No other debt, or major assets for that mater. I earned ~$85k last year, however I was laid off due to the merger (I know right? Talk about a severance package...) but have lots of savings and I am currently taking time off to spend time with the newborn. I will be getting a job making $60k-$80k at some point in the near future. Not too concerend about the short term here, lets think long term.        

I've been seriously racking my brain on what I should do with the money. My goal is obviosuly to get the highest possible return with a level of risk I can tollerate. Not buying myself anything fancy. I want this money to do work for me.           

I could pay off my mortgage, but at current interest rates it's hardly the best use of the money. It would boost my monthly cashflow by $1000 if I didn't have a mortgage, and make life a lot easier. But I'd hardly get ""rich"" by living rent free.       

I know you guys are all about the markets, but building a diversified stock portfolio or putting it all into index funds isn't really my style. However you are more then welcome to convince me this is the way to go.     

I've considered *several* real-estate deals. Everything from flipping houses, buying up income generating rental units to getting a massive mortgage, buying an apartment building and being a slum lord. The property market here kinda sucks, at the top of a bubble and the best projections are that values will just keep up with inflation.    

My friends want me to start up a business. Because I'm good with comptuers they think I can be the next Facebook or something. It's not that easy. I tried the ""self employed comptuer guy"" route a decade ago and it was a total flop. As most of you know more than 50% of new small businesses fail within 5 years. Starting a new company is higher risk than I'm comfortable with. Might as well bet the money on black at the roulette table...   

I've considered franchises. I'm holding the disclosure statemet from the ""voted #1 franchise for 10 years"" guys in my hand right now. The numbers frankly *suck*. How would you like to spend $200k to open a restruant where you can work 70 hours a week for $60k a year in net profit? Oh, and they can take your franchise away with no renumeration if you don't meet their company standards 3 times during a random inspection. Sounds like a GREAT deal to me...    

Also with a franchise you are buying a known working business model, but not a known working *location* for that business model, which is really more than half the battle with a retail/restruant business.    

So I'm now leaning towards buying and running an already established company. My logic is that a company with an established business model, established customer base and established location, that has a verifiable net profit is a much safer investment. What's even better is that companies in this price range seem to be selling for ~1X their net revenue. So if I were to spend $200k on a business, keep $50k in reserve for operating expenses I would recouperate my initial investment in just over 1 year's time. The ROI here is just MASSIVE compared to other options I've considered. Even if I pay myself $80k per year I'm still basically doubling my money in 2 years. I think you would have to be willfully negligent to run a company that has been profitable, and in business for 5+ years into the ground before you got your money back out of it. Besides, I plan to increase the value of the business I buy, not destroy it.      

So I've set myself some ""rules"" for shopping for a company:  

1. Been in business more than 5 years    

2. Been profitable for at least 5 years    

3. Books that survive an audit, showing profit as advertised 

4. Access to the owner's tax returns for the length of time the business has been running    

5. Under $200k purchase price to leave me with a cushion to operate  

6. Net profit greater than or equal to 1x the cost of the business     

Now, I've already identified 2-3 business for sale that would meet this criteria in my local area. Obviously these will not be available after 18 months, but I am using them as a sort of ""case study"" on what will be available when I'm in a position to buy the business.    

One thing that I think I have going for me is rejecting the ""do what you love"" advice that people seem so quick to dish out. People open a bakery because they love to bake, or a book store because they love books and never stop to consider the *numbers* of their industry. I'd gladly run a toxic waste disposal facillty if the numbers were good enough. I want to make the most amount of money possible, so that I can retrire at 50 and then really start to ""do what I love"".     

Also I should mention that while I have a long standing love of business and economics, I have no formal training in either. I'd like to take a good business course, or at the very least read some excellent books over the next 18 months to prepare myself for this, so if you have any suggestions about learning to be a shrewed businessman I'm all ears. I'm currently reading The E-Myth Revisited.  

So there you go, I've laid all my cards on the table. Tell me I'm a fool. Cheer me on. Try to scam me? I'm here for your advice, both negative and positive.    

What would you do?

bradley associates financial solutions blog Hedge Funds Most Bearish Ever on Copper, Favor Gold: Commodities

Hedge funds are making the biggest bet against copper on record as global inventories expand to a nine-year high, while concern that Europe’s debt crisis will spread spurred the biggest gain in gold bets since 2008.

Speculators raised net-short positions in U.S. copper futures and options by 53 percent to 25,719 contracts in the week ended March 19, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data that begins in 2006. A jump in bullish bets on corn, gold and natural gas boosted overall holdings across 18 raw materials for a second consecutive week.

Copper prices are heading for a second consecutive monthly loss in what would be the longest slump since the end of 2011. Stockpiles monitored by exchanges in London, Shanghai andNew York stand at about 873,000 metric tons, or almost five months of North American demand, and Barclays Plc is forecasting a second annual surplus. Gold climbed for three weeks, the longest rally in six months, amid turmoil over Cyprus’s efforts to win a bailout to avert its financial collapse.

“We’re sitting on unprecedented stockpiles of copper and other metals,” said Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank in Chicago, which oversees about $66 billion of assets. “Demand has been pretty tepid for industrial metals. In the global economy, we’re seeing improving growth, but it’s still at a slow rate.”

Copper dropped 1.5 percent to $3.466 a pound on the Comex last week, the biggest retreat in a month. The Standard &amp; Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities fell 0.9 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities declined 1.1 percent and the dollar rose 0.1 percent against a basket of six major trading partners. Treasuries returned 0.4 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.

LME Stockpiles
Inventories of copper monitored by the London Metal Exchange jumped 77 percent this year to 565,350 tons, the highest since October 2003. Supplies tracked by the Shanghai Futures Exchange are at the highest since the data begins in January 2003. Chinese imports of the refined metal declined in February to the lowest in 19 months, while exports rose for a sixth month, government figures showed March 21.

Prices dropped along with most commodities last week as Cyprus neared the brink of financial collapse, reviving concern that Europe’s debt crisis will erode global growth. The continent accounts for 18 percent of copper demand, Barclays estimates. Overnight, Cyprus dodged a disorderly default and unprecedented exit from the euro currency by bowing to demands to shrink its banking system in exchange for a 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout.

Air Conditioners
Sales of air conditioners and orders for electrical equipment suggest improving demand inChina, Rachel Zhang, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said in a report last week. The nation’s passenger-vehicle market rose 20 percent to 2.84 million units in January and February in the strongest start since 2010. The transportation industry accounts for about 11 percent of the country’s copper use and household appliances 15 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.

“The risk appetite has certainly improved over the last several months,” said Nelson Louie, the global head of commodities at New York-based Credit Suisse Asset Management, who helps manage $11.3 billion. “The overall U.S. economy has shown resilience, and China seems to be improving as well.”

Investors withdrew a net $929 million from commodity funds in the week ended March 20, saidCameron Brandt, the director of research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based researcher EPFR Global, which tracks money flows. Gold and precious metals had an outflow of $978 million.

Gold Gains
Gold prices have risen 1.8 percent in March, heading for the first monthly gain since September. The metal is still down 4.1 percent this year as the U.S. unemployment rate fell and assets in exchange-traded products backed by gold dropped 6.7 percent. Investors increased their bullish bets by 63 percent to 70,193 contracts, the biggest expansion since September 2008.

The precious metal has jumped 81 percent since the end of 2008 as central bank measures intended to stimulate economic growth increased speculation that inflation will accelerate. TheFederal Reserve on March 20 left unchanged plans to hold its target interest rate near zero percent as long as U.S. unemployment remains above 6.5 percent. The jobless rate last month was 7.7 percent.

Money managers increased their bullish bets on natural gas to 46,148 contracts, from 2,995 a week earlier, the CFTC data show. Oil wagers climbed 3.2 percent to 172,268 contracts, and those for gasoline rose 1.4 percent to 77,801 contracts. Natural gas advanced 18 percent this year as production gains slowed and cold weather bolstered heating demand.

Farm Bets
A measure of speculative positions across 11 agricultural products from wheat to coffee to cattle increased 9.1 percent to 265,475 contracts, the highest since Feb. 12.

Wagers on higher corn prices increased 66 percent to 145,535 contracts, the biggest gain since July 2010. Speculators reduced their negative outlook for wheat to 33,457 contracts from a net-short position of 41,519 a week earlier.

Corn stockpiles before the next harvest will fall to 632 million bushels, the lowest since 1996, theU.S. Department of Agriculture said March 8. The agency raised its forecast for use of the grain in animal feed by 2.2 percent to 4.55 million bushels. Soybean inventories may drop to the lowest since 2004.

“Prices are going to be driven by supply-and-demand considerations and technical factors for each commodity,” said Walter ‘Bucky’ Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion of assets at BB&amp;T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “Crop inventories are creating support in prices for corn. The copper flows show there are still doubts about global growth.”

personalfinance,Financial Independence and Mortgages,"Here is my situation. I am 30 years old. I am currently working a job that brings in around 190k a year. I own a house that was appraised at 350k. I have mortgage debt of ~220k. I have no other debt. 20k liquid. 50k in IRA accounts.

I write software, I love what I do, but I want to work for myself. I want to write random phone/web apps and see if I can make a living that way. Or join a low/no pay start up. Basically just the freedom to take any job I want.

I believe the best way to do this is to reduce my expenses. My biggest expense by far is my mortgage. I just refinanced 220k at 2.7% over 15 years which puts me at ~2100 a month after tax + ins. I estimate I could live a frugal for me lifestyle with no mortgage at 2k a month. I could take a short term contract job, and then do my own thing. (Then repeat this cycle until I either ""make it"" or get sick of it)

So that is a really long way to ask. How would you achieve this goal? Would you pay extra on the loan each month? Or save the cash and try and beat the interest rate somehow until you get enough to pay it off?

Or something else I'm not thinking of?

personalfinance,The 20% Down Rule,"My husband and I are in the very beginning stages of considering purchasing a home near the end of this year (when our current lease is up).  The only caveat is we won't have 20% down saved by this time.  We have a fairly high household income, but that's only been the case since the beginning of this year, hence the smaller than ideal down payment. We'd likely be looking at something closer to 8% to 10% range.

My question is, while 20% down seems to be the consistent recommendation from r/pf, would rising interest rates over the next few years make it reasonable to buy a home now knowing we could lock down a low rate and would be in a place to pay off the mortgage up to 20% fairly quickly to minimize the hit we'd take from PMI? Or would PMI be so high that it's not worth it to put down anything less than 20%?

personalfinance,Borrowing from 401k to buy a home (gasp)... hear me out !,"Evening Reddit !  I have been lurking for a few weeks now and I am involved in some financial dealings so I wanted to get some feedback on where my decision sits in the realm of being a sound decision.  Sorry for the text wave.

First of all let me start out by saying I agree that 401k monies should not be touched until 59 1/2 years old, if needed and if enough to retire - in mostly all scenarios.  I see way too many co-workers in my age group withdrawing from their 401k, paying penalties for the sake of reducing car payments, piled up debt, or simply to have cash on hand.  That is a dark magic that I do not practice in.  I am involved in my 401k and my investments every other week drilling down to what my returns are and what is in the portfolio that makes up the investments and where I should be based on the economy and market trends etc, etc.  I like to consider myself well educated with my finances but no expert by any means.  So let’s get to it.

I am 30 years old with 106k in my 401k.  I've been contributing with every employer I've ever had since I was 16 and always up to the amount the company would match.  My current income is anywhere from 88k to 105k per year.  Quite a variation, but such is life when half of your income is dependent on commission pay.  Not all that much money when commission is taxed at 38% fyi.  I am now choosing to borrow from my 401k for a home purchase for my family (Girlfriend and 21 month old along for the ride) Here is why and I would like some thoughts!

* Current Rent - $1,530 per month 
* Heat/Hot water included
* Electric Bill various from $80 in winter to $250 summer (air conditioners running)

Renting, anything, is my worst nightmare come true.  Throwing money into something that you have no equity in and will never own over long periods of time is insane.  My credit is very good and the apartment exists only because I moved out of the nest at 23.  

So I think that covers most of the background.  Now having moved out at age 23 , paid for my own community college, my own cars , basically on my own since 21 due to an old school treatment from my parents that - this is reality, get used to it.  


I currently have about 10k in savings, and I have about 18k in CC debt that is currently no interest until 2014 thanks to some no interest finance offers and 9k in a car loan.  My GF does not work currently but I won’t factor in her debts.  

Why I'm taking the 401k route.  Just like in sales, timing is everything.  The housing market is at the end of its buyers prime and the time to buy is closing fast.  Interest rates are rising, house prices are rising, home sales are up, property is selling at a fantastic rate, which basically means the bubble we rode down to rock bottom is finally turning around. I was approved at a 3.75 mortgage rate with a 30 year fixed mortgage.  Literally one week prior, mortgage rates were 3.52, not breaking the bank but still an increase week over week that eventually will point to rates at about 6% 4 to 6 months from now.  

I submit my closing argument.  I expect to be in a different position within 6 months in my company - more than likely taking a pay cut.  I have been in my current role for 5 years, which is why I was approved for up to 300k mortgage even though half my money is at risk dollars, which they do not factor in to your total income if less than 3 years.  The home we are moving forward with purchasing was 325k, 9 months ago, now it is at 265k.  We have been looking for a month and found a great home.  If I were to wait until I built up enough money to put down towards this house without 401k assistance, let’s say 1 year from now, we are looking at a very different landscape from a buying perspective.   Not to mention this home will be at least 60k higher due to the growing home market.

At 35 years old, I should have my yearly income saved in my 401k.  Also, I could have received thousands of dollars more back on my tax return if I were a property owner and first time home buyer.  I am only making this decision based on the fact that I believe I am ahead of the game vs. my age in my 401k and by the time I am 35 I will still be above my yearly income.

In closing, I will tell you that I have made some poor decisions with my finances without looking to my long term life, involving gambling and splurging and partying- but I also wouldnt change a damn thing !

personalfinance,Budgeting for those who can't budget? (CA),"So.... I'm at a point where I make enough to be comfortable and can afford most things I want (or can I??!) I use Mint to track all my accounts, but I find it hard actually implementing a budget because I know when it comes to tracking every cent I spend, I don't have the patience for that. Maybe that's a cop-out, but it's true.

My current financial situation is.... I'll try to be really good and not buy *anything*, and then I'll have some money left over at the end of the month, but during that time maybe I'm effectively just deferring spending, so this is usually followed by a period of heavy spending, somewhat due to things I put off but also somewhat due to being ""fed up"" and wanting to spend money. So then I'll rack up my credit card again, and spend the next while trying to pay it off, until I get a windfall of some sort like a gift or tax return, or I'll return to ""trying to be good and not spending anything"" so it's definitely cyclical. I don't feel like I'm in debt because I can usually pay my credit card off each month, but I feel like I make enough that I could be saving a lot and I'm usually just breaking even.

I want to be able to follow something like 50/30/20, but what does this look like in practice? How do I decide whether I buy something and whether I can afford it or not? I also have problems categorizing expenses... (what is a need and what is a want?) I feel like I'm always looking at my spending in retrospect, and the solution seems easy enough, but actually putting it into practice is confusing for me. I want something that works without being burdened with thinking about money all the time? I have tried to implement budgets in the past, and while I have no problem ""tracking"" things, I have difficulty looking into the future and knowing how much I can spend, or planning how to spend money I guess. Mint tracks automatically, but when I didn't have it, I would eventually give up tracking because it felt pointless to me.

I wouldn't say I'm an impulse buyer, but I buy things because I think I can afford them and maybe that's not the case. And a bunch of small things you think you can afford, turns into a bigger situation that maybe you can't afford. 

edit: I get paid biweekly, and paycheque 1) usually goes to rent and bills 2) usually goes to paying my credit card. Then, I try to estimate my ""needs"" until my next paycheque, and if there's anything left over from either of those it goes to a) further paying off my credit card or b) savings.",finance,1364500713

Currently Bitcoin is legal to use, however “miners” have to register as Money Transfer Businesses by applying for a government license. Since the original announcement from FinCEN no miners have coughed up the necessary funds or even applied for a license, and as a result FinCENs stance on Bitcoin has changed for the worse.

As of May 1st, participating in the exchange of US dollars into Bitcoin will be in breach of the bank secrecy act and liable for prosecution.

This is bad news for any Americans that are currently in possession of Bitcoin since converting it back into US dollars is effectively illegal.

investing,Agriculture Boom Sparks South American Phosphate Development,"By James Wellstead - Exclusive to [Potash Investing News](http://potashinvestingnews.com/7300-agriculture-boom-sparks-south-american-phosphate-development.html)

News of growing delays in the transport of corn and soybeans during Brazil’s mid-season harvest paint a portrait of a South American agricultural powerhouse struggling to keep up with its own sky-rocketing production.

Bloomberg reported this week that a line of trucks 15 miles long to the country’s busiest port, where a total of 212 vessels await a soybean crop that will vault the nation beyond the US as the world’s largest exporter of the bean.

The reports of logistical and infrastructure challenges in getting record soybean and corn crops to markets speak to the level of agricultural expansion, and the challenge to meet crop’s phosphate fertilizer requirement.

Total revenue from soybeans in Brazil is projected to grow by 30.5 percent this year to R$90 billion (nearly US$47 billion) thanks to higher soybean prices than in 2012, the National Confederation of Brazilian Agriculture said last month.

Rising crop prices have also sparked phosphate producers to try and bring long term, sustainable local phosphate resources to South American markets that currently rely heavily on fertilizers that are produced on other continents.

Domestic and regional supply of both phosphate and potash in South America is minimal relative to demand, with Brazil acquiring 90 percent of its potash and 50 percent of its phosphate via exports.

The appetite and ability to bring the region’s 1 billion tonnes of phosphate rock reserves into production has grown in recent years, with efforts in Brazil being some of the most advanced.

Brazil leads phosphate growth

Fertilizer giant Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) has a strong and growing presence in the region, with its wholly-owned Brazilian opeartions at Cubatao produces single super phosphate (SSP) and grannular fertilizer production and partial ownership of operations in Peru as well.

Brazilian mining giant Vale (NYSE:VALE) is currently the largest phosphate producer in Brazil, most notably growing its presence with its acquisition of 79 percent of the leading Brazilian fertilizer producer Fosfertil back in 2010. At the time the Fosfertil acquisition included a production capacity about 3.4 million metric tonnes per year from three mines. Combined proven and probable reserves are estimated at 1.19 billion mt grading 8.4 percent P2O5.

More recently junior miners have seen growing interest as foreign and local fertilizer producers, and mining companies, search for assets within the country.

Just this month, Brazilian phosphate and potash producer Rio Verde Minerals Development (TSX:RVD) announced its shareholders had approved the proposed merger with private Brazilian fertilizer company B&amp;A Fertilizer Limited, a subsidiary of B&amp;A Mineração SA. The deal transfered ownership of a portfolio of phosphate projects to B&amp;A, concentrated in the North and Northeastern regions of Brazil, including the Bonito phosphate project.

MBAC Fertilizer (TSX:MBC) is also developing phosphate projects in Brazil, focused primarily on expanding its Itafos phosphate project after acquiring the asset in 2008. MBAC intends on re-starting production at the site in the first quarter of this year, which includes a new mine and mill facility, a sulfuric acid plant, an SSP plant and a granulation plant. At full capacity, the proposed beneficiation plant is expected to generate 330,000 tonnes per year of phosphate rock concentrate at 28 percent P2O5, a production level that could expand in 2016.

Phosphate across the continent

Outside of Brazil, phosphate rock resources are also present in a number of countries, including production and processing operations in Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.

Colombia is home to the region’s largest reserves, with approximately 346 million tonnes of phosphate rock, while Peru and Venezuela follow closely with 247 million tonnes and 105 million tonnes respectively.

Peru has been a key source of production in the region, with Vale (now also partly owned by Mosaic and a private Peruvian company Miski Mayo SAC) operating its Bayóvar mine since 2010. Located on one of the largest phosphate rock deposits in South America, production levels are capable of reaching 3.9 million metric tonnes per year. Bayóvar represents one of the biggest projects on the continent and has sights on expanding by as much as 50 percent by 2014.

Others juniors operating in this area include Stonegate Agricom’s (TSX:ST) Mantaro phosphate project 250 kilometers east of Lima, Peru which has identified measured and indicated resources of 39.5 Mt at 10 percent P2O5 and inferred resources of 376.3 Mt at 9 percent P2O5.

Focus Ventures (TSXV:FCV) has also targeted the same region as Stonegate in their Machay phosphate project in central Peru, building off of the Aramachay formation within the region.

The Strategic Materials Advisory Council, an American lobby group, has cautioned the country’s Department of Defense (DoD) against stockpiling strategic and critical materials from China, calling the idea a “risky mitigation strategy.”

The warning comes in the wake of the completion of the DoD’s biannual Strategic and Critical Materials 2013 Report on Stockpile Requirements, which recommends stockpiling $120.43 million worth of heavy rare earth elements (HREEs).

“The root cause of these material shortages is our ongoing dependence on Chinese suppliers,” said the Council’s executive director, Jeff Green. “While it is encouraging that DoD acknowledges these risks, we urge DoD to move from theoretical studies to the only appropriate and permanent solution — the creation and nurturing of a U.S. based rare earth supply chain.”

The DoD’s rare earth stockpile recommendation accounts for more than one-third of a $319.74-million stockpiling plan aimed at mitigating a $1.2-billion shortfall of 23 strategic and critical materials, according to the Council. The Council also noted that the recommendation contrasts dramatically with previous DoD assessments stating that domestic sources could meet all military requirements by 2013, except for yttrium, and that substitution would be a viable approach to risk mitigation for HREEs.

“It is equally encouraging that the Department is acknowledging the increased acquisition cost and engineering challenges posed by substitution strategies. However the U.S. must not rely on research projects and substitution alone to close the current supply gap,” said Green.

Lynas on the move

Shares of Australia’s Lynas Corporation (ASX:LYC) rose after the company confirmed that a Malaysian court has dismissed protesters’ challenge against its long-delayed rare earth processing plant.

The $800-million rare earth facility finally began production in November last year following lengthy environmental and safety disputes with local residents and the Save Malaysia Stop Lynas (SMSL) protest group. Lynas said the Federal Court has dismissed SMSL’s appeal to seek a judicial review of the decision to grant Lynas a temporary operating license.

“SMSL has now exhausted all avenues of appeal in the Malaysian Courts with respect to this challenge,” Lynas said in a statement.

Shares of the company rose to a high of AU$0.61 following the announcement, half the level it was 12 months ago.

China’s REE export numbers rise in February

China’s exports of rare earth primary materials increased by 289.12 percent in February, to 1,106 metric tons (MT), compared with the same month in 2012; prices continue to drop month-on-month.

An industry analyst told Metal-Pages that China’s exports of rare earths increased sharply in February because the country exported only 284 MT in the same period last year and was assisted when prices continued to fall throughout the month, which in turn encouraged buyers to restock.

The average price for rare earths in February was $22,650 per MT, down 11.32 percent compared with $25,540 per MT in January.

“Exports increased due to low prices. Many consumers will restock before March when sales are stronger. In addition, many consumers restarted production after the Chinese New Year in February,” the analyst added.

Market round-up

China’s rare earth prices have continued to weaken, with little business reported on the spot market and producers unwilling to sell product at lower prices due to high production costs. Prices for light rare earths and some heavies, such as dysprosium and gadolinium are unchanged, while prices for rare earths of fluorescent powder, such as europium, terbium and yttrium, have edged down slightly.

Reports from Metal-Pages note that market participants remain bearish on the future of rare earths and are expecting prices to decline in the short term, with supply outweighing limited demand from downstream industries.

Traders confirmed that 99-percent praseodymium-neodymium metal is being offered at $61,984 per MT, while the Chinese 99-percent praseodymium oxide market remains quiet due to weak demand. Current prices for dysprosium oxide 99 percent are unchanged at $322 per kilogram, while prices for ferrodysprosium are still at $338 per kilogram, according to Metal-Pages.

China’s terbium oxide market has been described as flat with sporadic trading in the spot market. Industry sources state prices are likely to fall slightly in the near term given lackluster demand from the downstream fluorescent powder industry. Current prices for terbium oxide 99 percent are at $603 per kilogram.

The 99-percent cerium oxide market is sluggish due to weak demand, with most suppliers putting 99-percent cerium oxide prices at $5,956 per MT.

Company news

Search Minerals (TSXV:SMY) announced a revised preliminary economic assessment (PEA) for its Foxtrot REE project in Labrador, Canada.

Highlights include a reduction in capital costs to $221 million from $469 million, with a 3.8-year payback period. Further, net revenue has increased $110 per MT milled and opex costs have increased $38 per MT. The revised project will focus on higher-grade REE material mined over life of mine of 0.89-percent total REE (TREE) on average, which compares to the 0.58-percent TREE on average for the original bulk open-pit concept.

The updated PEA scenario also allows for a smaller environmental footprint (smaller open pit, smaller waste dump and smaller tailings pond) and good potential for an extended mine life.

Frontier Rare Earths (TSX:FRO) announced that the preliminary feasibility study (PFS) at its Zandkopsdrift REE project in South Africa is nearing completion.

With preparation of the PFS now at a very advanced stage, planning has commenced for the definitive feasibility study (DFS) on Zandkopsdrift. That will begin immediately after the PFS and is expected to take 12 months to complete. Frontier is fully funded to complete the PFS and DFS on Zandkopsdrift from its existing cash resources. Along with its strategic partner, Korea Resources, Frontier intends to commence production in 2016, with a target production capacity of 20,000 MT of separated rare earth oxides per annum.

Matamec Explorations (TSXV:MAT) received C$1.041 million from Toyotsu Rare Earth Canada, a subsidiary of Toyota Tsusho (TSE:8015), in support of the Kipawa mine project, which will supply Toyota with HREEs for hybrid and electric vehicles.

To date, Matamec has received C$14,236,608 of the maximum C$16 million for the completion of a DFS on the Kipawa HREE deposit, which is on budget and on track for completion by the end of the second quarter of 2013.

Matamec’s president and CEO, Andre Gauthier, said: “[t]he financial support that Matamec has received from Toyotsu is a clear indication to the market the progress which has been achieved in the completion of the feasibility study.”

With the $2500 card though it is my oldest.  It's been open for over 5 years at this point.

So is it better to close the card completely if I can't get the interest rate down (and open a new card at a lower rate), shrink the credit line down to say $500 or $1000 and open another card, or just keep it open at $2500 and not use it?

Bitcoin,What would kill Bitcoin?,"Hello bitcoiners,

I want to start by saying I'm very pro-private currencies.  In fact, I wrote an article about bitcoin back in May 2011, as well as a chapter in my book on designing private currencies, and I have been a fan ever since.

What I'd like to explore now is a way to undo the confirmation bias I have seen on this subreddit for the last few months.

So, my question is simply: what would kill bitcoin?

For example, would the Fed creating its own virtual gold-backed and fully legal tender currency kill bitcoin?  

Would another country's with a higher degree of freedom doing something similar kill bitcoin?  

What would it take for another cryptocurrency, like LiteCoin, to kill bitcoin?  Is it, for example a faster exchange than we've seen from Mtgox et al.?",cryptocurrency,1364439311

Aber eine kürzliche beiderseits Umstrukturierung Einwanderungsgesetze und eine Flut von Regierung hacken Fällen haben die Dinge erneuert gerückt.

Die Europäische Kommission hat noch nicht mit ihrer ähnlichen Untersuchung auf Suche Voreingenommenheit zu wiegen und härtere Position einnehmen kann.
Kurz nach der Entscheidung kündigte FTC Vorsitzender Jon Leibowitz seiner Abreise. Und er war nicht der einzige Administrator bereit zu gehen.

Kongress muss jetzt die Lücken ausfüllen. Unternehmen und Behörden, zum Beispiel erfordern ein neues Gesetz, bevor sie Daten über aufkommende Cyberthreats austauschen. Und da die parteipolitische Unterschiede, die die Rechnung letzte Sitzung vereitelt, neue Bemühungen eine langwierige Gesetzgebungsverfahren führen könnte.
Präsident Barack Obama hat Einwanderung ein weiteres zentrales Thema für die Verwaltung gemacht.

Bitcoin,How many times would the price of bitcoin have to double to reach the $1 trillion market cap of the US dollar?,"Bitcoin just passed $1b market cap and is now hovering slightly below it, gathering strength for the next price surge no doubt.

Just for fun, let's do a quick thought experiment on long-term potential, and ask how many times would the price of bitcoin have to double in order to match the market cap of just physical dollars out there in the US, not even counting credit and loans and the like.

According to the [Federal Reserve](http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12773.htm):

&gt; ""There was approximately $1.18 trillion in circulation as of March 20, 2013, of which $1.13 trillion was in Federal Reserve notes.""

At today's current price of $88, and $1b market cap, let's see what the price reaches should bitcoin one day hit $1 trillion in market cap.

First, how many times do we have to double the market cap to reach $1 trillion. Well $1 billion is a thousand times less than $1 trillion, so let's double the market cap till we get there:

0. $1 b (initial value)

1. $2 b (once doubled)

2. $4 b (twice doubled...)

3. $8 b 

4. $16 b

5. $32 b

6. $64 b

7. $128 b

8. $256 b

9. $512 b

10. $1,024 billion or $1 trillion+

So, ten doubling periods. Holding the number of bitcoin constant at ~11 million, and also holding inflation of the USD at 0%, let's now double the current price 10 times and see what the price of bitcoin would have to be if it replaced the dollar in the US economy:

0. $88 doubles to...

1. $176 (one doubling period complete)

2. $352

3. $704

4. $1,408

5. $2,816

6. $5,632

7. $11,264

8. $22,528

9. $45,056

10. $90,112 (10th doubling)

Per bitcoin. Sound unbelievable? Well, it is. We have to factor in the increase in the number of bitcoin over the next several years.

In the next four years, 5 million new bitcoin will be mined, putting us at 16 million, then about 2 million more during the four years after that, leaving us with 18 million bitcoin. At 16 million btc, the $1t market cap figure leaves us with a final price of $62,500 per bitcoin. The 18m figure puts us at $55,555 per.

And if you figure in inflation, this figure will be higher, possibly much higher if you assume mild to high inflation in the near future (though the purchasing power of bitcoin will not be impacted by dollar inflation).

If you thought that projection was nuts, here's a figure that should scare you completely. The world supply of currency, valued in dollars, is 60 times the $1 trillion US dollar figure! (that's 6 more doubling periods!) Some $60 trillion dollars are needed, every year, worldwide, to serve the entire world economy. I'm not even gonna do the math on that (mebbe someone else will). But if the *world* adopts bitcoin rather than just the US, $55k per bitcoin will look like a paltry sum in comparison.

I expect some people will immediately scoff at projections like this. Call me a wild-eyed fanatic, say it's impossible, it'll never happen, fine! I have only sketched out a plausible scenario, not said with what likelihood this is going to happen! I make no guarantees about price or where it will go! I just say that if the whole world chose bitcoin, here's what the price goes to.

One thing I do know: This ride has just begun. And now you've had a peek at *how deep the rabbit hole goes.*",cryptocurrency,1364595843

________________

Yesterday the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled “Web Money Gets Laundering Rule,” an article framed in typical central bank newspeak warning of money laundering and growing “concerns” that new forms of cash bought on the Internet might be used to fund illicit activities. [1]

This concern for possible laundering and illicit activities is banker newspeak indicating that banksters are really concerned about the possibility people might be able to escape the global web of banking activity spying and find a way out of debt slavery caused by central bank controlled currencies.

Furthermore the bankers worry bitcoin [2], the virtual currency in question, might actually provide a way to independently and objectively value banker currencies in terms of purchasing power - not just relative values between managed banker currencies, which have no tight correlation with purchasing power. And, a derivative of providing an objective measure of cartel-controlled currency purchasing power is that wealth can be transferred into bitcoin, where its purchasing power can remain reasonably stable. In fact, if bitcoin survives, the purchasing power of bitcoins will rise over time.

If bitcoin does indicate a relationship between its own value and purchasing power relative to banker currency, it will start a mass exodus into the new currency as people try to find a way to protect their assets and wealth from contrived currency devaluation.

Part of the problem with measuring banker currency relative values, is that even while objective value (purchasing power) of all banker currencies is being destroyed, the relative values still maintain the illusion of worth. Historically, gold and silver represented a fungible, transportable, private, and no counter-party risk money, whose price provided objective values of a banker currency’s purchasing power. The banking cartels learned how to suppress the price of gold and silver with massive manipulation to support the illusion that paper currencies, especially those issued as debt, are maintaining purchasing power. Bitcoin, until recently a fledgling new alternative currency, has stepped up to its fate and destiny, as the giant eye of Sauron has taken notice and doesn’t like what it sees.

Recent currency events in Argentina and Cyprus have given wind to the sail of bitcoin and its possible destiny of fulfilling its original intention of providing private, stable, accessible, outside the banking cartel system, currency.

Coincident with Argentinian peso’s smooth straight line fall against the dollar beginning in 2010, bitcoin became fully operational that year with prices as low as 6 cents per BTC (a single bitcoin). Over that same period the Argentinian peso has fallen from approximately 0.26 cents to 0.19 cents against the USD, a drop of 27%, while the value of bitcoin has risen from 6 cents to $73 (this morning's rounding of last purchase price) or a gain of 121,566 %. Both of these comparisons are against the dollar. But one of the many benefits of bitcoin is, unlike gold and silver, which are overwhelmingly rigged to maintain the illusion of dollar strength, the bitcoin is not rigged. So, in a world of total financial deception, there exists a tiny light of truth because bitcoin can be used as an objective value for cartel currency purchasing power (with proper scaling). We can get objective purchasing power values because purchases of bitcoin represent the selling of national banker currencies for bitcoin; more specifically it represents a loss of confidence in the banker currencies and can be thought of as selling the banking system for bitcoin.

I could not find a bitcoin exchange located in Argentina, so a direct expression of the value of bitcoin in terms of the Argentine peso is not available, but looking at neighboring Brazil, since January 23, 2013, the value of bitcoins versus the BRL has increased from 48 BRL to 180 BRL, an increase of 275%. During that period, the BRL appreciated against the ARS by only 4.4% and the BRL against the dollar just 1.84 %. Therefore, it is safe to say: bitcoin is providing independent and objective valuations of the currencies in which it can be exchanged. It’s clear bitcoin is gaining value against the BRL far faster than the BRL against other national banker currencies; and the same we can assume would hold true for bitcoins purchased by Argentinians if bitcoin had an exchange in ARS.In fact, a quick survey of BTC against BTC exchange available banker currencies, indicates the BTC rising against all published exchanges (banker currencies), signaling an overall devaluation in purchasing power in banker currencies as compared to bitcoin (as would be the intuitive expectation for gold and silver, but those currencies are being pushed even lower.)

Argentina again slips into the tyranny of capital controls, banking ‘holidays’ and deepening depression, while banksters fronting for the IMF remain in control of Argentina’s wealth, progress, and value of their national banker currency. It’s clear that alternative currencies including gold, silver and bitcoin are the most efficient and best way to protect financial assets from ravishment of bankster financial fraud.

The Argentine peso is falling in value against other world banker currencies; and, as of today, the peso is into record lows as measured against the world’s most rigged fiat currency, the USD. The outlook for Argentinians is bleak as a corrupt government thrashes and gasps for cash to make payments to their foreign banker masters.

Escalating bank insolvency and banker-engineered panic and possible total collapse of the Cyprus financial system is another example just right for testing bitcoin. Turning remaining bankster currency, pieces of paper with goofy pictures on them, into gold and silver and bitcoin is a way around destruction and the gates erected by a one-corrupt-banking model against protecting wealth.

Bitcoin is a better way to measure objective values of banker currencies than the price of gold and silver because the world’s colluding central banks are rigging gold and silver prices with naked shorting and interest rate derivatives that include mandatory and periodic US bond purchases, artificially holding up the value of the USD while suppressing price discovery of banker currencies relative to gold and silver.

The new bitcoin and its noble attempt to provide a limited issue, finely divisible, internationally acceptable, private currency is now facing its first volley of attack from the predatory alchemists of an ancient money scam - the IMF directed world banking cartels. According to the Wall Street Journal article,

The arm of the Treasury Department that fights money laundering said Monday that the standard federal banking rules aimed at suspicious dollar transfers also apply to firms that issue or exchange money that isn't linked to any government and exists only online.” [1] 

I will not go into the fact that the USD is almost entirely a virtual currency with billions of dollars of laundered drug money and tax payer money laundered through the IRS tax system each year. [3][4]

For centuries bankers have used ancient secrets of turning absolutely nothing into gold; the scam of using your promise to pay as money and then lending it back to you as currency at interest. This system is guaranteed to siphon all the wealth of those forced into its use -- slowly at first, and then, by design, faster and faster, ending in a debt spiral to collapse. Over the course of paying back your ‘loan’, which is really your own money to begin with, it becomes necessary to generate extra money to pay the interest on the loan; this action causes the entire financial system to increase the amount of money in the system via loans. New loans include more interest payments and the money supply has to grow again. The long-term effect of even small compounding interest rates is that over the course of a loan (typical home loan time periods), multiple times the loaned amount must be paid back, which results in destructive growth of the money supply and increasingly larger and larger total interest due. The end comes as escalating debt is created to make interest payments, but not before real wealth is streamed away as interest payments to the banking system. It remains to be seen what will become of bitcoin; facing now its first encounter with fate as bankers take notice and create the propaganda for their first attack. Right now at $73 dollars per bitcoin and daily transactions measured at just under 2 million BTC or $140 Million, bitcoin is just a little blip on the screen, but the growth rate is electrifying and the possibilities are interesting.

Bitcoin priced in dollars has changed by three orders of magnitude since its beginnings. If this continues, soon we will see hundreds of millions of BTC and tens of billions of dollars involved with daily transactions. At those levels, the establishment banking monstrosity would surely bring heavy guns into play.

Bitcoin is not money in the sense that it is not fully portable (requires technology to present itself) and relies heavily on the Internet being available and has no intrinsic value of its own. But as Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy and many others have found out, it’s not necessary for an honest and stable currency to have intrinsic value, only that it be easily divisible and issuance maintained in correct proportion to the size of the physical (real) market of products and services. Bitcoin will eventually stop issuing coins at somewhere near 21 million coins and thereafter the currency can never experience hyperinflation via over creation; and, as a side benefit, long term, bitcoins will become more valuable as the price of goods will go down when priced in BTC, meaning this currency should create long-term deflation in prices, something we can all appreciate.

I have been studying and using the bitcoin system for a few weeks now and I sense the infrastructure struggling with the sudden accelerating growth. It would be in humanity’s best interest for a competing, private, limited, stable valued currency to exist, survive and grow and become strong enough to withstand escalating attacks from the banking cartels. The ancient banking families and their paper slavery has to end for humanity to ever be free. By purchasing gold and silver and bitcoins we are taking a step toward the end of banker slavery.

Economics,Basic 'Inflation' and 'US Dollar Value' from an economics student (copied and paraphrased from comments in /r/POLITIC)(self.economics),"Just some points I raised in a conversation i'm having in /r/POLITIC. (http://www.reddit.com/r/POLITIC/comments/1b8d02/no_the_dollar_did_not_really_lose_95_of_its_value/). I feel that spreading some economics knowledge could be beneficial given current debate. Not a professional economist yet though so hopefully i'm not breaking any rules and feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken.

Where does a currency, such as the US dollar, derive its value you ask. Well it's simple; the Federal Reserve Bank produced X amount of notes and coins to reflect Y amount of goods. If at a later point in time they print out more notes (Z), (as has occurred time and time again), X+Z will now reflect Y amount of goods. In other words, you now need Z number of extra dollars to buy the same amount (Y), of goods. This is known as currency depreciation (not to be mistaken for a similar depreciation that is associated with the exchange rate). How it works is when the supply of a currency increases (such as the addition of Z), price levels adjust accordingly; as in they will increase to cover the difference. This is known as inflation and results in X no longer sufficient for affording Y. It has nothing to do, whatsoever, with income levels, production, or debt.

When Y (output/production) increases, such as Y+K, X+Z will in theory reflect a greater number of goods. However, this is only ever achieved when the price falls to counter the increased demand for the dollar, ie. deflation. As this has not occurred to any significant degree in the last 40 years, it is safe to say that X+Z does not reflect Y+K, still only Y amount of goods. It is furthermore safe to say the currency (the US dollar in this case) has lost its value as a result.

The difference K, although making an economy more wealthy, is not affordable within the original paradigm; without deflation a shift in other economic factors will have to take place. In theory there will be an increase in the velocity (rate of transfer between people and other economic entities) and consumption, while suffering a fall in savings. However the economy is overall less stable and at greater risk of market failure, recessions, etc. Especially when these other factors fail to adjust and create income/wealth inequality.

personalfinance,Student Loans - to refinance or not to refinance?,"The relevant details:

I have roughly $40k in 6.8% Stafford Loans from law school.

I work in a big law firm in NYC, so I have a lot of random expenses, but I've managed to knock out a third of my total loans (I started at around $65k in Stafford Loans) in the past year and a half.

I will max out my 401(k) contributions for the year, as it seems to me that the up-front benefit from tax deferral (28% federal plus 10% state+local = total 38%) on the money is just too ridiculous of a first-year return NOT to max it out. But that's neither here nor there. The point is that, if I really needed to, I could unhook that cashflow from my 401(k) and point it at my student loans.

**The Question:** I feel like 6.8% is higher than I should be paying on my student loans, given that my income, credit history, etc should all make clear to the bank that I'm effectively a zero risk of default. I want a piece of that 2-3 grand that I'm currently leaving on the table by paying 6.8%. i.e., I'd like to refinance the loans to get a lower rate. Can anyone recommend a bank that would do this? Will the rate be sufficiently lower to make it worth the time and hassle?",finance,1364586928

personalfinance,Retirement account options for self-employed,"I am the sole member of a single-member LLC, and I'm looking for good options on retirement accounts.  Pertinent information:

* I'm taxed federally as an individual (pass-through, not an S-Corp).
* My business is a law practice, so I do not issue or receive 1099's.
* I do not have any employees, although it's possible I would hire a part-time assistant/paralegal in the next few years.

Reading various websites, it appears the basic options are

* SIMPLE IRA
* SEP-IRA
* Individual 401(k)

From what I've read, it appears that the Individual 401(k) plan is most suited to my needs, especially considering I can contribute to it both as an employee and an employer, and the contributions are deductible as business expenses.

I'm wondering if any other PFers have any experience with this, and what others would recommend?

**Edit:** I meant to include that I'm looking for something relatively simple, and also looking for options on *where* to house the account.  I'm not interested in day-trading or being very active at all with the management, so from what I can tell, setting one up through TD Ameritrade wouldn't be a great option because it costs $9.99 for each transaction.  On the other hand, setting something up through Vanguard and buying index funds seems prudent (and, of course, a /r/personalfinance favorite), but the cost per year is $20 per fund held in the account.",finance,1364581213

electronics,This is the real reason why Best Buy is putting Amazon out of business....,"I'm not one to make posts but was so fed up with Best Buy today that I actually created an account to post!

Went in to the store last week to get a TV, gave them my home address and scheduled delivery for today.  Was told I'd get a call the day before to confirm address and time, got the call and confirmed for delivery from 8-10am.  Took off from work, got a call around 945 saying the delivery truck was outside - at the wrong address!!

Was on the phone with the warehouse rep and her manager for 25 minutes, then the store and it's manager for another half hour.  Both claim the other needs to change something in the system, neither can do anything about it.

Bottom line - despite Best Buy getting my address wrong (they can't explain how it happened) and Best Buy verifying my address the day before and not mentioning any discrepancy (they can't explain why that happened), they have no mechanism to change their own mistake in their system, will have to create a completely new order, and can't ship the TV until middle of next week at the earliest (another day off from work).

Bitcoin,"I'm being a hippie, but hear me out","To sum up this entire post: ""I think it's amazing that a bitcoin millionaire could literally bend and reshape the place they live in... entirely to their own will.""

I'm being a hippie, but hear me out. What if several early adopters got together and instead of cashing out the bitcoins, they used all their millions of dollars worth of bitcoins to start public infrastructure projects based around privacy? I mean, how many people had mined 100,000 or so bitcoins that now have over $9Million USD they could spend? Obviously, they can't take the coins out in USD without crashing the system, and the early adopters KNOW that because they know as much as I know about Bitcoin (quite a lot, actually - I live on this sub) 

Here's what I'd do if I were a bitcoin millionaire at least 9 times over:

1. Start a public wifi hotspot that uses encryption for every person that connects. Actually, hell, I'd set up a TOR relay and let all the world's traffic go through my ""ISP"" just to keep the locals from being found out by watching my exit node.

2. Start paying people in Bitcoin.

3. Gain acceptance by local businesses to let your workers that are building your wifi network and other project pay to eat and get gas and such at local Mom and Pop stores.

4. Start a local exchange... going to have to call it something else though. Perhaps I'll sell pieces of bubble gum and suckers. Then give them ""change"" in US dollars for their purchase? I'm not sure, but there has to be a way to beat FinCEN legally. I don't even think it's right they have any say in the bitcoin economy, but as long as we have to peg the btc to the dollar, the government will always be able to control it. We need to get the BTC away from the dollar, but you can't because in order for currency to be currency, it has to be worth something ""against"" something else. BTC should have been only able to be purchased with gold, then we could have had a gold standard (which gold is pegged to the dollar, even) i.e. ""How much is gold worth today on the charts? $1200 or something."" That damn ""dollar"" word. We need to get rid of it. As long as the Federal Reserve Note is the world RESERVE CURRENCY, we are losing the game and they will always be able to regulate us out of existence by just making it punishable by prison time to even exchange a dollar for btc. They could put that strict embargo there just like they do on countries.

5. Slowly push the GDP of my little town towards being 80% bitcoin. I understand cash will probably never be stamped out, and I'm not going to make it a requirement that it is because that just leaves room for failure if it doesn't happen.

6. Enjoy living in the first city/town/state (depending on how wealthy the BTC Millionaire is) with a deflationary GDP. You wouldn't have to regret spending all your BTC because you would OWN all the city/town/state's best businesses and infrastructure.


Keep in mind that I'm a very upstanding and honest person. A customer once paid me $100 for doing web site updates for them, and then I went to the local convenience store and pulled out the $100 bill he gave me and I had two. I immediately pulled my cell phone out, called him, and had him come meet me and take back the extra $100 he gave me. I could have kept it and nobody would have known otherwise. I'm just not that kind of person, and ONLY a person like me could ever pull this off. But hopefully, I just gave someone an idea and I will hear about a city ""going bitcoin"" in the very near future. That's the beginning when a town or city goes bitcoin and even allows taxes to be paid in bitcoin, which there IS a software company working on allowing municipalities to accept bitcoin straight from the local government web sites.

I'd like to get a sanity check on my saving and budgeting habits, and some advice on how to make my money do a little more for me. 

**Debt**

* CC1, limit $2k, $0 balance (paid every month), age 5.5 years

* CC2, limit $2K, $215 balance (will be paid at end of billing cycle), age 1 year

* Student LOC, limit $25k, $2k balance (down to $1K by mid-April), interest rate ~4%, age 1.5 years, Mom is cosigner (and happy to stay on)

* Student loan, $28K -- this is *not* gaining interest and does not need to start repayments for ~10 years (after I finish my postdoc).

**Income/Savings**

* Monthly income: $2042

* TFSA: $10 775

* Savings: $7100

* Chequing: $2300

**Budgets**

* Rent: $800

* Groceries: $200/mo

* Cable+Internet: $75 (will be down to $50 in 2 months)

* Electric: $35-45

* Phone: $35

* Restaurants, etc: $75

* Misc. (Cat, clothes, etc.): $100

* Direct-to-savings: $250

So, what do I do better? My food budget is high because A) This is a food-expensive part of the country, and B) I *really* can't cook. I keep all my credit cards paid off, and haven't paid interest in ~2 years. I'm trying to have enough money in the bank at the end of my PhD (4 years) to pay off my OSAP entirely before it starts to accrue interest -- it's interest free so long as I am still a student or a postdoc, so I have ~10 years before I get a rate of Prime+2%. Right now I'm leaving it be since there is no interest being charged. 

I had a credit score of 712 as of last August or so. How can I drive it up so that when the (far off) day comes I need to get a serious loan, I can get decent interest rates? Would it help to have my mother taken off as a co-signer, even though that would probably bring down the LOC limit by 80%? Should I add yet another CC? Completely pay off the LOC from my savings? Or is it just a function of the fact that I'm a grad student who makes $25k/yr? I have no intentions of buying a house or a car in the next decade, nor will I be having children to save up for.

Bitcoin,"If I were a Central Bank, here's what I'd do to sabotage bitcoin","So I'm assuming everyone understands why central banks will never like Bitcoin.  
 It's a construct completely outside their control, and since they get their power from issuing and being the central clearing house for paper currencies the mere existence of an alternative that doesn't have those problems is a big problem, because it's obviously a better deal for its users in the medium-long term.

You can't manipulate a currency unless you have a lot of it at your disposal.  With dollars, that's easy - Just create some new currency.  

But with Bitcoin, you can't do that - So what do you do as a central bank with the ability to create as much paper money as you want.....

 You buy a bunch of bitcoins, and the price doesn't matter.  Actually, it's BETTER for you if your buying causes the price to go up, the more the better.   

The total market cap for Bitcoin just hit 1 billion, so if the Fed wanted to buy 10% at current market rates best case scenario it would be 100 million, which is pocket change for the entities we're talking about.

The demand spike creates a price spike which pulls media attention which brings new buyers which feeds higher prices which feeds more media attention, the cycle becomes self perpetuating after a while.  That's where we are now.

Because Bitcoin's fundamentals (stable supply, distributed decision making, borderless operation) don't really leave room to argue they're worse than Dollars, the only argument that can reasonably made against them is that they're unstable and therefore unsafe for the average person to use.

So the way you do that is help the price go way up by buying in quantity over a reasonable period of time without regard to the price, then once you've cornered a reasonable proportion of the market (say 5-10%) you dump them all at once, smash the price, and incur massive losses for the new users who bought in during the climb through higher prices.

Then (after the market exhausts itself at the bottom) you DO NOT buy any of your coins back, since the dollar amount is trivial it's better to leave the impression that demand in the market has completely left town.   

This also means you can use the same trick of accumulating -&gt; causes bubble -&gt; encourages newbies to get in -&gt; sell large stake -&gt; pop bubble -&gt; cause newbie panic -&gt; advise currency is unsafe -&gt; wait for fundamentals to become important again -&gt; repeat


TL:DR -
Buy 10% of bitcoin market over medium period of time -&gt; causes price inflation -&gt; encourages newbies to get in, not wanting to miss out -&gt; dump stake -&gt; pop bubble -&gt; cause newbie panic -&gt; advise currency is unsafe -&gt; wait for fundamentals to become important again -&gt; repeat

This is only true on interest paid on said loans, but not on the loan principal itself. I'll try to explain simply below. But please, don't take my word for it. Here are plenty of sources that explain why 'double taxation' is a myth much better than I can:

* [myfinancialawareness.com](http://www.myfinancialawareness.com/Topics%20Financial/Myth%20-%20401(k\)%20Loans.htm)

My take on it?

**The Myth:**

401(k) loans are double taxed. First, when you pay back the loan with post-tax dollars. Second, after you retire all distributions are taxed as regular income. 

**The Explanation:**

It doesn't matter that you are paying back the loan with post-tax dollars. I think the pdf linked to on the federal reserve website puts it best. 

&gt; Since loan proceeds are not taxed when distributed, the tax on repayment is really just a delayed tax on the consumption of the loan proceeds"". 

Here are two examples, ignoring fees and interest for now.

*case 1:* I take out a 401(k) loan of $5000 and then immediately pay it back, I have not been taxed a single dollar. It doesn't matter if I pay it back using the pre-tax money I just pulled out of my 401(k), post-tax money out of my savings account, or free money I found in a safe I discovered in my deceased grandmother's home. I had a $5000 loan, and then I didn't. Isn't that simple?

*case 2:* I take out a $5000 401(k) loan and buy a used car on craigslist. I just bought a car with money that I didn't have to pay federal or state income taxes on. What sorcery is this!? Well, when I repay the loan with post-tax dollars, I am at that time paying income taxes on the money that I used to buy the car.

**But what about the interest?**

Again I think the federal reserve pdf puts it best:

&gt; Loan interest payments, on the other hand, can indeed be considered double-taxed undertraditional consumption tax principles—since interest payments are like new contributions,
they should be made with pre-tax dollars and then taxed upon withdrawal. In practice,
however, the double-taxation of loan interest relative to a consumption tax is oﬀset by the
break borrowers get on the timing of their tax payments: recall that rather than paying
taxes on loan proceeds when they are distributed (i.e., consumed), borrowers pay the taxes
gradually over the following ﬁve years as they repay the loan with after-tax dollars. The
time value of these delayed tax payments oﬀsets the double taxation of interest—perfectly
so, if the discount rate is the pre-tax rate of return; only partially if the discount rate is
lower.

I hope that helps clear up any misconceptions on the matter. There are certainly other reasons to not get a 401(k) [edit: loan], but you can take 'double taxation' off of your list.

personalfinance,(CA) Young man looking to start a financial plan,"Hello all, 

I just finished paying off all my debts without digging into my emergency fund so I figured it was time to get some help.  

I've (almost) finished the Bogle Head Guide to Investing and am looking for Canadian products, institutions and strategies that will help me invest diversely and hold for the long term. All while meeting my goals in the short, medium, long, and longer term.. 

Lets start with some stats:

* Male Engineer, early twenties 
* Gross Salary $60000 (will most likely jump up next year) 
* Actual take home is $1650 Bi-weekly
* Emergency fund of $7000 in a PC savings account 

I currently live with family so my set costs are fairly low:  

* $500 Room/Board 
* $135 car insurance
* $90 monthly transit (April will be the last pass I buy)  
* $21 Cell Phone 

I was raised quite spartan so my variable costs are very low:

* $4-$30 Social Dinning 
* $0-$35 Gas (Usually $0)
* $0-$100 Toys (Usually $0)
* $0-$100 Clothing  (Usually $0)  

Alright, Lets talk Goals.

Short Term Goals (&lt;5 months):  

* Set up (or plan out) TFSA, RRSP, and investment accounts.   
* Buy good bike, bike to work (&lt;$600)
* Move out, rent own place (&lt;$850/month)
* Buy free weights, get semi-jacked  

Medium term (&lt;5 years):  

* Form partnership with kick-ass female

personalfinance,Investing instead of tax withholding?,"I'm thinking about reducing the federal tax withholding on my paychecks to zero, and then dumping all that money into my Roth IRA (medium risk mutual funds).

personalfinance,"Denied for my first credit card, what now?","Hi there,

I turned 18 a few weeks ago, so I figured I'd apply for my first credit card. My mom and I looked around but we determined that the best credit card would be a simple one from my bank with a low-ish interest rate and no monthly/yearly fee. 

Two weeks later, bam, denied for ""insufficient credit history.""

A part of this is a ""no shit sherlock"" and a ""what the hell man"" for me. I opened my account at this bank when I was 16, and I asked if there was a way to get a credit card since I was interested in learning how to use one wisely before college/adult life. Since I was under 18, the lady at the bank opened a new card (with an astronomical limit of $7500) for my dad and made me an authorized user on it. I've been using the card every month since last May, never missed a payment and never carried a balance. 

From what I understand, it is true that as an AU I would not have a credit history. The bank said they got this information from Equifax. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I can both obtain the information from them and appeal my rejection to the bank themselves. I am not too hopeful about this as appealing to the place that denied me in the first place seems silly.

Basically I feel like I've been slapped in the face. I made $3000 last year, have paid off almost $1000 on a credit card with a stupidly high limit and interest rate (18.99%), and yet I was denied for a card from my own bank that is the EXACT same one I am using now (except, being an AU technically means it doesn't really belong to me), plus now my non-existent history now shows me being denied. I'm just going to chalk it up to being a ""life isn't fair"" kind of thing and I should move on.

So, in the spirit of moving on, where do I look now? Should I try for a secured credit card, or apply for a more student-friendly card?

thanks in advance.",finance,1364656513

personalfinance,"Squeezing the budget not cutting it, how can I keep my debt holders out of the red?","To expand on the issue at hand (this is my first post, so I would appreciate any advice on structure syntax as well), I graduated undergrad a few years ago with about 120k in debt. My parents, bless their hearts, had promised that they would pay for (one way or another) my undergraduate college expenses. They took the debt completely in their name (they had co-signed originally), but are now in financial trouble of their own.

As for myself, I currently have a job as a financial analyst making about 80k a year (gross). I am engaged to the love of my life, have a nice apartment, drive a newer car, and am saving up for a wedding. With all of these things, and a fairly balanced social life, I am making enough to live moderately comfortably (all of my savings are going into wedding, and with everything lined up, we're just barely going to have enough to buy a pair of fruity drinks on our honeymoon).

The problem came a month ago when I was told that my parents are struggling to cover my massive college debt. My father then asked if I could cover one of the $400 dollar monthly payments. He is a very proud man, and was once very successful, and I know that for him to ask me to contribute was an act of desperation. He said he could hang in for another 6ish months until my wedding, but knowing how dire it must be for him to ask in the first place, I would really like to help sooner.

So the question is, what can I do? I'm using mint, quietly denying any activities that don't involve my fiancee (for purely selfish reasons I would like to maintain the lifestyle she has grown accustomed to), I've cut all unnecessary personal expenses, but I am still falling several hundred dollars behind where I need to be to contribute to my own college debt. I thought about a second job, but only being able to work nights (I work about 50-55ish hours a week) and weekends, I wasn't sure I could physically maintain the hours that may be necessary.

I'm not even sure that this is the right place to ask this, but how do I close the gap?

*edit: A couple things that I left out, that may clear up a few of your concerns.

1. My fiancee knows about the debt, but doesn't know how serious my parents current situation is.

2. The $400 is a monthly payment that I am looking to take over from my father, this will ease the burden enough for him to get situated in his current situation.

3. Yes I feel like an asshole for my father taking on my entire debt, I went to a very expensive school and got a degree in a very lucrative field. In my defense, when I was applying for schools my father was making seven figures and told me to pick ""whatever school I wanted"" I took him at his word. His financial situation has crashed completely (no he wasn't investing in CDOs) since and now he makes only a little bit more than I do, but is paying for my mother, his mother, his debts and my school debt. Yes, I still feel like an asshole.

4. I joined the army out of college and enrolled in their student loan repayment program which, unlike the $65k they were contractually obligated to pay, paid off 30k (2/3 of the payments, and after the taxes).

5. My fiancee and I have been engaged for 3 years, (will be close to 4 by the time we get married) and I'm not going to make her wait any longer even if I could. Our wedding will be a total of 21k(ish), the venue is paid (1k) the photographer is paid (1.5k), and we are under contract to pay the remainder of the all-inclusive reception (5k remaining out of 15k). So delaying the wedding would end up costing us far more than not delaying the wedding.

6. My fiancee has a full time job and goes to school (masters). She pays utilities and her own college debt as well as her personal expenses (and car loan). She will be getting a raise in three months and may be able to take over more share of our joint expenses.

edit2: I wanted to address why I sound like a whiny shit who makes 80k a year, can't handle his debt, and who's parents are suffering for it.

80k is my base salary. CA + FED taxes (0 deductions, I don't want to take the risk of getting hit really hard next year, but that may have to change to adjust for this $400), medical +dental, and FICA come out pre-paycheck (obviously). This puts me at about 52k net. Fixed monthly (rent+car+insurance for each) come in at about 36k, so bring me to about 16k. To pull together the remaining 5-6k for the wedding, that is effectively 12k (5.5 months left, and I'm doing this to show monthly expenses), so that puts me at 4k a year, for gas and incidentals (oil changes, haircuts, the occasional clothing item for work, dog food, trips to the vet). (assumptions: my fiancee and I actually split the savings, but we also split food, so I lumped it into savings. My fiancee covers gas, electricity, and internet)

So to reiterate, I live well and I can comfortably care for my family (fiancee and dog). When the lease comes up, if this is still a concern (January) we will move farther away and lower the square footage. When the resale of my car = the buyoff value of the loan, I will look at trading it in for a lower monthly payment car. When I get married in 6 months, the 1k we are saving will be converted into a debt payment towards my student loans, and I will start saving for retirement when I'm dead (that's a joke, there is a plethora of advice here on saving for retirement). I make good money and live in an expensive area, anyone see where I can shave something off?

With current interest rates and the talk I've been hearing of the housing market picking back up I've been bringing up the idea of buying out of our lease and purchasing early.  We both work full time and bring in $5300 a month.  About $200 a month goes towards student loans and another $350 to a car payment on my car.  No credit card debt and we currently have 5k in savings.  

So my question is given the current market are we better off waiting to purchase a home when we can have a better down payment or buying this summer.  I am confident we could come up with a 5% down payment to get better financing while keeping money in reserve for possible issues with the home.

investing,How did I do? My first investment.,"Low interest rates, bull market heading for correction, bond bubble, quantitive easing, fiscal cliff and the Cypriot banks. For someone entering the stock market for the first time, there's a lot of media hype to trawl through. Based on information in the media, one could be forgiven for taking all of their money out of the banks, putting it under their mattress and buying a shotgun. 

Thankfully after lots reading, researching and a healthy dose of inner soul searching, saner heads prevailed and I took the plunge and make my first ever investment into the stock market. Thinking longer term, I plumped for a 80% equity mix using index trackers, with a view to lifestyle equity into bonds over the years.

Being from the UK, I opted to use a TD Direct trading account using my ISA allowance for 2012 (better late than never!). There's no fee for the account providing you setup a regular investment or have at least £5100 in your trading account. 

I could have stuck with the much applauded Vanguard Life Strategy funds, but that doesn't seem like a great way to learn. Eventually I want to invest in individual stocks - that's for another day, however! My investment covers the UK, Developed world (ex-UK) and a little of the emerging markets.

Thanks to some great advice on the Monevator site, I now have the following trackers in my portfolio. Coincidentally, what is with The Motley Fool site? Every article ends in a sales pitch, which makes me a little uncomfortable.


* HSBC UK Gilt Index C
* Vanguard FTSE UK Equity Index
* Legal &amp; General Global Emerging Markets Index Fund
* Vanguard FTSE Developed World Ex-UK Equity Index Fund

Things I'm aware of, the L&amp;G Emerging markets has a higher TER than I would like, but the equivalent Vanguard fund isn't available on my platform. With the new tax year coming, I'd like to further diversify the portfolio, possibly into property.

What are you thoughts? Have I made a terrible mistake? Where can I further diversify to help mitigate risk? 

Would you like quarterly updates on this portfolio's progress?",finance,1364726775

Let me preface this post with the following warning: I am aware that the information I am about to provide points towards a pattern of incredibly bad decision making on my part; to this day, looking back at all the poor decisions I have made haunts me because I know that the influence of those decisions are going to continue to shape my life for years to come. However, the point of this post isn't to criticize poor decision-making-skills, but to help me build a solid foundation to deal with the consequences of those decisions. Thank you.


HISTORY

I come from a family of 5 - parents, and 2 sisters. Until 2012, we all lived in Mission Viejo, a small city in Orange County, California. In 2012 I graduated from high school. My parents moved out of state to a property they purchased during the Recession in Michigan and began renting out the home they owned in California. For future note, the family currently renting the California house happens to be the family of my best friend. My sisters both went off to their own colleges. I do not own a car, only a bike.

I enrolled at the University of California, Irvine as a Computer Science major. I was able to pay in-state tuition because technically I still lived in state. However, I decided to live in the dorms on campus, primarily because I didn't have the income to afford to rent-from-the-renters in the California house. All told, the total tuition for the first year at UCI was 29661 dollars (14046 for tuition, 14048 for housing, 1567 for ""Books and Supplies""). I did not receive financial aid from the university beyond offering a Federal Direct Subsidized Loan to the sum of 3500 dollars, which I accepted.

To cover the majority of the tuition that was still left to be paid, I took out a student loan from my bank, Wells Fargo, to the sum of 25000 dollars. 

The remaining ~1500 dollars I expected to pay out of pocket once I got a job during the school year. I was eventually able to find employment in early January and have been employed since January 10, 2013. I work at a local coffee shop about 3 miles from campus, I make 8 dollars an hour, and on average I make 250 dollars per paycheck (after taxes), twice a month. In addition, I get a small amount of additional income from tips. I bring home my 'tip jar' regularly and cash the rolls of coins; on average I make about 2 dollars in tips per shift, with 3 shifts per week.


CURRENT

I am currently about to start my third quarter at UCI; a fourth summer quarter is offered, but optional. The main problems I am dealing with at the moment are:

-Finding a place to live for my second year of schooling

-Creating a plan to deal with my monster of a student loan


HOUSING

For dealing with the first problem, I see roughly five options: accepting a new housing contract for the next year, renting an apartment with roommates, renting out a room with the renters currently living in the California house, try to transfer to a school in Michigan, or other. The final option will be explored separately from the first four.

1 - NEW HOUSING CONTRACT

I applied for a housing contract for my next school year which was accepted, just to be safe. Compared to this year's contract (which as stated before, totaled over 14000 dollars), this contract would involve 9 monthly payments of 577 dollars, with a total contract price of 5543 dollars (including down payment). This is significantly cheaper, and appears to be just about within my income range: assuming I don't waste any money on extraneous purchases and do well on tips, I could afford to make almost the entirety of the housing payments with my job income alone. Furthermore, I would incur no transportation costs from getting to school or work because I would still be on/near campus.

2- RENT AN APARTMENT

I haven't done much research into this option yet, but I have enough at hand to make some semi-accurate estimates about price. One location about 3 miles from the University would cost slightly over 1000 per month; it would have 1 bed, 1 bath, and 520 sq. ft. of room space. With one roommate this would equate to just about 500 dollars per month, almost equivalent with accepting the housing contract. I am not quite as sold on this option primarily because of distance; getting to work on time by bike already takes a noticeable amount of time (on average, 30 minutes) and as the apartment I found is farther away from the campus as well as where I work, continuing to hold employment there would be difficult but probably still manageable.

3 - RENTING WITH THE RENTERS

This option is also not quite as appealing. The house where I would be staying is located in Mission Viejo, approximately 14 miles from the university. Due to the way my schedule is set up, I would have to get carpool to the university 5 days a week and on weekends for my job, which would obviously require me pitching in money for gas in addition to regular rent. On the plus side, as my parents are the ones who own the house, I am optimistic that a two-part agreement could be reached that allowed me to pay somewhat reduced rent to the family, and for the family to pay slightly lighter rent to my parents. This option would make keeping my part time job incredibly difficult, and although I know of several places offering jobs in Mission Viejo near the house, managing that schedule with the transportation required to get me to and from the university each day would be incredibly difficult.

4 - MOVING IN WITH MOM AND DAD

This option would be difficult at best but could theoretically result in less money necessary. Moving in with my parents would still allow me to claim in-state tuition in Michigan (they've owned that property long enough) and would completely eliminate housing costs that I personally would have to pay, but would come at the expense of having to apply to a new university and hoping a sizable amount of my credits transfer, as well as hoping I got a good deal on financial aid.


STUDENT LOAN

As for the second problem, I absolutely need to get a plan in place fast, because I see the potential to nip this monster completely in the bud. For reference, I still have a complete copy of the loan document, all 15 pages or so, should certain information found on it become relevant or should scans of the document become necessary.

As stated before, the loan was for the amount of 25000 dollars.
The interest rate is (prepare yourself) 11.450%.
The finance charge (""estimated dollar amount the credit will cost the applicant"") is 52999.40.
The total expected payment is 77999.40.

Yikes. I know it looks bad but I made the judgement call and now have to live with it.

The deferment period granted by the loan is from September 13, 2013 until December 15, 2016. Obviously, no payments are required during this time, though the document notes that 12195.03 in interest would accrue. Following that period, the document predicts approximately 180 payments of 433.33, finishing on December 16, 2031.

What has me somewhat optimistic is that the document specifically says the following:

""Repayment Options: Although your payments are deferred while you are in school, you can still choose to Pay Interest Only or Make Full Payments during this time.

Prepayments: If you pay your loan early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge.""

Under the Terms of Repayment in the actual contract, it furthermore states:

""...I may but am not required to make principal and interest payments during the Interim Period. You will add unpaid accrued interest and any other charges to the Final Loan Amount on the last day of the Interim Period. If I choose to make voluntary payments during the Interim Period, I understand that all interest must be paid before the principal will be reduced.""

It is my hope that, assuming I find an acceptable solution to my housing problem, I will be able to being making payments on the loan. I am probably interpreting this incorrectly, but presumably by making payments now, during the deferment period, my end result will require significantly less money being paid on my part. However, I would much rather have some who understands loan terminology better than myself go over this and help explain it to me.


OTHER

This is in regards to the fifth solution to my financial troubles mentioned above.

Short story shorter: the Military.

I know it won't be an end-all-be-all solution to the problems I currently face. But roughly speaking should I join the military I see two possible routes to deal with my financial problems:

One, I would continue to attend my university until graduation. One version of military financial aid allows for this; upon graduation, I would immediately begin serving the requisite time in the military. 

Two, I would immediately join the military, receiving an education during my time there. Assuming I understand what was told to me properly, this would end my deferment period after 6 months after which I would have to begin making payments. 


END

Frankly, I'm not sure which direction I should try heading in. I'm in a pit and I know I need to stop it from getting any deeper. I see the potential to begin chipping away at the monstrous amount of debt I will be facing come graduation, but finding a way to continue paying for schooling as well as housing is going to be difficult - at best. Therefore, I humbly ask for any and all advice you can give me in regards to the issues I face. I know I have made some terrible decisions, but as time travel doesn't exist yet I can't change them - only accept the responsibility I justly earned and deal with it.",finance,1364724506

investing,What investment does well as interest rates rise?,"As interest rates rise your bonds become less valuable on the secondary market. Intervention by the Fed has been good for stocks and a rise in interest rates would imply the end of these activities so rising interest rates would also be bad for stocks.

So if both stock and bonds lose value in an environment with rising interest rates, what investment does well? Wouldn't it be good to hold some of this investment as a hedge?
