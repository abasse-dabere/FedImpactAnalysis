personalfinance,Advice needed: investing in a first car,"First time posting here, so thank you in advance for reading this. It's a decision  that's been weighing heavily on my mind and I'm still a beginner when it comes to thinking smart about my finances. I need to decide whether or not it is wise for me to invest in buying my first car. Here's the situation

Me:
-full-time college student, 21, about 13G in loans (private and federal)
-Tuition  is about 7,000/year (on financial aid)
-Will be working full time during summer at a job that's $15/hour
-Completely financially independent (cut off from parents)
-The only bills I pay currently are my cell phone ($50/month)

Summer housing situation: I saved up $2,000 so my rent for the summer will be taken care of. For the next school year, I will pay our of pocket or take out another loan for tuition

This leaves me with a surplus of $2,000 left over from my taxes, plus the ability to save money freely during the summer--about (500/month).

Recently I've been looking at used cars that are about $1000 or cheaper for a first car that would last me about 2-3 years until I'm making real money after graduation (hopefully). I estimate it will take another $300 or so to get it on the road, and insurance for me could be quite costly (the quote estimates about $160/month, but that could be a lot lower than reality).

I would like a car because it's hard to be independent when you rely on the bus/train constantly (groceries, getting from point A to B in general, etc). You understand the convenience. Additionally any sales tax I'm accountable for would be wiped out by my education credits next year.

But there are always others things I could spend the money on: Paying off interest in my loans, or working my ass off to pay tuition so I have less debt in the end. 

I can't tell if I just *want* a car for a reward, or if it's a healthy decision for me. I also can't really estimate the amount of future expenses it would cause me, either. And yet I'm so tired of working for things that don't really gratify me. Any general advice?",finance,1364856958

personalfinance,A newbie's guide: Stock market – what you really need to know and what is just “nice to have” (DE) --&gt; I found it interesting,"Investing in stocks seems to be really complicated if you've never done it before. Many of you may have friends who told you that they made a lot of money by buying and selling shares, others probably have heard stories about people who lost all their money due to a fatal investment. Actually investing in the stock market is not that difficult if you learn some basic concepts.

**What you really need to know**

**News and Common Sense**: Before buying some company's shares, make sure you scan the news for any information about that company. Is their business growing, are they having financial difficulties or have their competitors just launched a new product that is likely to have a negative impact on the company's turnover? Use your common sense and don't try to speculate – if you read in the newspaper that an entreprise is likely to go bankrupt soon, then don't buy their shares.


**Rating Agencies**: There's been a lot of Rating Agencies bashing lately. Ok, they didn't anticipate the bankkruptcy of Lehman Brothers and that they may play an “ambiguos” role in the European debt crisis, but it's also true that you shouldn't buy shares of companies that have bad ratings. The three major rating agencies are Moody's, Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor's.

**Balance Sheet and other stuff**: Make sure you learn how to read a balance sheet so that you won't have to rely on someone else's opinion of a company. Learn how to calculate the most important balance sheet ratings and what a cash flow is.


**Monetary system and policy**: You really have to understand how the monetary system of your country works and the effects of your central bank's monetary policy, you need to know the basics. What's going to happen with your share prices if the interest rates rises or falls? Are you likely to lose or win money?

**Risk Diversification**: Try to diversify your risk by buying companies' stocks that operate in different business sectors. There is a lot of information on risk diversification on the internet.

**Stop-Loss order**: Make up your mind on how much money you're willing to lose and always set your stop-loss orders accordingly.


**Nice to have, but not essential**

**Day trading and Day Trading Algorithms**: Unless you are going to do this for a living and you really know what you're doing, don't try to take part in this (Russian) Roulette. If you want to be a day trader, you need (a lot of time) and mathematical, programming and economic skills.

**Technical Analysis**: Many of you may have read that Technical Analysis is a kind of “Stock Market Voodoo” rather than a trading technique one should take seriously. I guess that nobody knows if technical analysis is really useful or not (maybe you want to share your opinion on this), but learning some basic inidcators like RSI or MACD may still be worthwhile, even for a newbie (it can help you to decide when to buy and whether a share is expensive or not - I wouldn't rely on them though).

**Machine Learning techniques** : This quite advanced mathematical “stuff”. These techniques help you to discover hidden patterns and word of mouth has it that they're used by hedge funds. There are many books on Random Forests, SupportVector Machines and Neural Networks out there.

** Futures and options**: Again, you'll need a lot of time if you really want to start trading with futures and options. Don't do it, you can lose a lot of money.

personalfinance,Advice for starting my career,"Hi,

I'm currently finishing up my last semester of college and I have a job lined up in a large city. I'll be making 60k per year, and I'm trying to sort out what exactly I'll do with the money. I plan on living at home for the first month at least, and will graduate debt-free other than some money I owe my parents from traveling (planning on paying them a couple hundred bucks a month until that's paid off).

My future employer will match 401k contributions for 6% of my salary, 50 cents on the dollar, so I was planning on contributing 6% ($3600) per year to that. I also thought that it would be a good idea to max out a Roth IRA, so there's another $5500 going to that. I did some rough calculations with federal and state tax as well as FICA, and after the 401k contribution and taxes I'll have $42,655 annually. After $5500 into the Roth IRA that leaves $37,155.

When I decide to move out later this summer, rent will probably run me $800-$1000/month based on the area I plan on living.

Other than that, I'm not sure if there's anything else I should be doing with the money. Is maxing out the Roth IRA overkill? Or not enough? I've done a bit of research and I think I have a good plan, but I don't really know and I'm looking for input. I figured I'd work on putting the rest into savings and work on not spending frivolously, and probably over time work on setting up an emergency account with 6 months of living expenses. Is there anything else I should be doing?

financialindependence,Question regarding a Calculation,"I currently have about $90k in student loans ranging from 6.2-7.9%.  I was planning on putting all extra money toward the loans to pay them off in 3-5 years.

I make $75k and my employer contributes 15% of my salary to a retirement account that I will be setting up with Vanguard in July.  I then have the option of contributing any of my own money to a 401k.

I wasn't going to contribute anything to the 401k until my loans were gone, but I have been contemplating contributing some because of my high tax rate.  I know people say putting $1000 toward a 6.8% loan is like getting a 6.8% return, but how does this work when I am getting taxed 29.1% (federal and state) on my top dollars?

I would like to retire early, so I would go from single $75k to married ~$50k or so in today's dollars.  I imagine this would be a reduction in tax rate, although nobody can predict the future.  So if I saved 29% now on the invested money and paid 15-20% when it came out, how does that affect my return?

The figure of Americans applying for unemployment benefits surprisingly cut down last week, signifying an upturn in the labor market. This could be very fastidious news. If the economy will continue to rise, possible revival will soon be realized. At some point recovery seems implausible but turn of events is favoring us and results are even enthralling.
Early reports from the Labor Department said on Thursday, state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 340,000, waning for a second straight week. The preceding week’s claims number was altered to demonstrate 3,000 more applications received than earlier reports. According to Reuters’ poll, economists had expected first-time applications to mount to 355,000.
The four-week inconsistent average for new claims, an improved measure of labor market trends, also fell 7,000 to 348,750 pointing to some firming in underlying labor market conditions. Since March 2008, this has been the lowest number. No states had been estimated and there were no special factors influencing the report, says a Labor Department analyst. According to a Reuters’ survey of economists, employers probably added 160,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, a small pick-up up from January’s 157,000 count. That would just be enough to hold the jobless rate steady at 7.9%. The figures due on Friday have no bearing on February’s employment report as it falls outside the survey period. Economists claim job increases of about 250,000 per month over a constant period are needed to significantly change the ranks of the unemployed. Job escalation averaged 200,000 in the last three months. Companies have no plans hiring domestic demand remains lackluster even though layoffs decreased. Claims stay pushed in the low end of a 330,000 to 375,000 range for this year. Federal Reserve last year to launch an open-ended bond buying program because high unemployment provoked them. The U.S. central bank said it would keep up the program until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market. In testimony to Congress last week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled the central bank would press forward with plans to buy $85 billion in bonds per month. The amount of populace still getting benefits under regular state programs after the first week of aid rose 3,000 to 3.1 million in the week ended Feb. 23. It was the lowest since July 2008 the four-week moving average of so-called continuing claims.

personalfinance,How do you handle finances on a commission-based salary?,"I'm 22, about to graduate college, and will be accepting an offer for a job as a community leasing consultant this week. The job pays $35,000 as a base pay, with an average of $8,000-$10,000 a year in commission (I don't know how this is paid out yet, although I have sent an email to HR inquiring how they do this). The job is based in the DC Metro area. 

Basically, I've concluded that the base salary is pretty pathetic for that area, and have plans to ask for an increase in the range of $37,000-$40,000 (it's a long shot because it's entry level, but worth asking). I don't expect them to give too much more because they do offer a lot of benefits: 401(k) with matching, full medical/dental/vision insurance, paid holidays, employee stock purchase plan, and a 20% discount on rent in company-owned communities (which really isn't worth that much to me because it looks like their apartments are still way out of my budget). 

So, how do you go about setting a budget/managing your finances when a decent chunk of your income is based on commission? My base pay is pretty low, so it's not like I can just treat it as ""extra money,"" right? I'm also worried that I'll be starting during their ""peak season"" for lease signing, meaning I could potentially miss out on a lot of commission because I'll be new/in training. 

edit: I guess I should add that I am fortunate enough to be graduating debt-free (my family has helped me tremendously, and my grandparents did not want me graduating with debt) so that's not really too much of a concern of mine. I do have federal loans out in my name, but I was promised that they would be paid by my father. I also have practically no money saved, so that's cool. Not. 

**edit 2:** So, based on all of the wonderful advice I've received, I've calculated my take-home pay using an online calculator to be almost exactly $2,000/month. Let's hope I can negotiate even a small bump (I won't hold my breath) but, in the mean time, I guess it's time to start a roommate search. Thanks for all of the advice!",finance,1364784588

personalfinance,Taking out loans. I have a plan. Need advice.,"Hi all. I have been browsing around here and it seems that i will get some great advice.  So i have a few questions about student loans. 

A little background : I am a musician. I am the first person in my family (Me and my Mom) to go to college/university because my family came here in the 80's (We are from Central America) My family does not have much money at all. My mom does not even make 25k a year. So basically, i come from nothing. My mom never thought about saving up for my education past high school. What she makes a year will not even cover a semester at the school i will be attending in the fall. So unfortunately i have the burden of having student loans because there is just no other option. Musican + Debt= ??? (Who knows)  


But after a ton of work i have been admitted into one of the best music schools in the country as a transfer (Sophmore, so i get to cut atleast 1 year off of loans). On top of that between scholarship and grants i have about 98% of my tuition covered. Believe me, i almost cried tears of joy when i got their offer!! haha.



Unfortunately, the cost of living in NYC is pretty darn high and that's why i will be taking out loans, and the small loan to cover the rest of my tuition, which in the bigger picture is next to nothing. My first year i am required to live in their living quarters, thats where they are trying to stick me with large loans (atleast for the first year). It is very expensive. But after that i can live on my own in the city which will be much cheaper (than the dorms atleast).



There is a lot more to the story that i would like to share but i should get to the numbers haha.

So when they offered me their financial package they offered me 3 loans :

Direct Stafford Loan : Interest rate is : 3.4% (Interest does not build while i am in school)

Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan : Interest rate is:  6.8% ( Will build up interest while in school)

Direct Parent Plus Loan : Interest Rate is : 7.9 % (Interest builds while i am in school)



Now, i have done a absolute ton of research on these loans and came up with a plan. I Will be able to defer all the loans, but according to my research, even when they are deferred i will be able to make payments on them. I plan on leaving the loan with no interest building alone while in school. But the other 2 loans i am going to attack while i am in school. I figured out how much interest will be added a month and will pay that on both myself because the interest that will be building is not actually a ton of money.  My mom offered to help also, so with her help i will also be reducing the principal amount. On top of that i have some family that will help with small amounts, which will still help greatly haha.



Now on top of that i will also be using the loan itself to pay because i will have some leftover. After i get disbursed all the money, there will be some leftover that i will be able to pocket. i am going to keep it to pay on both the loans in case i have a hard month or something along those lines.



Now, on top of this each year my loans will be of a smaller amount. This first year is the biggest at about 20k. i estimate that i will be pocketing about 1k. My second year i will probably taking out about 9k. and my third year will be about 8k.


Now i know it is a TON of money. but each year i will be taking out more in the smallest interest rate which does not build interest while in school. And the loans with the bigger interest rates will be less and less. So i will roughly be paying off about 10k while in school!! On top of that, i WILL be paying off the interest myself. So that when i get out of school i wont have built about 5k (?) in interest. There is a bit more to my re-payment plan.


But here are the questions i asked myself before taking out the loans :

Exactly how much will i be taking out? Do you know to the exact cent?

What is the interest rate?

Does the interest build while in school?

How much interest will be added a month?

Would it be possible to pay off the interest that builds while in school so that it does not screw you later?

What will happen at in the worst case scenario? (Scholarship Cut, Tuition Hike, Accident, ETC ETC)

Who has the loan? ( I found out companies tend to sell your loans so sometimes people will find out that their loan is now somewhere else)

Now because of the question of what would happen in worst case scenario. I put myself in the position of what would happen if i took out about 65k in loans. Using my above method i came up with how much it would cost a month. And it is roughly $850 minimum a month. 

The realistic scenario  (if i came out with 35k) it would cost me about $450 a month minimum. which is quite doable. That would be if i did NOT pay off while in school.

if i did.

I would be paying about $250 minimum payment. 

(All the above are across 10 years BTW)

Here is the thing though : i am not extremely good with numbers haha. But i was not going to sign my life away without doing some research.

My question to you guys that have experience : 

Am i going about taking out these loans the right way?

I completely understand that this is a risk, but this is a risk that i am willing to take. YOLO right? Haha.

Any advice? tips? 

Maybe somebody who is really good with numbers would be willing to help me out more. 

I want to know everything down to the exact cent. I will not be stuck with debt for the rest of life.

Also : I plan on taking off a year afterwards to really chip away at the loans I estimate that even working to make 30k my first year roughly. I might even make more. You never know what is going to happen.

But i will be going for my masters because if i get that i will be able to get a job at a University or college on top of working privately. But i will be getting my masters for free or really cheap. Theres a couple schools that offer free masters degree (assistance ships) if you get in.

personalfinance,Rethinking the Value of College,"Let me first say I'm not against college. It is a great experience with many intangible benefits that can add to a richer life.  But many articles make it seem like a financial slam dunk. 

Example- http://www.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/bs_collegeROI_0621.html


I've always felt like these are a case of lying with numbers. College is a huge expenditure, so I wanted to start a tread to break them down. 

Some thoughts assuming someone is deciding whether or not to take out loans to pay the balance back-

- Although they use ""net"" they are netting out the gross earnings above high school graduates, not taxes. Those numbers are all gross earnings numbers.

- In the US, we have a progressive tax system, so the high school graduate will be living on a higher % of their income than the college graduate throughout their lifetime.

- Student loan interest rates are currently around 6.8%. Assuming an all in 15% tax effective rate, that is 7.82%.

- Net those two figures, and you are at a 4-5% ROI (if the average is around 12%). That's if you work hard, graduate, manage to find a good job, work harder, manage to get promoted, keep working hard, etc. There is a whole lot of risk/ stress/ 60 hour weeks built into that figure.


- Pay is not linear, it is concentrated toward the end of a career. Loans on the other hand, if someone manages to pay them back on schedule, are concentrated toward the front of a career. This leads to many years of purchasing power that is lower than what would have been available had someone not gone to college- in the hope that there will be a few at the end that are much higher.

- ~~Finally, and this may be the biggest issue- average vs mean. When Bill Gates walks into a room, the average net worth of everyone skyrockets. The mean? Not so much. I wonder how much the averages are being affected by a few outliers.~~ EDIT- I missed that the article controlled for this. Thanks EventualCyborg.

personalfinance,Buying car and Building credit with/without a co-signer,"So I'm a recent college grad who's going to be buying his first car pretty soon.  I don't have a ton of credit at the moment (due almost entirely to a lack of history; currently have 1 credit card and 1 store card that are both less than a year old), so I'm getting fairly high interest rates quoted at the dealer (~5.9%).

 I was going to go to a credit union to try to get a better rate, but then my dad (who has excellent credit) said that he could co-sign for me (regardless of whether I do credit union or dealer financing), and probably get me close to 0% financing.

3 Questions:
1. As a recent grad who's trying to build up credit, will me having a co-signer build *less* credit than if I did it on my own?  
2. Will I still build *some* credit regardless? 
3. What's the best decision here? Go on my own, or do co-signer?

* Exporters and financials gain
 * Cyprus parliament to vote on bailout later on Tuesday
 * Underlying trend still bullish- analysts
 * TPP should be positive for Japanese equities - analyst
 By Ayai Tomisawa
TOKYO, March 19 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average rebounded 2 percent on Tuesday, regaining some ground lost in the previous session as fears receded that a controversial bailout proposal for Cyprus could reignite the euro zone crisis. Analysts said that the disruption to the Japanese market from the unusual bailout plan for Cyprus seems to have run its course, although the Japanese equities market is prone to volatility because it is vulnerable to a rise in the yen when global market uncertainty increases. 
 ""It looks like the bailout issue will be contained in Cyprus itself and it probably won't spread to the euro zone. As the Japanese market was rallying lately, Monday's selling served as a good opportunity for correction,"" said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities. ""But European debt issues will likely take years to be resolved, and we need to be prepared for a sell-off like this again as the Japanese market could easily get hit by a strong yen when investors buy the yen."" The Nikkei added 247.60 points to 12,468.23 after sliding 2.7 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day drop in 10 months. The index is just 0.74 percent away from a 4-1/2 year high of 12,560.95 marked last Friday. Ahead of a parliamentary vote in Cyprus that will either secure the island's financial rescue or threaten default, euro zone ministers have urged Cyprus to let smaller savers escape a controversial levy on bank deposits.
Still, investors are concerned that forcing ordinary citizens to fund bank rescues up front, through a tax on deposits, is setting a precedent that could lead to other bailout countries imposing something similar on depositors. On Tuesday, Monday losers such as exporters and financials were bought back. Sony Corp surged 6.8 percent and was the most-traded on the main board by turnover. Mazda Motor Corp jumped 5.6 percent and Nikon Corp rose 3.4 percent.
The broader Topix gained 1.7 percent to 1,045.89 in relatively thin trade, with 2.84 billion shares changing hands. Last week, average daily volume was 3.72 billion shares.  The benchmark Nikkei has rallied nearly 44 percent since mid-November when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe embarked on aggressive fiscal and monetary expansion campaign to revive the ailing economy. Investors are also focused on the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy-setting meeting starting on Wednesday and the change of leadership at the Bank of Japan this week.

 ""Investors are ready to chase the market higher to 13,000 on hopes for easing by the new leadership next month,"" said Mizuho's Miura. 
STILL UPBEAT
Goldman Sachs remained upbeat on Japanese equities, lifting its 12-month Topix target to 1,250 from 1,100. ""Without a doubt, going 'long Japanese equities' has become one of the most popular trades among global investors in 2013. This is not to say, however, that every long-only foreign investor is neutral or overweight Japan,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note. ""We estimate that if the underweight gap of 2.8 percentag points of EAFE-benchmark mutual funds were to close, this could imply roughly $42 billion of potential foreign inflows from this investor segment."" (EAFE=Europe, Australasia, Far East) Foreign investors bought 1.12 trillion yen ($11.7 billion) worth of Japanese shares in the week through March 9, their largest net purchase since the Ministry of Finance began collecting the data in 2005.
Market participants said that Japan's decision to join Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) membership talks was acting as a long-term catalyst to chase the market higher. ""This is, in our view, clear evidence that Abe is not just about 'buying growth' ahead of the July elections, but really about a fundamental pro-growth policy change,"" Jesper Koll, head of Japanese equity research at JPMorgan, wrote in a note, adding that banks would be a prime beneficiary if TPP forced a rise in competition, which would mean that companies would re-invest in buildings and facilities as well as accelerate mergers and acquisitions.

personalfinance,I built up a good chunk of credit card debt and a few of my accounts went delinquent. I got offered a loan that would essentially pay off the vast majority of my cards and debt. Should I take it?,"Over the past year I got a little trigger happy with a bunch of credit cards I was pre approved for. I completely demolished my credit score and I'm way past due on several of my cards.  


Today I got a letter in the mail from a company called One Main Financial. They offered me a loam that would end up removing a good chunk of my debt, essentially consolidating it. According to my research the interest rate would be decently high (20-30%), and the company has a couple shitty/scumbag tricks up their sleeve (for those who blindly sign their papers) but I'd regain quite of bit of stability (credit card wise). I'm in a financial bind (gf and I recently found out were expecting, so we're freaking out about money) so I'm very tempted to take the loan.


 I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this company and/or if there is a better way to go back to normal. 


I've tried calling my credit cards and they haven't been to helpful in terms of working with me and unless I come upon a couple thousand dollars I'll be playing a bad game of catch up over the next few months. 


TL;DR - Have a bunch of credit card debt that has gone delinquent was offered a loan that would fix most of that. But I don't know if I should consolidate my debt and move it to a third party or try to pay it off little by little.",finance,1364869879
personalfinance,"I have $90,0000 in Student Loans and would appreciate some advise on my payoff plan","Currently, I have five loans with different interest rates on which I am paying the minimum monthly payments for their extended payback plans (300mo/25yr). I am paying $636.76 toward my loans each month, and am able to save an average of $150-$200 after living expenses. I have built up a savings/emergency fund of $10,000, which is enough to get through 6 to 8 months if I were to lose my income. I have good credit, and don't carry any credit card debt; I use my credit card as a a debit card, paying off balances before the billing period and making money on the cash back. I don't own a car, and bike to work all year. I track all of my expenses in GnuCash, run reports, look at my spending. I would like to think that I live frugally and am smart with my money, minus this massive student loan debt I am carrying.

Up until now, I have been paying the minimum payments to build up my emergency fund. Now that I have a bit of a cushion, I know I should put more money toward my highest interest loans, but wanted to get a little input and thoughts on my plan. I just found out about unbury.me, and have been playing with increasing my payments, as well as playing with amortization in OpenOffice to double-check the dates and numbers.

Basically, if I pay the minimum on each loan through the end, I'll be paying back upwards of $190,000. If I up my payments from $636.76 to $700 a month, applied to my 11.5% loan first, then cascading down after each is paid off, I'll be paying back around $155,000. This is the less-complicated plan.

Now that brings me to what I am hoping will be a way out, but I wanted to know if anyone else has tried this plan: If I switch my federal loan to the IBR plan (I am eligible, only making 33k pre-tax), I will be paying less than $150/mo instead of $259.55. I could take that ""extra"" $100 not going towards federal loans and put them toward high-interest private loans to pay them off earlier. I could continue paying what I'm currently paying monthly (or pay more), but be applying much more toward principle. The IBR plan lets you pay at the rate proportional to your income (and family size, kids, etc...) and if you pay for 25 years, the balance is forgiven at the end. The problem is, if I'm paying $150 a month toward my federal loan, I'm not even covering the interest, so by the end of the 25 year period, that loan will have grown to around $80,000. When that gets forgiven, the IRS looks at it as income, and I'd have to pay income tax on that lump sum; pretty scary. Also, just letting a loan fester for 25 years and grow to twice where it is right now scares me.

So what I'm looking for is a little guidance and another set of eyes on these plans I've been working on. Or alternatives if I've missed something or am not coming at this aggressively enough. I feel like at some point in the future, my federal loans will have to be forgiven (banking on that student loan bubble bursting), but private loans most likely won't be part of that; so I'd like to pay those off as soon as I can.

If I can provide any more information, or if it would be helpful to put my worksheets on GoogleDocs, please let me know. I'm putting the specifics of my loans below if that will be helpful for anyone. Thanks for taking the time to read through this wall of text, it would be a huge help for me.

^Quick ^edits ^for ^formatting, ^and ^please ^excuse ^my ^typo ^in ^the ^title!

**Update:** Thanks for all the replies everyone. I've been really busy the past two days with work so I haven't had time to write a response. I spent a few hours working through all these options with my girlfriend last night and think we have come to a good solution.

We've had a budget and have been sticking to it for a few years. So we looked at what we'd need for 4 months of unemployment, for the both of us, at our current expenditure rate, and have that amount in savings. So from this point forward, we're going to put everything extra that we'd normally be saving towards our loans. We've put all of our loans into unbury.me and have a plan figured out where we'll be able to pay off everything (private and federal for both of us) in about 7.5 years. We won't be adding anything to our savings that entire time, but we also won't be pulling from our savings, just holding steady and paying off our debt as aggressively as possible.

She makes a decent amount more than me, and since our plan is to buy a house once we have the money/little to no debt, it's worth it for both of us to put all we can to get out of this debt as soon as possible. We'll be able to put $1400 a month combined into our loans, paying them off avalanche-style, and should be debt free by December 2021 (or sooner if we make more money in the coming years). We'll be paying about $35,000 in interest on $115,000 of debt, which is exponentially better than paying over $100,000 in interest on only my $90,000 of debt.

For those who asked, I went to Champlain College for Multimedia &amp; Graphic Design. It's a private school, and while the program was great, I would have gone somewhere with more grants and lower tuition had I understood the finances and process while I was in high school. Our system is so broken and we're just selling kids into indentured servitude after graduation because you need a degree if you want to be above poverty level, but that's another discussion.

Thanks again for all the help, everyone. It was a big wake-up call to see that I really didn't have any options to pay my loans down faster with my current income. It pushed us to re-evaluate our plan for the next few years and team up to work on getting out of our debt together.",finance,1364867039

From my research everything about the school is great, I visited multiple times and loved it.

I only applied to in-state schools that offered engineering, the other schools are marginally cheaper, but aren't nearly as highly ranked or have as many support and supplementary programs.

I have a 26 years left in a 30 year fixed mortgage. I owe 45,800 at 4.875. My monthly payment without escrow is $330, and I pay off an extra ~$220/month.

I just came from the bank where they offered to lock me into a 15-year fixed at 2.875. My new payment is still well-below what I'm paying now (when accounting for the extra I'm paying--and will continue to pay--toward principal). With the extra principal I'm kicking in, I'll have the refi paid off in 7.5 years.

This is where the question comes in:

I ALSO have a student loan of about $13,000 that I'll have to begin paying interest on once June rolls around. The interest rate is 7%, which is nothing to sneeze at.

I'm thinking of taking 'cash out' of my house, and refinancing at 45,800 + 13,000. The house is worth from $80-90k. 

My other option is to cash out an MFS fund that is worth almost exactly 13,000. I'm wary of touching this because it does decently well, and is nice to have.

My plan at the moment is to take the cash out of the home. I have no intention of ever paying a penny of that 7% interest, and taking the money out of the house and paying %2.875 has to be a better idea than liquidating the MFS fund (which grew ~13% last year, but is erratic).

personalfinance,Some of the common wisdom regarding tax advantage accounts may not rightly apply to early retirement.,"The [subreddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq#wiki_in_what_order_should_i_prioritize_my_long-term_investments.3F) has a fantastic writeup on how to allocate money between accounts.  I agree %100 with it if the goal is to maximize the amount of money that a person can spend over their lifetime, which is what most people want when talking about retirement accounts.

However, early retirement has a different set of fundamental assumptions.

* Reducing the number of years that the retiree is required to continue to work is the primary goal.
* Any increase in the amount of money is good, but it is generally not worth extending the number of working years.
* The date of retirement will be a long time (20+ years) before the age that allows penalty free withdraw of most retirement accounts.
* Due to the short saving time frame, direct earnings account for more of the retirement fund gain than compounding.


The difference in goals is enough to turn some of the common wisdom regarding retirement accounts on its head.  

The biggest problem is that the penalties associated with early withdraw can outweigh the tax sheltering effect.  The sooner the retirement, the worse the impact.  There is an [awesome report](http://www2.stetson.edu/fsr/abstracts/vol_13_num3_p233.PDF) about the break even time horizon involved with using a taxable account vs using a tax shelter and paying the early withdraw penalty.

To summarize, it is possible for a tax advantage account to be superior to a taxable account evening if paying the penalty, but how long it takes before breaking even depends the tax before and after retirement, the annual return, and the type of return (regular income vs capital gains).  The break-even tends to be over 20 years in many cases, and in early retirement we are talking about saving for 10-20 years and then taking withdraws immediately.

A lot of people site [Substatially Equial Periodic Payments](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/SEPP:Substantially_Equal_Periodic_Payments) as a reason to use 401k accounts for early retirement.  However, the methods for calculating how much can be withdrawn are limited.  The ones that allow the highest withdraw rates are related to the federal mid-term rate, which is extremely low right now.  The amount one might be able to withdraw might be far less than the [%4 safew withdraw rate](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/), which will hamstring the retirement plan.

My tentative opinions based on the above evidence breaks significantly from the conventional wisdom.

* **Roth IRAs suck.**  According to the report, the tax break even for a ""typical growth mutual fund"" earning %6/year is a whopping  42.8 years.  This completely defeats the purpose as an early retirement vehicle.  The principal contributions will only last a few years for most early retirees.  Who cares if the principal withdraw is penalty free if we are losing money on the gains for 20 years?  Further, since early retirees are more likely to go down in marginal tax rate than go up, this is a seriously tax disadvantaged type of account.
* **Traditional IRA/401k are much better, but still have problems.**  The break even horizon for ordinary income investments are not so bad.  For a bond fund yielding %4 for a person in the %25 bracket, breaking even 14.8 years is useful.  However, most people have the lion share invested in stocks.  The ""typical growth mutual fund"" break-even at %6 return is 22 years.  In other words, even the first dollar contributed is not likely to have gained more in a 401k/ira than a taxable account until after the planned retirement date.  Money that is contributed near the end of the savings period will suffer.  The saving grace for this type of account is if the tax bracket is going to drop significantly then the break-even period drops significantly.  In the specific case of dropping from %25 bracket to %15, the break even is *immediate* and all gains are advantaged.
* **SEPP alone is not enough to justify increasing 401k contributions.**  A person needing $15k/year will need a $375k retirement fund at %4 safe withdraw rate.  However, a 30 year old person retiring right now would only be able to withdraw about $11k/year with SEPP.  It would take an additional $140k to get enough with SEPP to live, significantly delaying retirement.  I suspect that SEPP is mutually exclusive to taking penalized withdraws due to the way the rules work.  As I understand it, if the entire account is part of a SEPP program (in order to get enough money per year) and  some extra amount is withdrawn, they will retroactively penalize all prior SEPPs. 

So what does the ideal early retirement plan look like?  I haven't quite figured that out yet.  It is probably going to change wildly depending on how much the person's marginal tax rate is going to change, the length of the savings period, and what happens to the federal mid-term rates.  We are going to have to either bite the bullet on the withdraw penalties, or bite the bullet by investing in a taxable account to augment SEPP or to tie over until retirement.",finance,1365018266

worldpolitics,Reaganomics. . .what i personally think about this issue,"I understand huge portions of the language being written and defended by conservatives and conservative independents. 

I studied business and economics in school, both secondary and post secondary. Most of it is BS. . . 

Some won't believe that, but i do. 

Reagan made some of the worst deals in modern america. He let the economy cease in the late 80's specifically around the time when the top 3rd worst economic austerity was brought into play.

In 87, Alan Greenspan was inducted as treasury secretary. In the summer of 87, the economy-- with no forewarning collapsed. 

Reagan let the economy tank, thinking that chasing a war with rebels would win them the desert wars in that period. In the early 80's he made deals with different sheiks and oil barons, who were apart of H.W. Bush's Inner circle. 

It was about control, destruction and recovery. We never recovered from that and analysts were shaking about how there would be even more to come. 

Reaganomics is that, in itself because the austerity with world banks and international trading would forfeit any liens against america for siding with the enemies. 

We were fighting them then and we are fighting them now. 

we have trillions in printed money, which if injected into the economy COULD SAVE IT. But it wasn't. it's still being held, because of matters of the fiscal cliff. . .Or at least the government version of it. 

The fiscal cliff was warned by scholars and experts in the 70's to now. When reagan decided to begin a war on drugs during a failing american economy, it broke us even further and there are even more drugs on the streets. 

When farms shut down and had to be sold, because their crop didn't put them in the black when they tried to convert their crops, 
thousands and thousands of lifelong farmers, where turned away from Government subsidies that would help them convert their soil into a cash crop. 

Nope. A lot of this stemmed from that era and there are thousands of other fiscal atrocities from the Reagan era, because of it. 

That era did nothing for america, except tie us into the world banks and make sure that the FED would stay private to pitch out as much money as possible. 

When you can take the dollar down to less than a certain percentage, you can tank an economy whenever you want. Letting it linger at 60%, Banks and Corporations can do whatever they want.

investing,Talking Gold Manipulation with GATA,"By Michelle Smith - Exclusive to [Gold Investing News](http://goldinvestingnews.com/33634/gold-price-manipulation-gata-central-banks-united-states-federal-reserve.html)

GATA, formally known as the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee, insists that a gold cartel is  suppressing metal prices and aims to expose the group’s secret activities.

Gold Investing News (GIN) contacted Chris Powell, treasurer, secretary and director of GATA, and had an extensive discussion about what is going on in the gold market.

GIN: Can you outline how the gold manipulation scheme works?

CP: Sure. Central banks that want to support their currencies and support the US dollar in particular want to control interest rates and government bond prices so they intervene in the gold market by selling their gold outright, by leasing it into the market through bullion banks and the BIS, and by swapping it to other central banks that will be doing these sales or leases. They also sell gold options and futures contracts through the BIS. They do a lot of shorting of gold to control the price.

GIN: Who is involved in this manipulation scheme?

CP: I think all the major western central banks are, if not participating, then at least aware of it and cooperating. I think all of the western central banks who were identified openly as being part of the London gold pool in the 1960s are certainly cooperating with it. Though I think the major ones lately have been the US, Bank of England and the Bundesbank. But I think any central bank that has been identified as having swapped or leased gold is a participant.

GIN: So, you’d say that the gold cartel is composed of central banks?

CP: It is a central bank scheme but they operate very often through agents like bullion banks. JP Morgan Chase and HSBC. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland conducts much of the gold trading for the western central banks. So certainly the BIS is an agent as much as the bullion banks are.

GIN: Who does gold manipulation affect? Is the negative impact just limited to gold investors?

CP: Oh no. It’s the destruction of all free markets. It’s the destruction of transparency in government. Certainly gold investors and mining companies and developing countries that rely on the production of commodities for their livelihood are terribly harmed.

But from my standpoint as an American citizen and a journalist who wants transparent government I think the greatest casualties are free markets and accountability in government. This scheme is a matter of rigging markets surreptitiously and when you rig markets you don’t have free markets anymore. And when you lose free markets you lose your competitive economy as well as your democracy when such major government action is undertaken in secret.

GIN: Is gold manipulation done mostly through leases, swaps and selling gold?

CP: Not only gold, but futures and options as well. They are hugely capitalized operations so they have very deep pockets. The can probably sell gold futures and options to an extent that no buyer can compete with them. And most buyers will be driven out the market by the amount of imaginary gold that central banks can sell because they have the ability to create money in infinite amounts.

GIN: How do the bullion banks and the futures market factor in?

CP: Because central banks trade through them, they are acting as agents. Whenever there is any crisis in the financial markets, where do the Fed and the Treasury go to try to put together a bailout? They start with JP Morgan Chase.

The use of New York investment banks by the US government, particularly JP Morgan Chase, that’s public record. I’m sure if you asked for access to all the communications between the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury and JP Morgan Chase you would get a lot of interesting information if it was made available to you.

But again, these are questions that are best put to central banks. I am only a derivative source of information. I can’t speak for the Fed and the Treasury and the Bank of England. I can show you the exchanges we’ve had with them. I can show you what has come out as a result of our suing the Fed. But we are not the possessors of the original information here. We are not the original sources.

I have always marveled that we should be questioned at GATA before any questions are put to the central banks about their policy in the gold market. I think if you pose questions [to the central banks] that are specific enough that you will find pretty quickly that the door is slammed in your face.

GIN: You said the motive for gold manipulation is to control interest rates and bond rates?

CP: If you read the academic paper which is on GATA’s internet site called Gibson’s Paradox and the Gold Standard, that paper analyzed the historical relationship between gold and real interest rates. If you read it I think you will indeed find there is a historic relationship. And indeed gold is pretty much by definition a determinant of currency value and interest rates and by extension government bond prices.

Gold  is a terribly important determinant of the value of other financial instruments. We have collected a lot of State Department memorandums, CIA memos and documents throughout history about the importance the US government put on controlling the gold price. Many central bankers have made statements signifying that the gold price is of great concern. Governments have always sought to control the gold price and that’s what the Gold Standard was really about.

GIN: If gold market price control has pretty much always existed, does the tactic remain the same? Or does the gold cartel switch up how they control the price from time to time?

CP: Well they certainly change their mechanisms. Back in the 1960s the western central banks were controlling the gold price in a forthright but very costly fashion. That is, they were dishoarding a lot of metal out of their reserves and they lost a lot of it. And as they were down to the last tonnage they decided they couldn’t do it that way anymore

They’ve come up with a much more efficient and powerful way of controlling the gold market insofar as they’ve created a vast imaginary supply of what we call paper gold. That is certificates claiming ownership to gold. Central banks realized that they could basically underwrite the paper gold market run by bullion banks by advancing gold to bullion banks as necessary to avert a short squeeze in gold when bullion banks sold more gold than they could deliver.

GIN: Can you help our audience better understand Bill Murphy’s [of GATA] comment about central banks realizing in 2001 that there was too much gold at too low of a price? He said central banks then embarked on a management scheme that has been ongoing now for 12 years.  

CP: I think he meant western central banks had to unload some of their gold into the market to cover the short position built up by the bullion banks.

There was something called the gold carry trade that went on during the 90s. We believe it was effectively devised by Robert Rubin when he became Treasury Secretary. In the gold carry trade a lot western central banks leased gold at a very low interest rates to bullion banks. Bullion banks sold the gold and used the proceeds to buy government bonds paying something like 5 percent per year. And they collected a spread that was risk free as long as central banks could guarantee to make gold available in the event of any short squeeze.

Bullion banks made a lot of money. Gold prices were suppressed. Interest rates were suppressed and government bond prices were supported. This started to become a problem when the gold started to run out and production was decreased by the falling gold price. So all of a sudden the gold dried up.

I can’t prove it but I think the gold price rose between 2000 and 2010 despite central banks announcing gold sales every few weeks because they really were not sales at all. They were the cancellation of leases that had been issued in the previous decade. Central banks realized they could not recover their gold and so they agreed to let the bullion banks off the hook with a cash settlement.

GIN: If western central banks have lost most of their gold, leased it out, swapped it, sold it and they do not have the physical supply that they claim to have, now, with so many emerging central banks in the market, why would western central banks not also be buyers?

CP: Number one we don’t know that they are not also buying. But I don’t think they would necessarily announce it. I can give you some examples of how official gold is wrong or just misinformation. But I do think the western central banks that have been leasing of swapping the gold are in some trouble here.

GIN: You have central banks that do report their purchases and sales. Given that gold is so important and western central banks do not have the metal that they once had, why are there no reports of western central banks buying gold when we see emerging nations central banks buying at an increasing pace?

CP: I think its because there is two groups of central banks operating in the world, an eastern group and a western group. The western group is along with United States in suppressing the gold price to support the dollar. The eastern central banks are not part of that and I think they see gold as a very good reserve asset long term. Not every central bank in the world is in on the gold price suppression scheme.

A few years ago among the Wikileaks cables that were leaked were cables from the US Embassy in Beijing, China to the State Department in Washington. They were translations into English of Chinese government news agencies reports about the western gold price suppression scheme. The significance of these cables is that they show that the Chinese government long has been aware of the western gold price suppression scheme and the US government knows that the Chinese government knows.

GIN: Okay, so the US government then is leading the way of  gold suppression along with other central banks? But whoever actually has physical gold is ultimately going to be able to control the gold price, is that correct?

CP: Yeah, I would say whoever has the most gold is going to run the gold market. And whoever runs the gold market is going to run all of the world currency markets and probably all of the interest rates and government bond markets as well. Because the gold price is going to determine all those things.

GIN: And as far as we know it is predominately emerging markets who are stocking up and in essence gaining control over the gold market?

CP: Well they are certainly gaining influence but we don’t know how much. The official gold reports are notoriously unreliable. Everybody expects that China is acquiring a lot more gold than it is reporting. A few years ago, China went for something like five years without reporting any increase in its gold reserves and then one day reported it had a vast increase in its reserves. That vast increase did not happen overnight. The same thing I’m sure is going on right now.

This a matter of the highest national security. Western central banks do not want the world to know how much gold they have in the vault and how much they have leased or swapped out. Gold being an incredibly powerful weapon.

GIN: So, GATA is raising the money to prepare lawsuits against the Federal Reserve, the US State Department and the US Treasury Department [to sue for all their gold records]?

CP: Yes, we are trying to raise the money. We filed informational requests with the Fed, the State Department and the Treasury Department seeking access to all their gold records. Those agencies have not complied with our requests and we are now eligible to sue them in federal court. That kind of litigation we have not undertaken because we just haven’t raised enough money.

GIN: How much does legal action like that cost?

CP: With this kind of lawsuit, such a comprehensive request, against such major elements of the US government, I don’t think I would want to get into it without having at least half a million dollars in the bank. It could cost substantially more than that though. I think the explosiveness of the material being sought is just overwhelming.

GIN: Over the time that GATA has existed, how has sentiment toward your organization changed?

CP: I think it’s changed vastly. I think at first the attitude in the gold world was we were nuts. Now, I think the attitude in the gold world is that we’re probably onto something and certainly no one wants to argue with us because we have all of this documentation we offer up and it can be argued with.

GIN: If miners were to attempt to make a case to shareholders that they want to invest in supporting GATA, what could a company say it expects to get in return?

CP: As I said, if we could raise a half million or a million dollars we would undertake these Freedom of Information lawsuits against the Fed, Treasury and State Departments. And within a year or two I think we might extract some information as interesting as the information we extracted in our [previous] lawsuit against the Fed.

Now, that information by itself won’t do any good but if it is publicized enough and if it exposes the gold market as rigged then the gold market will collapse. Nobody will trade there any more and people will try to undertake some other mechanisms for buying and selling gold.

That, I think would be an immense benefit to the mining industry in the monetary metals. I think if the world every wakes up and realizes that say something like 75 percent of the investment gold it thinks it owns does not exist and its really a paper claim at a bullion bank that does not have the metal, then the price of investment gold and silver will rise.

GIN: Whether you look at the futures market or ETFs, there are clearly a lot of people who have no interest in taking possession of the physical metal. Why do you think it will be such a bombshell if gold manipulation is unveiled to the mass public when that would mean the current system can work without the underlying gold?

CP: I think it would give gold investors pause. This is realization we are trying to bring to gold investors around the world. That if you are not prepared to take delivery of the gold you are buying and move it outside of the banking system and you are investing in gold as a hedge against inflation or a currency collapse or whatever, you might as well just flush your money down the toilet. Because people who are running the world financial system can create infinite amounts of the unreal.

GIN: Taking physical possession and the gold manipulation scheme are basically concerns for people who are using the metal as a hedge against inflation or some type of currency collapse?

CP: It is for anybody who is buying gold because he wants the price to appreciate or the protection that gold can provide. Infinite paper will be created to keep the price down. That’s the scheme now. Central banks have decided that they can beat gold only if they are dishonest and deceptive and create a lot of imaginary gold that doesn’t exist. And that’s how they preserve more of their gold reserves.

GIN: As this scheme has been existing plenty of people have made lots of money with just paper?

CP: Yeah, that’s right and we argue that this is a controlled retreat by the western central banks as their gold reserves are being bleeded out. And they are just trying to bleed them out as slowly as they can.

Bitcoin,Reposting a comment that I think needs wider exposure...,"I made this comment earlier but it was buried in a long thread.  With all this talk of ""bubble"" I feel it needs to be seen.  

It's important to realize that if an asset is undervalued, people would rather hold while it reaches it's proper value before they spend. This is perfectly natural in a free market and an important part of describing the collective valuation of said asset. I'm not spending my bitcoins because I know how rare they are, how revolutionary they are, and how useful they are. Considering the price at this point, I'm not comfortable with parting ways with any of them. If the price spikes up to a more favorable value, it will make me more comfortable with my position to start spending fractions of a coin. 

For far too long we have had an economy based on spending, and keyensian theory. An unadulterated savings and spending equilibrium is what makes bitcoins so attractive. There is no third party capable of manipulating interest rates for savings, which in turn lowers the rate of savings and people spend more. Yes, we want economic activity through spending of bitcoins, but only if it's at a market rate. **We can't force people to spend**, that removes the romance of bitcoins. We want people to spend as they see fit.

Bitcoin,Just a short heads up if you are thinking of buying now,"I consider myself an average person, and as one of the average i came to know about bitcoin with the last media reports about bitcoin.

I have been looking at what bitcoin is, set up a miner and then a day later looked up on how you buy coins.

I got really excited about investing as i would have already made a 50% profit if i invested the first day i learned about bitcoin.

But being an average joe and realising there are lots of people like me out there i got a little doubtfull. So i decided to read stuff the community posts at the moment to see **WHO is giving bitcoin value** at the moment. This made me even more doubtfull and I decided against investing:

With the rise in worth/BTC the market is only attracting people who want to invest, not those who want to actually buy stuff.

Offcourse I see that a market to buy stuff is there and growing BUT we are talking about the value of a bitcoin, and it is people that give the coin its value, and to get an incentive to where the value might be going and how stable it is I like to put a bit of thought in why people put a certain value to it at the moment.


My conclusion is that the only reason why people are putting the current Value on BTC is **hope**, noone came to know of bitcoin, surfed around, and saw some neat gadget he wanted to buy and did so by paying with BTC.

The only true people who did put value in BTC were the stoners seeking to buy weed and drugs, this is the one backbone BTC has at the moment and it's at about 1-10 Dollars/BTC
With this i don't want to say tht BTC will drop to that price again, as the community did grow since then.

So first conclusion: Only hope is driving the current value of BTC.

Second topic: Who are the bigger shareholders at the moment?
The people who are driving the economy are the ones who invested early(duh). These people are your average stoners and normal guys who jumped on early this year investing a few bucks. They now, with the current evaluation control a big portion of the market, they decide where it is going, not intentionally, but with their thought on what a BTC is worth and if they rather cash out or stay in the market.
**What smart money would do:** If they are smart, they would now sell the tiniest possible tradable portions to new people wanting to invest. **Why?** Because this puts more players on the market, and single orders dont influence the course of the BTC as much anymore.

**What these people are probably gonna do** They are probably freaking out at the moment at the fortune they are making and when the BTC hits a certain value, they are going to sell some of their BTC to buy something nice(To them it will only be a small amount of their investment they are gonna cash out, as they invested early), as they are not selling the smallest possible units but are rather bigger chunks of the momentary market, this will make big waves that could easily make the course drop below what people who are just now starting to invest initially paid. 

So at this point they are gonna just sell their btc again, and think about how stupid but be happy that they made no big losses.
They are now just watching the market and waiting.
As this happens to more and more people, less new costumers come and the guys who invested early might think now is the time to also buy that car or pc etcpp.

This is probably gonna happen when the Trend dies down, just keep an eye on ""Bitcoin"" on google trends(if in 7 day mode, ignore the current day, pay attention to the last 6)

**TLDR**: Don't invest in markets only driven by hope and where the biggest shareholders aren't smart investors",cryptocurrency,1364988324

http://www.teslamotors.com/about/press/releases/tesla-unveils-revolutionary-new-finance-product

PALO ALTO, Calif.-- Tesla Motors announced today that, in partnership with Wells Fargo and US Bank, it has created a revolutionary automotive financing product that provides the best elements of ownership and leasing to Model S customers.

Most people throughout the world prefer to own their belongings, rather than rent what is essentially someone else’s property via a lease. However, leases do provide some key benefits, particularly a low initial payment, tax deductions, lower risk on resale value and the convenience of returning a car without the hassle of reselling it personally.

Working with some of the largest and most respected banks in the country, Tesla has been able to create a new kind of financing product that combines the security and comfort of ownership with all the advantages of a traditional lease. Like the Model S, this product was created from the ground up to provide maximum benefit to consumers, rather than simply duplicating other financing programs that tend to favor companies at the expense of the individual.

How does it work?

US Bank and Wells Fargo have agreed to provide 10% down financing for purchase of a Model S (on approved credit.)
The 10% down payment is covered or more than covered by US Federal and state tax credits ranging from $7,500 to $15,000. New Jersey, Washington and DC also have no sales tax for electric vehicles. These advantages are not available when leasing.
When considering the savings from using electricity instead of gasoline, depreciation benefits and other factors, the true net out of pocket cost to own a mid-range Model S drops to less than $500 per month.
After 36 months, you have the right, but not the obligation to sell your Model S to Tesla for the same residual value percentage as the iconic Mercedes S Class, one of the finest premium sedans in the world, made by Daimler (also a Tesla partner and investor).
Not only is Tesla guaranteeing that resale value, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk is personally standing behind that guarantee to give customers absolute peace of mind about the value of the asset they are purchasing.

investing,Bitcoins - some basic concepts... but only recommended for speculators...,"http://weird-economics.blogspot.com.es/2013/04/bitcoin-bit-what.html

You've probably already heard people talk about Bitcoins, especially during the Cypriot debt crisis last week. It seems that some Cypriots tried and are still trying to exchange their Euros (or at least part of them) for Bitcoins. So I guess it's about time that you learn about the basic facts of this new currency.

**What is Bitcoin?**
Bitcoin is an electronic currency which was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. It's based on cryptographic keys and a P2P network which is formed by the users who run Bitcoin clients. Each transaction of money between users is recorded in a public database.


**What can I buy with Bitcoin?**
There are some small companies that accept bitcoins for all kinds of services: internet hosting, blogging, online gambling, etc. But even some big well-known entreprises like Wordpress accept payments in this new electronic currency.


**How much is a Bitcoin worth?**
A bitcoin cost about 20$ at the beginning of 2013, but it's risen to more than 120$ lately.


**What's the difference between Bitcoin and “traditional” money?**
Almost all national currencies are controlled by a central bank which manages the money supply by raising or reducing interest rates. The value of “traditional” money depends entirely on the capacity and possibility of exchanging this paper money for physical goods and services.
Unlike “traditional” money there is no central bank which controls the money supply of bitcoins. New bitcoins are generated with digital signatures (“bitcoin mining”) and the (future) supply of bitcoins is limited to 21 million units.


**How and where do I get Bitcoins?**
You can buy them on websites like MTGOX or can accept payments in Bitcoins. And you'll also need an application like BitcoinQT or Armory Bitcoin in order to use and manage your bitcoins.



**What are the advantages of Bitcoin?**
Bitcoin can have many advantages. For example:

    * All payments are anonymous.
    * You don't have to pay any comissions to any “middleman”.
    * Nobody can rob you: your Bitcoins are clearly yours.
    * It's very difficult (if not impossible) to counterfeit bitcoins.
    * Any payment made in Bitcoin is irreversible. This means nobody can trick you when you try to sell something on the Internet.



**Are there also some disadvantages and even risks?**
The biggest disadvantage is that there are not that many stores that accept Bitcoins. And there is also one majoy risk: many analysts and prestigious economists (like Sala i Martín) are already talking about a “Bitcoin bubble” - you could lose a lot of money if you bought Bitcoins right now!",finance,1365108244

economy,Is the brazilian economy behind the eight ball?,"Some economists argue that the Brazilian Federal Government has stimulated the consumption of the so called 'new middle class' far too much, by steadily increasing the minimum salary above inflation and allowing unprecedented access to cheap credit, while granting 'strategic' tax exemptions to key manufacturers of consumer goods (mainly automotive industries), fuel, electricity and food, in order to try and control the inflation. 

It's important to note that this policy has worked out surprinsingly well for the economy in the past decade, despite fierce opposition and some political instability in the beginning. Few economists, if any, will disagree that it has indeed transformed the lives of many and turned Lula into a living legend of brazilian politics (enough so to elect Dilma Roussef as his successor). However, once the historically repressed demand for credit began to cool off and unemployment rates fell to record lows, this policy ended up putting too much pressure on the price of services. And now we might just be at a cross roads. 

Brazil's Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance now face the challenge of curbing the high demand for services and the cost inflation that is corroding industrial profit margins for years, if they want to keep inflation within the target of 6,5% a year (tops). At the same time, however, they also need to boost the economy. Since the internal market is giving clear signs of saturation, economists believe there are only two ways out of this mess: to invest heavily in infrastructure and/or debase the currency. Most say that the USD should buy up to R$2,90 (it's currently at R$2,09). The tricky question is: how could the government possibly do that without generating even more inflation?

The generally agreed upon remedy for this situation, now that it has come to this terms, seems to be raising interest rates, which are currently at a historicall low record of 7,5% a year. But this would make it all the more difficult to invest in the already critical infrastructure projects (such as Belo Monte dam and the high speed train connecting Rio to São Paulo), which apparently won't be coming through any time soon (mostly due to bureaucracy and corruption). Even with current interest rates, because of the not so bright picture of the future, brought about by the sparkling of the global financial crisis, the private sector seems to be holding back on investments. Now, if we also consider the fact that the government has no money of its own to invest, given the record high spending in the last decade, that makes it all even worse.  

My question to you is this: if you had the power and the authority, what would you do? Of course, fiscal reform is inevitable. That is the root problem, in my opinion. It is because of reckless government spending (not borrowing, just spending) that the pressure on service prices has gone this far. Most economists seem to agree that the low interest rates and the growing purchasing power of the population would not have caused this alone. But here's the thing: that fiscal reform will take too long. Something needs to be done right now, so that we can buy more time to cut back on the government spending spree. 

Would you keep the low interest rates and an overvalued BRL, trying to control inflation through tax exemptions? This seems to be the government position so far. Would you devalue the BRL to have greater economic growth, while risking losing control of the inflation? How about raising the interest rates, as most economists are suggesting? I'd really like to hear your thoughts on this, if you will.",finance,1365104056

I want to get rid of the credit card debt I have, consolidate into one place, and close the accounts. I don't want the accounts open, because I tend to fall back on bad spending habits when I do have them.

The Discover and Mastercard A are both in 0% intro rate status at the moment. 

The Discover promotion will end in June and Mastercard A in September. 

The Question! Should I wait to payoff Mastercard A until September, while it’s at 0% interest rate or just do it now. I’m bad at math. What I’ve done for math shows I won’t be saving much either way. I'm going to use the loan for 3 of the cards. The Mastercard B I'll pay off separately.

Under the standard 10-year repayment plan, the monthly payment would be about $2750, which is obviously impossible at this time. But they do have a income-based repayment plan if you have financial hardship in which case I am estimated to be paying about $380/month.

My question is: since I don't know of any low-risk investment options that will definitively give me a 6.8% or better annual return, should I just put off retirement investing for now and pay off the loans as quick as possible?

Public opinion on a popular doctors forum seems to be to try to pay off as much of the principal as possible during residency ($4000/mo income, so maybe at least $1000/mo into paying down the principal) and then when becoming a full doc, just pay it off as fast as possible (low end salary of $10K/month up to $20K+/month as a full doc). So if I can keep living expensive down to $1k/month, then I can put something like 8-9K+ a month into the loans. Hopefully will be paid off in 3-4 years and then start investing?

I've graduated in December and immediately started a great IT job out here in Silicon Valley making pretty good money.  Having a more stable life due to the new income and I've been on a book reading binge on investing and personal finance.  I finally sat down and did a budget finally and I've been sticking to it for a month or so.  I'm currently paying student loans also (58K in student federal loans so the interest isn't too bad, around 3.5%), but this isn't so much the issue currently.

My question is in regards to my new savings (my old one was depleted) by the time I moved out here).  I able to stack away only 5% of my paycheck into my savings (emergency fund) currently (5% also goes into my 401k which matches 4.5%).  

In regards to the 5% I am saving aka emergency fund, I wanted to start having it deposit into my brokerage account and at the end of every month, buy some Fixed income ETF's (very stable gains).  I've been doing a lot of research and for the long haul, these seem great.  It's a very liquid form of investing, easy to sell and transfer the money out in case of emergency.  

I'm wondering if I'm better off just leaving it in my savings account currently or having the 5% direct deposit into my brokerage account (sucks that the sweep account only pays .01%), but have the chance to invest into these ETF's.  I do a lot of research before I invest into these funds so these are calculated risks that I have gotten into and I feel will give me long term dividend growth).


EDIT: In regards to the CC's, The minimum payment's are $120 dollars per month and I'm currently paying off @ $200 dollars per month.

I would love some feed back on this idea if at all possible.

Thanks a ton Reddit!

EDIT: I have an extra $150 in my account at the end of the month when all my expenses have been paid and that is also giving my personal spending money (around 10% of my total income) for the month so I want to know what to do with it?  Sack it away in savings? leave it in my account as a cushion? or apply more of it to my CC debt",finance,1365089499

personalfinance,"Getting fedup with debt, but serious about Savings.","26 yr old male, with a wife and 1 kid. Living on dual income both full time, and *still* barely above water with an 'extra' $100 a month.

I recently sold some things and paid off one credit card, and utilizing Dave Ramsey's snowball method to start paying down everything else. (Working on a second CC now, with its horrible 25% interest rate).  I have set up a budget recently and just need to stick with it and it should save us a some money. Looking at the bigger picture, and our debt reduction plan, our 'big payoff' is so damn faraway (2023 including mortgage, 2017 without) it seems impossible. My mind is going 'why do I want to live like THIS for another 10-15-20 years of living paycheck to paycheck, just to 'pay off debts'. That is, if I just keep paying minimum on everything I'm living paycheck to paycheck. If I use that one CC payment paid off to snowball into other debts, I'm STILL LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. That is the frustrating news.

The good news, one CC paid off, working on paying the other two off, two car loans, and student loans. Everything extra I have plus the snowball will go into the next debt. That's a -long- way off. I currently have $1500 in an emergency fund. I contribute 4% of my weekly income into an employer matched (4%) 401(k). I'm looking to bolster my savings and actually make it INCREASE instead of sitting in a stupid .04% interest account. I put about $50 a week into a savings account (just today switched that from the Emergancy fund).

I need **your** advice what to do. I was thinking about taking stopping my 401(k) contribution, and opening a Roth IRA through my bank (USAA) which has a 10 year return about 8%. I consider that a good deal. Then again 8% on say $1500, is still pitiful.

personalfinance,"Should I invest my excess income, or use it to pay down my mortgage?","I'm a 28 year old unmarried man in the US with no immediate future plans to have children, move, or change career paths.  I bought a house last year, own a relatively new car, and don't have any major expenses coming up for the foreseeable future.  I have a good job in the IT industry that seems pretty stable, but even if something were to happen to it, I'm not worried about my ability to find another job if necessary (in fact, a recruiter came after me unsolicited just yesterday).  I'm not sure whether it makes sense to continue investing most of my excess income, which I've been doing in the past, or to put a lot more of it against the principal on my home mortgage.  Previously it made sense to invest because I was saving up to buy a house, but now that that's happened, I don't know whether to change my strategy.  Here are my stats:

$90K gross annual income, 12% of which is deferred into a 401K.  I also max out my Roth IRA every year.

Net monthly salary income after taxes, 401K, and pre-tax transportation expenses is $4,500, plus $1,200 monthly I get from two renters.  Monthly costs are $1,530 for home mortgage (including taxes and insurance), $460 for auto loan, and something typically in the range of $700-$1,000 for all other expenses including groceries, entertainment, utilities, hobbies, etc.  The home loan is a 30-year fixed standard mortgage at 3.375% that I have about 29 years left on, and the unpaid balance is $275K.  The auto loan is a 3-year loan at 2.25% that I have around a year and a half left on.  My only other debt is on credit cards, and they get paid off every month.  I never had to take on any student loan debt.

My assets include a house ($350K), a car (who cares, I'm not selling it), unencumbered stock investments totalling $120K, and retirement investments (a mix of Roth IRA, Rollover IRA, and 401K) totalling $115K.  I have a few thousand dollars stashed away in an emergency fund (I know someone is probably going to complain about that being too low, but I'm not enthralled with the low rate of return on savings accounts available).

Here's my dilemma: Out of the $1,530 monthly mortgage payment, $1,200 of that is for the loan itself (not taxes or insurance).  Out of that $1,200 a month, $750 goes against the interest and only $450 goes against the principal.  I've been paying an extra $600 per month so far against the principal just because I really don't like the idea of paying more for interest than principal (which *feels* like paying an interest rate of &gt;50%, even if it isn't so).  I've also been investing $2-3K per month in stocks.  Does it make sense to decrease my monthly stock investment and put a lot more towards the principal on my mortgage to rapidly bring down the amount I lose to interest every month?  Or are the expected returns from stocks still greater?

I know the interest rate on the home mortgage is only 3.375%, which is very low, but it doesn't feel like it when most of the base payment every month is going towards interest.  $750 per month in lost money to interest is a lot; it's more than I've ever paid in rent (though of course when I was renting I didn't have rooms of my own to rent out).  In comparison, on the auto loan, I'm paying less than $20 per month against interest and over $440 per month against principal.  There's no temptation to make extra principal payments against that loan because the stock market can almost assuredly do better than that pitiful return, but the home mortgage?  If I only pay the normal statement amount every month I'll have paid around $520K by the end of the thirty years (ignoring taxes and insurance), on a loan that was originally in the amount of $280K.  But big extra principal payments now, when I'm paying the most in interest per month, will bring that total down rapidly.  So: Pay down the home mortgage quickly?  Or continue investing in stocks?",finance,1365087073
Bitcoin,What would happen if the government created a rival cryptocurrency?,"Bitcoin is decentralized and free of government control, which is what many people like about it.

But nothing prevents the government from making its own rival cryptocurrency, valuing its units in terms of dollars, and allowing people to easily switch back and forth between regular fiat and cryptofiat. 

A currency like that could have many of the advantages of bitcoin: peer to peer transactions, mining rewards, decentralized transaction confirmation, impervious security, anonymity, carrying money in code form, etc. You could also use it for things like colored coins, assurance contracts, and all the other possibilities being explored with bitcoin. There could be a reddit usdtipbot!

The only thing you couldn't replicate is bitcoin's deflationary nature, and it's freedom from government control. Cryptofiat would inflate, since the government could always authorize new lines of cryptofiat even if individual lines had a limited amount of coins. And of course, a new type of crytocurrency could have additional features the government wants to make it easier to track people, discourage illegal transactions, automatically catch tax avoiders, etc.

But it would have fiat's advantages: relative stability, increased trust, universal acceptance, can be used in central monetary policy (both good and bad), etc.

So, the question is: what would happen if the government ever released cryptofiat?

My own opinion is that it would be good for fiat. Cryptofiat would just be improved fiat, with more potential uses. All the good and bad of fiat, but with plenty of new high tech possibility.

It would probably be bad for bitcoin though, since cryptofiat would directly compete with it. For example, bitcoin is great because you can transfer money without paypal or a bank, but bitcoin would have less going for it if you could also do that with cryptodollars or cryptopounds or cryptoyen. 

That would leave bitcoin's only advantage the fact that it's free of government control and inflation, leaving it in the role of virtual gold. But since most of bitcoin's current immense price is based on the idea that bitcoin will be the currency of the future, that might cause a drop in price if/when fiat currencies copy bitcoin's advantages and move into its online territory.",cryptocurrency,1365084602

Bitcoin,Crowd sourcing justice for market manipulators.,"Essentially we are in the wild wild west days of Bitcoin. One of the beauties of Bitcoin is the fact that it isn't regulated by any central authority. So Bitcoin will always be in the wild wild west.

Back in yonder days you had people who came out west to find a new life and live honest and you had bandits who came to prey on those honest folk.

When a town finally got fed up with the robbing, raping and murdering they formed a posse and brought justice to the bandits.

Eventually bandits learned to avoid certain towns more than others because it wasn't worth the risk.

With this market manipulation of Bitcoin I suggest we do something similar. There are those among us who want to see Bitcoin succeed and prosper and then there are bandits who just want to make a quick dollar at everyone else's expense and don't care about the legitimacy of the market.

Let me be clear, in the next few days I'm sure CNBC and BBC and everyone else will be running stories about how Bitcoin is destined to fail due to the fact that anyone can manipulate the market and that's why we should keep our money safe and sound in centralized regulated banks and just do what our masters tell us because it's a scary world out there with bad people in it.

I say we fight back, we have thousands of analytic minds at our disposal in the Bitcoin community.

If the exchanges (mtgox) were to basically encode user names or account numbers with hashes then release the buy/sell data for 10 minutes before the DDOS, during the DDOS and after the DDOS from both attacks people could sit down and analyze the transactions to find a pattern. If someone is always there at just the right moment and making a profit from each DDOS attack (I'm sure there will be multiple accounts, its obviously not just one person) but this suspicious behavior should leave a pattern. Now this obviously might lead to some people being wrongfully accused of market manipulation but it should at least narrow it down to a list of 'suspect accounts' as it were. Then the exchanges could target these accounts for further scrutiny and whatever they chose to do (suspension or trade limits or whatever) to these accounts will help make it more risky to be involved in market manipulation.

We don't want a SEC for Bitcoin but I think that it is up to our community to police our own if we want it to succeed otherwise we might as well abandon all hope.

It's just a thought and I'm sure its not the only idea out there but what other ways can people think of to stop market manipulation on a large scale like this involving DDOS?

personalfinance,"Considering switching banks, how will this affect my credit score?","Hi everyone. This has possibly been answered in the past, but doing a search hasn't gotten me the information I'm looking for, so I figured I'd pose the question.

I had an account with Chase while I was a senior in high school into about my sophomore year of college. I got fed up with them when they screwed up a check I deposited and it took me about half a year to get that money back and I got so pissed I switched to TD. 

TD has been okay to me, but I've had my share of issues. They've blocked my transactions on multiple occasions, despite me calling in and telling them that I know what I'm purchasing and that it's perfectly legal and whatnot (for the record, those purchases were on Greenmangaming.com, I was buying games. That site is flagged as online gambling for whatever reason, but 2/3 times that I called in to get them to let it go through they refused). I also have a student account, which won't last forever, and when it ends I'll probably end up having to pay fees and have deposit/account/transaction minimums. Plus the ATM fees. 

So for all those reasons, and the higher savings account % (though not as high as some other places), I've decided to switch my account to, most likely, Charles Schwab. I've heard great things about their service, no fees/minimums, etc. 

Problem is, as I understand it, switching banks means that Schwab will be looking into my credit history and this may hurt my credit score (which is pretty good right now, I think). Also, I've heard that just the act of switching banks may hurt it. Is this true? If so, how much would my credit score likely drop? 

I mean, I'm 22, so I don't expect to have to take out any big loans/mortgages in the near future, but I'd like to keep my score as high as I can. 

Any information/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

personalfinance,Negotiating terms on an old credit card and a bonus question about balance transfers.,"Recently I've made smart decisions and paid off some nagging debt on a store card, which opened up my credit utilization and seemed to have triggered more interest in me from credit card companies. My only current debt is $540 on a really crappy Capital One card with a $750 limit, an annual fee and over 20% APR. With my Bank Americard rewards card I recently was approved for, I did a balance transfer so I don't have to pay interest since I have already budgeted to pay that off by September or October. 

Now that the balance transfer is complete, I have an empty card I dislike and two much better cards with no fee. I'd like to keep the Capital One line because it's one of my longest-open lines of credit, but I'm not sure how to go about asking for no annual fee. The limit and APR I can take or leave since I don't plan on using it much, but I also don't want the account to close up and reopen if I ask for no annual fee. Does anyone have any experience with this specifically and can you offer advice? Should I just close it and deal? 

My second question is about a different balance transfer. I was recently approved for the Chase Slate card at the mid-tier APR and introductory 0% interest for a year, including on balance transfers. My balance is already done, but now that I'm almost done paying off my debt I would like to help my boyfriend. Before anyone jumps to ""don't do that for someone you aren't married to,"" we have been together for five years and lived together for most of that, we have very entwined finances already and may actually get married in the future. I'm not worried about it and I consider it a gift to him, because his creditworthiness is how I've been able to get apartments and get on my own two feet. 

He has $17k in debt (his father died and he took on a lot of expenses, plus made some iffy decisions when he was younger) and is paying it off about $3k a year, but I wish to help him once mine is clear because interest pushes him back. He has a few smaller debts that he could use a balance transfer on, and I offered up my Chase Slate card for that and he and I can just pay that off so it doesn't accrue interest. However, is this a problem because it's in his name and not mine? Would they allow a transfer like that?

Thanks in advance. Last year I got my body into shape, this year my finances. Reddit's an amazing place.

Edited for clarification: I wouldn't be taking on his whole debt, or even most of it. Perhaps $500-$1000, he needs to give me a list of his cards, balances, and interest rates and we'll go from there. If this doesn't work out, then I plan to either set up one of his cards on my bank's bill pay center and pay it that way or send him money for it, but if we can use the lack of interest till 7/2014 I would like to.",finance,1365192425

The total number of Bitcoins mined so far, and potentially available for use (not accounting for people who lost their keys), is nearly 11,000,000. At $140 per Bitcoin, the current value of Bitcoin emissions is **$1.5 billion**.

This is larger than the Eastern Caribbean Dollar (used by some 600,000 people, as well as partially in off-shore banking). It is almost as much as the Costa Rican Colon (national currency for some 4 million people).

Does Bitcoin even have 4 million people who have access to it? Does it have 600,000 people who use it on a daily basis? It seems doubtful.

According to the [2010 Federal Reserve Payments Study](http://www.frbservices.org/files/communications/pdf/press/2010_payments_study.pdf), in 2009 there were 115 billion of just **non-cash** transactions in the US:

    Checks        24.5 billion
    ACH           19.1 billion

    ATM            6.0 billion
    Total        115.1 billion

In the US in 2009, that averages out to about 1 **non-cash** transaction, per person, per day. I have no estimate for the number of cash transactions in addition.

Meanwhile, the average number of Bitcoin transactions per block right now is [335](http://blockexplorer.com/q/avgtxnumber). That's on the order of 50,000 transactions per day. Drawing a parallel to USD, that's, perhaps... equivalent to 40,000 people regularly using Bitcoin? But with many of those transactions being speculative, due to recent publicity it has received?

Bitcoin has promise, but it has major shortcomings that have not yet been overcome.

If it becomes more successful, those who benefit from the current financial system may act to make exchanges into and out of Bitcoin *a lot* more difficult - it may become a currency only exchangeable in black markets.

It does not seem to me that a price of $140 reflects real, long-term demand for Bitcoin that's sustainable given the options that exist right now. If you're buying it at $140, you're making a bet that it will be more successful in the future, and it won't run into major obstacles.

So what could I place my savings into that gets better interest than a savings account, but doesn't have restrictions on withdrawal such as a CD has.",finance,1365183769

finance,Does increased regulation increase the cost of lending? Why?,"Hi, stupid person here. 


I'm working on a presentation on banking regulation and I came across this article that states that the cost of lending increases with increased regulation. 


Here's the quote I'm confused about. 


*INSEAD Professor of Banking and Finance Jean Dermine cautions some of the proposed regulations are going too far. In a new white paper entitled ""Banking regulations after the global financial crisis, good intentions and unintended evil"", he says these regulations may safeguard banks from future meltdowns but the economy could suffer because the supply of loans would be severely curtailed. In other words, the new banking regulations threaten to keep too much money in the vaults and not enough in the economy. ""This is an overreaction,"" Dermine told INSEAD Knowledge, ""because we should not forget that banks are extremely useful in the real economy, to finance lending to consumers and small and medium-sized companies. If you come with stringent regulations, **the cost of lending is going to go up tremendously**. The cost of bank loans to small firms will increase.""*


Can anyone kindly explain why the cost of lending would increase? I'm guessing it's because since banks would be required to keep more in reserves, they are going to have less capital to lend out - thus increasing the bank's required return, which would be the interest rate. If banks had more money to ""play around with"" they would be able to accept lower returns (issue loans at lower rates) and would be able to lend more funds.


So, decreased supply of loan-able funds = higher interest rate, right?


But how is this a cost to the bank? Is it that less in the quantity of loans (which would be an asset to the bank) means less earnings?


I'm confused. Please help.",finance,1365182040

Bitcoin,"""But they're untraceable! People could use them to buy drugs and weapons!"" (Responses for anti-BitCoin arguments)","**But they're untraceable! People could use them to buy drugs and weapons!**


Yup. And if I withdraw 500 bucks from my bank account and give it to some shady dude for a few ounces of ganja or a pistol, well, that transaction doesn't exactly come with a printed receipt, does it. 


**But the bank will still have a record of you making the withdrawal.**


They'll also have a record of me withdrawing the money I used to buy a coin at a Canadian exchange. That's pretty much meaningless in the grand scheme of things.


**But criminals could use BitCoin to launder money!**


Oh, you mean what HSBC, the largest bank in the UK, is now facing a 640 million dollar fine for doing? Or how HBUS, the American branch of HSBC, accepted 9.6billion in cash over two years from subsidiaries without checking where the money came from? You mean like that?


**But...well...they could launder it more EASILY through BitCoin!**


And it's easier for me to kill someone by unloading a .45 into their chest than by using a rusty fork. If I'm intent on doing it though, I'll find a way regardless of what tools are available to me. It's not like murder never existed before guns did. Thankfully, the vast majority of the population would never dream of committing such a heinous act. Most of us are pretty good people. 


**What about teenagers and kids? They could have easy, anonymous access to illicit drugs online!**


Riiiiight, like I ever had a problem buying drugs as a teen and hiding them from my parents. If a kid has a choice between buying pot from a friend, or transferring money through an exchange to a virtual currency and then trying to figure out where the hell he is going to mail it to, which do you think he's gonna choose? Besides, a lot of teens have free, instant access to drugs through their ignorant parents' medicine cabinet. Maybe we should teach our kids the actual truth about drugs, like how some aren't any worse than drinking a six pack with a buddy, but others are as bad as knocking back a 2.6 of rye and getting behind the wheel of a corvette. Most of the time, people don't make an informed decision because they haven't actually been informed yet. 


**But the guns! What about psychopaths buying unregistered weapons?**


What of it? It doesn't really change the fact that 99.9999% of us would never dream of taking another person's life. A person doesn't suddenly ""become"" a psychopath simply because he's presented the option of committing a horrible act. I have all sorts of pointy objects in my kitchen I could use to harm people with. If I was crazy, I probably would. I prefer to use them to make dinner after work.


**It's a useless currency though. You can hardly even buy anything with it.**


Really? I'll sell you my mint condition complete in box copy of Super Mario 3 for 0.40 BTC right now. Besides, do you think when the Native Americans came up with the idea of using Wampums for personal exchanges that every one in the village just accepted this over night? It took awhile. Then the New England colonies came in, having learned how to cultivate the scarce mollusk used for this currency, and completely devaluated it, ruining their entire economy. 


Kinda like what the Fed does when it prints paper money.


**But websites are never 100% secure! And a lot of BitCoin wallet sites have been hacked recently! You could lose everything!**


Yup. I could also have 50 grand in gold coins sitting on my coffee table when a burglar breaks in. Or, I could have them in a fire proof safe that's bolted into the concrete behind a hidden panel of my closet. That's the difference between having an online and an offline BitCoin wallet. I guess I could keep it in the bank too, but if I'm not careful with my personal information, it would be easy for a thief to assume my identity and drain my savings. Or even worse, we could have another Cyprus indecent where the people I entrust my money to decide to take it anyways.


**It's too complicated though. Your average person will never be able to learn how to properly use it.**


Those were my thoughts when I used to surf BBS sites and chat on IRC back in the 90's using the ""internet"". Roughly 2 and a half billion people do the very same now.


**But what happens if some malicious force decides to buy up half the bitcoins, send them to an address, and then delete the private key! Wouldn't that destroy the currency?**


I hope they do. That will make the few coins I have about a thousand times more valuable. And either way, money was exchanged for them. Probably shouldn't sell a huge amount of coins though for paper. People have always seemed to like gold and silver though.


**Well, even if this whole BitCoin thing ever starts to truly catch on, the major banks will step in and shut it down. They won't tolerate that competition.**


No, they certainly won't. Powerful people only have a two-fold agenda, and that's to keep the power they have, and to acquire more; they'll settle for the latter in risk of the former. But what then? We all just roll over and accept it? Are we really to the point where we can see the corruption around us and just don't care enough to do anything about it? Have we bought into the whole ""one person is powerless"" garbage? The only reason they would try to shut something like this down is because they're afraid of losing their influence. I would be too if I was in their position. The fact is, power rises and falls. The universe has a tendency of seeking to balance things out, and we're all an instrument of it. I've heard people say that the real reason the US went to war with Iraq is because Saddam stopped trading oil for USD. And if you look around, you can see a bunch of conflicts started soon after an action was taken that would threaten the petro dollar as the world reserve currency. These guys are serious.

personalfinance,Brother is in extreme debt with no job and needs help,"Hey guys, I'm asking for my brother, who is hopeless and worthless.  He's currently out of a job because he got fired, and apparently has not paid any bills at all for several months.  He lives with our parents, but has his own car (paid off but a piece of shit), his phone bill (which he stopped paying, and when they shut it off he just stopped using it) as well as a few credit cards and loans which he owes on.

Just a few minutes ago, a man came serving him an order to appear in court, Vantage Credit is bringing him to court over a $4,xxx loan which has gone unpaid.  It was one of those they send a $5,000 check in the mail, and if you deposit it you basically have the loan from them.  Interest is 11.9%, and like I said he has like $4,XXX outstanding.  

He has no money, no savings, no income, only his federal refund to his name.  He can't even go on unemployment because he was fired for workplace negligence.  My parents have maxed out everything they have (credit cards, home equity, etc etc) with other shit, and I'm only friggin 19 and trying to keep my head above water.  So we have absolutely nothing for a lawyer or anything.

So my question is, there's all these ""debt consolidation/ elimination"" whatever places you hear about, are any of them truly legitimate?  Are any of them cost-free?  Is there any way to actually settle all of his debt and for him to just pay a low monthly payment?  I'm talking like less than $50 a month.

Barbarino replied with the following: 

""Smallest to largest ignore the interest rate... Also you are far better off not contributing anything to your Roth until you pay your CC off. You can't save and pay debts off at the same time... Think about how much more you can save for retirement if you didn't have any of those monthly payments.. That's how you have to look at it...""

Which got me thinking... If I understand compounded interest correctly each year you fail to contribute makes a significant difference in the final years of my Roth.

For example:
If I started my Roth when I was 25 and maxed each year gaining 8% I would have $1,424,810.85 when I turned 65.
If I started my Roth at 24, only one year prior, at 65 I have: $1,544,295.72.
Contributing $5,500 into my Roth vs paying off my school loans generates an extra $119,485. This significantly trumps the approximate $14,000 I will pay in interest over the next 12 years paying off my school loans.
Can someone verify my logic?

Bitcoin,What merchants should do right now and why.,"Offer huge discounts of 30% or more. This adds value for the consumer by saving them a good amount of money. Money motivates people, and if it means they can save a lot of it they will look into it. If they don't value their time really highly they will more than likely go through all the rigamarol to get some bitcoins just to save some money. Aggressive discounting if done widely enough will lead to aggressive adoption, and with aggressive adoption comes aggressive deflation, and with aggressive deflation each of the those few bitcoins you got will be worth more a lot more. Essentially you are reinvesting capital that you spent on making or acquiring your products into bitcoin. This is much much better than investing directly in bitcoin because you are adding a ton of value to the consumer for using bitcoin. If your margins are high enough you still might even make a profit at the time of sale but if not and the currency takes off at some point in the future you will actually have effectively made a larger profit than if you sold it at full price and the currency takes longer to catch on. Your betting on bitcoin appreciating more than your loan is. For example if your loan has 10% interest rate and you offered 40% discount and you have 20% profit margin to break even bitcoin only needs to go up 60% to break even and 100% to come out ahead. If enough people offer massive discounts it would not take long for mass adoption. Imagine if everything was 50% off on amazon, people would go crazy.

Now this probably is not the solution for businesses that barely have enough cash flow to make loan payments and such. This being said our 2 person startup has 60k in loans but in a month or so we will be offering our first product on sale online. The pricing we are looking at right now is dwolla transactions are normal price, paypal pay 5% more, bitcoin 50% off. We have enough cash flow to make minimum loan payments. We are betting on bitcoins appreciating more than the few percent interest we are paying for the loans. This way we are essentially leveraging our capital investments that are tied up in the equipment to make our products to get bitcoins. Depending on what your profit margins are and what discount you offer you will only be risking profits, if you costed out equipment depreciation, and everything you are only not making money instead of loosing it if things don't take off before you need more liquid capital. However you still have risk if bitcoin completely collapses you'll be out what ever costs that were in the products you sold with bitcoin.

personalfinance,College freshman with loans: What to do with money from summer internships?,"Hey there guys,

I tried searching but haven't been able to find something that's quite my situation, so I decided to just make a new post.

**Here's the background story:**

I'm a college freshman at a prestigious university studying computer science and engineering, possibly double majoring in business as well. I'd had my heart set on going to this university since middle school, so when I got in, even though it wasn't exactly within my parents means to fully pay for my college education, they decided that they'd do whatever they could to help me pay for it.

Essentially, my parents are contributing $30k a year and I'm taking an unsubsidized Stafford loan for $5.5k per year since it has a lower interest rate than private loans. The rest (approximately another $20k a year to be conservative about it), is coming from loans that my parents are taking out under their name so that we can get lower interest rates. It's within their means to pay those off, but since I have a little sister and I don't want to screw her college options over, I will be doing my best to pay those loans off myself.


**Now here's where I need your advice:**

Partly because of prior experience and partly because of pure luck, I'm going to be interning at a rather successful startup in the Bay Area this summer. After living expenses, transportation, and food are taken into account, I'll be making a cool $15k over the summer and I'm just confused about what to do with it, or money from future internships in general.

My gut instinct is to put it all towards the loans with the highest interest rates, but I know that I don't know too much about personal finance. I reasoned that it's possible that something counterintuitive like putting it in a retirement fund or investing it somewhere might work out to be more beneficial, so I just wanted to get some advice. Based on what I've seen and experienced and been told at my university, once I graduate, the combination of my degree, work experience, and skillset should have me making $100k+ a year in the Bay Area if that provides some further information regarding how likely it is that I'll be able to pay off those loans in the future if not now.

Thanks in advance and sorry for this really long post!

personalfinance,Interest Rate Charge on Expenditures after Credit Card Balance Transfer,"Hello

Recently I needed to transfer some balance from one of my credit cards to another one (From Citicards to Discover Card). I was paying my debt on Discover Card slowly. And doing my regular spending on Citicards, since it had zero interest rate, and a nice reward system (Actually I pay in full at this point, so I don't need the zero rate much)

Then I lost that Citicard, and replacement got lost in mail. I started using Discover Card (The card I used to transfer balances) for regular expenses. I did this for three weeks.

But now this is what I am curious about. When I pay money to Discover, will they first count this payment to offset my balance I got for transferring my debt, or will I be first paying for my expenses that I recently did, and then will be payingfor transfer balance? As far as I understand, my debt has two tiers, one tier has zero APR, other tier has 12% APR. 12% APR expenses came after the first part of my debt. If I don't get to pay that last expenses first, it means I will be paying APR from that point on until I eradicate my first part of debt. I know credit card companies are sneaky, but is this the case now?

business,Own gun control plan proposal keeps on,"http://hendrengroup.biz/blog/2013/02/09/own-gun-control-plan-proposal-keeps-on/

WASHINGTON — House Democrats will unveil 15 proposals for curbing gun violence that resemble President Barack Obama’s plan and will include a call for banning assault weapons, people familiar with the package said Wednesday.
The Democrats’ recommendations will also include barring high-capacity magazines carrying more than 10 rounds of ammunition, requiring background checks for all gun sales and prohibiting gun trafficking, all of which Obama proposed last month.
The proposals, to be released Thursday by top House Democrats, were described by people who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plan publicly. They represent the initial House Democratic response to the horrific Dec. 14 shooting of 20 first-graders and six adults at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.
Even so, the Democrats’ proposals are unlikely to go anywhere quickly in the Republican-controlled House. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said the House will wait to see what the Democratic-led Senate does.
Obama’s gun control proposals have been opposed by the National Rifle Association, which is a potent lobbying force on Capitol Hill. In addition, some Democrats — including many from rural or conservative areas — have been reluctant to endorse the president’s plan.
That hesitation was underscored Wednesday at a private retreat Senate Democrats staged in Annapolis, Md. At that session, Democrats largely embraced expanded background checks on gun sales, but some senators expressed a desire to avoid voting on an assault weapons ban, according to two people who described the closed-door session only on condition of anonymity.
The House Democrats’ recommendations were proposed by the 12-member House Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, led by Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif. Two-thirds of its members had to approve an item for it to be included in their plan, meaning there likely will be Democratic dissenters to some of the ideas.
Among the task force members was Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the House’s longest serving member. Dingell has been a strong ally of the National Rifle Association, though he has clashed with them on some issues in the past.
There has been strong public support for expanding background checks beyond the current system, in which the checks only cover sales by federally licensed gun dealers. The checks are aimed at weeding out gun sales to criminals, people with mental health problems and some others.",finance,1365231326

I want to move back to the city that I am originally from, but I feel like renting is just wasting money, should I look towards buying a house here first?

Downside to just buying one in my home city and rent it out?


Regarding IRA/401(k), I contribute 6% to my 401(k) (traditional, not Roth) which is the maximum amount that my employer matches (they give 300% for the first 2% and then 100% for the next 4 meaning they contribute 10% of my paycheck).  Are there downsides to increasing this % so that I can hit the yearly max?

Does the $17,500 maximum contribution mean that the sum of my contribution AND my employers contributions cannot exceed $17,500 or just mine?

I have not made any contribution to a Roth IRA for 2012 yet.  I am planning on contributing the max $5,000 before the deadline in 10 days and then $5,500 for next year since I found out that this principal can be withdrawn without penalties if I decide (this would be if I needed a down payment on a house or related matters).  My 401(k) is set up through fidelity and I was just going to use them for my IRA instead but I hear good things about Vanguard... Thoughts?  Also was going to put all of this into index funds, but recently have been reading posts that say target date funds are better, any reason why other than this mixes in bonds?  What's the benefit assuming I re-balance my investments more and more into bonds as I grow older for less risk?

personalfinance,Need advice concerning student loans,"I have a number of student loans that are getting difficult to pay off. I currently owe over $75,000 in federal student loans, plus a private loan. I can manage the private loan, but the federal loans are getting out of hand. My income is about $40,000 a year. I'm in the U.S.A. The loans are a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized federal student loans. My statment says FSL but the online site says FFEL.

For this month I owe over $1500 due to missing the first payment after coming out of forbearance. I don't expect to have enough money to pay this off this month nor the next one.

What are my best options? I can only find four options: forbearance again (and handle the increased capitalized interest later), new payment plan, or restructured loan.

The new payment plan requires my account to no longer be delinquent in order to be eligible for an IBR. I don't see this being possible without borrowing money.

My main concern with the restructured loan is that from I can see my options are more limited in the future if I restructure. And unless I get a reduced payment with the new loan I'll still not be able to pay the monthly payment (even though its lower than what my current combined payments).

personalfinance,Need help figuring out savings contribution as a percent of pay.,"Hello everyone,

I've read that you should aim for 10% savings (at least?) per pay check, and I have a few questions regarding this rule of thumb.

First, is that 10% of your pre or post-tax pay?

Second, I am not sure how to factor the Agency Matching contribution into this.  As I am a Federal employee, my retirement fund is the Thrift Savings Plan.  Into this, I make the 5% pre-tax contribution which gets matched 5%.  So that's 10% of pre-tax there, but I am wondering if this gets factored into the 10% savings.  

On top of that, I am making a Roth contribution (also into my TSP account), which amounts to just 2.64% of gross pay, but 5% of after-tax pay.

I would be contributing more, but I also am repaying a debt consolidation loan, which I took out to get some old credit debt refinanced at a lower rate.  I also try to put what amounts to 12% of my after-tax pay into a savings account, to eventually own a home.

Overall, I guess I have no idea how I'm measuring up.  I realize the goal is to live as frugally as possible, while still enjoying life, and putting as much away as you can.

personalfinance,"Looking for some extra input on debt, retirement and general money advice. (US)","First - throwaway because I didn't want so much financial information tied to my primary account.

I just wanted to throw out my current situation and get some extra feedback on my progress and things to consider going forward over the next few years to decades.

Me (25) and my wife (24) are currently married, filing jointly, dual income no kids with a taxable income of +/- 100K/year and non-taxable income of an additional 30K.  We rent ($1,900/month) and are not in a situation to purchase a home anytime in the next 5-20 years.  My credit score is 685-740; the high one is because TransUnion doesn't have my only major negative information (3 consecutive missed payments on an electric bill 3 years ago because of an autopay screw up on my part) in their report.  My wife's score is in the low 700s.  I am currently on active duty in the military with two more years of obligation and then plan to either get out if my wife goes to medical school (lets ignore that for the time being) or stay in and retire after 20-25 years total.  I do work in a field that I would be quickly employed at roughly the same pay if the military thing fell apart; my wife is also highly employable and if laid off (very unlikely) getting a new job would only take a few weeks.  My income will grow significantly in the next few years and my wife's will probably stay steady (more pay but less hours in the future).  Plan to have a kid in maybe 5 years or so.

**Assets:**

-40K in various retirement/investment accounts; 14k in my wife's 403b, 6K in my old 403b, 10K in my Roth IRA and 10K in a Vanguard taxable investment account, plus a few grand in my new TSP.  Most are earning 8-12% a year right now.  All but $500 is fully vested at this point.

-2 cars, mine worth 3K (owned) and my wife's worth 6K (financed); both conservatively priced per Craigslist and KBB. 

-Savings account with 5K in it as an emergency fund

**Debts:**

-3K car loan on my wife's car

-Total of 25K in student loans at 6%

**Budget**

-We bring in 10K a month and spend about 9.5K total

-That includes 600/mo to my savings account, 600/mo to my Vanguard investment account and ~450/mo to my IRA (set to max it out over the course of the year), and 400 to my student loans.

-If need be (job loss, emergency, etc.) we could quickly cut spending to around 5K a month.

-My wife puts 10% into her 403b and I put 11% into my TSP all pre-tax.  The plan is to push both of those up to 15-20% once we move (locally) in a few months.

Now on to the advice.  First on, if you have any recommendations right off the bat that would be awesome.  Most of these accounts are fairly new (1-3 years old) so I'm not set in my ways at all.  My savings account is used as my emergency fund and my automatic investments are mentally separated for short-term savings.  Over the last 3 years the account has never been below 5K even with my occasional withdrawals for vacations and other short-term expenses.  I have never had to utilize the emergency fund to this point; we just cut down spending for a month or two and put the expense on a credit card.  We never carry a balance forward or miss payments.  We have about 15K total credit limit and rarely exceed 3K (and rarely that high) before paying off in full each month.  I could also tap into my Roth if needed for a major emergency.  Plus family and a plethora of military programs are available in a *GIANT* emergency to cover costs.  I'm sure a lot will suggest increasing my emergency fund, I just wanted to mention why I, in my likely incompetence, think it's adequate currently.

Some things I was wondering.  Since I've been researching finances more recently I wanted the community input on my debts.  Is it better to take my taxable Vanguard account and pay off about half my student loan debt now or keep it in place because the interest rate is under my current rate of return?  Does the community suggest I keep the automatic investments in place or switch to only debt reduction?  

We aren't overly interested in cutting down on spending.  We do eat out frequently, spend a lot on entertainment and go on semi-frequent vacations.  That's what we enjoy doing, as so long as we're saving a decent amount we're not interested in retiring early if it means cutting down on having fun now.  We also have expensive hobbies, so that doesn't help.

Looking to the future I plan to use that Vanguard investment account as a long-term savings account.  I plan to use some for a house down payment (or just pay cash for a house outright), a college fund for any potential children, and an additional retirement fund.  We are aiming to retirement from full time work at age 45 (if I stay in for 20 years in the military) but continue to work per-diem making roughly the same as pre-retirement (pension + salary) for about 10-15 years and not touching any of the retirement savings until that point.

So, now any suggestions, recommendations or harsh criticism?  Should I just sell it all and join the circus?  I have been reading this subreddit plus a few early retirement and general investing websites/forums, so bring on your worst.  Please.

What bonds are currently most popular in state, federal, and foreign countries (other than America), and how effective are they?

Finally, I wanted to discuss infrastructure bonds. To me, infrastructure includes roads, buildings (including public schools), telecom, and whatever else you can think of in air, land, and sea. India has Long Term Infrastructure Bonds - ""These tax-saving bonds let you invest indirectly on a long term basis, in infrastructure projects across the country and aid in the growth of India... investors can save tax and earn an annual interest rate of 8.70%""

So let's pretend that in America, you'll find the same options for a LT-Infra Bonds.
Is it popular? Are investors saving money? *Who* are the investors? Does America's infrastructure all at the local, state, and federal levels improve in 5 - 10 years?

I vaguely know about war bonds - you bought them and it paid for weapons, supplies, and food for the war effort. So comparatively, couldn't we the people buy infrastructure bonds to fight the ""war on infrastructural degradation""?

What other bonds and, if any, alternatives to revenue from tax be implemented to lift the economy and allow the people to better invest?

I honestly don't know his reddit page but I do know a copy of his reddit page on this website: http://www.playthegame.co/forum/topics/huge-alcatraz-leak-disgruntled-employee-leaks-lots-of-info

His Leaked Info:
Hey, ok so I'm new to this reddit thing but I heard that its a great place to talk about things (really don't know how this is different from a forum but whatever) so here it goes: I've got a bunch o* info to lay off my chest. So, I'm not going to get into too much detail here but I was affiliated with Treyarch and worked on the campaign as well as the recently announced zombie map Mob o* the Dead. What 3Arc did as an internal move to get high-quality DLC out fast is actually have the campaign team design and script Mob o* the Dead.

So, basically the zombie team has already a rough draft o* all the DLC maps they'll release (I don't know much about future ones though) and are currently working on DLC 3 and 4. So what happened with mob o* the dead (or ""Mobzies"" as was the working title [im not f****** joking here that was actually the working title]) was that Treyarch (or more accurately Activision) was imploring for DLCs to be ready faster (I'm not to sure about the details there, I wasn't involved on the business end o* things but that's what we were told).

So, right after DLC 1 dropped the zombie team started working on DLC 3 and 4. The zombie team subsequently sent us a rough draft for what they had in mind for Mob o* the Dead and asked us to develop it while they worked on the last 2 DLC drops (which by the looks o* things seem very big). They really only seemed concerned on the storyline aspect o* the map, other than that they were pretty lenient when it came to ideas. the zombie team really just gave us their input on MotD, they really did not develop it and most o* the contributions came from the campaign front (and frankly it's a radically different approach to z****** as I'll explain later).

I will confess I haven't played the map yet but know about most things it will incorporate as the final product rarely diverts too far from the original concept. The map, as you know, features a cast o* Hollywood ""gangsters"" playing fictitious mobsters within Alcatraz island. The overall idea was similar to have these 4 actors trapped in some kind o* time loop, with amnesia o* who they were as actors, fighting z****** in Alcatraz. Originally we had the roles for the actors envisioned for Al Pacino (whom we imagined wouldn't decline us as he starred in that god-awful Adam Sandler movie), Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Mike Madsen, but Al and Joe were working on movies. We eventually settled on having Joe Pantoliano and Chazz Palmentiri replace those characters. But before we decided on the whole Hollywood aspect, we settled on some ideas after what seemed like endless open discussions and brainstorming.

From what I could remember these were the ten ""things"" I know for a fact will be on the map:

a ""purgatory mode"" (the team was really hyped about this one)
varied kinds o* z******
a real cool side-quest
dynamic environment
zip-lines galore
horror/thriller theme
historically correct Alcatraz
not too hard for beginners
plenty o* new perks and guns
musical aspect
The first thing I want to talk about is this purgatory mode. Basically, once your character is downed and is not revived and bleeds out he access this new area called purgatory. Purgatory is actually like its own separate map (its absolutely massive) with an entirely different objective. There are no z****** in purgatory and its like this weird inter-dimensional trance space, and it may or may not have been influenced by LSD. The idea is that there's no time or space in this place. It's like this weird Pandora's box kind o* place with weird ass things everywhere. It's a huge part o* the side quest. And the whilst you are walking through here you are meant to get scared. You have weird voices telling you things and out o* place objects everywhere. While in purgatory there are no weapons, no z******, and no points. It's really more o* a discovery kind o* place. There are also buildable items located in purgatory that you can grab. Once the new round starts, though, you are pulled out o* purgatory and put back into the normal map, along with any items you find there. There's a lot in purgatory and even though this is a ""leak"" some o* its is quite awesome and I really don't want to ruin it for you guys (trust me once you play it you'll agree with me).

The n*** point are the ""varied zombie types"" within the map. The team wanted to do better than just add a zombie boss. There are actually 4 zombie type bosses throughout the entire map. The map is huge, mind you, and is divided quite liberally into 3 diverse sections and each section has a roaming ""boss"" (each one has their own abilities that differentiate themselves. But the idea is to f*** up trains, basically). There's also a fourth boss that comes every 4-6 rounds. Basically at the start o* these rounds the entire team spawns at an inaccessible part o* the map and stay there for the duration o* the ""mob"" round. They are then swarmed by huge amounts o* z****** going through everywhere (the z******' health stays the same after round 15 though). There is, I believe, a cap at 50 z****** for that round. But the z****** spawn above you and at your sides. After the round you get a Max Ammo, a perk-bottle, and you're given about 45 seconds to Pack-a-Punch (this is the only way you can do so in the map though).

The n*** bullet point is the side-quest. When we were approached by the zombie team with the rough concept for the map, they were very specific about the fact that it had to be in Alcatraz and follow a very specific chain o* events. We were actually given story-boards with everything that was to happen. From what I can remember from the meeting the narrative within the map starts off with these 4 actors trying to escape Alcatraz and while they're trying to they start getting fractions o* their memory back (remember I said they had amnesia). But there's this voice talking to them (pretty sure it wasn't Nolan North's character). And then it's gets really crazy. This voice (which the zombie team really never gave too much detail about during their visit) instructs the 4 mobsters to help these other characters escape from space. I might've missed some stuff since the only time I hadn't explained to me was when the zombie team came over and showed us the storyboards. But that's what I understood o* it (was pretty confusing though). I don't know any steps in this side-quest (wasn't my job to do that) but I do know that purgatory and this buildable weapon has a lot to do with this side-quest. Again, I'm probably not 100% on target with this as it wasn't my job to make the narrative and I was only ""briefed"" on it sometime about 2 weeks ago. But what I can say is that's its EXTREMELY CONFUSING.

Another cool feature we wanted to incorporate into the map was a great dynamic environment. Different parts o* the map have different ""auras"". For example, there is plenty o* fog on the outside areas o* the map. And the environment changes. About every 10 minutes it starts raining in the map (with thunder). I know the environment triggers certain events but honestly I don't know the specifics.

The main method o* transportation within the map are zip-lines. Now we decided to put a very intricate ""network"" o* zip lines. The player really has to know what zip line brings you where (since there's really zip lines in almost every room). But the idea with the zip lines was that you could get from one end o* the map to the other in about a minute, without really skipping ""significant"" areas in the middle where you would want to be able to get stuff.

Another ""creative direction"" we wanted to pursue was a strong horror/thriller aura to the overall map gameplay. We wanted the map to really scare you. A lot o* the zombie spawns are in places you don't expect. We also made it so the behavior o* the z****** isn't as scripted as in previous maps. One second the zombie can be walking and the n*** it can be full out sprinting at you. The map is also very scary in design. There are dead inmates everywhere and random loud scary noises.

The map is also as historically accurate to Alcatraz as we could accomplish without sacrificing gameplay factors. Lots o* the places we exact replicas o* the island (especially the warden's quarters). Treyarch actually hired a historian to help guide the team.

Another thing we were told to do by the z****** team was to not make the map too hard. So, what we did is make good weapons readily accessible and have a really good Sci-Fi esque weapons in the game. This one gun instantly ""vaporizes"" the z****** and turns them into this weird purple gas. It's almost instantly kills every single zombie within its range. We also made sure that not be too aggressive in early rounds.

We also wanted to incorporate lots o* guns fitting o* the prohibition-era timeframe. For example, we included the tommy gun (Thompson), the Uzi; as well as more modern guns (I don't have the names ready off the top o* my head). We also have the aforementioned gas gun (I remember the name was like a bunch o* numbers). As for perks I'm not so sure about ""old perks coming back"" (although I do know that Flopper is being revived in a kind o* nerfed form) but there are 2 new perks. The first I think is called bandolier. It gives your gun more bullets after killing z******. You pick up these little packets off o* dead z****** and it gives you more bullets (albeit at a slow pace). I know for a fact that we decided to balance the perk so that it only works on bullet-based weapons. The n*** perk in the map is called Two Times Tequila and what it does is that on certain weapons, If you buy them again or come across them on the mystery box, the gun is essentially doubled in all respects, granting x2 raw power, x2 ammo but the gun would cost x2 the original price and I'm pretty sure the perk is very expensive as well (not sure on the exact figure though). I do know that it stacks with all other existing perks (including the upgrade machine).

And finally I know that avenged sevenfold wrote a song for the map. I'm not really into heavy metal so I can't judge whether its good or not (haven't even heard the song) but I know they were called up to record the song for the map.

So, THAT'S ALL I KNOW. Again I won't reveal what my exact job was on the development o* the map (for obvious reasons) but I didn't deal too much with gameplay aspects so the vast majority o* the ""interesting"" stuff came from our original meeting with the zombie team and the subsequent team brainstorm sessions. But I've seen the map (haven't played it though) and am pretty confident that these features will stay true once the map is released.

gaming,Toys R Us misleading return policy + dumb customer support,"So, before you start this post, here's a link to Toys R Us' return policy: https://www.toysrus.com/helpdesk/index.jsp?display=returns&amp;subdisplay=returns

Prior to purchasing a Wii U, I looked up Toys R Us' return policy just to make sure of what I was getting into. Surely enough, I found two different clauses indicating what can and cannot be returned. Review the two excerpts: 

""Please note the following items: Pre-recorded movies &amp; music; computer &amp; video game software; trading cards; and breast pumps must be returned in its original, sealed and unopened packages along with an in-store receipt or online packing slip for refund. If the packages have been opened, the items may only be exchanged for the identical items or titles.""

Just to make sure, I scrolled down to their ""Exception to 90-day Policy"" and it states:

""Return Guidelines for Computer Hardware, Cameras, Camcorders, Digital Audible Players, Video Game Hardware, Personal DVD Player, No Contract Cell Phones and Baby Monitors.

We will accept returns of the following items within 45 days, from the date of purchase: Computer hardware (eReaders, Netbooks, Tablets); cameras; camcorders; digital audio players; video game hardware; presonal DVD player; no-contract cell phones and baby monitors. The original in-store receipt or online packing slip is required and the item must be returned in its original package for a refund or exchange.""

So, here I'm thinking, alright... video game software i.e. monster hunter 3 ultimate cannot be returned if I open it. However, video game hardware i.e. the Wii U console CAN be returned provided I have the original package and receipt. No where does it say video game hardware cannot be returned if it is opened, unlike video game software where it clearly states that. 

I buy my Wii U, am not happy with it after 5 days, attempt to go to the store and return the console (I bought 2-3 games, didn't even try to return those), and they say because it is opened, it is not eligible for a cash refund. So, I give them the benefit of the doubt and think I must have read the policy on their website incorrectly. I go home and re-read it at least 5x. It CLEARLY states I can return video game HARDWARE for a refund provided I have the receipt and original package. 

I call their customer support and, the first guy was alright, but he transfers me to some dude named Jules. Jules tells me electronics do not quality for a refund if it's opened. I tell him the website in no way indicates video game hardware does not qualify if it's opened. This is the best part... he tells me the Wii U is not video game hardware and rather, it's an electronic. So I explain to him that the Wii U, similar to the Playstation/XBOX, is considered video game hardware. He tells me no. So I ask him, then what is video game hardware? He tells me video game hardware are things like video games e.g. Monster Hunter 3. At this point, I'm confused and decide to ask him, ""then what's video game software?"" He pauses, ignores the question, and tells me in an extremely rude attitude, ""Look Sir, the Wii U is an electronic, NOT video game hardware."" At this point I get fed up and ask for a transfer.

After being transferred, first thing I did was ask the lady if she knew what video game hardware was. She agreed with me that this consists of stuff like the Wii U, Playstation, and XBOX. So, moving forward, I explain to her my situation and she tells me that I am reading the policy wrong. I ask her, ""how?"" She states that, because video game software must be unopened for a full refund, that this applies to video game hardware, too. So I tell her that the website does NOT state that and clearly says the opposite. She then tells me that it's inferred and that I'm basically shit out of luck. I decided to hang up as it was a total waste of time. 

Moral of the story is, Toys-R-Us is dodgy with their refund policy as any normal person would read it the way I do. Moreover, their customer support is both rude and dumb at the same time. I have never had this issue with Target who, in the past, I have been able to return video game HARDWARE without an issue. Disappointing as Toys-R-Us was an awesome store growing up.",technology,1365294616

personalfinance,will student loans keep me from qualifying for a mortgage?,"Essentially, I want to know whether or not I can qualify for a mortgage, given a very large student loan debt. 

I have around $200,000 in federal student loan debt from getting a professional degree. I'm *not* planning on paying it off any sooner than 10 years. I am currently on IBR. The school I graduated from makes 90% of those payments for me through their own public interest loan forgiveness program; I also qualify for the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which will forgive any remaining balance after 120 total payments. So I am currently paying under $100 a month, and that payment will only go up as my salary increases. Basically, I have no incentive to pay any more than the minimum required payment on my loans each month. 

Having said that, I'd like to buy a house. I think I'm in a good position to afford one. I make $80,000 a year, have no debt except student loans, have a 6 month emergency fund, and (with matching) contribute 9.5% of my pre-tax salary to a retirement savings account. I also qualify for a pension, which doesn't require a contribution on my part and increases each year I stay. My credit score is in the mid to high 700s. 

Within the next two years, I should have around $45,000 saved to put toward a house--more if my husband finds work. He previously made around $35k a year, but is looking for something a little better. He has no debt. Average home price in my area is around $100-150k for the size and locations I'd want. My goal would be to have 30% of the price of a house in savings so that I can put 20% down and have 10% for closing costs, repairs, emergencies, etc. 

So is my outrageous loan balance going to sink me? I'd hate to waste years paying rent when I could easily afford a home in reality, if not on paper.",finance,1365464264

Bitcoin,Suggestion: Gold is to cash what bitcoin is to the next inflationary cryptocurrency. Thoughts?,"Just thinking that fiat currency can sometimes be said to serve a purpose (if you believe that under specific conditions, minting new currency can be of value to the greater society). I personally feel the problems are that the monetary policy around it is not democratic or consensus-driven. So perhaps an inflationary cryptocurrency with no hard cap is in our future, not post-Bitcoin but complementary, with minting schedules that are decided by the express will of the people as dictated by cryptographic measures?

My train of thought is that fiat currency could never have come into existence without a scarce resource like the gold standard coming first. Maybe bitcoin is the new gold standard that we start with before deciding that we need another consensus-based cryptocurrency to act as a day-to-day currency rather than a store of value. I would think this would only be necessary to consider if the economic theorists are correct in their predictions of a wildly swingly commodity valuation for bitcoin.

And yes, I realize that libertarians will hate this, but please realize that the consensus might be in favour of fair and accountable taxation through inflation, rather than no taxation at all. You might get outvoted. Or progressives might get outvoted. One of us might fork to use a totally different economy. Who knows.

Regardless, exciting times :)

personalfinance,"Trying to change bad habits, would like some help","I have been bad with money as long as I can remember. Now that I've grown up considerably in the last few years, and gotten a very steady job, I am committed to getting better at it. I'm sure you've heard it all before, but I'd like some advice, and to see if I'm putting my money in the right places.

I also checked my credit score today through creditkarma, and had a 686, but it hadn't accounted for paying off a $2,000 credit card yet.

Income: My take home pay averages out to $1100 every 2 weeks. 10% of that is automatically put in a savings account, which is currently $500 (I have no idea what my interest rate is, but it's very low) (which I already understand is a huge issue and I am working on). I also occasionally work for cash fixing people's computers, but that's no more than $100/month.

I live in the midwest, rent pretty cheap (665/mo, +~110 total for internet, electricity, and water [only due every 3 months]). My fiancee will be moving with me in a month, and has agreed to help pay for bills. Other bills I have include:

* Student loans - ~$30,000 total, paying $315 a month. One being $450 (6%), and largest are 2 at around $7,600 each. All of my student loans except the small one are 6.8%

* Cell phone - $90/month. I understand this is a lot, but I'm not quite willing to sacrifice it, and will be converting into a shared plan with my fiancee this summer which we have agreed to split and this will reduce cost to about $65/month.

* Engagement ring - ~$1,000 total 0% APR until June 2014. I pay between $72-80 per month which is minimum or just over, which will clear the balance before the 0% APR ends.

* Credit card/oldest line of credit - just (last week) paid off $2000 balance, and is now at 0. Considering canceling and opening a new card at a different bank. Would like advice.

* I subscribe to Netflix and Spotify, which totals $20/month.

Other expenses:

* As I stated before, I am putting away 10% of my paycheck (~$200) into savings.

* I have 2 other savings accounts, and 1 checking account. One savings is for the wedding ($475, .75%, $150/month), one is labeled vacation, but could be for anything ($375, .75%, $50/month), and the checking is a backup and to help manage the savings accounts, which I contribute $10 a month to (a whole $20 right now, as I needed the money last month for food)

* I spend around $80 for 2 weeks of groceries

* I currently spend $60-120 every other week for gas, which depends on visiting my fiancee who lives an hour away. Once she moves in this will go down.


All of that gives me around $300 extra a month not dedicated to something, which really isn't that much, but I do find ways to make it all work. I am not currently putting anything in retirement, because I am playing catchup for poor money management in the past. I plan to start a 401k plan with my employer next year (or sooner if I can afford it). We are getting a significant amount of help with the wedding. The amount I'm saving now (plus some help from her) will almost cover all costs we expect for that.

So, /r/personalfinance, how am I doing, what could I do better, and what do you suggest? Thank you all for your help.

Since the U.S. has the worst maternity leave policy ever, we pretty much drained our savings so I could stay home for 12 weeks; thus, no cash.

Let's say for example, I buy a car on a loan (please, none of the 'buy used' schtick, just go with the example) for 30000. Give it a 6 year term, and an interest rate which puts the monthly payments at around 430. 

Now let's say I couldn't get my old car sold in time to make it the down payment, so it turns out to be a 0 down loan and 430 is my monthly payment.

After getting the new car, I sell the old one, and put $5000 immediately toward the debt (barring any other better uses for it like paying down higher interest debt).

So now the balance is at 25k.

The payments, as I understand it, would still be the 430/month, correct? 

Can I ask the bank to recalculate the monthly payments to be based on the new balance? Is that one of the reasons people refinance?

business,Crown Eco Management: Biomass Boiler,"Alaska, heavily forested, built on rock and surrounded by water, every commodity that enters the country arrives by air and sea. The use of oil is a struggle for both the economy and the environment. Oil must come from elsewhere and be transported but of course by additional fuel, fuel that is subject to oil price stability.

A site that could help giving a solution to the problem is the Southeast Alaska Discovery Center in Ketchikan. The site that provides information to more than a million visitors each year is also the site where a pilot biomass system is now coming to life. A two oil-fired boilers serving the 250,000-sq-ft center were replaced with a highly efficient system fueled by local wood was manufactured by Hurst Boiler &amp; welding Company Inc.
Another good thing about the project is that the hot-water boiler was custom-designed to fit within very limited indoor space.

To address concerns towards issues related to building space, fuel costs, comfort, reliability, simplicity of operation more especially environmental concerns, the biomass boiler system was developed by Hurst representative Gregory W. Smith of Global Energy Solutions Inc. under the direction of E. Dane Ash, project manager for Tyonek-Alcan Pacific LLC.

The excessive use of fossil fuels has been long a problem in any point of the world more especially to Alaska, the boiler system was intended to highlight how biomass can reduce or eliminate the use of fossil fuels. The Hurst S100 Series Fire Tube 27 HP Hydronic Water Heating Boiler features a pre-heater to optimize combustion and an underfeed stoker with dry-ash-removal system. The new boiler requires heating for a minimum of nine months a year; it is located at lower level of the Discovery Center. To protect form extreme moisture the local wood densified into fuel pucks is delivered to an elevated walking-floor storage bin in a vestibule area that is designed especially for the woods. It is important to protect the woods because the biomass-fired boiler can burn any wood product with up to 50-percent moisture content. Not to worry, freezing is not an issue because the walking floor easily breaks up any frozen contents.

Many benefits come along with the use of this biomass boiler, the country saved as much as two-thirds of the fuel costs. There is almost no residual ash when densified pucks are used. But, tree clippings from the Ketchikan walking trails will be ground and fed into the boiler, eliminating the need for transport to a landfill, burning, and other methods of disposal. The system easily can be replicated for heat or heat/power generation up to 20,000 kw.
Systems that were improved by the new technology include municipal solid waste, as well as woody biomass for steam production and steam to power. In June 2011, Smith was a keynote speaker for the fifth annual Native American Economic Development Conference in Anaheim, California, he proudly flaunted the initiatives being implemented in Ketchikan and shared success stories of biomass-fired boiler systems installed on institutional campuses and in manufacturing facilities throughout the United States, particularly in challenging and remote locations.

Assuming paying down the mortgage will not be a problem, should I go with a longer term with a slightly higher interest rate so I have greater flexibility? (mostly for investments) Or go with a shorter term with lower interest rate.  

15y are going around 2.5-2.75%, while 30y are going 3.5-3.75%

Is the flexibility of a lower payment of a 30y mortgage worth paying an extra .75% in interest?  The difference in he mortgage payment between 15yr and 30yr can be considered negligible (we are pretty conservative, and the extra money would go into savings/investing, and not be spent/wasted otherwise - ie: at a minimum, i can buy preferred stocks or exchange traded debt which can be fairly nonvolatile instruments that yield aroound 5% safely)",finance,1365399425
Bitcoin,"How much is bitcoin worth, really?","many friends ask me what the ""real"" value of bitcoin is. They thought it was too high to buy at 30, 50, 100 and 150 and every time it keeps going up. Therefore I decided to write some speculative value guide for anyone interested.

First and foremost, the value of any commodity is determined by demand and supply. If everyone can obtain something with little to no effort, that commodity will have little to no value regardless of how important that commodity may be. For example, air is free to breathe and water is relatively cheap even though they are life-essential.

The next thing to remember is that even if demand stays high, an unexpected super-spike in supply can crash the price. For example, natural gas prices have plummeted recently due to large finds in the last few years. Tomorrow, if a golden meteorite falls into our atmosphere, shredding itself and causing gold flakes to fall everywhere over a few weeks, gold price would plummet as well.

When the price of an essential commodity goes very high, alternatives become viable and human ingenuity will invariably invent it. This is likely to cause drops in value.

Even if none of the above happen, the value could plummet if people no longer want it as with the Tulip bubble in the 1600s.

That said, determining the ultimate value in bitcoin simply becomes determining how much of the economy adopts it. Some numbers from Federal Reserve help: http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/h6.htm

Given an extreme scenario, if every single USD in M2 is replaced with Bitcoin, the total value of a bitcoin would be:

10412000000000/21000000 = $495809

That is to say, bitcoin is used for savings, retirement and investment and not just as a cash measure.

If on the other hand, only M1 is replaced with bitcoin, i.e., bitcoin is only used as cash to transfer value but not as an investment, then the potential value is 

2472000000000/21000000 = $117714

More likely, only a small fraction of the economy would adopt bitcoin. Conservatively, I'm going to assume that this is around 1% and lets assume IRA investors do not use bitcoin, i.e., they won't be able to buy stocks with bitcoin. 

Then the potential value is $117714 * 0.01 = $1177

This considered USA adoption only. If we assume that half the bitcoin economy rests outside the USA, then BTC would be worth twice as much: 

$1177 * 2 = $2354",cryptocurrency,1365390150
business,"Jakarta Capital Environmental Blog, Crown Eco Management: Biomass Boiler Addresses Alaskans' Environmental, Economic Concerns","http://crowncapitaljakarta.blogspot.com/2012/12/biomass-boiler-addresses-alaskans.html
Jakarta Capital Environmental Blog, Crown Eco Management- The heavily forested city of Ketchikan, Alaska, is built on rock and surrounded by water. Every commodity that comes into Ketchikan must arrive by sea or air. The use of fuel oil is problematic for both economic and environmental reasons because the oil must be obtained and refined elsewhere and transported (using additional fuel). What's more, fuel oil is subject to price instability.

Southeast Alaska Discovery Center in Ketchikan, which provides information to more than a million visitors each year, is the site of a pilot biomass boiler system now coming to life. Two oil-fired boilers serving the 250,000-sq-ft center were replaced with a highly efficient system fueled by local wood. Manufactured by Hurst Boiler &amp; Welding Company Inc., the hot-water boiler was custom-designed to fit within very limited indoor space.

Under the direction of E. Dane Ash, project manager for Tyonek-Alcan Pacific LLC, the biomass boiler system was developed with Hurst representative Gregory W. Smith of Global Energy Solutions Inc. to address environmental concerns, as well as issues related to building space, fuel costs, comfort, reliability, and simplicity of operation.

The new boiler is located on the lower level of the Discovery Center, which requires heating for a minimum of nine months a year. Local wood densified into fuel pucks is delivered to an elevated walking-floor storage bin in a vestibule area built to protect against excessive moisture. (The biomass-fired boiler can burn any wood product with up to 50-percent moisture content.) An auger moves pucks from the storage area to a metering bin and into the boiler. Freezing is not an issue because the walking floor easily breaks up any frozen contents.

The boiler system was designed to highlight how biomass can reduce or eliminate the use of fossil fuels. Visitors can see the boiler operate through specially designed windows. In the hall just outside of the boiler room, the noise level and ambient temperature is consistent with the rest of the building.

Savings

Fuel costs have been cut by two-thirds. The densified pucks are used with almost no residual ash; eventually, however, tree clippings from the Ketchikan walking trails will be ground and fed into the boiler, eliminating the need for transport to a landfill, burning, and other methods of disposal.

The Boiler

The Hurst S100 Series Fire Tube 27 HP Hydronic Water Heating Boiler features a pre-heater to optimize combustion and an underfeed stoker with dry-ash-removal system.

Results

The system easily can be replicated for heat or heat/power generation up to 20,000 kw. In June 2011, Smith served as a keynote speaker for the fifth annual Native American Economic Development Conference in Anaheim, Calif., where he described the initiatives being implemented in Ketchikan and shared success stories of biomass-fired boiler systems installed on institutional campuses and in manufacturing facilities throughout the United States, particularly in challenging and remote locations. Systems include municipal solid waste, as well as woody biomass for steam production and steam to power.

personalfinance,Student Loan Question/Advice?,"Hello, I am new to reddit as a user but am familiar with how it works, and after a friend showed me that he uses this subreddit I browsed it for a bit and found some pretty handy advice. 

I was hoping someone could help me decide how to divvy up my earnings for paying off my student loans. I have been out of school a year and half and after bouncing around jobs I found a steady one in my field that will allow me to pay slightly more in the present and drastically more in the next 2 years than I am now. They are currently existing as follows (rounded for simplicity):

* Stafford Loan 1: Principal $12,830.00, Interest rate 6.55% 

* Stafford Loan 2: Principal $8,140.00, Interest rate 6.55%

* Stafford Loan 3: Principal $7,640.00, Interest rate 6.55%

They all have the same rate but are held through different lenders, so I was wondering if I was going to make a payment ranging from $300-600 a month depending on slightly varying paychecks (I get a ton of overtime some weeks and only a little some weeks), what would be my best allocation of funds percentage-wise? Should I pay the minimums on the lower 2 and try to pay the big one off first? Should I overpay about equally for all 3? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated, you guys and gals are awesome and hope you can lend me a hand!",finance,1365385498
business,CROWN ECO MANAGEMENT- SO WHEN DID ENVIRONMENTALISM LOSE ITS SOUL?,"The Vermont Times Argus published a spot-on review of a new book by Bill McKibben -one of many who made a career out of jetting between conferences about the environment.
It’s written by Suzanna Jones, described as “an off-the-grid farmer living in Walden.” She does not object to local power – but disagrees with McKibben about the trend towards industrial scale renewables. It is, she says, part of the mainstreaming of the environmental movement.
“In his 2008 book “Deep Economy,” Bill McKibben concludes that economic growth is the source of the ecological crises we face today. He explains that when the economy grows larger than necessary to meet our basic needs – when it grows for the sake of growth, automatically striving for “more” – its social and environmental costs greatly outweigh any benefits it may provide.
Unfortunately, McKibben seems to have forgotten what he so passionately argued just five years ago. Today he is an advocate of industrial wind turbines on our ridgelines: He wants to industrialize our last wild spaces to feed the very economy he fingered as the source of our environmental problems.
His key assumption is that industrial wind power displaces the use of coal and oil, and therefore helps limit climate change. But since 2000, wind facilities with a total capacity equivalent to 350 coal-fired power plants have been installed worldwide, and today there are more – not fewer – coal-fired power plants operating.
(In Vermont, the sale of renewable energy credits to out-of-state utilities enables them to avoid mandates to reduce their fossil fuel dependency, meaning that there is no net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.)
At best, industrial wind simply adds more energy to the global supply. And what for? More! More energy than the grid can carry, more idiotic water parks, more snowmaking, more electronic gadgets, more money for corporations.
Why should we spend millions of dollars to destroy wildlife habitat, kill bats and eagles, pollute our headwaters, fill valuable wetlands, polarize our communities, make people sick, mine rare-earth metals – just to ensure that we can consume as much or more next year than we did this year?
The costs of industrial wind far outweigh the benefits – unless you are a wind developer. Federal production tax credits and other subsidies have fostered a gold rush mentality among wind developers, who have been abetted by political and environmental leaders who want to appear “green” without challenging the underlying causes of our crises.

Meanwhile, average Vermonters find themselves without any ability to protect their communities or the ecosystems of which they are a part. The goal of an industrial wind moratorium is to stop the gold rush so we can have an honest discussion on these issues.
Why does this frighten proponents of big wind? Because once carefully examined, industrial wind will be exposed for the scam that it is.
McKibben’s current attitude toward the environment has been adopted by politicians, corporations, and the big environmental organizations. Environmentalism has been successfully mainstreamed, at the cost of its soul.
This co-opted version isn’t about protecting the land base from the ever-expanding empire of humans. It’s about sustaining the comfort levels we feel entitled to without exhausting the resources required. It is entirely human-centered and hollow, and it serves corporate capitalism well.
In “Deep Economy,” McKibben points out that the additional “stuff” provided by an ever-growing economy doesn’t leave people happier; instead, the source of authentic happiness is a healthy connection to nature and community. As Vermonters have already discovered, industrial wind destroys both.

gaming,Connect a gamer - Game testing gets a platform,"Hello all, I would like to have a chance to tell you about a project myself and a few others are working on to help shape the world of the gaming industry. For those of you have knowledge in the gaming industry (making/developing) you will know how tedious and difficult it can be to be provided with good help in finding bugs/glitches as well as overall getting feedback on the game as a whole. 

Connect a Gamer works to supply a platform for both gaming developers to fast tract their testing and be provided with helpful feedback to improve the game beyond bug/glitch fixes. Developers will contact a certain amount of testers or open their game to public on the site in order to do this. Interested? read on.

As gamers, your job will be to test the games. Thoroughly. Testing is not speed running the game and on your feedback saying the game was fun and submitting. A lot of the time testing is more ""if i run into this wall for x amount of time where the map doesn't quite meet up, am i going to fall through?"". This may now seem like a very appealing task now that i have buffed however in return for testing these games and based on how well done/helpful your feedback is you will be rewarded.

The rewards will be varied and will be based as i said before on how well the game is tested, you feedback will be not only looked upon by the developer but also your peers, your feedback comes first seeing others feedback comes after. No copying, that would be cheating now. The only downside to this scheme being we cant have people jumping from game to game just wanted free game time on something they want to play, this is why after you are done playing to receive your next test game you must provide sufficient* feedback.

There will be a level system integrated and only certain level testers will be able to play certain level things, this will all be fleshed out as time goes on. Connect a Gamer is still in its early days and would love the support of the /r/Gaming community. I hope you come into this idea with an open mind and an eager heart like us.

    &gt; Be in debt.
    &gt; Have Credit Card #1 with balance of $2,640 @ 18.999% APR (I know... I know...)
    &gt; Have Credit Card #2 with balance of $4,833 @ 19.999% APR (I SAID I KNOW.)
    &gt; Get tax refund of $1,500.
    &gt; Toss $300 into joint account with the wife.
    &gt; Sitting on $1,200 to either save, pay down a credit card, or fix my car. (which is making weird noises)
    &gt; Go out on Friday night to local wrasslin' show.
    &gt; Get within half mile of home after fun evening with the wife.
    &gt; Hit deer.
    &gt; Car noises are now worse than before.
    &gt; leaksbadman.jpg
    &gt; Insurance cuts me $2,774 on total loss.
    &gt; Sitting on $1,200 + $2,774 = $3,974 cash with $7,473 in horrible credit card debt.

YES, I KNOW. PAY OFF THEM CARDS. I have been working on it! Back in Sept 2011, it was up past $12k across 4 credit cards. Since I started paying down my debts, I've also gotten married and gone on a honeymoon. So that slowed me down a bit.

I'd like to think I'm still on track, chucking $150/month (sometimes more) towards CC#1 and $260/month towards CC#2. Recently checked my credit score, too:

* Equifax: 746/850, Above Average
* TransUnion: 772/990, Grade C

###The Simple Plan:

1. Use loss check as down payment on a vehicle.
2. Use tax refund to pay down debt.

###My Master Plan:

1. No down payment on car.
2. Drop the entire $3,974 on my higher APR balance (CC#2), reducing it down to a balance of $859.

###Alternate Master Plan:

1. Set aside $1,334 for down payment on car.
2. Drop $2,640 to eliminate CC#1 credit card debt, freeing up $150/month.

I'm figuring any car loan interest rate will be heavenly compared to my credit cards, ~~so going with the Dave Ramsey Rule of ""highest APR first""~~, it makes sense to me (right now at least) that I try to get rid of that 19.999% debt first on CC#2. This would free up $260 a month that I could use towards a car payment. That remaining $859 is a conundrum though... I could muster up maybe $100/month to get that gone before the end of the year, likely taking advantage of a 0% Balance Transfer on one of my other cards. That effectively takes me to freeing up just $160/month (Gain $260/mon from zero balance on CC#2, lose $100/mon for new balance on 0% transfer CC#3).

The Alternate Plan would get me a cheaper car payment, free up $150/month, and also knock me down to 1 credit card payment a month. It would just take longer to pay down CC#2 completely, so a ""snowball"" would be farther away. But it's the last debt balance, so that may not matter?

So which plan do I go with? Am I crazy for not doing a down payment on a car?

EDIT: Forgot, I bastardized the Dave Ramsey rules in my head. I started with lowest balances first to snowball up to this point, but recently switched my thinking over to APR's and not balances since I'm down to my last two credit cards, and a snowball right now could go in either direction. Still, to me it seems that freeing up $260/month in my budget on a higher APR is better than freeing up $150/month in my budget on a lower APR.

**Kill CC#1**: free up $150/month for car, put $1,334 towards CC#2, be down to one credit card balance of $3,499 at 19.999%

**Kill CC#2**: free up $260/month, use $150 of that for car and put $110 towards paying off that remaining $859 for 8 months, be down to one balance with $2,640 at 18.999%",finance,1365549038

Bitcoin,So you think you know about BTC? Everyone who is interested in BTC should read this...,"fyi - the use of the word ""scheme"" is not used negatively!

**BASIC FEATURES**

Bitcoin is probably the most successful — and probably most controversial — virtual currency scheme
to date. Designed and implemented by the Japanese programmer Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, the
scheme is based on a peer-to-peer network similar to BitTorrent, operating at a global level and used
as a currency for all kinds of transactions (for both virtual and real goods and services). It thereby
competes with official currencies like the euro or US dollar. The scheme maintains a database that
lists product and service providers which currently accept Bitcoins. These products and services
range from intemet services and online products to material goods and professional or travel/tourism services. Bitcoins are *divisible to eight decimal places* enabling their use in any kind of transaction, regardless of the value. Although
Bitcoin is a virtual currency scheme, it has certain innovations that make its use more similar to
conventional money. 

Bitcoins **are not pegged to any real-world currency**. The exchange rate is determined by supply and
demand in the market. There are several exchange platforms for buying Bitcoins that operate in real
time. Mt.Gox is the most widely used currency exchange platform and allows users to trade US
dollars for Bitcoins and vice versa. As previously stated, Bitcoin is based on a decentralised, peer-
to-peer (P2P) network, i.e. it does not have a central clearing house, nor are there any ﬁnancial or
other institutions involved in the transactions. Bitcoin users perform these tasks themselves. In the
same vein, there is no central authority in charge of the money supply. 

In order to start using Bitcoins, users need to download the free and open-source software. Purchased
Bitcoins are thereafter stored in a digital wallet on the user’s computer. Users have several incentives to use Bitcoins. Firstly, transactions are anonymous, as accounts are not registered and Bitcoins are sent directly from one computer to another. Also, users have the possibility of generating multiple Bitcoin addresses to differentiate or isolate transactions. Secondly,
transactions are carried out faster and more cheaply than with traditional means of payment.
Transactions fees, if any, are very low and no bank account fee is charged.

**ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS OF BITCOIN**

The theoretical roots of Bitcoin can be found in the Austrian school of economics and its
criticism of the current ﬁat money system and interventions undertaken by governments and
other agencies, which, in their view, result in exacerbated business cycles and massive inﬂation.

The following ideas are generally shared by Bitcoin and its supporters:

— They see Bitcoin as a good starting point to end the monopoly central banks have in the
issuance of money.

— They strongly criticise the current fractional-reserve banking system whereby banks can
extend their credit supply above their actual reserves and, simultaneously, depositors can
withdraw their funds in their current accounts at any time.

— The scheme is inspired by the former gold standard.

**TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF BITCOIN**

The technical aspects of this system are complex and not easy to understand without a sound technical
background. Therefore, a comprehensive explanation of the underlying technical mechanism of
Bitcoin lies outside the scope of this report. This section aims simply to provide a basic description
of the functioning of this virtual currency scheme. According to the founder, Nakamoto (2009), an
electronic coin can be deﬁned as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner of the currency (P') has a
pair of keys, one public and one private. These keys are saved locally in a ﬁle and, consequently, a
loss or deletion of the ﬁle would mean that all Bitcoins associated with it are lost as well.

A simpliﬁed illustration of a chain of transactions from one node to another can be found [here](http://imgur.com/JXLdEAH).
The virtual coin shown in the picture is the same one, but at different points in time. To initiate the
transaction, the future owner P‘ has to ﬁrst send his public key to the original owner P0. This owner
transfers the Bitcoins by digitally signing a hash6 of the previous transaction and the public key of
the future owner. Every single Bitcoin carries the entire history of the transactions it has undergone,
and any transfer from one owner to another becomes part of the code. The Bitcoin is stored in such
a way that the new owner is the only person allowed to spend it.

All signed transactions are then sent to the network, which means that all transactions are public
transactions, although no information is given regarding the involved parties. The key issue to be
addressed by the system is the avoidance of double spending, i.e. how to prevent a coin being
copied or forged, especially considering there is no intermediary validating the transactions. The
solution implemented is based on the concept of a “time stamp”, which is an online mechanism used to ensure that a series of data have existed and have not been altered since a speciﬁc point in
time, in order to get into the hash. Each time stamp includes the previous time stamp in its hash,
forming a chain of ownership. By broadcasting the new transactions, the network can verify them.
The systems that validate the transactions are called “miners” — essentially these are extremely fast
computers in the Bitcoin network which are able to perform complex mathematical calculations
that aim to verify the validity of transactions. The people who use their systems to undertake this
mining activity do so on a voluntary basis, but they are rewarded with 50 newly created Bitcoins
every time their system ﬁnds a solution.

“Mining” is therefore the process of validating transactions by using computing power to ﬁnd valid
blocks (i.e. to solve complicated mathematical problems) and is the only way to create new money
in the Bitcoin scheme.

According to Nakamoto (2009): **“if a greedy attacker is able to assemble
more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud
people by stealing back his payments, or by using it to generate new coins. He ought to ﬁnd it more
proﬁtable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else
combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth”**. 

**MONETARY ASPECTS OF BITCOIN**

The Bitcoin scheme is designed as a
decentralised system where no central monetary
authority is involved. Bitcoins can be bought
on different platforms. However, new money
is created and introduced into the system only
via the above-mentioned mining activity, i.e. by
rewarding the “miners” who perform the crucial
role of validating all transactions made, with
new Bitcoins. Therefore, the supply of money does not depend
on the monetary policy of any virtual central
bank, but rather evolves based on interested
users performing a speciﬁc activity. According
to Bitcoin, the scheme has been technically
designed in such a way that the money supply
will develop at a [predictable pace](http://imgur.com/sCX9LUM)
The algorithms to be solved (i.e. the new
blocks to be discovered) in order to receive
newly created Bitcoins become more and
more complex (more computing resources are needed). As explained on its website} the rate of block creation is approximately constant over
time: six per hour, one every ten minutes. However, the number of Bitcoins generated per block is
set to decrease geometrically, with a 50% reduction every four years. The result is that the number
of Bitcoins in existence will reach 21 million in around 2040. From this point onwards, miners are
expected to ﬁnance themselves via transaction fees. In fact, this kind of fee can already be charged
by a miner when creating a block.

The fact that the supply of money is clearly determined implies that, in theory, the issuance of money
cannot be altered by any central authority or participant wanting to “print” extra money. According
to Bitcoin supporters, the system is supposed to avoid inﬂation, as well as the business cycles
originating from extensive money creation. However, the system has been accused of leading to a
deﬂationary spiral. The total supply of Bitcoins is expected to grow geometrically until it reaches
a ﬁnite limit of 21 million. If, however, the number of Bitcoin users starts growing exponentially
for any reason, and assuming that the velocity of money does not increase proportionally,
a long-term appreciation of the currency can be expected or, in other words, a depreciation of the
prices of the goods and services quoted in Bitcoins. People would have a great incentive to hold
Bitcoins and delay their consumption, thereby exacerbating the deﬂationary spiral. The extent to
which this could be a problem in reality is not clear. Two remarks should be made. Firstly, *the deﬂation hypothesis entails an assumption which is not realistic at this stage*, i.e. that many more people will want to receive Bitcoins in return for goods or
in exchange for paper money. However, Bitcoin is still quite immature and illiquid which is a clear disincentive for its use. Secondly, Bitcoinis not the currency of a country or currency area and is therefore not directly linked to the goods
and services produced in a speciﬁc economy, but linked to the goods and services provided by
merchants who accept Bitcoins. These merchants may also accept another currency (e. g. US dollars)
and therefore, the fact that deﬂation is anticipated could give rise to a situation where merchants
adapt the prices of their goods and services in Bitcoins.

**SECURITY INCIDENTS AND NEGATIVE PRESS**

From time to time, Bitcoin is surrounded by controversy. Sometimes it is linked to its potential for
becoming a suitable monetary alternative for drug dealing and money laundering, as a result of the
high degree of anonymity.“ On other occasions, users have claimed to have suffered a substantial
theft of Bitcoins through a Trojan that gained access to their computer.” The Electronic Frontier
Foundation, which is an organisation that seeks to defend freedom in the digital world, decided not
to accept donations in Bitcoins anymore. 

However, practically identical problems can also occur when using cash, thus Bitcoin can be
considered to be another variety of cash, i.e. digital cash. Cash can be used for drug dealing and
money laundering too; cash can also be stolen, not from a digital wallet, but from a physical one; and
cash can also be used for tax evasion purposes. The question is not so much related to the format of
money as such (physical or digital), but rather to the use people make of it. Nevertheless, if the use of
digital money in itself complicates investigations and law enforcement, special requirements may be
needed. **Therefore, the real dimension of all these controversies still needs to be further analysed.**

Bitcoin has also featured in the news, in particular following a cyberattack perpetrated on
20 June 2011, which managed to knock the value of the currency down from USD 17.50 to
USD 0.01 within minutes. Apparently, around 400,000 Bitcoins (worth almost USD 9 million)
were involved. According to currency exchange Mt.Gox, one account with a lot of Bitcoins was
compromised and whoever stole it (using a Hong Kong based IP to login) ﬁrst sold all the Bitcoins
in there, only to buy them back again immediately afterwards, with the intention of withdrawing the
coins. The USD 1,000/ day withdrawal limit was active for this account and the hacker was only able
to exchange USD 1,000 worth of Bitcoins. **Apart from this, no other accounts were compromised,
and nothing was lost.**

This [chart](http://imgur.com/QP41pgK) shows the evolution of Bitcoin’s exchange rate on the Mt.Gox exchange platform during
the hours of the incident, and is also the expression of how an immature and illiquid currency can
almost completely disappear within minutes, causing panic to thousands of users. The problem was related to a particular
trading platform — Mt.Gox — which did not have strong enough security measures.

In a more recent case (May 2012), the exchange platform Bitcoinica lost 18,547 Bitcoins from
its deposits following a cyberattack, in which sensitive customer data might also have been
obtained.”

**A PONZI SCHEME?**

Another recurrent issue is whether Bitcoin works like a Ponzi scheme or not. The US Securities and Exchange Commission
deﬁnes a Ponzi scheme in the following terms:

""A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing
investors from funds contributed by new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new
investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to generate high returns with little
or no risk. In many Ponzi schemes, the fraudsters focus on attracting new money to make promised
payments to earlier-stage investors and to use for personal expenses, instead of engaging in any
legitimate investment activity.“

On the one hand, the Bitcoin scheme is a decentralised system where — at least in theory — there
is no central organiser that can undermine the system and disappear with its funds. Bitcoin users
buy and sell the currency among themselves without any kind of intermediation and therefore, it
seems that nobody beneﬁts from the system, apart from those who beneﬁt from the exchange rate
evolution (just as in any other currency trade) or those who are hard-working “miners” and are
therefore rewarded for their contribution to the security and conﬁdence in the system as a whole.
Moreover, the scheme does not promise high returns to anybody. Although some Bitcoin users may
try to proﬁt from exchange rate ﬂuctuations, Bitcoins are not intended to be an investment vehicle,
just a medium of exchange. 

**“Bitcoin is an experiment. Treat it like you would treat a promising internet start-up company: maybe it will change the world, but realise that investing your money or time in new ideas is always risky.""**

However, it is also true that the system demonstrates a clear case of information asymmetry. It is
complex and therefore not easy for all potential users to understand. At the same time, however,
users can easily download the application and start using it even if they do not actually know how
the system works and which risks they are actually taking. Therefore, although the
current knowledge base does not make it easy to assess whether or not the Bitcoin system actually
works like a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, it can justiﬁably be stated that Bitcoin is a high-risk system
for its users from a ﬁnancial perspective, and that it could collapse if people try to get out of the
system and are not able to do so because of its illiquidity.

Bitcoin,Can anyone stop the rise of Bitcoin?,"This is a very interesting question.  The Financial Sector has every reason to stop Bitcoin.  But can they do it?

**Bitcoin will Shrink the Financial Sector**

Bitcoin increases the value of savings and wages.  People that move away from Dollars and into Bitcoin will see their savings hold value (or for the next few years) dramatically increase in value.  But Bitcoin ""accounts"" or Bitcoin ""wallets"" are free.  You don't need a bank, even if you might wish to have one.

The returns on Bitcoin are going to clear the debt held by many people, maybe everyone that can figure out a way to adopt Bitcoin over the next few years.  Suddenly savings have value, and actually increase in buying power.  Prompted to save, people will save, and collect resources.  Those resources can then be used as needed to buy stuff without taking out loans.  As people begin to fund purchases with savings rather than debt, all the flows of interest and fees from transactions and credit card accounts will shrink.  In response to competition, Banks will have to reduce interest rates on loans, and perhaps increase interest rates on savings.  

Making a more fair game in dollars will not save the banks.  In fact, giving people a better deal will give them more resources to move to Bitcoin.  That will fuel faster and quicker adoption of Bitcoin instruments.  Banks will begin to provide easier conversions from Bitcoin to traditional currencies and back to Bitcoin.  This will more rapidly move the economy to Bitcoin.

So why won't the Financial Sector effectively oppose Bitcoin?  It will not be because they don't want to.  It will be driven by their need to appease the richest people in the world. And in the process of trying to hellp (perhaps exclusively) the richest people do what they want with Bitcoin, the Banks and the Rich of the world are going to underwrite this process of building up Bitcoin.  

That is what we are really seeing today.  That is why Bitcoin is now at 225 and rising.

**Tax Havens and Offshore Accounts**

The Richest of the Rich do not like to keep their money within the reach of the major governments.  Roughly 30 Trillion dollars are kept in offshore accounts like Cyprus, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, etc.  But now all those very Rich People have heard the message telegraphed from Cyprus.  They have been told they can lose as much as 40 percent of their holdings.  

Where or where can they hide their money if not in safe havens like Cyprus?

How about a distributed, fully encrypted instrument far out of the reach of any bank or government?  One where the value is sky rocketing?  Where maybe it might crash (losing  as much as 50 percent of its value) which it will very likely gain back in a few years anyway?  As it did in 2011?

Does anyone think the Banks are going to give back the 40 percent from the Cyprus bank bailout?  Ever?

The problem:  Bitcoin doesn't have enough value.  Even at $225 a Bitcoin, Bitcoin is just too cheap.

That's right.  To inexpensive.  Isn't worth enough.

So Bitcoin has to grow in value.  Not to support transactions.  Not to speculate.  Not to stick it to the Central Banks.  Bitcoin needs to grow to give the wealthiest of the wealthy somewhere to put their money.  

Someone has already yelled ""FIRE"" in the theater.  There is one door, and the first few through that door get the keys to the kingdom!

Those that claim Bitcoin will collapse, that it is a bubble that is just going to pop, well those people are most likely wrong.  Those people are trying to tell you that a theater full of rich people are not going to lay down some cash that might grow by a factor of 1000 in a year.  That they are going to sit in the theater until the fire burns up 40 to 50 percent of their net worth. 

**Who is going to Protect Bitcoin from Government?**

The only people in this world that can truly insure the success of Bitcoin will be a world wide group of very rich people that have invested into Bitcoin.  Once a critical mass of the Richest of the Rich have Bitcoin, then any move against Bitcoin will be very difficult to execute.

Bitcoin is a perfect solution to the needs of Africa, the perfect bait for the most Wealthy of Wealthy, the perfect solution by  libertarians, and the perfect solution to the plight of the common man.  Most people have not even heard of Bitcoin, much less come to understand how it will help them gain an even footing in this world.  But the only one in this list that can protect Bitcoin from Government and Banks are the wealthy.

**Can Bitcoin Lose?**

Yes.  If the government moves on Bitcoin before a critical mass of the most wealthy are invested in it, then yes.  Maybe.  It will remain very difficult, since laws against Bitcoin will almost surely outlaw coupons, Video game ecosystems, and prove to be ineffective anyway.  But if the most wealthy can be deterred from vesting in Bitcoin, then the wealthy can be mobilized against Bitcoin to prevent its rise.

The problem is the [Prisoner's Delimma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma)... Any early adopters of Bitcoin among the Rich will be VERY wealthy.  Any that delay could be seriously reduced in wealth.  So even though it might be in the best interest of the very wealthy to oppose Bitcoin, it may be too much to expect that they will.

Someone has already yelled ""Fire"" in the theater.  I just don't see how blocking the door is going to work.

Bitcoin,"Musings on Bitcoins, and a comparison with gold (long)","Musings on Bitcoins, and a comparison with gold.
================================================

[[ Edit #1 - in the 2 days since I wrote this, BTC has gone up to $226 USD - abut 40% - I'm leaving the numbers as written, as I thinkt he point still holds ]]

Full disclosure: I recently bought $200 USD worth of bitcoins (April
7 2013), near the current price peak at about $159 USD / BTC.  This is
either the smartest or stupidest $200 I've spent, and only time will tell
which.  By my purchase, I guess that makes me ""bullish"" on the long term
prospects of Bitcoin.  I'll try to not let that color my analysis below.

This analysis is not intended to be extremely precise.  I'm trying to
ballpark numbers here for a sense of scale and future possibilities.
Feel free to correct any errors you may find, but if they don't
qualitatively change the sense of the results, I'm not really interested,
given how rough some of my estimates are.

==================
Assumptions: 

1) Bitcoin will be around for the foreseeable future, and not succumb to
any of the obvious existential threats it faces (e.g. Majority network
control by an attacker, governments squash all legal interchange with fiat
currencies, users and merchants become completely disinterested, etc...)
If this assumption is false, the rest of the analysis doesn't matter.
Bitcoins will effectively be worth zero.  This is a distinct possibility,
a total bust, which I choose to ignore here, as it is uninteresting.

2) While not a perfect fit, Bitcoin will (in the long run) behave much
like gold does today, as both a commodity and a currency.  Bitcoin shares
a number of obvious qualities with gold.  While gold has some intrinsic
utility (value) which Bitcoins lack (in both decoration and electronics
manufacture), Bitcoin has advantages as a currency and commodity in its
ability to be transmitted electronically world-wide, and to be easily and
arbitrarily subdivided.  Ultimately, and historically, gold has had the
majority of its value derived from the qualities it shares with Bitcoin
(e.g. limited supply, difficulty to counterfeit, resistance to government
manipulation, etc...)  As such, it seems like a good proxy to gain some
insight into the possible future of Bitcoin.

3) We may be able to predict some sort of future bitcoin value ranges
based on what we know of gold, and how it has been priced vs fiat
currencies, currently and historically.  I'll focus specifically on the
stability of gold's price when US dollars were exchangeable for gold,
vs the rise when dollars were no longer redeemable for gold (1971).

4) Just as gold didn't stop the rise of fiat currencies, but rather
continues to exist alongside them as an alternate store of value, so to
will Bitcoin.  Fiat currencies are very useful for (as well as abusable
by) modern governments, and as such will continue.  Gold hasn't destroyed
fiat currencies in day-to-day business, and I seriously doubt Bitcoin
will either.  Most folks don't transact business in gold any more.
I expect the same to be true of Bitcoins.  Bitcoin's existential threat
to the government's ability to manipulate macro-economic monetary policy
has been wildly exaggerated.

5) The current explosion of BTC prices is most likely a speculative
bubble, but _may_ be the start of a recognition of Bitcoin's potential
to be a gold-like store of value.  If so, BTC should eventually reach
parity with gold, proportionally scaled to the amount of each available,
with each occupying a similar place in the global economy.

==================

==================
Discussion:

From the number section above, as of April 2013...
$8.8 trillion USD for all the gold in the world
$1.76 billion USD for all the bitcoins in the world
500 ounces of gold in the world per bitcoin

If the BTC economy were equivalent to the gold economy today, the nominal
BTC price would go up by a factor of 5,000 (500x as many ounces as
bitcoins, at 10x the price each).  That would yield a price of $800,000
/ BTC.  That's quite a potential upside, but assumes the total quantity
of bitcoins today were as valuable as the total quantity of gold.
A dubious proposition at best.  Let's call this a hypothetical upper
bound on BTC future value in today's money, as I really doubt bitcoins
will ever replace gold.

Given that US GDP is only about twice the value of the current world
gold supply, you could double the number above ($1.6 million / BTC) if
you wanted all the bitcoins to stand in for all the economic activity
of the US in one year.  If you did that, one ""satoshi"" (10^-8 BTC -
the smallest subdivision) would be about one US penny.

Let's make a bunch more unfounded assumptions, and see what else happens.
;-) Let's assume gold is continually mined and the supply increases 1.5%
/ year (at the 2011 rate) for the next 127 years until 2140.

That would give us 36.44 billion ounces of gold (about a 6x increase)
if compounded annually, or 16.5 billion ounces (3x, if not compounded
and we just keep pulling the same amount out).

In that same time, we will have 21 million total bitcoins (2x increase)
as we mine out the last one.

From this we can see that, if the value of bitcoins and gold derived
solely from their scarcity, the intentionally deflationary nature of
bitcoins would outpace gold in relative value over the next century.
So, how fast has gold been appreciating historically vs Bitcoins?

Let's look at some history.

The bitcoin price graph is noisy, and there isn't much history (relatively
speaking) so these numbers are all pretty rough.

Notable dates:
--------------
January 3, 2009 - Genesis block established
July 12, 2010 - BTC crosses the $0.01 (one cent) USD mark. 
Feb 9, 2011 - BTC reaches the $1 USD mark.
Jun 2, 2011 - BTC reaches $10
Source: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/History

From the one cent point to $160 / BTC today (April 7 2013) is about 14
doublings (2^14= 16384 cents, or about $160) of value in 33 months. That's
an insane 32x growth year over year.  Going from the $1 mark to today
would be about 7.5 doublings in 26 months. That's still a 12x growth year
over year. From the $10 mark, that's 4 doublings to $160 in 22 months.

From $0.01 - to $160 - 2.35 months doubling period
From $1.00 - to $160 - 3.46 months doubling period
From $10.0 - to $160 - 5.5  months doubling period
From $0.01 - to $10  - 1.1  months doubling period

The first three sets of numbers, of course, include the current
spike/bubble from the beginning of 2013.  But even the range from $0.01 to
$10.00 (ten doublings, factor of 1024 growth) took only 11 months. The
current 2013 spike went from approximately $20 at the beginning of
January 2013 to $160 at the beginning of April.  That's been three
doublings in 3 months.  Clearly, the current rate is unsustainable.
If it were sustained, however, the BTC economy would reach the earlier
mentioned level of the gold economy in roughly a bit over 3 years, giving
us an $800,000 bitcoin.  Let's call that the ""ridiculously bullish upper
bound scenario.""

Let's look at gold's rise, after it was uncoupled from the dollar in 1971
(e.g. the ""Nixon Shock"")

We went from $40 for an ounce of gold (a relatively steady value for
over 100 years) to $1600 in 42 years.  That's 8.5 doublings in 42 years,
or a doubling period of 5 years, or 60 months.  An online inflation
calculator says that only 2.5 of those doublings should be accounted for
by inflation ($40 in 1970 buying the same bag of goods as $235 in 2012),
so let's call the ""I want gold for it's own sake"" rate to be closer to
6 doublings in that time, or a doubling period of 7 years, which is
84 months.  Even after we account for inflation, that is still about
a 10% year over year appreciation.  That may be close to the bitcoin
steady-state rate, after all the hype has passed.

Over its short 4+ year history, Bitcoin's doubling period is 10x
- 60x faster than gold's over the past 42 years.  If I'm correct
and Bitcoin will, in its maturity, resemble gold for its financial
characteristics. 10% appreciation per year will be closer to the norm
than the current, insane,  200% - 1000+% we are currently seeing.

So where does this leave us?  Gold, while widely accepted, makes a
lousy currency in practice.  You can't effectively buy things online,
or at the corner market for gold.  In most cases, you have to trade it
in for fiat currency to actually *buy* things.  As a commodity, it does
a much better job.  Because of it's commodity qualities, it works well
as a store of wealth, and is relatively easily convertible into various
fiat currencies.  Bitcoin would seem to share all of those qualities with
gold, and in addition, is accepted by at least some merchants directly
online for goods and services already, and that number is growing.

Ultimately, that, I think, will be the key.  If merchants widely accept
bitcoin directly, and/or it is at least as easy for consumers to convert
bitcoins to fiat money as it is to convert gold, bitcoin should have a
gold-like future.

I don't believe bitcoin will become the currency of the global masses.
Gold certainly hasn't, and it has had a much longer time to try and
claim that place.  Fiat currency is too useful a tool to give up, and
most of humanity doesn't own gold, and if they do, they don't buy things
with it directly.  Bitcoin will be no different.  Further, one needs
computer access to transact in bitcoins.  While more and more of the
world becomes connected every day, there are still vast numbers of people
with no computer access (or water or shelter or bank accounts or...).
Again, parallels to gold.

If we use a population figure of 7 billion for the world, and were to
split the gold and the bitcoins up evenly, that would be a bit less than
one ounce of gold per person, and a bit more than 1.5 thousandths of
a bitcoin each.  So if you have more than that already, you are ahead
of the game, globally speaking.  However, these numbers argue against
either bitcoin or gold ever becoming a true ""global currency.""

The Global Wealth Report (http://www.cnbc.com/id/44956585) cites $231
trillion US dollars as a figure for total global wealth.  That's $33,000
per person.  From the numbers earlier, that means gold makes up only
about 4% of that global wealth number, and recall that the collected
value of all the worldwide bitcoins is less than a tenth of one percent
of the gold wealth.

This 20 year old Straight Dope article is still relevant.
It essentially says that ""cash"" in all it's forms is really
small change in the global economy.  Even upping Cecil's numbers
a bit for 20 years, I think his premise still holds true.
http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/719/how-much-money-is-there
==================


Conclusions
===========

Bitcoin will either be yet an other failed crypto-cash experiment, or
it will become the de-facto standard Sci-Fi ""credits"" of the future.
History suggests failure is the more likely outcome, but only time will
tell for sure.  Bitcoin has managed to anticipate and avoid many of the
problems with previous systems.

Given it's deflationary nature, gold-like properties, and requirement
for computer access to use, I do not believe it will ever become
wide-spread in a world-wide population sense, but it may succeed in
augmenting credit-card transactions for online ""cash"" purchases of
goods and services.  If it is wildly successful and widely adopted,
it may reach a place of financial significance on par with gold at
some point.  Even then, this will still be a relatively small part of
the global economy.

Given that half the bitcoins ever to be produced are extant right
now, the total world supply will, at most, double.  That's it.  So,
barring various fiat economic collapses in the future, whatever price we
eventually settle on for a bitcoin's utility as a store of value in the
near future (next few years? a decade?) should remain pretty constant
(within a factor of 2).  Markets and currency speculators will still
cause wild price swings, but once it establishes a consensus ""worth,""
that value shouldn't change much more based on supply, just on demand.
Supply will be essentially fixed, but demand will be driven by utility
(where can I spend it) and speculators.

We are currently (April 2013) in a massive speculative bubble, as ""the
market"" tries to decide how much bunches of ever-harder-to-find hashes
are really ""worth,"" as a medium of exchange for goods and services.
The success or failure of Bitcoin will be directly related to the network
effect ""lock in"" as more merchants and users use it.  If it catches on,
its success will snowball.  If not, it will tank.",cryptocurrency,1365525005
personalfinance,Fighting with Fiance over wedding costs.,"Got engaged a month ago.  Fiance just went out to visit her parents in Napa California before she starts a new job that will not allow her to travel for the next year (we live on the east coast).  

She asked to go alone.  I was a bit miffed b/c I like her parents and wanted to share in the engagement celebration/ happiness with her family.  I asked that they not really make any concrete wedding plans without me there.  That said, her parents have offered a signifigant sum of money to help cover the wedding expenses (at least $15k).  

Fast forward 4 days into her trip.  She calls me, practically shivering with excitement: ""OMG, my parents neighbor is a caterer for a wedding planner and knows the owner of a winery that does weddings!  Neighbor says it's amazing, and its in the heart of Napa.""  

Since I am more financially minded, I ask, ""So what is a ballpark figure?""  She hit me with a dreaded statement, ""Well after talking to my girlfriends, they have all spent between $30k and $150k"" on their weddings.""  My blood ran cold.  ""This place can do EVERYTHING for around $20-$30k... Isn't that amazing?""  

I struggled to not knee jerk respond with a comment that dumps water on her head, but I guess my tone gave it away... I try to move forward by asking when she's going to check the place out, and that I would really have liked to see the venue myself... It's my wedding too.  Long story short, the converstation ended tersely, and we argued via text for the rest of the evening. 

I guess this is two parted:  I don't like the idea of planning a wedding in a venue I have not seen, nor can really see until just prior to it.  Two, I really don't like the idea that a $30k wedding is considered a steal.... 

For reference, we make a combined $200k and hold about $250k in debt (she just graduated from a masters program in her field.  This is her first job and she makes $100k.  Upside for future growth).  I wanted to really focus on that debt over the next couple years, not pay for a wedding....

What do you think PF?  Female perspective especially welcome.

**UPDATE:**  Wow.  I never expected so much great information and genuine input.  Thank you all.  The responses are coming fast and furious so I'll stick a FAQ here to clarify and update since my post this morning:

**Why did my fiance vist alone?**  She is very close with her family.  She's the oldest of 4 kids and the first to get married.  She asked to go visit her folks one last time as their little girl and transition into being my wife (we have had a quick courtship.  I met her fam in December).  I did ask that they not discuss wedding stuff without me, regardless of them paying for it or not.  She did not pre-medidate looking at venues without me and had no plans to do so.  She was on a walk in their neighboorhood with her mother and ran into the neighbor who saw her ring... and it went from there.  After talking with me she felt so bad she canceled the appointment to go visit the winery.  I've since tried to have her reschedule.  I definitely overreacted out of impulse/ emotion.

**Why are you such a cheapskate?**  Most of my life I've struggled with money.  Grew up lower middle class.  Within last 5 years of my life my income has grown by hundreds of percent.  By marrying my fiance, I'm now doubling that!! I'm not accostomed to making decisions of this magnitude with this kind of buying power, and still feel like debt of any kind should be enemy #1.  

**Is it a money or relationship issue?**  To be completely honest, we got engaged, she finished school and passed the boards within the last month.  It's been a whirlwind.  Wedding budget was not discussed once.  When she left, we decided to discuss upon her return, two major things: What state do we want it to be? How many people?   I was a bit shocked to get a call telling me that she found a place for that kind of money.  I felt like we went from step 1 to step 5 instantly and I had no say in it.  In reality this is not the case, but it was my perception and I was very upset.

We've since talked on the phone and cleared the air.  She now says she understands my perspective, and after reading a lot of info here, I can better understand hers.  I guess i just really had no realisitic idea what weddings cost, or even what I really wanted out of ours.

Wife (28) and I (27) just had our first child and my wife (teacher) will not be returning to work until September.  We are using these next few months to challenge ourselves to live within our means and stick to a budget. 

Income:
I make $78k a year.  After 5% company match 401k contributions, FSA, bus pass, and taxes my take home is ~$4250 a month.  

Monthly Budget: 

$1410 - Rent

$327 - Wife's car ~$10k at 4%

$150 - Gas

$96 - Insurance for both vehicles and renters through AAA

$137 - Cell phone.  Stuck with Verizon contract for 6 more months

$98 - Cable/Internet

$96 - Gas/Electric/Water

$28 - Culligan bottled water.  Wife will budge on this one.  

$400 - Groceries

$100 - Credit Line for Tempur Pedic Bed. $900 remaining at 0%

$75 - Misc Home Supplies

$200 - Baby Supplies

$15- Dry cleaner 

$35 - Haircuts 

$50 - Pet Supplies 

$100 - Clothing

$60 - My money, no questions asked, no permission needed to use (alcohol and eating out for lunch)

$60 - Her money, no questions asked, no permission needed to use
(Who the hell knows)

Remainder ~$815 - Student Loans 

Student Loans:
My wife and I have several federal student loans totaling $101k.  The interest rates are a smattering of as low as 2.7% and as high as 7.2%.  Since we are on a single income right now I signed up for an income based repayment and anticipate the minimum payment to be ~$600.  Our plan is to pay the minimum payment across all loans monthly.  We can then apply the remaining ~$215 income to the highest interest loan.  

Savings:
Through work I am able to use Baxter Credit Union and take advantage of their high interest rates.  We have $13k in checking at 2% APY and $3k in ""Rainy Day Savings"" at 3%.  Through BCU you can sign up for this rainy day savings and if you make the minimum $50 deposits 12 months in a row you get bumped up to the 3%.  The max you can deposit each month is $500 so I am currently moving that over every month until it reaches $13k that we will use as our emergency fund.  

Once my wife gets back to work we will be sticking to this budget and pay off as much as possible on student loans.  We would like to purchase a house in the future but we are comfortable where we are and can stay here for 5-6 years if necessary.

What are your thoughts?  Any criticisms?  Are we on the right track or are we not considering some possible expenses?

I ordered my Alienware M17x R4 on 2/19/13 and received the system on 3/5/13. My initial complaint to the company follows below. Over several weeks and many issues I am yet to resolve everything at 4/8/13. Just the total lack of customer service skills presented by the Dell representatives brought me to write this. But after receiving two separate no-response I write this in hopes to dissuade anyone from purchasing from Dell. I also expect those to come out and say, “what did you expect from Dell they are known for their bad service.” But really, the problem I see here is why is this acceptable? So I write this up in hopes to at least bring it to light for others to see an example of what it is that makes Dell’s service terrible.

So I wish to break this tale into 3 parts as there are three distinct issues that I had to go through to. This first part will focus on my encounter with an online representative. The conversation was with Lorna, the online representative which I contacted through the Dell community site. Coming from a company that totes on how it cares about its customers I found it surprising to receive such callous attitude from Lorna.

Greetings Lorna, 
My name is Tooth and below is some information requested before I start.

Service tag #: I didn't know what or where this is Country of purchase: United States of America Current country location: Honolulu, HI 
Reason:I ordered my system with next business day shipping. Instead it is being shipped via FedEx 2day instead of the intended NBD. My order details specify NBD, FedEx tracking site has it as FedEx 2day.

Hi Tooth,
Thanks you for contacting me and bringing your concerns to my attention. I sincerely regret any frustration or inconvenience this matter may have caused.

I was able to access your account records with the information you provided and determined there are no costs associated with next business day shipping on this order.

According to the FedEx website, Tracking # 551246153248 has an Estimated Delivery of today, Tuesday, 3/05/2013 5:00 pm HONOLULU, HI.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if I may be of any additional assistance in this matter.

Thanks,
Lorna

Hi Lorna, Yes thank you for reiterating, that information is correct. However the shipping method on the FedEx site states that it was sent via fedex 2day shipping instead of the offered next business day. I am messaging you to state this deviance from the intended shipping method. I understand this shipment was sent out on a Saturday, yet I also had a look at the FedEx website and found that they do offer next business day shipping from Saturday. My question to you is why was it shipped through FedEx 2day when my order was with next business day.
03-05-2013 11:35 AM
-----------------

Hi Tooth,
I guess I don't understand your complaint.  Dell does not contract with any carriers for weekend delivery. If you had selected next day delivery, you would have been charged for it. You were not charged for next day delivery.
Hope this helps,
Lorna

Yes I am also confused by the matter. I ordered the system with NBD and received 2day shipping. This order was through Dell. I noticed this order was sent out on Saturday, March 2nd according to the dell order status page. I am unde the assumption that Sunday is not a business day and Monday is a business day. I believe through this logic and the order of NBD I Gould have received my order yesterday, Monday March 4th. Yet I am receiving 2nd day delivery and receiving it 2 business day from the shipping date. My complaint revolves around having ordered this with NBD and receiving 2nd day.

Sorry Tooth,
I cannot request your order to be delivered yesterday. I cannot refund shipping you were not charged for. Other than say I am sorry you were diappointed your delivery was made on Tuesday instead of Monday, I just don't know how to assist you.

Lorna,
I have been civil to you throughout our conversation and I do not appreciate this unwarranted impertinent tone from you. We were at a misunderstanding and I was clearing things up so we  understand each other.
This was a service I was offered during the sale and I asked you why it wasn't honored. Your condescending attitude has been uncalled for. Your response is unacceptable that I should just deal with this error on your company's end. I am not just disappointed that my delivery was made on the wrong day, I am asking you why that mistake was made and what will be done about it.
I don't intend to take further mistreatment from you, if you cannot respond civilly, please forward me to your supervisor.

Hi Tooth,

Please accept my apology for any comments I may have made that you may have construed as being mistreated. That was certainly not my intent.
Please forward the information you are referring to that guaranteed you NBD delivery at no charge, as I am unfamiliar with that offer. You may submit a screen shot or email attachment to me at Lorna_McNamara@Dell.com.
Thanks for your patience,

(this next email below is separate from the chain above and was sent on Mar 10)
Lorna,
It has been four days since our last correspondence without reply from you. Since then a number of further issues have surfaced with my system. I will note again that next business day shipping was worked over out over the phone with a representative but I have included screenshots of the order status from dell.com and the fedex shipping method. At this point I would like you to transfer me to your supervisor so I can address my concerns with them. Aside from the this shipping issue I have encounter problems with:
-The operating system(OS) disc not-included
-The video card, leading to the requirement of the OS
-Now having an inoperable brand-new system
I have been in contact with the Alienware technical support, but until I get that OS disc they are unable to help me further. This has been a frustrating experience and you have been very unhelpful and condescending in the matter regarding customer support over the issues we discussed.

I wait another week before I finally decide to call in and register a complaint with some sort of manager and resolve this issue. Well I call in and get a terse outsourced manager who seems bothered that I called for him. I explain to him my issue and offer him the email exchange and the attitude I received from Lorna, he just tells me that Dell will investigate it and there is no need for any other information from me. As for my shipment, he informs me that it that the Fedex shipped it out before Dell was able to transfer the shipping information. I am absolutely floored by the different story I’m being fed but I hangup anyway. But I’m really unsure if they investigate this matter at all but it is unbelievable to me that a customer service staff treats customers this way.

Bitcoin,"Breaking through skepticism: what do people not understand about fiat (and government debt), that they think they do?","In developing my Bitcion pitch, at the point I transition from values to details, I've realized that people reject something new, especially when it's more complicated than they can grasp in one conversation.   Yet they accept fiat, which is actually controlled by more arcane mechanisms. 

The standard strategy at that point is just transferring some coin.  I want to back that up with something usable in a larger group setting:  shaking their existing paradigm.  

I imagine an intuition pump of setting up a confusing quiz, about how the [US dollar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System) (and government debt) operate.  I must be able to prove, with authoritative citations, my answers to these tricky questions.  Conspiratorial possibilities are not helpful.

It's a bonus if the questions reveal hidden costs (like merchants pricing in chargeback fraud), or make inflation's inequality more visible, but that's not required.  It's also a bonus if the answer can be made clear.

**tl;dr:** What can you explain about fiat that a moderately attentive business person might not already know?

*example*:  In the US, Primary Dealers (member banks of the Fed) buy bonds from the Treasury, and sell them back to the Fed for guaranteed profit, due to the Fed's public QE policy.  For a while they were getting loans from the Fed to do this.  (*This needs a simple and clear citation and some demonstration of scale.*)",cryptocurrency,1365473909

If I threw it into a mutual fund then I could potentially make significantly more than 2%.

Bitcoin,Should this be a concern?,"One of the comments posted [here](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/bitcoin-the-encryption-standard):

&gt;Misconception: Bitcoin has no central authority. Bitcoin *does* have a central authority in the hands of Satoshi and other core devs. They have less power than the Fed but they still have decent power. In the fork in March we saw them exercice power by declaring that one of the blockchains was right and the other was wrong. They can also tweak the core algorithm, and there are a few things that they are already planning to change (such as one day increasing the number of times you can subdivide one coin). And no one other than the core team has the ability to send Bitcoin Alerts.

&gt;Another misconception is the idea that Bitcoin will never have more than 21 million coins. If the core team wants to increase the coin limit, and they can convince 51% of miners to go along with the change, then they can make that change.

Also another concern I have is with mining pools. As we have seen recently, BTC Guild reached over or was at 50% of the total hashing rate enabling them access to malicious activities if they so desire. Besides having to trust that the pool operator will not have an incentive to cause harm to the network and that no outside hackers take advantage of that situation, are there protocols in place to prevent such pooling towards the biggest pool behaviour?",cryptocurrency,1365469809
Bitcoin,"Where is it going? To the moon? Crash landing? No, I think it goes through Phase 1, 2 (now) and 3 (soon)!","No, I don't expect a crash. 

I wish and hope that bicoin succeeds in establishing itself as alternative currency, which could become the mainstream thing, perhaps together with other p2p crypto currencies.

Thats how I think its going:

Phase 1 - the currency was started by miners creating coins from 2009 on

Phase 2 - early adopters finance the system with fiat money. Value (energy) - fiat money, gold or services - is pumped into and absorbed by the system, which consequently raises the price of bitcoins in relation to fiatmoney and even in relation to gold, due to the growth of the system in this phase. Bitcoins could go all the way up, because its not a bubble what we see here, but the energy and hope of a growing number of people who are fed up with the current mess, got aware of bitcoin and eagerly jump on the bandwagon.

Phase 3 - bitcoin gets more and more independent of its relation to other currencies. The growth slows down and the steep curve of exchange value to fiat currencies turns into a plateau (not necessarily, if the fiat currency is hyperinflating it will only look like bitcoin rises in value, where in fact all fiat currencies loose value - as is the case now) This phase requires a large user base. That base is being filled up in the current phase 2. Then people will increasingly trade in bitcoins and get independent of fiat money.

This is IMHO how it should go, how it was designed to establish itself, to grow and to stay. Let's hope for the best and help its success by being alert and fighting against negative influences.

personalfinance,"Little debt, decent income, emergency fund &amp; 401K established - what's next?","Hi personalfinance

I'm a 24 yr old male software engineer.  I earn around $30 per hour.  I have no student loans, I pay my credit card balance in full every month, and I have about $10,000 in cash as an emergency fund and another $10,000 in a 401K.  I contribute 8% of my pay to my 401K, and my company matches half of that.  My only real debt is a $10,000 auto loan, with about 3 years left to pay it.  My interest rate is 2.49%.  I've thought about just paying it off, but to be honest, I'd like to keep it for another 2 years at least to help further establish my credit, as I'd like to buy a house in the near future.  CreditKarma lists my score as around ~728, with my major weakness being few accounts and limited credit history.  I've only had 2 credit cards, one of which I got at age 18 and canceled it about a year ago.  Now I just have my Costco Amex, which I pay off every month.  I never had student loans in college, so again, I haven't had much opportunity to build my credit.

Currently I live with my fiance, who is a student but about to be employed in 4-6 weeks when she graduates, earning something similar to me.  We currently split the rent and bills 3/4 me, 1/4 her, (and I also cover most groceries and dinners), but when she starts earning more we plan on switching up to a 50/50 split.  She has about $70K in student loans, but we already plan on aggressively attacking them so she pays them off in about 5 years.

Consequently, I'm about to start ""making"" ~$500 more per month, and I don't really know what to do with it.  Even in my current circumstance, I live comfortably and have a decent amount of money that I spend on things I enjoy.

I've thought about starting a Roth IRA.  In regards to this, what advice do you have?  Additionally, I'd like to do something a bit more aggressive and accessible with my money.  Something that doesn't require me to get to age 60 before I can enjoy my assets (you can't predict the future; who knows if I even live that long).  I will be going back to school in the fall to get my MS, but that will be 90-100% paid for by my company.

So, what's next?  Is my best option just to start saving for a house?  What would be the best way to do that?  I really know nothing about investing besides the obvious things like retirement and savings accounts, etc..  I've read the links on the sidebar, but most of it (like the Boggleheads stuff) doesn't really apply to me, or are pretty vague.  I'd really appreciate some sound financial advice.

Thank you!

$ 221,000 Private student loans
$61,000 Federal Student Loans

My husband is terrible with finances.  We're newlyweds, and I decided to be the one in charge of getting this mess straightened out.  For six months I've been trying to contact them over the phone, e-mail, and snail mail in an effort to acquire the original promissory notes, records of payment, and the like for our records and so that I can get a game plan going.  No one has helped me, or wanted to help.  I even asked the recovery law office representative who called me, explained my plight, and she basically told me that I'm SOL.  If I try to contact Sallie Mae, they'll refer me to her, and she can't give it to me.

The thing is, the payments on these things are ridiculous, as you can imagine.  There is no way that we can pay these off without winning the lottery or suddenly making 100k a year.

On the phone, I kept getting told, ""You don't want to go to litigation.  If this doesn't get taken care of, we'll have to go to litigation.""

What will happen if we go to litigation?  I can't apply for bankruptcy.  I can't give them the $160k they want to settle for.  Even after spreading THAT out into 6 months.

I'm starting to wonder if litigation might be my best option.  Any advice?  Recommendations?

**EDIT:**
Okay, so it sounds like litigation is just a fucking mess all around.  Does anyone have any advice on how to procure a copy of the original promissory note as well as records of the payments that have been made over the years?  It sounds like the account has been sent over to a collections agency, and they're telling me that they can't give me a copy.  Will they give me a copy if I get an attorney to send them a letter?

Bitcoin,Layman's question about the bitcoin paradigm...,"I am far from an expert in digital currency.  From what I read about it, I got the idea that this was a currency that was decentralized, not issued by a government or reserve bank and part of the charm was that it would not be subject to manipulation and thus provide a stable store of wealth. 

It seems that with the recent rapid rise in Bitcoin value due to a mix of hoarding and speculation, it has lost its perceived purity.  Stability seems to have gone out the window.  

I really understand little about currency markets and never thought about it all that much in the past.  I took it for granted that I would go to the supermarket and trade in $2 for a gallon of milk and never really considered what that actually meant, except in terms of how long I have to labor to earn that two bucks.  

While bitcoin cannot be manipulated by some banker at the Fed, it still seems less than ideal for eventual everyday use due to its volatility.

personalfinance,Wells Fargo Student Loans are killing me with interest.,"Currently, I have about 25k in student loans, while my fiancé has 120k (paid for all of his school with loans). 

I’m not really concerned about how to execute paying back these loans. We’ve got a pretty solid emergency fund and have our own version of 50-30-20 plan that we’ve put into action. We’ve got a car loan of 5k with a 3.75% interest rate that we can easily take care of. 

My concern is my Wells Fargo loan. I owe them less than 10k, but my they are currently on deferment. I went to AmeriCorps for a year and then went back to school for a while after, so they’ve been waiting for me for a while (my AmeriCorps money went straight to my Direct Loan, as well as some community college classes). When I put them on deferment, I wasn’t nearly as savvy about money as I am now, and didn’t realize that my interest charge would still build up- as well as my interest rates, apparently. I had honestly completely forgotten about the Wells Fargo loan because I had never received paper statements or emails until they sent me a bill for my interest payment a few months ago to my new address. Paper statements were getting sent to my parents, which never got to me. So here’s what I’m looking at. 


* $7,688.55 at 12.74% - owe $1,798.03 in interest

* $2,285.92 at 8.74% - owe $366.73 in interest

* Owe a total of $2164.76 in interest.
 
* Loans come out of deferment at the end of next month.


Of course, I don’t have the paper work for when I originally took out the loan – I was a freshman in college... doing things that college kids do… So I have no idea if this was my original interest rate or not. I feel like current-me would never take out a loan with that interest rate, but it’s entirely possible that 18-year-old me did.

I emailed Customer Service about the interest rates, and this is the response I got back:

""The interest rates for your private education loans are variable and 
subject to change monthly. The rates are based on an Index (such as the Prime Rate) plus a Margin that was determined by your credit at the time you applied for the loans.

On your Wells Fargo Education ConnectionSM Loan the interest rate
of 12.74% is based on an Index of 4.75% plus a Margin of 7.99% and on your Wells Fargo Collegiate(R) Loan the interest rate of 8.74% is
based on an Index of 3.25% and a Margin of 5.49%.""

Okay.. so I'm still not all that savvy with technical terms. Can someone help me decipher this message? I feel like I'm in the Da Vinci Code. I get the part that it can change.. so how can I bring those rates back down to something reasonable?

I’ve heard horror stories with Wells Fargo, and I feel like I’m in one. Once our finances are leveled out again (we’re going to Chicago in a few weeks), we’re going to attack that Wells Fargo loan first and foremost so we can be done with those interest rates.

Bitcoin,Speculation and the Price of Bitcoin,"I've been aware of Bitcoin for a few years now and have kept an increasingly close eye on the trading rates for the past four months. It's amazing that the currency has created such vast wealth in so short time--even ignoring the crazy growth this week--and I'm genuine happy for all the thousand/million/billioinaires out there whose lives have improved as a result.

What I don't understand, and perhaps what someone who does understand can explain to me, is how the recent upward trends are the result of anything but naked market speculation. I recognize that all stock/futures markets are founded on speculation, but in most cases there is at least some rational basis for what we think a given company, market, or economy will do: we collect data on spending, examine balance sheets and past sales performance, consider growth and investment opportunities, etc. None of these are fool-proof, and there is always the risk that a) our analysis of present data is off and b) present data is a poor indicator of future performance. (We also make bets on how governments will act, which is anathema to Bitcoin; see below.) However, ""smart"" investors earn serious returns over a very long period, e.g. the Warren Buffetts of the world.

So what does this market-traded value of Bitcoin reflect? Sure, Bitcoin isn't subject to self-serving and oftentimes idiotic policy decisions made by any centralized banking ""authority."" That's great, and provides a great degree of certainty above traditional currencies. But that is more important when your currency is used to purchase goods and services, much less so when you're participating in sheer arbitrage. Is there a structural explanation for the present trading value of Bitcoin? Any indication that there is a structural model for the *future* value of Bitcoin as a currency versus other currencies?

As far as I can tell, the only rational basis for the current increase is the ""bubble"" effect, where people are betting that the value will go up for the simple reason that they think *other* people will make that same bet tomorrow. Is there any reason to think there is more going on here? If not, there is a massive risk that one day, nobody will make that bet, and then--whoops, there goes all that speculative value. And if that's all there is, then this is very much like the factors in traditional investment decisions that consider those fickle monetary policies about interest rates and bond buybacks and whathaveyou, all of which are infected by both greed and politics. You can ""predict"" behavior based on vague psychological notions, but they're mostly ephemeral and have minimal correlation with reality, especially in the long term. Again, that's one of the foundations of Bitcoin, to cut these speculative kinds of inputs out of our macroeconomic systems.

You folks who have taken these risks in the recent past are definitely entitled to your crazy returns, and seriously, more power to you for making some (or tons of!) money in these shaky times. I'm jealous, for sure. Yet if we're in a bubble, it's important to recognize what it is and for people to appreciate just what those risks are--and whether their investments are going to come back to them.",cryptocurrency,1365606622
Bitcoin,Theoretical Value of BTC with a Federal Reserve mentality,"So I have been thinking about BTC (as many of you have lately). Specifically, about some of its core concepts such as finite quantity of 21 Million and this got me thinking of the following:

According to the Federal Reserve for U.S. Currency, there was ""approximately $1.18 trillion in circulation as of March 20, 2013, of which $1.13 trillion was in Federal Reserve notes.""  (Source: http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12773.htm)

If the same level of trust and backing that the Federal Reserve Note currently receives were applied to BTC and if considering the current amount of BTC in circulation (which at the time of this post is 11,010,475) a single BTC *could* equate to ***$102,629 USD*** based on the mentality being applied to the FRN. This math comes from simply dividing the current FRN in circulation (1.13 Tril) by the current number of BTC in circulation (11,010,475 Source: http://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/). If assuming each of those Federal Reserve Notes is valued at $1 a generic comparison can be made with respect to the amount of currency in circulation. In this case, we are comparing the USD. A few friends and I were kicking around the idea and I am curious what the rest of the community thinks. At best, this is just a theoretical point of view. I am interested in any kind of feedback related to this topic or if it has already been discussed, what the current line of thought is. There are many assumptions made in this line of thinking.

At the very least this is a dialog about the potential long term value of BTC as it relates to other currieries and/or about how horribly inflated the U.S. Dollar and other first world currencies are.",cryptocurrency,1365605811

Bitcoin,"Lessons from Commodities Regulation, or, Why Governments Aren't Your Enemy","Hi all, 

I'm new to this whole Bitcoin thing, but I'm noticing a few trends that cause me some concern.  One involves the community's treatment of Bitcoin, and the other, recent market trends. 

* **Paranoia:** I've seen a few major posts expressing a fear that governments will purposefully tank Bitcoin. I don't think that's well-founded, for the primary reason that governments have no history of wrecking novel financial instruments. If you're looking for proof, good God, how about the last four years? Regulators can't even *control* swaps, how could they destroy them??

* **Vigorous sales offset with microtransactions:** take this [example](http://imgur.com/WgIaah5) from earlier today. Those of you who've watched it for more than a day might know better, but is this trend a common one? And has it occurred with as much frequency in the past, as it is now?

If this is a newly widespread practice, there's cause for concern. In traditional ForEx and commodities trading, federal law forbids practices designed to convey the appearance of value without the fact thereof. One of them is ""churning,"" another is called a ""wash sale,"" but both refer to the same thing -- repetitive, inconsequential transactions designed to crate the appearance of high volume and liquidity. Both of those lure more investors, who buy the commodities at an artificial price, benefiting the churners who know better. 

Churning is illegal, and was extremely common in early commodities markets. As a market without a set, respected, mark-to-market exchange, Bitcoin is essentially a primitive commodities market, and one that's even MORE vulnerable to churning due to the delay lag that artificial sales create in the market. The limited supply of the commodity causes even further problems, and exposes the market to the risk of cornering, and ""squeezing."" Remember, you don't have to have close to 100% of the supply to ""corner"" a market and dictate prices. You just have to have a respectable amount. The copper market, for example, was [""cornered""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornering_the_market#1990s:_Hamanaka_and_the_copper_market) in the last decade by someone with under 10% of the world's supply. 

You should be aware of these risks before you buy. And because of these risks, you need to confront, or acknowledge, the biggest threat to Bitcoin as a stable currency: small and large funds who will see Bitcoin as a chance for a quick buck, and use the relative lawlessness to bust out their old, 19th-century tricks for fleecing uninformed customers. 

That is all. Back to watching the ticker.

**Sidenote:** that said, I'd still love to get in on Bitcoin, with a nominal sum, but everything I see is so creepy (BitInstant) or requires banks that curiously don't exist near me. If you have tips, I'd love to hear it.

I am the one quoted in this article. I agree with Peter that we should learn from history, and I'd like to challenge the last two statements as evidence of properly learning from history. (I wasn't alive long enough to comment on the first 3)

**Dot-Com bubble:**

Where are we today with Dot-Coms? Google.com, Facebook.com, Youtube.com, etc. What then is a tech bubble? It is mother nature's way of weeding out the weak to make room for new and better species. Yes, bubbles are a part of nature, like the reptilian bubble that occured 450 million years ago. Thankfully that bubble popped 65M years ago to allow sentient beings to exsit today. 

Yes, many companies like Webvan was fundementally flawed, but if someone who believed in the technology (the Internet, that is) invested a little in every Dot-Com company series A since the 90s, I bet that man would be rich today. The analogus bubble occurred for Bitcoin in mid 2011. Those who bought at $20 and sold at $10 lost half of their investment in a matter of days. Those that bought at $20 and held it to this day just made a 1100% profit. (Joke: The guy who bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC is the dinosaur).

**2008 Financial Crisis:**

That was one slick deal from bank's perspective:

    1. Ask Fed to lower interest rates and print free money.
    2. Get everyone to buy houses
    3. Housing prices go up endlessly make MBS's a no risk investment (see 5.)
    4. Bubble gonna burst? No problem! Freddy, Fannie, and AIG got us covered.
    5. Oh they don't? Buddies at the White House and benevolent tax-payers got them covered. 
    6. While this is going on, let's just ""save"" Bear Stearns by reluctantly agreeing to buy them for $2.
    7. ???
    8. Present day: We completely recovered! http://goo.gl/BpDYt
    9. Unemployment? Back to 1, rinse, repeate. http://goo.gl/ABI8W

Now let's imagine Bitcoin in the above senario:

    1. Fed doesn't exsit because they have no power over monetary policy
    2. ...

My intepretation of the state of Bitcoin today (compared to history) is more akin to the first couple guys who found gold nuggets in the local river -- It's nice and shinny! I'll sell this nugget for some sea shells (the currency at the time). Some time later: ""Grandpa traded gold for sea shells and that's why we're poor?""",cryptocurrency,1365569176

gaming,Connect a Gamer - Creating a platform for gamers to test games,"Hello all, I would like to have a chance to tell you about a project myself and a few others are working on to help shape the world of the gaming industry. For those of you have knowledge in the gaming industry (making/developing) you will know how tedious and difficult it can be to be provided with good help in finding bugs/glitches as well as overall getting feedback on the game as a whole.

Connect a Gamer works to supply a platform for both gaming developers to fast tract their testing and be provided with helpful feedback to improve the game beyond bug/glitch fixes. Developers will contact a certain amount of testers or open their game to public on the site in order to do this. Interested? read on.

As gamers, your job will be to test the games. Thoroughly. Testing is not speed running the game and on your feedback saying the game was fun and submitting. A lot of the time testing is more ""if i run into this wall for x amount of time where the map doesn't quite meet up, am i going to fall through?"". This may now seem like a very appealing task now that i have buffed however in return for testing these games and based on how well done/helpful your feedback is you will be rewarded.

The rewards will be varied and will be based as i said before on how well the game is tested, you feedback will be not only looked upon by the developer but also your peers, your feedback comes first seeing others feedback comes after. No copying, that would be cheating now. The only downside to this scheme being we cant have people jumping from game to game just wanted free game time on something they want to play, this is why after you are done playing to receive your next test game you must provide sufficient* feedback.

There will be a level system integrated and only certain level testers will be able to play certain level things, this will all be fleshed out as time goes on. Connect a Gamer is still in its early days and would love the support of the /r/Gaming community. I hope you come into this idea with an open mind and an eager heart like us.

Bitcoin,"I decided to go 'all-in' and dump $10,000 in near the peak...","I caught the action as it was starting to rise up in March before the media and Cyprus hype took hold.  I bought one, then another, then a few more through services like Bitfloor and Bitinstant.  At that point my cost basis was under $1,000.

So I decided to take the serious plunge and buy $10,000 through MtGox.  That was just hours before yesterday's crash when it went from $235 to $260 in about an hour.  I even had to replace my order a few times because it was rising too fast.

I am currently 72% down from my cost-basis of all bitcoin bought, and quite frankly I am pissed and feel like I've been manipulated by the hype and pretty obvious pump-and-dumper schemers.  

The technology and protocol might be secure, there are very obvious failures within the system.  

1) The entire exchange infrastructure, and not just Magic The Gathering, but all of them are prone to hacking attacks.  All of them are under-staffed.  And all of them cost way too much in fees (I don't think I would pay as much as I did to get into mutual funds, but I got caught in the hype).  

2) The system is too easily prone to manipulation.  Twenty-one million coins, with a bunch of people owning over ten thousand, makes the system too prone to a sell-off.  Imagine what would happen to the price of Gold if the U.S. decided to dump Fort Knox onto the market at market prices?  While we can feel confident to trust the U.S. won't do this, there is absolutely no assurance that the other holders won't.  The whole system is easily manipulated like the Hunt brother's silver market cornering of 1980.  

And in any other regulated market, if there were an IPO the initial investors are locked in to prevent this type of sell off from happening.  But this is ""unregulated"" which is promoted as a benefit, but I am going to say it isn't.  The reason regulations were implemented is exactly because of this type of pump-and-dump and market manipulation.

Virtual currencies are a fucking joke.  I'd have been better off buying Linden Dollars or blowing my money on blackjack and hookers.

Bitcoin,"Repeat after me - ""I have no moral obligation to buy, hold, or sell Bitcoin just because others want me to do so.""","If you have read my previous posts and comments on this subreddit, you'll know that I'm a huge proponent of Bitcoin in specific, and of crypto-currencies in general.  I think that they're revolutionary, game changing, world shattering, and the tip of an iceberg that could potentially restore freedom back to the US and the rest of the world.

That being said, let me give you a bit of advice from someone who specifically studied the psychology of trading in a forum based environment when forum members had something to gain.

**Don't listen to ANYTHING that anyone tells you to do on a forum where others have something to gain by telling you to buy, hold, or sell at any particular time.  Use you own mind, and your own thoughts, as they are our truest weapons of survival and prosperity as humans, and we give up that survival and prosperity when we let others think for us.**

The statement above was hard earned through the tech bubble, the banking crisis (where I saw the Fed Chairman lie directly to the public) and by closely watching the forums of gold game ponzy investments, where the cheer leading, nay saying, and self-delusion often reach psychotic levels.

So, what am I saying with this post?  Should you buy or sell or stuff your bitcoins in your mouth as a ward against demons?

**I'm saying that you need to think.  Forget about what you want to happen at this moment, and sit down with a pencil and paper and start diagramming out all of the possibilities that could happen, how likely you think (not feel, but think) they are to happen, what impact they will have if they do happen, and what strategy you can use that gives the best results based on this.**

And if your strategy is to hold, then hold.  If it is to sell, then sell.  If it is to buy, then buy.  If it is to sell now to possibly buy cheaper, then do so.  And don't let anyone tell you that you're wrong, evil, or an asshole for using your mind and doing what you want with your property and resources.  It's yours not theirs, and they are wrong to even suggest that they have a claim to what you do with it.",cryptocurrency,1365706982

First, it makes our (USA) debt crisis look less severe when compared to other (insolvent) nations. Second, it suggests that debt should be proportional to GDP. If the economy grows, it justifies increased spending, even deficit spending. The services that need to be provided by government are not related to the size of the economy. It also suggests that maintaining or decreasing the ratio is progress. DEBT IS CUMULATIVE, it doesn't matter if the rate stays the same or even decreases. Third, it normalizes the concept that debt and deficit spending is an imperative. I'm shocked that more folks don't cry bullshit when this statistic is used to justify reckless deficit spending.  If you apply the same concept to a small town, the concept is obviously silly.  However, when applied to the federal government, it doesn't seem outrageous.

personalfinance,Pay accrued interest or put towards balance?,"Hello r/PF, got a question for you.  I am currently in in-school deferment for my student loans, however I want to make payments on them to reduce my payment amounts when they come due (which is the first of next year).  I have A LOT of loans, but will be making payments on the highest interest rate (6.8%).  My question is whether it would be more advantageous to pay the accrued interest on the loans to take advantage of the student interest rate tax deduction or to simple put that same amount of money towards the principal.  

My thought process thus far is that if I pay off $2500 worth of accrued interest this year, I will be paying off money that capitalizes on 12/28/13 anyway, plus I will be reducing my taxable income by $2500, and my federal tax liability by $375, which I should get back as a refund (which would in turn go towards my student loans).  On the other hand, if I make a $300 payment towards the principal each month for the next 8 months, I will only be saving a total of $61.20 in interest over the course of the year (this math is probably wrong, its been a long time since Intro to Finance).  So my back of the envelope calculations lead be towards paying the $2500 to the interest.  

Am I missing anything huge here or is this the right way to go?

edit: Don't focus on whether a payment can be applied to principal only.  That's not at all what I am asking.  I have loans with little accrued interest that I can pay then the remainder of the payments go towards the principle balance.  I also have loans that have plenty of accrued interest I could focus on paying.  This may have been the wrong sub to post to.",finance,1365643701

Private mortgage note. Originated 1988, final payment 3/2018. Have payment records from 1998, never late, pays early, not concerned about default.

Taxes and insurance are collected and paid from escrow, so no concern of tax liens or anything.

    Remaining payments: 59

    Monthly payment, P/I: $469.91

Note discount: Would be valued at $17,000, which is what other investors have quoted. In other words, would it be better to inherit 17k cash or this note?

Obviously this depends on other needs for cash, investment opportunity cost, etc... Please assume that money is not needed right now and might otherwise be invested into safe blue chip stocks or an index fund if cash were inherited.

Do you think that my aunt could offer the borrower a discount or pay some of his closing costs to refinance into a lower rate so she would get paid back earlier?

personalfinance,Financial Advice 24 Years Old...,"Hey everyone.. been lurking for a long time, finally decided to create an account and post. I'm considering moving out of my parent's house and wanted to know if I'm making the right move and also consider any tips that you could provide. 

Age:24

Location: Central NJ

Employment: Full Time Job, 72K/year +10k bonus potential. 

Retirement: Employer deposits an additional 8% into a 401K plan on top of my salary. I contribute 2% which is then matched an additional 50%, which means in total my 401k contributions are 13% of my salary ($9,360/year).

Assets: Approx 35K in a high yield AMEX savings account earning .8%. I also have about $1,500 invested in an S&amp;P 500 mutual fund. 

Debt: 5 year car loan with a 16K balance. Car is a 2011 Golf GTi purchased in July 2011. Blue book is around 19k. Interest rate on the loan is 1.9%. No credit card debt and student loans are paid off. My credit score is around 760 if it matters. 

I found a great condo that the owner is renting out for $1,150/month, but I'm unsure if I should be renting or if now is the time to buy. I'll most likely be moving in with my girlfriend in about 2 years after she finishes grad school, but for now I will be on my own. 

It will obviously be more difficult to save once I'm on my own, but I'm not sure what a realistic target should be. I would eventually like to buy a condo/townhome. 

Any tips/advice are appreciated!! Thanks.",finance,1365639606
Bitcoin,My BTC investment thesis,"Before I start, I want to disclose that I have sold all my BTC and do not intent to buy any in the future.


First, let me say that I think the whole concept of BTC is an interesting idea and there are many positives (especially in this economic environment) to using the currency.  However, I believe that the negative aspects of the currency far outweigh the positives and I'll highlight why I have a negative outlook on the currency and don't think that it will work going forward... even as a niche product


* As we saw today, there is an extreme lack of confidence in the currency.  Due to the volatility and the fact that it is rather complex, it will be extremely hard to get more people to adopt the currency.  Further, a stable monetary policy with clear guidance is necessary to establish a currency... something that BTC will never have

* The lack of infrastructure is a huge bottleneck, which not only makes the market less liquid, but also easier to manipulate.  Look at how little trading volume there is in relation to the marketcap of the currency... clearly manipulation is going on right now and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Without any sort of regulations in place, even the exchanges can easily manipulate the currency and perform illegal activities such as skimming

* I don't think the benefits of it being an anonymous currency is a good thing.  It is not really possible for the government to regulate the currency where tax avoidance schemes can flourish.  For example, good luck trying to convince the IRS that you lost 500k speculating in BTC to offset your capital gains.  Many forms of (illegal) market manipulation such as wash trading are easily to reproduce.  

* There's a huge conundrum with the currency is for it to grow, more people will have to adopt it.  But as the currency continues to grow, the more governments will pay attention to it and (most likely) make it illegal.  The US government spends billions of dollars and sends thousands of its citizens to secure Iraq and mountain the petrodollar.  Do you really think they'll turn a blind eye to BTC if it gains traction?  It wouldn't even be hard for the US govt to justify the banning of it to the public - its impossible for them to regulate and a lot of 'devious' activities are performed using BTC as a currency due to its anonymous nature

* BTC has no intrinsic value.  The USD is backed by the full power of the US Army and its currency reserves, land, people and resources with a regulatory body.  Even gold which value is also rather arbitrary at least has some commercial uses and a desirable physical appearance 


Good luck everyone.",cryptocurrency,1365638496

Bitcoin,"Alternative Views of ""The Crash""","I have a few ideas about the price movements of Bitcoin over the last few weeks. I hold &lt; 10 BTC, and had no intention of selling at any point, but I did give some serious consideration to buying more at various points along the road to $300. In fact, I did buy 0.75 just before the peak, which in some strange way makes me feel like I can say that I was ""part of something special"", but realistically, it was the classic sucker move: ""buy high, sell low"" (even though I still have no intention of liquidating my coins. **ALL OR NOTHING**!)

I'll put two of my ideas here (one for the way up, and one for the way down) and would be curious to get others opinion on this.

1\. **The Way Up**
  Popular opinion, and the mainstream media, tell the story that it was ""recent events in Cyprus"" which triggered people from other countries to flee fiat and traditional banking systems and flood into Bitcoin, leading to a price rise. I have a major issue with this, and that is simply that no sane person would choose *bitcoin* as a realistic destination for the funds they withdrew from fiat/banks. What about precious metals? ETF's? Shares in publicly traded companies? Bitcoin's current utility is, for the most part, as a means of transaction. Sure, some people would do it, maybe for *part* of their income, but the proportion of the world who knew much about Bitcoin at the time (or even now) is pretty small. So, the first part of my ""way up"" story is that I think there is something fishy about the explanation that has been popularised. Its human nature to simplify things but I think that this view is a little *too* simple. 

  So, my view is that something else was going on, probably many ""something elses"" going on, which could provide a better explanation for the recent growth. 
 
  * The Trading View: Suckers ""buy high, sell low"" but the smart guys ""buy low, sell high"", and in addition, have the correct appetite for risk and financial backing to take a position before the majority are even aware it existed. After the price started to go up, they may even give it another nudge in the right direction. If they meet little resistance on the sell side, they may nudge it a little further. Potentially, they have access to some media outlet (blogs, forums, local newspapers, larger newspapers, tv stations, whatever) and give things another little push from there. What they are waiting for is an  influx of other ""investors"" who feel like they've spotted a great opportunity, but the opportunity (or most of it) has already gone, and the current price reflects the current market sentiment etc. (My thinking here has been heavily influenced by [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator), by Edwin Lefevre.

  * The Transactional View: There are many sides to this. Increasing numbers of vendors accepting BTC in exchange for goods and services would lead to an increase in the price, as sellers now demand higher prices for the BTC that they need to liquidate (in order to pay their expenses which are most likely denominated in another currency) The story of the guy who sold a Porsche for 300BTC (or others like that which we havnt heard about): wait a little, then sell and buy a Lamborghini... People who are trying to shift wealth from one currency to another without leaving a paper-trail (money laundering etc.) All these guys are using BTC as a method of transaction, and ultimately intend to liquidate back to fiat and carry on with their normal lives, but, in order to carry out the transaction, they need to take a potentially quite large position in BTC, which would tend to drive the price up.

  My point I guess is that while it is certainly true that there was some wild speculation, the main movements were initiated by people who knew what they were doing and why they were doing it, and at all times understood the risk/reward tradeoff in front of them.

2\. **The Way Down**
  Some of what happened here could be due to the closing of the transactional exposures that I mentioned above. A business that has sold a product or service using one currency, but who has exposure to the exchange rate with another currency, will constantly be monitoring the value of their current exposure. These guys dont really care how high the price goes, but they need to be sure that they don't lose out if the price drops below their break-even point. They were not in it to make money from price movements. They were there to take advantage of the transactional properties of BTC. Same goes for the Porsche/Lamborghini guy(s) and the ""big money movers"".

  The trading view applies here too though. Again, I am excluding the mass effect of the ""bubble"" etc, and trying to think about how big, clever players would operate here. Traders who had accumulated a large position when the price was lower would start to suspect that the price was trading too high. They would test this hypothesis by selling a bit, and observing the market response. If their ""lot"" was snapped up, then they would most likely sell a larger chunk, and again observe the response. The price would most likely be still rising here, as more and more people queue up to buy the BTC that the ""buy low, sell high"" guys are selling. Ideally, they would liquidate their entire position while the price was still rising. Now, they have profit, and no BTC, and they are ready to make their next move (or walk away and look for opportunities elsewhere). So, you have no BTC but you believe that the price is now trading **way** too high (according to your market hypothesis), and know that if you had some, you would be selling all of it. In traditional financial markets, you would start to short sell the instrument, and continue to do so for as long as your margin/broker allowed, and for as long as your market hypothesis supported that strategy. In BTC, there is no ""official"" exchange available to you for this, but it could be easily achieved with an OTC transaction. First, you find someone with a large BTC holding. Then, you agree to borrow her BTC, and agree an appropriate interest rate, and sign some legal agreements if necessary, and agree to pay her back the same number of BTC you borrowed. Now you continue your selling strategy, selling the BTC that you've borrowed, and observing the market response. In the same way that you didn't accumulate your earlier position in one large ""buy"" trade, you dont now distribute your BTC in one large ""sell"" trade. But you do hope to sell all the BTC before the price starts to go the other way. You may even start to contact your various media outlets (blogs, FB, twitter, tv stations etc) to let them know that in your opinion, the price is too high, and that this is probably a bubble etc. You dont really care if the price crashes, or if it just decreases a little bit, you are ""selling high"" with the intention of buying back later at a lower price. When you eventually close out your position, and buy back all the BTC you sold (again, probably while the price is still dropping, by buying from the sellers who are in a ""rush to the doors"") you return the BTC to the lender, and you sit back and start to form another market hypothesis.

**TL;DR** Speculation likely fuelled the recent price action on the upside and the downside, but, I believe that there are reasonable stories that could be told to explain the real motivations behind what happened, and to understand who the real winners are.",cryptocurrency,1365805979

Bitcoin,Surprise! Bitcoin IS NOT a currency - it is an investment vehicle. Read below.,"Bitcoin is not a currency. It is an investment vehicle, and nothing more.

Why?

Currencies are intended to facilitate transactions. Bitcoin isn't, and never was. It is an investment vehicle by design. Allow me to explain, in simple 5 year old terms and internet hypotheticals.

Hypothetical: Let's say that a new currency named ""BSCoin"" has been introduced. Whoever has seigniorage (the right to produce BSCoin) prints exactly 1 BSCoin per day. At first, BSCoins are worthless because nobody knows what they are. Very few people use them, so the small amount of currency in circulation doesn't matter. Let's say that an average of 5 BSCoins pass hands every day. Not a big deal; after just 5 days worth of printing the BSCoin printer has enough to satisfy demand.

A year passes, and BSCoin becomes immensely popular. Instead of 5 BSCoins involved in private transactions every day, there is now enough demand for BSCoin as a medium of exchange that 500 BSCoins could be transacted every day. However, the BSCoin printer continues printing only 1 BSCoin per day; there are only 365 BSCoins in circulation when there is enough demand for 500 BSCoin transactions *per day*.

Disclaimer time - obviously the value of transactions isn't equivalent to the demand for a currency; however, for the sake of this illustration this vast over-simplification is sufficient.

So, there are only 365 BSCoins in circulation and yet there is a demand for BSCoin which far exceeds its supply. There are now two options:

1. BSCoin printer continues making 1 BSCoin per day, ignoring market demands. The value of BSCoin therefore increases relative to other currencies / goods, meaning that deflation takes place. Bread which had cost 1 BSCoin on day 1 now costs ~ .75 BSCoins on day 365. Deflation gets more severe as time goes on, because demand for BSCoin keeps outstripping the supply of BSCoin. Prices fall every day.
2. BSCoin printer increases his printing to adjust for demand, seeking to maintain price stability. Said printer prints more BSCoins, and bread which cost 1 BSCoin on day one still costs 1 BSCoin on day 365.

So, which of those two scenarios is a better functioning currency?

Option 2. Which is what our central banks (generally) do. A stable currency is better for business and for international transactions. Allow me to illustrate:

Let's say you run a sugar plantation in Brazil, and you sell your sugar abroad (the un-dentally-hygenic English need the stuff for their tea). It takes 5 months to ship your sugar from Brazil to England. Obviously, you're not going to put all your sugar in a boat and kiss it goodbye without a contract from a buyer promising to pay you - otherwise you could just be screwed when it arrives - so you demand a contract. But how do you know what to charge, if you're using BSCoin? 

Option 1 - Today bread costs 1 BSCoin, but under option 1 who knows what it will cost by the time your sugar arrives? You could be losing your shirt. Furthermore, your buyer also doesn't know what the sugar should really be worth by the time it arrives. Deflation could spike and cost him his shirt. Neither of you are very likely to enter into the contract, because you can't predict future prices.

Option 2 - Today bread costs 1 BSCoin, and under most conditions (barring an economic catastrophe) bread will cost around 1 BSCoin by the time your sugar arrives. Prices, you recall, are predictable and steady, because the producer increases and decreases BSCoin production in response to demand. You sign the contract, happy to know that you'll make money, and your buyer also signs the contract, knowing that he can sell it in England and still make a profit when it arrives.

What does bitcoin do?

Bitcoin purposefully DECREASES supply as time goes on. It does the exact opposite of option 2 - it LOWERS production as demand increases. That's beyond idiotic for an actual currency; however, it is fantastic for being an investment vehicle. After all, what better investment can have a guaranteed lowering of supply and raising of demand? If it were designed to a currency, it would seek price stability, or at least something close to price stability. It doesn't: it seeks the opposite. It purposefully seeks appreciation in value.

It is an INVESTMENT, not a currency. It was never a currency. It was ALWAYS an investment.

Oh, and the truly interesting thing: it only gains value as an investment if demand increases. Why would people want useless bits of information? Well, you convince them that it's a currency (as about 3/4 of you dupes apparently believe) or you convince them that other people will eventually want it. Which is exactly what Bitcoin and all its prosthelytizers do. ""Bitcoin is amazing!"" ""It is free of politics, and guaranteed to rise!"" ""It is the future of anonymous transactions, everyone will use it!""

Bitcoin relies on people's perceived (higher) future value of bitcoin, not on its actual utility as a medium of exchange. It is, as a result, an INVESTMENT VEHICLE and not a currency. And when people get off the bandwagon and begin questioning why they want to participate in the bitcoin market ... guess what happens to its value?

I look forward to my downvotes at the hands of ignorant anarchist / libertarians who know nothing about how monetary policy works, but are undeterred by their ignorance and hold vociferous opinions about bitcoin's unbelievably amazing and bright regardless.",cryptocurrency,1365803650

2. 2,555 @ 8.5%
3. 82,147 @ 7.9% 
4. 57,968 @ 6.8%

Right now I'm on a low-paid internship ($22,000 on the year), equating to about $1300 per month coming in. I have a credit score over 700 (703 average). I own my car out right (2008) and unless something awful happens it should be okay. I have about 13k saved up over the 4 years of loans. I have 3k in a ROTH IRA, but I'm not intending on touching that unless absolutely necessary. I'm looking at reasonably making about 65-70k in my first year of work and getting a job should be relatively easy as I have several prospects lined up (I should receive a doctorate in clinical psych in about 4 months from a respected school, APA accredited, etc. etc.). I should be able to boost my income about 10% after receiving my license (about $6,500) but will incur the responsibility of liability insurance after that (about $800). 

My expenses:

Rent: 1,100 p/m
Utilities: 220 p/m
Travel: 200 p/m
Food: 150p/m
Discretionary: 75p/m

The other noteworthy thing is that I'm planning on getting married in October of this year. Fiance is debt-free and making about 50k right now, with about 6k saved up (she has not done well in saving until recently). Right now she lives with her family, so her expenses are relatively low, as follows:

Food: 150 p/m
Utils: 100 p/m
Insurances: 140 p/m
Healthcare: 200 p/m (she has some conditions that require consistent care)
Travel: 250 p/m (gas mostly) 
Discretionary: ?? Don't know.

So, my questions:
1. How in the blue hell do I dig out of this debt? I know there are several options on the studentloans.gov website, but quite frankly I don't know squat about finance outside of giving the particulars and trying to be relatively frugal. 
2. Should I apply for these repayment plans prior to getting married since our combined income will be higher? 
3. I've heard from colleagues that staying in school (taking some online comm college courses) will carry over the debt into the next year, when more benefits and lower rates should take over? Is this even true? Can anyone show me the sources that say this, or even confirm the legitimacy of the hearsay? 
4. We're both likely to take on some inheritance from family situations, however not directly from our parents, is there a best way to receive this money?
5. To me, it makes sense to pay off that $2,500 loan at 8.6. It's the highest interest rate and I have more than enough to knock it out. Is this actually a good idea?

I appreciate any assistance you all can offer in terms of insight into how to improve this situation and whether #5 directly above seems like a good idea. Thank you so much.

She's really bad with money, and the card was supposed to be a gift to help me with expenses.

I never used the card. It sat unactivated among all my financial papers for a year. I forgot it existed

Fast forward to summer 2012. I'm about to get my first grown-up job and I want to save up to buy a car and begin building my credit. I checked my credit score and it said 714, so I figured I'd get a decent rewards credit card.

WRONG. When I applied for a credit card, I was denied. So I applied for a Target card, thinking that would be easier to qualify for--also denied. Couldn't figure out why

My student loans were coming out of deferment about that time too, and as the loan counselor was going through my debts she told me about the AmEx card. Apparently, my mother has $10,000 in credit card debt on that one card.

This is why I couldn't get approved for any credit cards. So I called AmEx and got them to cancel my connection to the account and take it off my credit score. They told me my mom had to call and make another cancellation on her end (??). So my mom calls and they tell her she doesn't have to do anything because the card was already closed out (??).

What the hell? What should I do? How do I remove this $12,000 dead weight that isn't even mine? (Sorry for the length)

I had an idea that perhaps I should consider borrowing money from my 401k as a loan for ~14k or so to reach the 10% mark as a down payment on a house.  I Have no fears w/ my job, stable, good salary etc but I do have concerns on how it will affect my retirement.

Right now I make about 95k and contribute 14% to my 401k + an employer match.  I also have about 50k in my 401k and 9k in traditional IRA.


Currently, it would take me several years to save to get to 10% and considerably longer to 20% (pay all my bills, high rent area (~1500) which isn't really acceptable; only 10% is a realistic number I""ll wait for to buy a house.  I do want to get a ring for my girlfriend as well so that'll be another 5-7k in the very short term.  She will move in w/ me in the house but will be unable to really help w/ bills until she graduates from her master's program in a year or so. I am concerned that waiting several years for the money to do all of htis would be a worse decision than taking out the 401k loan because if interest rates rise and/or houses appreciate,  I would have made more by buying a house than renting + waiting.

Note: No matter what, I have to move out in September and I'm hoping that it's not another shitty, over priced apartment.  Hope you can help PF!


Edit*: No one has convinced me this is a bad idea.  Their only point is that the mortgage is too high blah blah blah.  Unfortunately the reality is that mortgages will always be that high because that is the smallest sized house that we can get in a reasonable area close to high paying jobs.  I've done 100% of the calculations and saving $700 a month is completely reasonable for the short term.  Explain to me WHY this is a bad idea to borrow from my 401k if I'm going to pay it back in 1-1.5 years.  No one has answered that question.

Bitcoin,"Idea: Exchanges set the value of a Bitcoin based on a carefully decided algorithm, instead of demand","Disclaimer: I have zero knowledge of economics, so feel free to shoot me down if this is a stupid idea.

Bitcoin is wonderfully secure, but exchanges are the weakest link. One of Bitcoin's founding principles is that no matter how corrupt the players are, the game remains perfectly fair. Unfortunately, as soon as Bitcoin interacts with fiat money, algorithms and security are overshadowed by speculation and greed.

Would it be possible to define some rules that determine the relationship between Bitcoin and fiat money? Instead of relying on demand to tell us what a Bitcoin is worth, what if every exchange agreed to set a price according to a carefully constructed algorithm?

It could include factors such as volume of transactions, rate of generation, total Thps, average cost of electrical power, estimated number of lost coins, etc. The deflation could be calculated to mimic a typical bank's interest rate, so that people would still be encouraged to spend their bitcoins.

The value of Bitcoin is already tied to fiat money whether we like it or not. These bubbles and crashes are going to keep happening, so I was just wondering if something could be done to fix it.",cryptocurrency,1365770951
personalfinance,PMI,"Bought my house for 135k with 15k down in June 2008. 30y FHA loan. Did an FHA steam line refi twice to bring my interest rate down to 3.75% from 6%. After June I'll have had 60 months in on the mortgage and would like to pay the mortgage down to 78% to have the PMI (currently $105 a month) lifted. Currently owe around 115k and would have to put another 9-10k to get down to 105300k (.78*135000). 

I am basing this theory off the following information I found on FHA loans and PMI. Is this correct? Can I expect to throw another 10k at my principle and have my PMI lifted? Is this a good idea if I am able to do it?

personalfinance,My weeklong experience trying to refinance,"Background: Current mortgage has $178K remaining % 5.375 interest rate ($1142/month).  It's a 30-year mortgage that started in 2005, so I'm 8 years into it with 22 years to go.  It's not the worst loan in the world, which is why I haven't refinanced.  We've never had a late payment, and my wife and I both have good credit.

Last Friday:

My current mortgage company calls out of the blue and asks if I want to refinance under the HARP program.  Since they are my current mortgage provider, they have all my info (amount left on current mortgage, current interest rate, etc).  They say I can get a 10-year fixed, 15-year fixed, or a 20-fixed loan if I refinance.  I can't swing the 10-year fixed, but I tell them I'm interested in the 15-year first and maybe the 20-year depending on the interest rate.

She says the interest rate on the 15-year fixed is about 2.75%, which I'm excited about.  She tells me I can save $80K in interest costs by switching to the 15-yr fixed over the life of the loan.  I tell her I'll think about it over the weekend and call her back on Monday.

Monday:

I ran the numbers over the weekend, and if I can get a 15-year fixed at 2.75%, I'd be throwing like $350/month more toward principal than what I have now.  The monthly payment would go up to $1242 (instead of the current $1142), but I can swing that, and I make up the $2100 closing costs by paying less interest in like 8-9 months.  This is a no-brainer.  I want the 15-year fixed instead of the 20-year fixed, because there's about a 0.75% different in the interest rate between the two.

So I call her back and she gets all my info.  Credit scores come back good (814 &amp; 740 for me and my spouse).  She sends my info to underwriting for the 15-year fixed.

Tues:

She calls me back and says I've been approved for the 15-year fixed at 3.54%, which is a completely different loan than at 2.75%.  Payment would be $1300/month roughly with the closing costs ($2100) rolled into the loan.  Now we're at $160/month more than what I'm paying now, which is OK in the long run, but it makes me a little nervous.  I ask her about the 20-year fixed.  She says it's at 3.6%.  I wonder in my head why there's so little difference between the 3.54% on a 15-yr vs. 3.6% on the 20-year - it should be something like 0.75% difference.  Warning signs should have been going off, but I tell her go ahead with the 20-year fixed.  Again the closing costs ($2100) would be rolled into the loan.  So I expect the loan to jump from $178K to $180K (ok, not a big deal).

Wed:

She calls me back and says the 20-year fixed is now at 4.06%.  The payment would be $1110/month, which is only $30 less than I'm paying now.  The loan balance would be $183K.  I never did understand how it rose from $180K the previous day (with closing costs rolled in, remember) to $183K.  She made it sound like prepaying the home insurance for 1-year would be rolled into the loan, but that's usually not included in the loan value.  The 20-year fixed only cuts off 2 years from the loan.  Now it takes me like 2 years to make up the closing costs by paying less interest.  So I tell her I'm not going to refinance.

Summary:

- I hope my experience is not typical of the average refinance process, but I fear that it is.  I'm assuming that only people with perfect credit can get the low rates they dangled in front of me at the start (2.75% for 15-yr fixed).  I don't have the best credit in the world, but I thought a credit score of 814 was decent.  Instead they continually offered me about 0.75% more than the ""teaser"" rate they first said.  This was very frustrating.
- If the refinance process was this painful for me (decent credit, knowledgable about loans), I can't imagine how painful this is for the average homeowner.  No wonder mortgage companies get such a bad rap.
- The refinance they pitched me was part of the HARP program, which leads you to believe they are here to help.  But in the end it's just a typical refinance, one where they earn a lot of fees in closing costs.  I never did understand how she got to the $183K loan value when I was expecting it to be $180K with the closing costs.  Treat it like a business decision, because that's what it is.
- I've really soured on the refinance process.  If a different mortgage company called me up today, I would just hang up.  I think a lot of people think refinancing is easy (""we'll just refinance in a few years""), but it's not.  It's a process that really frustrated me.",finance,1365767763

investing,Why I Stopped Investing and Started Trading!,"As a kid growing up in suburban Maryland no one ever taught me about the wonders of the stock market. Both of my parents were federal government employee's and looked forward to generous pensions when they retired. Their financial future never depended on the stock market so that probably explains why they never shared its existence with me.
After high school I went to college and later to the U.S. Army. Even during that six year period the stock market and investing wasn't a part of my consciousness. It wasn't until I began working for the federal government that I was introduced to investing. For those not familiar with the federal system, government employees have a 401k like benefit plan called the Thrift Savings Plan or TSP. Within the TSP I found out I had the option to invest in five different ""funds"". The TSP opened my eyes to benchmarks like the S&amp;P500 and the Russell 2000. When I learned about dollar cost averaging and compound interest I just knew it would be just a matter of time before I became a millionaire. At the time, my plan was to max out my TSP contributions and then with my extra savings mirror my TSP fund allocations in a regular brokerage account.
So how did things go? Well, for a while everything went great! For a few years it seemed like the market was headed for the stars. Everyone at work bragged about how fast their accounts were growing. The real estate market was also going bananas at the time. I should have known something was wrong when all my neighbors talked about how large their lines of credit were. The idea that it all (or at least a good chunk of it) could disappear almost overnight never even occurred to me. Well, as we all know the bottom fell out. And as I now know the market moves in cycles. No matter how smart you are or how much you've mastered technical analysis (and all that other fancy stuff) I'm convinced no one can time the market. All we know is that it will rise and it will fall. This cycle just repeats itself over and over again.
After experiencing my first crash I must admit I became shell shocked. I didn't know if I should stay the course, forget stocks and move to bonds, focus on REIT's and dividend paying stocks, buy gold or just bury my money in the back yard! During that period I tried EVERYTHING! And just like the market my brokerage account went up and down. I knew there had to be a better way. I just didn't know where to turn or who to trust. Luckily, one day in my local Barnes and Noble I came across a book about trading options. I'll explain in my next article how that book opened up a whole new world for me. That book was the beginning of my transformation from an investor to a trader!",finance,1365737490
personalfinance,"Early 20s, Getting the most out of my money (CA)","Hello all, using a throwaway here to remain slightly more anonymous.

Here are the main stats:

**Income**

* $68,000 / year salary
* Expecting to have solid salary growth until it caps out at ~120k in 5-7ish years.

**Expenses**

* Monthly expenses around $2,400 (high COL city)
* No debt

**Assets**

* $5,500 in an RRSP (similar to a Traditional 401k)
  * Contibuting 5% (the max) of my pay for 10% total, after the employer match
  * $15,000 of unused contribution room above the standard 18% of income per year
*  $27,500 in TFSA accounts (similar to a Roth IRA)
   * $10,000 in cash (current emergency fund), $13,000 in ING Streetwise Funds, $4,500 in an [index fund portfolio](http://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/) at a discount brokerage
   * No ununsed contribution room
* Currently putting $500 biweekly into a high-interest savings account with $3,500 in there already.

I know I'm in a pretty solid position, but I still have some questions to ensure I make the most of it.

**1** - My plan for the short term is: 

* Continue saving $500 biweekly into the unregistered savings account until I reach $10,000, making this my new emergency fund.  Since interest rates are so tiny I'm not worried about the extra taxes.
* Consolidate all of my TFSA savings into the brokerage account in early 2014 (due to withdraw/deposit rules).  I figure since all gains are not taxable, I'd rather use this account for ETFs than a savings account.
* Continue getting the max employer match, but I won't worry about using up all of my current and unused RRSP room until the above is done.  My tax bracket is going nowhere but up anyway.

Any issues you can see with this plan?

**2** - With regards to asset allocation between accounts, is there any disadvantage to having the same X/Y bond/equity split in each account, rather than just maintaining that split on the total level?

**3** - Seeing as I'm still in my 20's, the 40/60 bond/equity split isn't aggressive enough.  Does something closer to 20/80 or 25/75 seem reasonable for someone with a medium risk tolerance?

personalfinance,Purchasing Vanguard retirement fund,"Hey guys, 

So I've got a bit of money sitting in a bank account earning a meager interest rate, about 5k and I'd like to put some of it to use.

Here's some background info:

I don't have any major bills to pay, besides car insurance and gas. I'm a college student, but my scholarships pay for tuition and housing. I work roughly 30 hours a week and bring home ~7-800 a month. I have two credit cards that I have been using the last year or so to build credit. I just recently purchased a new used car that is in relatively great condition. I do not anticipate any unexpected bills (but then again...they are unexpected). The only debt I have is credit card, which I pay off completely monthly. 

I'd like to invest around 2.5k of what I have in a long-term Roth IRA mainly because of the tax advantage, in addition to the fact that I don't need this money (hopefully) for quite a while.

I was looking in particular at Vanguard's Target Retirement 2050 fund, located [here](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0699&amp;FundIntExt=INT#tab=1).

I did notice, though, that the TR 2045 fund is cheaper and has had a higher return over the years, would I be better off purchasing that? The TR 2055 seems more in line with what Vanguard suggests for my age, however.

Bitcoin,Net worth of richest people in the world compared to bitcoins and money supply of the USD.,"According to wikipedia, there are ~29,000 people worth $100M or more. 

Here it is in a graphic.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Number_of_High_Net_Worth_Individuals,_2011_v4.jpg

There are also apparently around 1M people who have between $10M and $100M. 

If you were to apply that to bitcoins, and assumed that the 21M BTC had been mined, then having 21btc would put you (at a minimum) in the top 1M of all people holding bitcoins, and possibly higher since not everyone would have 21.0 btc.  

If BTC goes mainstream and gets away from the serious volatility, does that mean that potentially having 21btc (being a millionTHaire) would be some kind of near equivalent of having $10M-$100M?  

If so, on the low end, having 21.0 btc being equal to $10M would mean 1 btc = $476,190.00.  

Is that realistic? That would mean the value of all the 21M bitcoins (net currency supply) would be $10 Trillion dollars.

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=21+million+times+%24476190

$10 Trillion is a lot, but consider this:

1) The US Federal Budget is $3.5T http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2011.png

2) The currency supply of the US Dollar is $10.5T  http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/

If bitcoin took 100% saturation in the US Economy (which it won't) then that would happen instantly.  I think it is possible, however, given the global economy.

Once the currency supply of bitcoin is valued at $10T, having 21.0 bitcoins (a millionTHaire) would be similar to having $10M in today's economy.",cryptocurrency,1365896189

Bitcoin,Bitcoin - My analysis after only one week of exploring the topic,"**I know this post is not going to 'blow your mind' but I thought some of you long time bitcoin enthusiasts might appreciate my perspective after only a week of giving bitcoin any serious thought**

I work as an IT professional and I'm and avid gamer.  I first came across bitcoin a few years back when it was only worth around $7 a coin and there was virtually no way to exchange it for real value.  At the time, I investigated CPU mining, but never did enough research to learn about 'pools'.  After a few days of mining with all my idle processing power (2-3 computers) and not finding a block I shelfed the idea of bitcoin and moved back to things more interesting - gaming, women, etc.)  When the project was new it had not convinced me to look into it's potential (something I now regret very deeply.)

I had not bothered to do the research into how bitcoin could revolutionize the way we transfer money.  Virtually untraceable (unlike credit cards and ATM transactions, secure, and it can be exchanged for major currency fairly easily.)  I didn't look into the advantages of bitcoin as a decentralized currency, or a way to transfer money between currencies with a much smaller fee than going through a bank.  I also had not recognized the possible criminal uses such as money laundering or the potential to have your bitcoin wallet scammed out of your hands.

Once bitcoin became valuable and began making the morning podcasts on NPR that I subscribe to I began to take it seriously.  As an IT professional, gaming enthusiast, and competitive sports better... my life has been revolutionized with this new interest in bitcoin. Nearly 10% of my free time is now poured into further research on the subject, other alternative digital currencies, and the actual buying and selling as well.  This is absolutely fascinating and I hope for the best as bitcoin gains more and more publicity.  I will continue to invest as well as research the subject as government will inevitably decide how to regulate such a thing as a de-centralized currency.

As much as I am curious about bitcoin, I believe it will succeed regardless of my participation.  The potential it offers to the trade and barter process if it remains secure will guarantee it a place in the history books.  Even with the volatility of its trading value it appears to have been a solid investment since day one.

Amazing times we live in gentleman.  Amazing times indeed.

**I am also fascinated by the philosophical discussion of Bitcoin's potential but I am still learning so much about it... are there any good resources available that I might not have stumbled across?

Of course, be aware the exchange is in Russia or possibly Bulgaria and if anything happens the owner could just disappear, but this is highly unlikely. Why would you walk away from a money machine.

Bitcoin,Thoughts on this question and response? Its about negative interest rates and deflation (bitcoin deflation),"&gt;Suppose that, in the far future when everything calms down, the bitcoin deflation rate is 10% in terms of real goods (next year you'll be able to buy 10% more stuff with 1 bitcoin, with a high degree of certainty, and everyone knows that.) Now say someone offers you a loan in bitcoins with the best possible interest rate, 0%. They'll give you 100 bitcoins now and all you have to do is pay back the same amount, 100 bitcoins, in 1 year.

&gt;    You are considering using the loan to make a productive investment - to purchase a machine that allows you to increase the amount of chips you can produce (say 9 bitcoins worth, for a sure 9% return on investment). At the end of the year, you could sell the machine to pay back the loan, but wait! Even if the machine is still good as new after a year of use, its value in bitcoins will have dropped 10% - you could only get 90 bitcoins for it. So at the end of the year, you'd have the 90 bitcoins from selling back the machine plus the 9 bitcoins from extra chip production, but that still wouldn't be enough to pay back the 100 bitcoin loan. So you don't take the loan and don't make the investment (unless you can find alternate financing).

My Answer:

&gt;You are playing number games here. In your example ... I could just borrow the machine... create the 9 coins ... and then return the 'like new' machine to the lender. That would be a zero percent loan and i would make 9 coins.  The gains made from using the machine don't vanish.

&gt;Either I'm right in the above argument ... OR this: the fact the a %10 deflation is occurring to begin with presumes economic growth of about %10 given the stable money supply. Hence earning %9 is worse than other investments you could have made so u lose %1 by making a bad investment.

&gt;Either the activity is productive or it isn't. (no net gains being the breakeven for a %0 loan) Can't have it both ways.

personalfinance,"I can achieve my goals and still spend like crazy, right?","Hello PF,

I've been reading this sub for about a year now, and consistently over that time have always felt I've done a great job with my personal finances. I make a decent income for my age, save some money, contribute to my 401k, ect. However, I'm starting to realize the only reason I've been able to accomplish these things is due to a continually increasing income. **It has little to do with my ability to actually plan and stick to it.** I'll give you a quick snapshot of my last two years as an example:

* Grad college in May '11
* full time job made 35K (gross) June - Oct '11
* quit, hired at 60K annual (gross) elsewhere
* quit after 3 months, hired elsewhere at 60k (gross)
* now making 83k salary (gross) a little over a year into current job, with additional bonuses. (27% raise at my 1 year)

During that time I've bought a new (I know...but I love it and I got it at 0% financing) car for 25k, paid off a portion of my student loans (owed 15k at graduation), fully funded my roth ira for 2012, put employer match amount into my 401k, and have about 5k in savings as my emergency fund. 

However, I really feel like I'm not on track for my short and long term goals. And that's where this post comes into play. I'm 24/not married, but living with my SO. 

Short term goals:

* Fully fund 2013 roth ira ($5,500) by April next year

* Keep putting 6% of income to 401k (to get 3% employer match)

* Pay off student loan remainder (~$10,000) by October '13

* Save additional $5k by end of '13. 


Long term goals:

* Take a year off without pay in 4 years and travel to wherever (about $25k saved)

* Save enough that I could put a down payment on a house if I wanted to (~50,000k for 20% to avoid PMI) in 5 years


Here is a breakdown of my current income:

* $83k gross salary

* Two bonuses a year, first one is about 2-4K, my second one ranges from 10k - 25k. I anticipate 15K this year since last year I got 10k. (gross, not net). 

So each month (yes, paid montly) my regular paycheck looks like this:

* $6,920 gross

* -415 to 401k, and then employer puts in about $200 additional (50% match first 6%)

* -47 to no deductible individual health insurance plan

* -24 to dental insurance

* -5 to long term disability

* -35 to short term disability (kicks in after 1 week, and pays 60% salary)

Taxes:

* -100 Medicare

* -1150 Fed Income tax (yikes!)

* -425 Social Security

* -400 State income tax



This leaves me with $4,325 net going into my checking accounts each month. 

I have $525 each month go to Chase account (car payment is $420, and it auto withdraws from that account, so pad it with $100 each month for extra rainy day $). 

I have the remaining $3,800 go to another high yield checking account (non-Chase) that earns 3% interest/yr. I float anywhere from $4k-$13k per month in this account. 


My monthly expenses are as follows:

* Rent 555 (my half)

* Car payment $420 (owe 17K more on the 25K total of loan)

* Student Loan $135 (owe 10K total at 6.8%)

* Cell phone through Verizon $96

* Utilities (gas+electric) avg me $20 (split w/ SO)

* Internet $30 (I pay full bill)

* Car Insurance $65 (I pay 6 months at a time though)

* Renters Insurance $11 (I pay 6 months at a time though)

* Groceries are less than $40 a month. (I travel all the time for work)

* Gas is $60 a month on average

* gym is $30

* pet $25


* Eating out $150 a month avg (typically I pay for me and my gf)

* Entertainment is well shit now that I add it up I guess this is one area I can improve. It varies by month. So, don't really budget here...in April so far I've spent just $150. 

* In March I spent ~1300 (took a 3 day vacation). And also bought a new watch for $650.

* In Feb I spent just $600, but also spent $400 on furniture, and $250 on new clothes. 

* In Jan I spent $350 on entertainment things, but $550 on clothes (new shoes were $350 of that).

* In May I plan to spend about $750 (taking another vacation).

So, I realize I have a spending problem on some level. But even with all that, if I average that to $1100 a month of fun stuff, it still leaves me with an excess of about $1600 each month to put towards my goals. 

Since I want to fully fund a roth ira for 2013, I should 

* put away $460 a month towards that over 12 months (next April). 

* For my student loans, I owe about 10K and change at 6.8%, so to pay those off by October, 8 months from now, it's $1,250 a month. 

* 401k is already taken out of my pay automatically. 

* Saving an additional $5k by end of '13 means I can take the $1,250 I no longer pay towards my loan in Nov+Dec and knock out $2,500 of that, half my goal! The other half over 10 months is $250 a month. 

Since I have about $1600 in excess right now (if I **don't** cut back spending at all) that leaves me at ira 460+loans 1,250+savings 250=1960. So I'm short about $360 a month to hit my goals in the next year. I'll have to find some place to trim that and entertainment/eating out seems to be the best place to do it. 


Are there other areas I should look to trim or things I'm not thinking of?

My biggest concern, and a major prompt for this post, is a concern about being able to save $75k in the next 5 years for a down payment on a house and my year off. That averages to saving an additional 15K a year. **I can't do that this year.** So really it's saving $75k in 4 years, or about $19k a year. That's about 36% of my current net income a year. 

I realize the big wild card here if my annual bonus and my annual raise. I do anticipate staying at my current job for at least 2 more years, if not more. My total bonuses each year will be 10-25K during that time, likely never above 15K due to my tenure. I don't necessarily anticipate such a large % raise each year, but I would anticipate a 10% raise each year at least.

Given all that, are my goals (short and long term) still attainable? Do/should I look at seriously cutting back on my entertainment spending in order to make them happen? 


Thanks for the feedback all!

Bitcoin,A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating an Anonymous Wallet for Covert Practices,"**A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating an Anonymous Wallet for Covert Practices**

With the recent Bitcoin “bubble” fiasco and the subsequent rise and fall of Bitcoin value, it seems that this subreddit has become obsessed with making money. But get-rich-quick schemes are not at the heart of  Bitcoin. Instead BTC should be seen as a way to keep Big Governments and Big Businesses from knowing how much money you have and what you choose to spend that money on. As a currency, it doesn't matter how much the value fluctuates if you plan on spending your wealth on sites like the Silk Road and etc.

(OK, maybe it does matter a little bit if the money you spent yesterday is worth twice as much today; but this guide is for spenders, not hoarders. Or at least for hoarders who also like to spend.)


Let's discuss my favorite attribute of the Bitcoin protocol: anonymity.

Many noobs getting into the Bitcoin game fail to realize that anonymity is an important key to understanding the importance of Bitcoin. In places where your wealth can easily be taking away from you (see Cyprus, Russia, China, the USA and others), Bitcoin can function like a store of cash buried in a dessert in the middle of nowhere – buried so deep that nobody can find it, not even the most powerful men and women on Earth. 

**POINT:** *If you are purchasing your Bitcoins through services like Coinbase or Mt. Gox, and if you've ever given your real name and bank account information to a Bitcoin Exchange, then you are NOT anonymous. Your Bitcoins can be traced back to you. Your purchases are recorded in the blockchain, and although it's difficult, it's certainly not impossible for those with the knowhow to find you and prosecute you. See [this link](http://decryptedmatrix.com/live/an-analysis-of-anonymity-in-the-bitcoin-system) before continuing.* 

Bitcoin is not inherently anonymous. You must take steps to protect yourself in order to keep your identity a secret. And even still, if you don't know what you are doing, you run the risk of being caught. So if you care about hiding yourself and your money, I offer this guide as a way to accomplish secret purchases and covert trades. Of course I cannot guarantee you won't end up in jail. At the end of the day, nobody knows how closely governments are tracking BTC purchases over the TOR network. Some people even believe that the TOR network was created by nefarious forces. I doubt it, but you never really know. 

**STEP ONE: Anonymous Hardware**

Because you cannot *really* know whether or not you are being watched, your first step in creating an anonymous wallet is to protect yourself by buying a **cheap** laptop computer and removing the hard-drive. Really, who needs a hard-drive anyway? Toss it in the garbage.  

**STEP TWO: Anonymous Software**

~~If you don't know how to download a Linux LiveCD, then stop reading now. You are probably not skilled enough to protect yourself anyway.~~ If you don't know how to download a Linux LiveCD, then proceed with extreme caution; downloading an ISO file and burning it to a DVD is pretty damned easy. Easier than anonymity. Those who refuse to learn are at risk.

It's arguable which software you should use, but I recommend connecting to the TOR network using [TAILS](https://tails.boum.org/), a live DVD or live USB that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. TAILS helps you to use the Internet anonymously, leave no trace on the computer you're using, and to use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, email and instant messaging. 

**ProTip:** For an extra layer of protection, download the ISO from your local library's computer. Or while you're sipping a mocha at Starbuck's. Then burn it to a DVD and take it home. Place it in your crap computer (the one without a hard-drive) and turn it on. Enter the BIOS menu and boot from CD if your computer doesn't do it automatically.

DO NOT CONNECT TO THE NETWORK FROM YOUR HOME.

I repeat, for an extra layer of security, DO NOT CONNECT TO YOUR HOME WIFI USING TAILS IF YOU WANT TO DO SHADY THINGS. That's just common sense. TAILS itself isn't illegal. But if you're the type to do shady things, you don't want to practice on your home Wifi, which you probably pay for with a bank account or credit card. 

After you've spent a day or two using TAILS and familiarizing yourself with the LinuxOS, and once you feel comfortable enough to continue, then head back to your local Starbucks, boot up the LiveCD, and connect. Browse the TOR network and triple-check that you are protected. You can do this by [checking your IP address for DNS LEAKS](http://www.dnsleaktest.com/). Only if you feel comfortably hidden from prying eyes will you want to continue.

**STEP THREE: Creating an Anonymous Wallet**

There are [several different ways to to this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b9p8d/how_unsafe_is_it_to_use_bitaddressorg_to_generate/), but the easiest way is to use the code at [bitadress.org](https://www.bitaddress.org). Thanks to /u/SpenserHanson for creating [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b9p8d/how_unsafe_is_it_to_use_bitaddressorg_to_generate/) which describes the process in detail:

1. Save bitaddress.org.html to your computer
2. Close browser.
3. Disable computer Wi-Fi.
4. Open bitaddress.org.html in browser. 
5. Generate an address and record the private keys.
6. Close the browser window.
7. Go home. Think about what you are about to do.

**STEP FOUR: Funding the Anonymous Wallet**

Funding your wallet will be the most difficult part of this process. Obviously you don't want to go to a site like Coinbase or Mt. Gox and link up you bank account, then start sending coins to your anonymous address. That would be stupid. Very stupid.

Probably the best way to get coins is to know someone who is willing to send you a few, but even then you lead a trail back to your friend. 

My suggestion is to make cash deposits through ZipZap or Bitinstant, and give them false information (for example, use the new email you created, over the TOR network, from a site like Hotmail or Yahoo, which doesn't require a phone number to sign up – I'm looking at you Gmail. Make sure your new account  forwards your email to yet another account, perhaps Tormail or a temp address. You probably won't need to use the email more than once anyway, for confirmation, if you need it. And you might want to create a new address with every deposit, just to be safe). There are other options of course. Some companies will sell you Bitcoins anonymously through Bank of America cash deposits. But remember that the moment you walk into a Big Bank and give them money, you are caught on camera. Maybe offer a homeless man some money to make the deposit for you. And hope he doesn't just pocket your money. Regardless, you want to stay away from Big Banks if you can. It really isn't that hard.

If you absolutely must make deposits from your bank account, you could send your coins to an anonymous online wallet first and then to cold storage, but make sure to use several mixing services over a period of several days. And then have trouble sleeping at night.

Another great idea is to use the [localbitcoins website](http://localbitcoins.com/); meet with a seller locally; pay cash and GTFO.

   
**STEP FOUR: Spending from the Anonymous Wallet**

 If you are looking to CASH OUT, there aren't many anonymous options besides meeting with somebody and selling face to face. You could always sign up for your own account at localbitcoins, then hope a buyer contacts you. But this guide isn't about making money, it's about spending your coins.

To buy things, you'll want to go to back to the library, connect through TAILS, download a lite client like Electrum and access your account. Every time you want to spend, you will have to re-download, but it should not take more than a few minutes. And though you are probably safe enough to spend directly from the client, if you really want to be safe you should send the funds to a second wallet though a mixing service, then to a third or fourth or fifth wallet, also through mixing services. These “Mixing Wallets” should NOT be created using the TOR network because the TOR exit node may be monitored. I've never had a problem myself, but it's theoretically possible that an attacker could record the password/private keys for the hosted wallet and steal your coins. Which is why you should NEVER USE THE SAME ACCOUNT TWICE. And never access your cold storage wallet through the net. That would be very very bad.

To created the mixing wallets you will also need a way to hide your identify without using TOR. The best way to do this is to sign up for a VPN service though a public WiFi hotspot and then pay in Bitcoin. The best service I have found is called [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/). You can access their service through a public computer, connect to the VPN, and voila, you now can safely create mixing wallets without exposing your password to the open network. Make sure that after you mix the coins you send them all to a safe, final address, which will be your Spending Wallet. 

Remaining anonymous will cost your some time and money. With each transaction you're going to have to pay for mixing, and also the transaction fee. And setting up a new email and a new account with every transaction (so that you can spread the coins across multiple fake accounts) will be bothersome but worth it in the long run. You can't put a price on piece of mind when it comes to your safety. 

**REMEMBER** Your Spending Wallet should not contain all of your funds. The bulk of your coins should be address you created using bitaddress. Never trust an online service to hold the bulk of your funds. The recent hacks have shown that the best place to store your private key is in your head.

**Final Notes:**

The Bitcoin protocol itself is not anonymous. And theoretically it's possible to trace every transaction back to you. This is why you need to use fake emails, many multiple addresses, and a VPN service with heavy encryption. Even with the knowledge and the technology to map the blockchain, the FEDS will have a hell of a time tracking multiple address though VPN tunneling back to a cold storage wallet that you created offline and only use to send coins over TOR. There are just too many roadblocks. Of course nothing is impossible. But I sleep very good at night knowing that my door is not going to be kicked in by the Men in Black. And even if you're not doing anything illegal, this sort of behavior is certainly suspicious.

If you were lucky enough to receive a tip from Reddit's own /u/bitcoinbillionaire (I myself was not) and you haven't cashed out. Create a VPN-tunneled throwaway account and tip yourself before claiming your coins. Then send them through a mixing service and to your cold storage address. Now you're on your way to being an anonymous spender. 

I hope this guide helps. I really do. **The purpose of Bitcoin isn't to make money. It's to protect the money that you already have, and to protect your identity in places where your identity is compromised.** Everybody in the world wants your money, especially the richest of the rich. You ought to do everything you can to keep yourself safe. Especially if you live in a compromised geography.

I've never fully understood reporting my freelance income. My freelancing activities are not under a business name - - they've always just been a side hobby that happens to make some money on the side. I've been freelancing since about 2008, but didn't really start to make more than $1,000+ a year until about 2011.

For past freelance jobs, I've always reported the money **IF** I received the proper form(s). But not every client has provided a form, usually because the project is something like doing wedding invitations for a friend or a small website for a friend of a friend.

To make a long story short, I use invoicing software so I know that I made $4,700 in 2012. This was not reported. 

I have already received my 2012 refund and (of course) spent in on paying off various debts and bills. Not I'm panicking because I realize that I probably owe a shit ton for the money that wasn't reported, and I don't necessarily have that money because it was spent.

* Emergency funds: 6 months
* Debt: None
* Tax Filing Status: Single
* Tax Rate: 15% Federal, 0% State
* Age: 23
* Salary: 38k while saving ~40% of my post tax paycheck.
* Retirement: 5k Roth IRA, 1k 401k. Contributing 5% to 401k getting 4% matched.

I'm not really sure what my future looks like. I'd like to buy a house and/or move out of state in the near future. This could happen next year or in five. I don't have any concrete plans. 

My questions:

I was thinking of putting 30k into retirement and 30k into some sort of short term investment. If I don't move, that 30k would give me a 20% down payment on a house at the top of my range. Does splitting the 60k like this make sense for me?

Assuming it does make sense, what's the best way to invest each half?

For retirement, the first 5.5k would go into a Roth IRA. Would it make sense to put the rest of it into my 401k? That would mean putting in an extra 15.6k to max out this year. Once 2014 hits, I would be able to put the last 9k into the IRA and 401k. 

If that's the best way to do it, should I do anything with the cash while I'm waiting for next year to come? I'm not worried about short term risk since it's for retirement. Would it be worth it to do anything other than put it in a money market account?

What about the 30k for short term investing? I don't really have much of an idea of what to do here. Maybe 10k into a I-Bond and some in a short term bond index?

Bitcoin,"For everyone worrying about Bitcoin-24, please read this.","First of all, if you are panicking: *calm down*. Because I don't think Simon is a scammer especially because he is easy to track down. 
And I doubt that he will decide to skip the Eurozone jurisdiction with a wallet full of stolen BTCs. Did anyone here ever gotten their PayPal account frozen? 
It's a pain in the ass and takes a while to sort out. For whatever reason (Simon says per request of of a German government agency) the Polish Bank locked their account. 

Therefore your fiat money is safe, because even Simon can't get to it until this issue is resolved. 
I suspect that banks don't really like having e-currency exchanges as customers just due to the tremendous transaction volume and risk of fraud or money laundering, 

hence they probably already were looking for a reason to cut him loose and when a flimsy official looking document from some German law enforcement agency came they jumped at the opportunity and locked his account which isn't exactly stellar but could be much worse. So while your fiat money is not immediately available, it should be safe. 

I think the matter could be sorted out within a few weeks, why? 
Well obviously the alleged charges that lead to the suspension of the PL account weren't enough to warrant the immediate seizure of the Germany bank account (pretty sure you need an actual warrant for that rather then just a piece of paper with a official looking letterhead).

Also if Simon were facing serious charges he'd probably be in custody by now and not posting on reddit. Now as for the BTC: I think there are a bunch of links floating around to BTC24's fat wallets. They should also hold enough BTC to refund everyone. (Sry dont have the links handy)
Now as for the **trading engine failing**. 
As far as we know it was buggy for a while due to Simons lack of expertise in the field of database transactions :)
BUT (again all guesses/my interpretation of the situation) the actual amounts lost to this glich were so small enough that Simon covered them with personal funds (I hear he runs ASIC miners?) also larger amounts would probably be noticeable when doing his regular accounting.  

As some of you know the same bug became much more apparent as the trading engine started choking under the increased load (maybe people looking for new places to trade? more bots hitting the API?). 
The shoutbox started filling up with people who saw their order fulfilled not once, or twice but 4 times (Pay for 1 BTC -&gt; get 4). 

Further proof: Simon started asking for help on StackOverflow (a QA page for programmers). While that in it self is not very confidence inspiring (btw seriously Simon, get a second Nickname for your SO profile :D) it is not as bad as it sounds. 

Why?
When this bug escalated to a degree where it was obvious that the trading engine started choking and malfunctioning and therefore became exploitable there was one safeguard in place that prevented disaster: the hot wallet was empty (as others that were there can confirm). While getting free BTC is exciting in the moment it was NOT possible to withdraw those to a wallet of your own. Shortly after the exchange was shut down.

**What happens now?**

(on a technical level) A database rollback is basically guaranteed to happen, which will restore your legitimate  balance pre trading engine craziness.

Simon will have to fix the faulty code (Simon if you happen to read this I offered my help by email)

He will have to sort the legal problems out, which will be a huge pain in the ass as the German fiscal authorities (aka local IRS) have a reaaaaaaaally hard time understanding internet based businesses much less magic internet coins lol.

This was supposed to be a reply but I think this warrants a separate post but the point I was going to make (albeit within a lot less words) is: 

**Give him a break and lay off with the lawsuit (and as this is the internet probably also death) threats**

He is fairly young (24 I think), a **real** person residing in Germany who ran the exchange with minimum fees. Yes he fucked up and got fucked. 
But the last thing this guy needs right now is people threatening to send him into personal bancrupcy by burring him in civil suits.

Edit: 
I didn't mean to imply that just because he is young he should get a free pass but rather that he has a huge incentive to fix this unless he wants to spend the rest of his life hiding from debt collectors.
I know this one will be controversial but I feel that I have to bring this up: Such an outlook can drag you down, like down down and whether you care for him as a human being or not if he, god forbid, looses hope he wouldn't be the first to collapse under pressure and make bad decisions which will benefit no one. Sorry to pull this card but we (the hacker/startup community) have seen it way to often recently.

FYI I also have about 1.5k EUR deposited with BTC24 but I am confident Simon will be able to sort this out. Pretty sure he will be able to alleviate the problems with BTC24 in a timely fashion (unless course you insist that he should rather await trial while locked up)

tl;dr
don't panic, stop harassing Simon 
(including but not limited to threads of any kind (esp. legal , life), email spam etc)  so he can focus on bringing back BTC24

FYI, not affiliated with BTC24 in any way except that I still have 1.5k EUR there. I am just someone who is fed up with this fucking panicking and because Simon is busy with more important stuff (I hope) I just want to help worried users understand the situation.

My credentials (if that helps): I am a Web Developer (Python, PHP, CoffeeScript) and a few years ago I was working on something in the same field and experienced and/or witnessed the same problems Simon is facing now.

UPDATE FROM SIMON:
Little Update! As some of you know, I had some problems with the German bank accounts in the past. I have solved the problem with moving to Poland and we had also never problems with them.
Why does this all happen? The ""Deutsche Bank"" in Germany had some phishing attacks / hacker and some funds where send to my bank account. This attacks does not stop on the ""Deutsche Bank"", because it seems, that it is a very stupid bank! So they closed my bank accounts in Germany and I got an invite from the German police, to tell them, what I am doing. After that I had no problems but my Bank accounts where closed. (this all happen in the start time of bitcoin-24)
In my opinion the problems where fixed. I moved to poland and make all business on the BZWBK. The Germans are now fighting against me and the ""Deutsche Bank"" has still the same problems, that people are sending me money from stolen bank accounts! THATS NOT MY PROBLEM! The only thing I can do now is to not accept payments from the ""Deutsche Bank"".
The Germans think now, that I am trying to get money with this methode. So they look now, where I have money and try to close all bank accounts.
Why in Poland? The Germans think, I am a criminal guy and they will stop the crime. They asked the poland for help and they closed my bank account in poland.
I have 7 days to make something against this, otherwise my bank account will be closed for the next 3 month! I am very sure, that we can get back the bank account in the next time. I will not give you a promise, but it is possible, that I will get back the bank account in the next week.",cryptocurrency,1365950563

Bitcoin,New bitcoiner... have a (couple) sincere question(s) regarding ASICs.,"First off, I have to start out by making sure I have this part right.  ""As the network's ability to calculate increases, so does the difficulty of the blocks being mined.""  If I understood that wrong, or it is just wrong completely, please let me know, otherwise, I have these questions.

Assuming that butterfly labs comes through, and floods the market with their ASICs, won't that cause a massive jump in block difficulty and basically put all of us doing GPU mining into darkness by making mining so difficult that we'll only be able to do a fraction of what we're currently doing?

If so, basically, ASICs will not only make it to where GPU mining is a complete waste of time, but also make it so that ASIC mining does not produce the way that we think they will?  We see ""25 Ghash/s"" and think ""wow, that's awesome"" except, due to the increased difficulty, the ASICs may only produce at the rate that our current GPU setups are.

As this happens, we're going to start seeing Mhash rates as worthless, just like with processors... When was the last time you were wow'd by the processing power of a 900MHz processor?   My current, measly 140Mhash/s will go from being pretty much worthless, to completely worthless.

Analogously, this is a spoiled child with a loaded gun (it may or may not know how to use) issuing threats to a relatively educated and (hopefully) morally advanced crowd.

Again, this is a unique situation.  History is full of decadent dictators (and their consortiums) throwing themselves into the fire for fear of losing the perverted and luxurious lifestyle they have grown accustomed to.

Yes, **smartphones**, connected by satellite network or not depending on feasibility.  Pre-loaded with a startup video-message showing the world; showing other country's support and demonstrations of humanity and acceptance.  Something along the lines of the Voyager Message... after all, we are basically dealing with an Alien race by way of isolation.  These supply packages (with and without a phone) could be generously spread through populated as well rural areas and countryside... finding them possibly giving people a preoccupation other than typical anarchy shenanigans until help arrives by land.

There will be chaos, fighting over power and resources... luckily, people have an inherent tendency to spread information, whether they believe it or not.

On the *flip* side of things, I also do not see (or fully understand) the benefits of paying off the loan quicker.  It seems like I would have to be paying at least $1500/mo. to actually *save* money in the long term (but what would be the long term savings anyway?).

personalfinance,Any value in taking a loan I don't need just to increase credit score? I've never had a loan,"I understand that credit score is made up of a variety of factors, one of them being the different types of credit you have had. 

Currently, I have a good score (745) but a relatively thin file. Only one credit card, low limit ($1000), account age maybe almost 4 years. No negative marks on my credit, pay everything off in full every month, utilization is always sub 30%.

I plan on getting another credit card in maybe 6 months or so with a higher limit (and better rewards), but other than that I have no other credit types. Never had a school, home, auto or any other loan. I basically just save up for whatever I need and pay cash. I can think of things that I *could* take out a loan for, but I could also just save for 6-12 months and buy it cash, time isn't really an issue.

Is this ever a good idea? Is it dependent on what interest rate I could get? If so, what's the cutoff?

I am just trying to think about my score down the road in the event of wanting to buy a home or rental property. Any other suggestions for strengthening my history/score appreciated.

investing,Building a Passive Income Stream,"Hello /investing/ors.


I've dabbled a tiny bit in investing already using small amounts of money in brokerages like Kapitall, but I still know essentially nothing about it, and would like to start thinking seriously about investing for the future. In a year or two I am planning on leaving my job to travel and work/volunteer abroad for an extended period of time, and I would like to have money working for me, and ideally providing me with some sort of income, even if it's minimal.

In two months I will be able to pay off my student loans in full, freeing me from their 6.8% interest rate. I'm not paid very well, but at that point I will be able to feasibly put away about 1.5k a month. What are my ""best-bang-for-the-buck"" options for investing this kind of money? I've read a little bit about ETFs such as SPY, which seem like a good avenue for generation passive income because of their dividends, but I don't quite know what to look out for and which ones to select. Do ETFs compete fiercely, or can you usually expect one to perform consistently? What about some other potential investment streams? I appreciate your advice.

I was hoping somebody here could help me out with calculating my monthly interest on this particular account, as neither me nor my SO paid a great deal of attention in maths during school.

http://imgur.com/rJycIWH 

Basically we started out with $20.00 and just left it there.

Standard interest rate is set at 1.00%/p.a. paid monthly, there's also a bonus interest of 3.65%/p.a. (plus the 1.00% = 4.65%/p.a.) paid monthly if you add an extra $200 every month.  I can find no mention of whether this interest is compound or what.

Anyway, going off the numbers in the picture, I worked out that:
x/100 * 20.22 = 0.02
0.02/20.22 * 100 = x
x = ~0.09

If that's the monthly interest, then if I stuck 100,000 in there, I'd be paid 9,000 in interest every month, correct?

Which seems like a hell of a lot, and therefore, my calculations must be incorrect.   Can anybody help me out by figuring what the actual monthly rate on that $20 is?  We've recently come into a decent wad of cash and are trying to figure out where to stick it.",finance,1366024332

Thanks in advance.

##Situation

I switched jobs just over a year ago, which increased my 50 minute commute to about 65-80 minutes. That along with renting an apartment with electrical issues, which make living in it during hot months close to unbearable, has pushed my decision to move out and buy a condominium.

My goals are to find a place with

* 30 minute commute to work, preferably walking distance
* Better amenities, central air conditioning being a top one along with a sound electrical system, but nice to haves include a dish washer and in unit washer/drier
* Keep housing costs between 800-1200 monthly
* Improved quality, a recent rehab or new construction would also be nice to have's

I considered making this purchase an investment opportunity by buying a rental property to reduce my monthly costs. Ideally this would be less than the $835 rent I'm paying now, turning a net profit was not a priority. I made several calculations that included 2-4 unit buildings, factoring in average rents in the area, vacancy rates, maintenance and improvement costs, and taxes on rental income. Based on those, I saw that the quality of building I wanted close to my work would cost me 300-500k, which would totally wipe out my savings, exceed my monthly housing budget, and give me a lot more responsibility then I care to deal with.

I'll break this post up into three parts. First my questions, then a bit of background info to put things into perspective, and lastly how I arrived at my housing budget. 

##Questions

* **15 year vs. 30 year**
I've read that 30 year is better since you can invest the difference in monthly payments and get a better return (6% is thrown around often). My issue with this is that I'm already accounting for all my tax advantaged accounts, so this investment would be in a taxable account, meaning I'd have to reduce its return by 32% (or I guess 15% if it is considered capital income).
My main reason for considering a 30 year loan is that it offers more flexibility, ie I can pay extra monthly if I'm able to, but if something happens I have a lower monthly payment. I'd end up paying more during the lifetime of the loan, but that would be the cost of safety. 
On the other hand, I would use a 15 year loan if I can find a lower priced property while keeping my costs below $1250.

* **Is it a good idea to put more than 20% down?**
I'd only consider this to utilize the 40k I have set aside for a down payment.
* **How do you choose a real estate agent?**
I've been using redfin a lot to look at properties, but they don't offer their realtor services for properties under 200k. Outside of that I would turn to people I know who have had recent dealings with realtors. This includes a friend who had a great experience with his realtor very recently and another friend whose good friend is a realtor.
 I assume it’s a bad idea to use the same realtor agent as the seller,i.e. call up the realtor of a property I found online and just use them
* **How do you choose a lender?**
Bankrate.com has 30 year rates like 3.347 from AimLoan or 3.472 from AmeriSave. 
Chase is at 3.475 and my normal bank PNC is at 3.586-3.667.
The online lenders have mixed reviews, but should the total cost be my main driving force? What would a traditional bank offer me that one of these small guys can't or won't?
* **Should I include maintenance and improvement costs to my monthly housing budget?**
When I was considering buying a rental property I included these amounts in my monthly costs since tenants can cause damage to units, owning the building would mean I'd have to pay to fix a leaky roof, a broken water heater, update appliances to entice new tenants ect.... But in a condo situation, wouldn't most of the major repair costs be covered by my HOA fees? I know there are things like special assessments in case the association has a major repair they can't cover by their fund
* **What about pre construction condos?**
I noticed a few properties in the building stages around my work and I'm considering calling them up to find out what their units would be sold for.
From what I've read, construction companies sometimes offer discounts on units
I've got members of the family who deal with construction, so I could get them to do an inspection, but should I be worried about build quality of brand new buildings, ie rush jobs by investors
What things should I watch out for with the construction company. My friend who dealt with a new construction said he had issue's dealing with them since they create an LLC for each property they build to limit their liability in case things aren't quite as they should be after the construction is done (think they had issues with the security system and water damage (either leak in the roof or plumbing problem caused a unit to flood)).
* **Any issues with buying a smallish 1 bedroom condo?**
Friends and family have mentioned over the years that a two bedroom is easier to sell in any market
I'm looking at 750-1k sqft, would this be too small in years to come if i get married?
* **Are my cost estimates accurate?**
I'll mention these below, but things like taxes, insurance, and closing costs. I favor making more conservative estimates so that I'm not surprised by jumps in costs.

##Background

* Monthly Net Income: $5300
* Debt: none
* Monthly expenses: $2700 (including $835 rent)	
* Housing Status: Renting* 
* Tax Filing Status: Single
* Tax Rate: 28% Federal, 5% IL
* Age: 29
* Area: Chicago
* Credit: 700+ range about 2-3 years ago. Have been putting most of my expenses on a rewards card I pay off monthly, so credit should be above 700.

Current Investments

* IRA 10.5k
* HSA 3.1k
* 25-27k that will be rolled over to TIRA
* Taxable investment $12k
* Emergency fund 11k in US I Series Savings bonds (aiming for 6 months of expenses)
* Cash 70k
* Down Payment 
* I have 70k in savings, but I'm only planning on using 40k for down payment since I've got the remaining 30k allocated as such.
* 17.5k for 2013 401k once I’m eligible at work (6 months)
* 4k to complete my 15k emergency fund in savings bonds
* 5.5k for 2013 IRA
* 3.25 for 2013 HSA

I usually end up saving around $2600 a month, but I figure that once I move my expenses will change around a bit, so I don't want to include future savings to my down payment. Besides my housing related costs going up by up to $400, my utilities will go up since I'll have to pay for them (water, gas, heat, potentially higher electric). On the plus side, if my ideal scenario happens and I find a place within walking distance of my work, then I can drop my monthly $100 CTA bill.

##Housing Budget

Given my current level of income, current expenses, and money I want to allocate for retirement, my monthly budget for housing is $1250. This is the maximum net cost I'd like to pay after mortgage, property tax, insurance, HOA, and tax refund is taken into account. 

Estimate calculation

+ 63.6k net annual income

- 22.4k annual expenses (not including housing)

- 26.25 IRA, 401k, HSA retirement investments

This leaves me with ~15k annually or $1,250 monthly for housing.

Housing cost estimates

The spreadsheet I build to help me estimate my costs factors in the following items

* Mortgage payment
* Property tax 1.5%
* Insurance 0.25%
* HOA
* Closing Costs 3.0%
* Tax bracket to calculate tax returns on interest payments and property taxes

Am I missing any other important factors when estimating condo ownership costs?

Here's the [Housing Cost Estimator Spreadsheet](https://mega.co.nz/#!40gVQZCB!f5v8y2Wgc7hqnLW9_F2CATHZ70UEfUEgARmdALxCB_Y) I made, for anyone who wants to use this or to double check my estimates.

Hong Kong the Avanti News Group- Als u proberen wilt te begrijpen op een dieper niveau wat het betekent om een discrepantie gewoon kijken naar het gedrag van de grondstoffenvoorraden hebben. Als de wereld echt in goede vorm was, en we overal reële groei hadden, zou deze voorraden worden in brand aan de kop. Zij zijn alsof er is grote deflatie gaande. En we hebben in de echte wereld deflatie. De heer Bernanke's liquiditeit levering is de markt houden, maar dat is niet de echte wereld mensen. Het is zo moeilijk om uw hoofd wikkelen rond het grotere plaatje market actie als je bedenkt dat de dingen werkelijk in slechte vorm wereldwijd, met name in heel Europa zijn. In de afgelopen twee weken hebben we een overvloed van verschrikkelijke verslagen. Nogmaals, laten we gaan over alle van hen.
Vandaag was zag zeer slechte cijfers in de wereld van verkoop in de retail. Alle excuses die u wilt over het weer, maar slecht is slecht maken. De nummers waren in de rode wanneer de verwachtingen waren voor zeer groen. Het weer was rekening gehouden, voordat die positief cijfer werd gedacht. Werkelijkheid zegt niet weer, maar mensen regerend in. Dingen zijn niet goed genoeg, economisch, voor mensen te gooien over hun dollars in de retail-wereld. Lukraak uitgaven is gewoon niet onderdeel van de afbeelding. Wij weten dat dit waar is, als we kijken naar andere verslagen van de economie. Banen waren er niet. Jobless claims stijgen. Productie is bijna recessie niveaus opnieuw, nauwelijks meer dan 50,0, de mate waarin groei versus contractie.

De enquête Michigan vandaag hard gedaald. Mensen zijn niet alleen voelen goed omdat hun dollars worden uitgehold. Gezondheidszorg is hoger. Voedsel is hoger. Salarissen zijn lager. Banen zijn dalende. Dus ja, grondstoffenvoorraden dalen omdat globale prognoses zijn ook uithollen. Dat heeft niet tot uiting in Disneyland, ik bedoel de beurs, maar het is het echte werk. Dingen zijn deflatie in termen van vraag. Het enige wat op de stijging is wat we het meest nodig, voedsel en gezondheidszorg. Dus vandaag we niet zien veel verkopen als de dollar gedraaid zoals gebruikelijk, maar rustig je zag de echte wereld nemen houdt terwijl grondstoffenvoorraden kreeg wiegde beneden weer.
Ze lopen naar de plaatsen waar ze hopelijk sommige betere rendementen krijgen kunnen. Die plaats is ons land waar dingen zijn slecht, maar waar we hebben een Fed die zal niet pompen stoppen. Onze omstandigheden stinken, maar ze zijn nog steeds veel beter dan zo ongeveer elk ander land op de planeet. En mensen, dat is een zeer trieste verklaring. Dat gezegd hebbende, het is wat het is. Het geld zal giet aan waar het risico het minste is en nu, met de dingen zoals ze zijn, ons land het beste te bieden heeft, hoewel het is niet iets om trots over te zijn.

De beren niet hebben nog gedaan een ding in termen van het krijgen van de stieren te schudden een beetje in hun laarzen. Zeker, de occasionele kloof naar beneden is opgetreden, maar niets dat duurde in termen van de kloof en lagere gedurende de hele dag uitgevoerd. Het is meer van een kloof en -herstel, of kloof en zijwaarts soort kaars stokken. Niets om te suggereren een veel dieper verkopen periode is op ons voor een tijdje te komen. Het kan gebeuren op elk gewenst moment het overbought karakter van de wekelijkse en maandelijkse grafieken, maar ze overbought kunnen blijven zoals we inmiddels al te goed weten. Iedereen zit te wachten voor de grote verkopen voor vele maanden nu, dat is niet toevallig. Veel mensen verliezen hun shirts spelen de donkere kant zonder enig bewijs dat het moest houden. Alleen de overbought voorwaarden werden in de plaats maar geen belangrijke omkering stokken nog veel springen omdat ze vonden dat de markt dienen te vallen.

Het werkt gewoon niet op die manier. Met de grotere afbeelding trend stevig aan de zijkant omhoog speelt het is het beste te gebruiken zwakte om te kopen in plaats van te proberen om spijker aan de keerzijde. Met de markten zo overbought is het nog steeds het beste niet te krijgen overdreven agressief op de korte termijn, maar dat betekent niet dat je niet kan hebben een beetje blootstelling langs de weg. Gewoon weten te houden het licht, maar ook niet vergeten dat de trend echt uw vriend is. Niet meer dan analyseren als ik sprak over eerder in dit verslag. Spelen wat je ziet. Speel niet met uw intelligentie. Spelen met wat werkt. Ondersteuning op de S &amp; P 500 komt in op 1570/1560. Alleen een zet onder dat moet krijg de beren opgewonden. Alleen een zet onder 3200 Nasdaq moet krijg de beren opgewonden. Hong Kong the Avanti News Group

First, there are two articles that I would like to share. I feel like most people have been exposed to stories similar to the ones in these articles.

[6 billion people have access to cellphones](http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/03/25/more-people-have-cell-phones-than-toilets-u-n-study-shows/)

[People have used bricks to store value in hyperinflation conditions in Zimbabue](http://www.economist.com/node/7843601)

**These articles are relevant for many reasons, but a few that I think we agree are more apparent. ***

* Bitcoin provides a ""last resort"" store of economic value when a more stable currency isn't available. 

* Bitcoin provides a bank to the bankless.  

* Bitcoin provides a global transactional network.

===

I did two back of the envelope calculations:

**A. Rate of introduction of new bitcoins into the economy.**

25 BTC / block * 157 blocks mined today * 365 days per year = 1,432,625  new BTC created per year
This number is pretty non negotiable because of the system used to create bitcoins.

1,432,625 new BTC created per year / 11,005,775 BTC exist today.
13% more bitcoins on April 7 2014.


**B. Current BTC as a percent of the global economy**

Global Economy: 70 trillion USD (wikipedia)
Argentina Economy: 500 billion USD (wikipedia)
Hedge Fund capitalization: 2 trillion USD (not sure where this is from)
Current BTC Market Capitalization: 1.88 billion USD. ( bitcoinwatch.com, also calculated at 170 dollars per btc x 11 million BTC )

The global economy is approximated at 70,000 billion USD.

After a huge crash, the market cap currently is 1 billion dollars.  This is 3 millionths of the global economy.

Lets map bitcoin onto 1% of the world economy, which is 70 billion dollars.

**With a current quantity of just over 11 million bitcoins, we get a valuation at approximate global ubiquity of $6344 per bitcoin.**

---

On the other hand, the quantified global black market is purportedly 1.8 billion USD, and we would expect a much larger percentage of this market to go into bitcoin.  And it is hard to say what the true potential of global black markets would be with a better currency to facilitate them.

Another thing to consider is evaporating value.  In the event of a selloff, bitcoins might not map appropriately onto the work or assets they represent. As long as bitcoin is the least worst currency, this isn't really relevant for long term investors. Bitcoin will be, at worst, the economy of last resort - a store of value when the government decides they want to take 25% of your capital to help pay off their crushed economy, or inflate money until it is valueless to anyone but the printer.",cryptocurrency,1365984004

I make about $65,000 a year, and do not pay rent- I have a second job that provides me with a place to live. My company doesn't yet offer a 401k and I'm ethically uncomfortable with investing, so I've been struggling to find something else to do with the cash.

 I have recently been offered a chance to buy a house + separate studio apartment + triple lot for 53,500 dollars, on a seller carryback with an interest rate of 3.67%. The money doesn't come due for 5 years, when I can start making payments against principle- until then I'll just be paying interest. The property needs, based on the estimates of three separate contractors, about $75-100,000 worth of restoration before it will be up to the standard I would consider liveable/rentable. I'm currently saving $2,000 a month, but I've been living very high on the hog. I own a vehicle free and clear, and still owe about 11,000 in student loans, which I was going to pay off in a lump sum until I found out about this opportunity. Now I'm just stacking up cash, trying to figure out if I should go for it- and if so, how?

 I have also been offered- from a third party- the entire cost of the property ($53,500), which I could borrow at 3% interest. Is this a good idea? This would be a private loan between myself and a family friend, which I am loath to do, but the person is trustworthy and has the money.
 Leaving aside the ethical implications this is very complicated for someone who has not, historically, had a lot of money. Any advice for me?",finance,1366145920
personalfinance,Obama's new budget may eliminate tax penalties for those on IBR/PAYE student loan repayment.,"The question is, is there any incentive to living like a pauper and paying student loans early, assuming this proposal passes?

--------------TEXT-----------------------------------------

President Obama’s proposed budget for the 2014 fiscal year would prevent the taxation of student debt that is forgiven under federal income-based repayment plans, according to the Institute for College Access and Success.

If the provision is approved, it will come as good news to many college graduates who have been relieved to have more manageable monthly payments under the income-based plan and similar programs, which have recently been expanded by the federal government. While they are benefiting from the program now, though, they may end up with a large tax bill years in the future.

Last year, Ron Lieber wrote a Your Money column about the “tax time bomb” that could face some student loan borrowers who have their federal student loans forgiven under government repayment plans aimed at helping those struggling with high education debt.

The income-based plan uses a formula to calculate the monthly payment, based on your income. Then, after 10 to 25 years, the federal government forgives any remaining balance.

The catch is that you generally have to pay income taxes on any debt that is forgiven, unless you’re in a special program for teachers or those in other public service jobs. Depending on how much debt you have, the bill could be hefty — and it is supposed to be paid in full, immediately, when it comes.

The institute, which promotes affordable education and oversees the Project on Student Debt, supports eliminating the tax bill for those students who qualify for the lower-payment programs. Currently, concern about whether forgiven debt will be taxed in the future may discourage those who need help under income-linked repayment plans from participating, said Lauren Asher, the institute’s president.

She said that it was too soon to say if the provision would prevail, given the unpredictability of federal budget negotiations, but that such a proposal had recently had bipartisan support.

Other student debt items, which include keeping interest rates low on subsidized federal loans, are also up for debate.

personalfinance,"What to do, what to do. Advice please.","My daughter was hospitalized for 5 days back in February and the medical bills just hit. We have had smaller ones throughout that I have been able to pay in full which is not the case with this one or the next two that will be coming. About $1100 after insurance with the hospital and another $1300 from the doctor's office (this is combined with my husband's allergist visit). Emergency savings is tapped out from paying medical bills since Nov./Dec. and a $1000 in unexpected car repairs.

I've reduced my budget as much as possible. Set up one payment plan and waiting on the next statement to set up another. I am just not sure what the best route to go would be. Be patient with me.

I direct either $20-40 per paycheck into savings (I just changed the direct deposit form so can't remember the new amounts). We also contribute 7% to his 401K, his employer puts in 4% (the wording on this is weird, but pretty much if we put in 7%, they put in 4%. If we lower ours, employer match goes down too). We contribute about $222 each month and the employer $134 if the exact numbers are necessary.

I am assuming it is better to just not put any money into our emergency savings for the time being and funnel it all into the medical bills on top of the payment plan minimum to pay it down faster rather than reduce our 401K contribution. Both medical bills are 0% interest. In addition we have $2k in credit card debt at 0% interest.

Also we have two car loans with the same credit union. To my knowledge, we cannot consolidate these two as each car is collateral for each loan. One is 5% and one is 7%. 3 years left on one I think, 4 years on another. $8000 between the two of them. Not looking like I can pay that off next spring/summer due to the medical bills so is it worth refinancing at a lower interest rate if possible? Waiting for the credit union to call me back.

Info that may or may not matter:
Husband: 25 years old. Full time employee and student.
Me:  24 year old Stay at home mom to 3 kids (4, 2, and 8 months)- looking to return to work soon if I can secure a job with my husband's company.

I think I just feel overwhelmed by the big bill hitting after the smaller ones were easily paid.

EDIT: I think we figured out a plan- temporarily reducing our 401k contribution from 7% to 4% and put $100 a month in savings to rebuild the emergency fund. Pay minimums on the medical debt, but twice the minimum on the credit card debt. Once emergency savings is built, start to snowball the debt starting with the credit card since it will have interest starting June 2014.",finance,1366143425

Really, what I would like to do is find some kind of fund/investment/etc. that I can put a few hundred dollars into every month that will give me conservative but worthwhile risk/reward.  
I would like to be able to have access to this money in some way, whether it be once or twice a year, or for a specific purpose, emergencies, or something like that.  That is probably one of the most important things.
And after taking money out of it, I would like to be able to continue putting money into it to earn more.  I also would like to have something that my future wife could possibly be a part of once we get married.

I have done a little research on Roth IRA's and things like that, but there are like 4,108 different things to choose from and it's overwhelming.

Should I dump my cash and pay a huge chunk of my car/loans off?

Currently have a bit under $50,000 in savings.  We have a $215,000 mortgage loan at 4.5%, and our monthly mortgage is $1,600.  Annual income is about $115,000.  We live on the east coast of the US, my husband and I are in our mid-20's, and we are 2-3 years into our careers.

I am inclined to just pay off the entire balance of the loans now to avoid the interest I will accrue, since the money is just sitting in the bank right now anyway, but my husband is hesitant.

I guess I should note that we are also relatively conservative with our money.  Because we do not have a vast amount of knowledge on the subject, we are hesitant to invest anywhere that poses risk.

gaming,I'm not sure people know Diablo 3 has received many updates and has turned into a solid game...,"Out of boredom with WoW, I recently came back to Diablo 3 after quitting it within the first month. I read up on all the patch histories, they are currently working on patch 1.08.

Here is a list of things added or fixed since the crappy launch:

* After level 60 you continue to gain ""Paragon Levels"" from 1-100. Each Paragon level increases your base gold and magic find, and base stats slightly. You also get minor improvements to the visual of your character portrait. 

* You can now choose the level of difficulty of Inferno, from 1-10 (Called ""Monster Power"") I prefer the easier, stress-free mowing down of mobs, and low MP levels allow that. You still get inferno quality drops.

* Playing with friends is no longer a penalty. In fact, in 1.08 playing with friends will be even better, as it will provide additional magic find per party member. 

* Legendary drops had their itemization improved, and many new legendaries with interesting procs were added. 

* Many ""useless"" skills/runes were buffed to be viable. Just for example I think the Monk's bell went from like 250% weapon damage to like 800% weapon damage. Tons of weird builds are viable, play what you think is fun and still succeed.

* There is now a sort of meta-quest to collect keys from certain new boss mobs. Eventually you create a device that lets you fight ""Uber"" bosses, which are combos of 2 bosses and have new abilities, and drop a special ring.

* In the next patch the mob density will be greatly increased in Acts 1, 2, and 4 - meaning there will be more options for efficient farming and Paragon-level XP runs. 

* The Auction House now lets you search for I think 6 affixes at once, maybe 8? It also has many other improvements that were needed.

* The servers are extremely stable now, and ""rubber-banding"" has by and large been eliminated. 

Not everything is fixed. It still has a terrible story. It still requires an always-on internet connection, and the map randomization could be better.

This afternoon, the Boston Marathon was suspended due to an attack. This event is a tragedy in the making, covered internationally by media, government, and citizen alike; I can't say what the highest number was but I personally witnessed sixty thousand people listen in on scanners over the internet. With contradicting information coming from all over, places like reddit have done a superb job of disseminating and organizing information, helping establish aid for those who need it, and otherwise being a calm voice in an otherwise hectic disaster. In this thread I will begin by laying out fact versus speculation, and then provide the resources available at this time.
  
As it is a constantly developing story, this post is obviously subject to change. Please be patient with me as I try to keep on top of an ever-growing pile of dubious information. Sourcing will be done in the comments, due to text constraints of self posts.
  
----
  
###The story as it stands
    
**Casualties**
  
As of the hospital press briefing, the final number is 183 injured. 100 so far have been released from medical care. 17 people were in critical condition after the blast, and I don't have any updates on how many remain so. Of the fatalities, one child of eight, Martin Richard. The second victim is Krystle Campbell, age 29. The third, a woman aged 23 is a student at Boston University. Family has now okay'ed her identification so I will say that her name is Lingzi Lu.
  
There is a photograph of two women lying on the ground having their pulse checked, one of which has been severely wounded. It is believed that she is one of the fatalities; however, the other woman appears to have died from the other explosion. (it is accepted but unconfirmed that the woman departed in this image is Krystle)
  
Jeff, the subject of the famous image of the man in the wheelchair who's legs were shredded by the explosion is supposedly in stable condition.
  
**The bombs**
  
There have been two bombs, and only two. The incident at JFK library was due to a machine room fire, and all of the suspicious items (up to 5 other suspected) disposed of by authorities have been shown to not contain explosives.
  
Official reports state that the bombs were ""probably"" pressure cookers, black nylon bag residue found in both blast scenes. As of today, with the leaked images of the bomb residue, it is accepted that the bombs were 6L pressure cookers stuffed with ball bearing and nail shrapnel. A circuit board has been recovered that may expose how the bombs were set off; the FBI has not come to any conclusions on the matter and have not commented further. Note that the only ""official"" information we have is that these bombs were ""probably"" pressure cookers, so under no circumstance is this summary set in stone.
  
Images of evidence from the blast: http://www.reuters.com/article/slideshow/idUSBRE93G04T20130417
  
During the event there was worry about cell service shutting down; this could be due to a fear of the bombs set off by phone, or simply the flood of calls overloaded the area, causing people to lose service. However, police are still recommending that you text rather than call, just in case.
  
Also during the event, there was fear of a failed third device (not the JFK scare) in a trash can at the finish line. This resulted in a controlled detonation by authorities. However, to my knowledge it was not an explosive.
  
On the afternoon of the 17th, there was a hype buildup concerning a possible arrest, which later proved to be false. During this time, however, the federal courthouse building was given it's first ever Code Red. Bomb squads rushed to the scene and the harbor was locked down by authorities in boats. The bomb scare proved to be a false alarm.
  
The risin events from the morning of the 17th were unrelated to the bombings.
  
**Suspects**
  
**Photos of Persons of Interests are now up on http://fbi.gov. Send tips to http://bostonmarathontips.fbi.gov or call 1800-CALL-FBI if you know anything. Do NOT try to aprehend or contact these individuals yourself.**
  
The investigation has now become one of national focus. The FBI is now responsible for the investigation, and ATF is confirmed to be in the area, as well as Navy and National Guard. For a while it surfaced that CIA and antiterrorism task forces are working in the are as well; however, there is only one source for this so I would hesitate to confirm it.
  
Specialists are coming in to investigate the video evidence.
  
The crime zone in Copley Square was initially 15 blocks, and has now been [reduced to 12 blocks](https://twitter.com/Boston_Police/status/324604822911348737/photo/1). Copley Square will likely be a crime zone for the next few days as they reduce the area. A warranted search of a Revere apartment building was conducted late last night, and later confirmed. However, the apartment was a dead end for investigation; the resident was a victim of the blast, not a suspect. The city will be covered by more security, with more wary authorities as well as presence from national and federal investigators. The MBTA will conduct random bag searches.
  
The story of the Saudi national has been a hive of misinformation so I'll try to clear that up as best as I can: a Saudi national may or may not have been detained, either he was hospitalized from the attack and put under guard, or seen running from the scene and arrested. Shortly after initially breaking, official reports denied any arrests; however, rumors of guarded patients continued into the night. Some time the 16th there were claims that if this Saudi national was detained to begin with he was found innocent and released. Official reports have denied holding him, and have made mention that police presence in hospitals is specifically for asking eyewitness reports.
  
On an individual level, this was definitely a predetermined attack; the possibility of a 'gas leak' was shot down minutes after the explosions occurred. No groups or organizations have taken credit for the attack, and the Pakistani Taliban has outright denied responsibility. However, this may still very well be an attack conducted by an organization rather than an individual. Furthermore, we do not know whether or not this is a domestic or international issue. This is likely, though unconfirmed, to be a terrorist attack, and at this point I would like to make a statement of clarification due to some comments: terrorism by definition has no need to be based in agendas or political ideology.
  
On the 17th, AP reported that an arrest is imminent; however, there is no indication that there are ID'd suspects, let alone any information on their locations. Later that day, CNN jumped the gun on a possible arrest. Other news broadcasts used CNN as a source and the rumor spread across news media. Skeptics called to question the legitimacy of the source, and with no response it became clear that this assumption was on shaky ground. Boston police [later denied](https://twitter.com/Boston_Police/status/324591574807891968) that any arrests have been made.

I just wanted to ask you, now that I have a chance, exactly how my dick tastes.  How is it?  Does my semen taste sweet?  I've been eating tons of vegetables for years for just such an effect.

I'm asking you this because I fed you my dick, on four consecutive races, despite the fact that you'd successfully modded your Wii and were cheating.  Don't deny it.  We can see you fall of Rainbow Road and suddenly you end up back on course, with no time lost, ahead of where you fell.  We're not idiots.  We may be naive, sure.  We are, after all, clean racers continuing to race in a system that's been dirty for years.  It gives you cheaters a massive competitive advantage, and it feels especially good when we clean racers are able to beat you.  In four consecutive races, two of which were of your choosing.  And it makes us feel even better when we take advantage of costly blue shells to pass you basically at the finish line on the last race, causing you to pout, quit the game, and probably beat your girlfriend.  And maybe you even bitched that I was cheating.  But guess what, yuyu?  I wasn't.  I'm clean.  I beat you because I was better.  Deal with it.

I'm not going to chide you about taking the game too seriously.  It's fun to win.  And I'm certainly taking it seriously enough to write a longwinded open letter to you on Reddit after the fact.  The point I want to make, yuyu, is that you're an asshole.  Everyone who cheats at Mario Kart, hear me - you're an asshole.  No, it's not costing anyone any money, or really anything that matters, but you're taking a game that we enjoy playing, in an online interface that's simple and easy to use, and you're sucking the fun out of it.  Half of you cheaters aren't even good.  You have no honed skills.  You're just lazy.  And there's nothing OK about that.

Anyways, yuyu, I don't want to keep you away from finding another table that I'm not in and trying to cheat your way to winning against other foes.  But don't forget how my cock tastes.  I'll be feeding it to you every time we race.

Because I'm better.

Sincerely,

personalfinance,An alternative to making extra payments towards a mortgage,"Let's say you've got a $100,000, 30 year mortgage at 3.5%.  If you make the scheduled monthly payment of $449.04, the loan will be paid off after 360 payments.  If you pay an extra $200 per month towards principal, the loan will be paid after 205 payments.  (So far no surprises.)

However, instead of paying $200/month towards principal, how about if you put $200/month into a savings account that earns 3.5%.  (I know that's an unrealistic rate, but let's keep things simple for now.)  By doing this you'll have enough in the savings account to pay off the loan after... 205 payments!

Why do this?  What if you lose a source of income after a few years.  You can't go to the bank and say ""remember all of those extra payments I made?  How about if I stop paying my mortgage for a while until I get back to where I would have been without the extra payments.""  So the reason I would consider putting the money into savings would be to have cash on hand in an emergency that could be used toward paying the mortgage (beyond my normal emergency cash fund).

A reason for not doing this is that 3.5% is an unrealistic interest rate for savings.  PLUS you have to pay tax on the interest income.  However, if we assume earnings of 0.0% there is still enough savings to pay off the loan after 235 payments (an extra 2.5 years beyond the 3.5% saving rate scenario).

Perhaps a mix of the two approaches makes sense.  What do you think?",finance,1366076871

personalfinance,"Hi, r/personalfinance! I'm 25, in debt, trying to save, and desperate for financial advice.","Hey, r/personalfinance! I've finally, after lurking and trying to do this myself with no prevail, caved and decided to ask for some good advice. Sorry for the wall of text...

The issue: I'm trying desperatley to save money to move from New Jersey to Houston, TX within the next handful of months to be with my long-distance boyfriend permanently. I am drowning in debt from student loans for an education I never finished. When I turned 18 I was stupid with a number of credit cards and am now trying desperatley to pay these off as quickly as possible. 

I had about $600 saved in my savings as of January however because of a personal emergency it left me with nothing in my savings and I'm back to square one. I'll give you a run down on my expenses every month.

**My monthly income**: Usually around $1500 after taxes. It can fluctuate depending on if I work a full 40/hrs every week.

**Car Payment**: $203

**Car Insurance**: $202 (but I only pay this for 4 months and then have three months with no car payments)

**Student Loans**: $228/month total

**Credit Card payments**: $250(these are the minimum payments, which when money allows it I pay extra towards when I can)

**Cell Phone**: $40

**Rent**: I currently am, because financially I can't do it on my own, living with my family. I give my parents money towards bills/food shop when the extra money is available. so technically here I don't pay any rent at all.

**Gas**: $125/mo

**Food/Groceries**: $150-$200/mo

**Gym Membership**: $10/mo

**Netflix**: $7/mo

**Total Monthly Expenses**: $1215 (fluctuates slightly)



The only thing I really spend ""extra"" on myself is getting my hair colored every 6-8 weeks which is $55 and eating out with friends which I've budgeted into that food/grocery budget.


What I've done recently to try and help change things: I've stopped eating out except for maybe once every two weeks with friends. I've been dieting so this hasn't been much of an issue for me. 4 months ago I started a brand new job making $3 an hour more than I was previously which has helped me currently to start saving again. I currently only have $150 in my savings account after saving for yes, 4 months.

I need help. I just don't know what else I can do to try and save more money to make this move to Houston happen sooner. I want to have a cushion to be able to pay my bills while I look for a job. 2 months tops of my expenses is all I really think I'll need and even then I really don't think it will take me two months to find a job down there. There are also moving expenses involved which I need to think about too.

My dad suggested getting another credit card with a lower interest rate and transfering my higher balances however I can't even get approved for any of the offers sent to me in the mail. I also don't think that opening another credit card is even a good idea. Do I have options to consolidate my credit card debt? I've already consolidated my student loans and one of them is completely private through Wells Fargo which I can't really do much about from my understanding.

I'd be willing to talk about this through PM's too if any of you are willing to reach out and give me some decent advice.

personalfinance,Suffocating Student Loan debt - advice?,"A few years ago, I made the egregious error of going to college.  Though I've seen a slow but steady increase in salary since my graduation, I'm still currently only making a modest $35,000(ish) per year.

That number is less than half of my total student loan debt.

I have around 65k in private student loan debt; and what’s worse, is that about 35K of this debt is at an 11.75% variable interest rate (the remainder is a mere 4.75%).  The cherry on top is 15K of Federal debt.  I've been on an interest only repayment ""plan"" for the past 3 years, but my payment has actually increased by around $50.00/month total after interspersing 18 months of forbearance (and about to enter another 6 month period of forbearance - I simply don't see a better option right now). 

All told, I'm paying around $500 per month - and this is scheduled to increase significantly upon principal repayment this time next year.

I won't pretend to be the best with money; I have around $3500 of revolving credit, as well as typical bills (rent, utilities, etc.) and no savings (though in my defense, it’s rather difficult to save when your bills exceed your monthly income).  I’ve never missed a payment/defaulted/etc on any bills.

At the risk of sounding melodramatic; this situation is ruining my life.  I find myself unmotivated to improve poor health habits, or go out and meet people/engage in relationship (I can't afford to buy a drink for myself, let alone someone else).  I go to sleep thinking about my debt.  I dream about it at night, and wake up and think about it.  When I achieve something at work (or otherwise), any internal celebration is followed closely by a reminder of my soul-crushing debt.

Don't get me wrong - I'm far from a depressive person.  I have plenty of enjoyment in my life.  It’s just that such happiness is generally followed with a somber reminder of my situation.

I know there are people with worse circumstances lurking about here, but I just don't know how to solve this problem.  I refuse to accept that I HAVE to live like this - but I also acknowledge that, as with any problem in life, my vision is likely obscured by being “in” the situation.  And so, I’m hoping I can relate to some others here, or some experts  - I’ve seen some truly inspiring stories here.  Does anyone have any advice for how to climb out from under this?  Other than my usual staple of destructive self-pity, what’s my best course of action?

investing,Need advice on investing mix vs. student loan repayment,"My wife and I are currently investing appropriately in our 401(k)'s and have employer matching, we're also investing in Roth IRA's and saving each month for our emergency fund. I know the typical advice on the order of those investments and I think we're good on our balance. 

My question is the debate my wife and I have about either paying more on student loans or saving more towards retirement. For example, let's say we have $100 of unallocated funds in our monthly budget. Is it better to put that $100 towards a faster student loan repayment or into an investment like a Roth IRA? So will our money be better spent knocking down loan interest or taking advantage of compounding? 

It might also be important to note that besides our home the student loans are our only debt. No high interest on cards, cars, or anything else. I tend to think we have ""good"" debt but if that thinking is wrong please let me know. 

Thanks in advance for any advice.

gaming,Why are most online games balanced extremely slowly?,"I'm sure everyone knows what I am talking about. A patch for a game comes out that either introduces a brokenly OP new item/skill/etc. but it isn't ""fixed"" for at least two weeks to a month. 

Now I know there are reasons, legitimate and not to do this namely:

1. Release OP item on F2P game -&gt; Encourage players to acquire said OP item with real money before nerfing it

2. Riot's more legitimate stance of ""people need some time to figure out how to deal with this champion before we make any adjustments to its numbers""

Even so, there are countless cases in literally every online game I've ever played where something was clearly super overpowered or super underpowered that just doesn't change for quite a long time.

With that said, most devs also seem to be a fan of dramatic balance changes over patches that make things unpredictable or ""nerf into ground"" aforementioned OP item. 

I'm mainly curious why more companies do not balance their game more incremental, but frequent changes. And to attempt to answer my own question I guess I can see why too many small changes in every patch can get hard to keep track of.

To give a recent example:

Planetside 2

Now I do have a lot of respect for the SOE devs that are clearly working hard on improving this game and I can say that they do a lot better than many other F2P games I've played in the past. But there are just some things that almost everyone agreed was stupid.

1. Annhilators pre nerf turning large areas into effective no-fly zones. (Fixed after like 3 months).

2. AA MAX suits are cheaper and vastly better than AA tank (Still not fixed, been true since the game launched).

3. Magrider was too dominant. Now it sucks. The horizontal movement doesn't compensate for very slow projectile speed and slow turn rate to aim barrel. Also Sauron tank beam nerfed so the common pool rocket mount is a better choice 90% of the time. (VS and NC unique Sauron equivalents are still noticeably better at certain ranges).

This isn't meant as broad criticism of gaming developers working on these things, but why aren't a few small (say 10% RoF decrease for Burster MAX) changes implemented each week or patch that addresses some glaring issues that are cropping up this ""balance cycle""?",technology,1366196453

gaming,"Gamers of Reddit, what is your ""dream game.""","By ""dream game"" I mean an idea for a game that you'd love to see made. here's mine:

I want a heist game. None of that GTA bullshit, I want a proper heist game. Picture this: 

BioWare would spearhead the team. I want a plot structure along the lines of the Mass Effect Trilogy. You recruit team members, complete missions that increase your preparedness for the heist, etc...

Actual gameplay would stealth based, with combat de-emphasized, while still usable. For the actual missions, picture a combination of Mass-effect's non-mission sections (running around cities, talking to people, purchasing items in shops, etc..) and Splinter Cell's stealth-based third-person action. 

Here's how it would play out:

Your character is some kind of relatively well-known criminal. You could pick your backstory in the form of classes. You could be a Facilitator, with an emphasis on speech and coercion. You could be an Enforcer, with an emphasis on combat. You could be a Hacker, with an emphasis on tech and gadgets, or you could be a Burglar, with an emphasis on stealth.

So in the beginning, you get approached by some kind of organization. I'm thinking an intelligence agency, but it could also be a crime syndicate. So this organization comes to you with a Carrot and a stick. They want you to Steal ""Something."" What the Maguffin is isn't really relevant, but they want you to get it. for the sake of this, let's say it's a Hard Drive, something important encrypted on it, being held by a federal agency trying to decrypt the data on it. Whatever interested party approaches you needs that hard drive back. They're willing to pay top dollar for it. Lots of money. Never work again, fuckoff amounts of money. There's your carrot.

But if you don't do it, they have someone close to you. A wife, a child,  a sibling, whatever. and if you don't do it... Well, that's the stick. 

So there's the plot. You have to break into some kind of high-security mother-of-all-vaults type place, and get this maguffin back. so you go and recruit your team, each with their own specialties, and each bringing in more side-missions. one character will only help you if you wipe all records of him from some government database, another will have to be broken out of jail, and so on. 

But the whole time you're preparing for the main heist, you're also working the angles, and trying to find a way out. You call in favors, and while preparing the main job, you're also preparing a secondary job, against the people who have your wife or kid or whatever. You have to balance keeping the syndicate off your back, while still holding on to every bit of leverage or advantage you can get over them.

And then you Add in the possibility that someone on your team is a mole, and that somebody might be on the syndicate's payroll, just watching you.

so you do all these preparation missions, jailbreaks, stealing supplies, reconnaissance, trial runs on similar structures, robberies for funding and so on. 

And then of course, you have the heist itself. It would be glorious! there would doublecrosses, and standoffs, and twists like you've never seen! 

So there it is, a storyline and character driven, stealth-centric crime RPG. 

And that's my idea. So tell me, what's yours?",technology,1366185110

1st SM loan - $25,920.81 @ 11.25%
2nd SM loan - $22,492.23 @ 8.5%

They are costing me about $600 a month and it hurts. My deferment ended in November and I have been making the $600 a month payments since then and I haven't seen my total loan amount go down since November, maybe a few hundred. From my understanding those interest rates are trash.

After rent, bills and loan payment I am left with $600 a month, most of which goes into the bank. I am wondering if I should consolidate my SM loans into one loan with them? Refinance with another company, but then I lose my forbearance which I will probably need. Is it possible to get lower interest rates? I am not sure what to do at this point, its also a possibility that I will lose my job when our current project ends this fall.

Bitcoin is a form of Internet money that is immensely trendy and greatly appreciated means of buying and selling on line. And this is a currency that barely anybody understands. Various companies exclusively accept Bitcoins. The truth because of the recent banking instability in Cyprus it became so enormous that the worth of “all outstanding Bitcoins” just hit $1 billion.
So what is this bitcoin? Bitcoin (sign: BTC) is a decentralized digital currency based on an open source, peer-to-peer internet protocol. It was introduced by a pseudonymous developer named Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. 
Bitcoins can be exchanged through a computer or smartphone locally or internationally without an intermediate financial institution. In trade, one bitcoin is subdivided into 100 million smaller units called satoshis, defined by eight decimal points. 
Bitcoin is not managed like typical currencies: it has no central bank or central organization. Instead, it relies on an internet-based peer-to-peer network. The money supply is automated and given to servers or “bitcoin miners” that confirm bitcoin transactions as they add them to a decentralized and archived transaction log approximately every 10 minutes. 
Who would have thought that a virtual currency with no physical manifestation all of a sudden worth $1 billion in U.S. currency.
Bitcoin is gaining traction plus attention even if it does not hold a candle to the $1.13 trillion in Federal Reserve Notes in circulation.
What people like about Bitcoin is it removes the middleman from online transfers of money. We are all concern about those middlemen such as central banks, or the Federal Reserve or credit card companies. Bitcoin also permits for more anonymity than every other mode of online payment. Though it’s hard to pinpoint just how unidentified Bitcoin really is, this fact manipulates how the currency is used. One controversial Reddit group that seeks to “protect” men from feminists asks for donations in Bitcoin particularly to guard the characters of all involved, although some secretive purchases made online using Bitcoin are justified,.
Two main ways to acquire Bitcoins: You can buy them or mine for them, don’t go back you red it right, you can mine it. Just like any other type of money the Bitcoins and U.S. dollars exchange rate also fluctuates. The current exchange rate as of Friday afternoon is 1 Bitcoin to $88.811. Similar with conventional currencies, it’s possible to make money just by buying and selling Bitcoins as exchange rates change.
It’s a outlandish procedure as for mining for Bitcoins. According to Bitcoin’s official website, mining is basically making your computer run a program to “do mathematical calculations for the Bitcoin network to confirm transactions and increase security.”
Your chances of receiving any Bitcoins from mining on your own are thin, other than mining takes up a lot of space on your computer. A lot of people adhere what are known as mining pools to compensate. People can combine their computing power to crack the codes together, splitting the Bitcoin profits among themselves in a pool.

personalfinance,How do you decide how much money to put towards debt/401k/roth/emergency fund?,"I'd like to believe that at 21 yrs old I'm in a pretty good place so far. I've got a job after I graduate this May. I've got about 32k in student loans, but at least I have like ~3k in stocks and ~8k in a Roth IRA (i won't be able to maximize my contributions this year unfortunately T_T).

I know the general goals about saving and paying down debts

* pay off debt as soon as possible, focusing on the high interest rate ones first. 
* enroll into my future employer's 401k and contribute up to what they would match.
* do my best to maximize my contribution limit to my Roth IRA each year.
* build an emergency fund (which I have about $800 in so far... still adding to it).

However, how do I prioritize amongst all of these goals? Should I focus on my student loan debt before contributing to my Roth? Or should I focus on my 401k and conributing to my Roth before my Debt?

The uranium spot price plunged $1.35 this past week, to $40.90 per pound U3O8, as new supply entered the market, according to TradeTech. “The lack of market activity and reports of new problems with import licenses at the Chinese border prompted some sellers to lower offer prices,” reported the industry consultancy firm. “However, the drop in the spot price has yet to attract extensive buying interest and only two transactions are reported for the week.”

Estimated 2013 uranium production from the world’s leading uranium producer, Kazakhstan, is pegged at 22,821 tons U3O8. The Central Asian nation plans to “annually boost” its uranium production in order to keep its top-dog status, according to Tengri News. A look at Kazakhstan’s nuclear power agency’s 2012 to 2016 strategic plan shows yearly production targets of: 24,019 tons U3O8 in 2014; 24,754 tons U3O8 in 2015; and 25,602 tons U3O8 in 2016.

Last week, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and India’s Department of Atomic Energy finalized arrangements for Canadian companies to export nuclear products and fuels to India. “The agreement ensures Canadian exports only go to facilities in India under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards,” reported the National Post. India plans to construct 12 new nuclear reactors by 2021, and its annual uranium purchases are expected to triple to about $650 million.

The United Arab Emirates expects to have a nuclear power capacity of 5,600 megawatts by 2020, reported Bloomberg Businessweek. In 2015, AREVA (EPA:AREVA) will be supplying nuclear fuel for the Jordan Research and Training Reactor (JRTR), currently under construction in the Kingdom of Jordan, reported The Wall Street Journal. “Construction of the JRTR research reactor by the KAERI/DAEWOO consortium is an essential step for Jordan in acquiring the capabilities required for nuclear R&amp;D and producing nuclear power,” states the report.

Company news

Energy Resources of Australia (ASX:ERA) has set its sights on building a new mine in the Northern Territory, reported The Australian, in an effort to “extend the life of its declining and unprofitable open-cut Ranger mine in Kakadu National Park.” The company is planning to start underground exploration drilling of the Ranger 3 Deeps exploration decline in the second quarter of this year.

Junior company news

The Patterson Lake area in Saskatchewan’s prolific Athabasca Basin is once again taking center stage in this week’s mining headlines, with more positive exploration results out of the Patterson Lake South (PLS) property and further land acquisitions in the area.

Monday, Alpha Minerals (TSXV:AMW) and its joint venture partner, Fission Energy (TSXV:FIS), reported radioactivity results from the final 10 drill targets of their winter 2013 exploration program at the PLS property. Further drilling at the R00E zone has extended the strike length of high-grade mineralization to more than 120 meters, with widths of up to 50 meters.  Highlights include hole PLS13-059, which intersected 26.5 meters of mineralization (55 to 86 meters), with a total of 9.9 meters of off-scale (&gt;9999 cps) radioactivity, including a 6.5-meter section of continuous off-scale radioactivity.

Skyharbour Resources (TSXV:SYH) completed its acquisition of a 100-percent interest in 285,000 acres in the Patterson Lake region, which is strategically located near the PLS uranium discovery. In total, the company has acquired six properties, totaling 388,000 acres, in the region.

Aldrin Resource (TSXV:ALN) entered into an option agreement to acquire a 70-percent interest in the Triple M uranium property, which is located in the Patterson Lake region. The 12,001-hectare property borders the PLS property 9 kilometers south to 11 kilometers west of the recent discovery. The press release notes that the property contains: a segment of the Patterson Lake fault along strike from the discovery at Patterson Lake; a segment of a southwest-trending fault zone parallel to and south of the one at Patterson Lake; and a segment of a southwest-trending fault zone parallel to and northwest of the one at Patterson Lake. The company stated that it has commenced a technical report describing the Triple M uranium property.

TAD Mineral Exploration (TSXV:TJ) acquired about 4,000 hectares of prospective land through staking in the vicinity of the PLS prospect. The company plans to put boots on the ground shortly.

Zadar Ventures (TSXV:ZAD) entered into a purchase agreement to acquire a 100-percent interest in the BullRun uranium project in the Southwestern Athabasca Basin. The BullRun project is comprised of three claim groups totaling 9,185 hectares. Block A is located 30 kilometers north of the PLS property and 40 kilometers south of the Shea Creek uranium deposit. Block B is located 50 kilometers east of PLS and 50 kilometers west of the Centennial uranium deposit. Block C is located 12 kilometers west of the Centennial uranium deposit.

Kivalliq Energy (TSXV:KIV) discovered ”radioactive mineralization associated with a geophysical conductor located between, and along strike from, the Eastern Extension and J4/Ray Zones” at the 340,268-acre Angilak property in Nunavut, Canada. Phase 1 of the 2013 exploration program will continue through June and will include approximately “3000 metres of NQ core, with one diamond drill rig, on advanced targets within the Lac 50 Trend and new targets such as Dipole and VGR located on the western side of the Angilak Property,” according to the company’s press release.

Paladin Energy (TSX:PDN,ASX:PDN) released its Quarterly Activities Report for the first quarter of 2013. Highlights include strong sales revenue of US$106 million for the quarter and sales of 1.92 million pounds U3O8 at an average price of $55.22 per pound. Langer Heinrich production totaled 1.23 million pounds U3O8 while production at Kayelekera totaled 761,992 pounds U3O8. Production guidance for 2013 (8 to 8.5 million pounds U3O8) remains well on target.

Energy Fuels (TSX:EFR) is looking to restore the Sheep Mountain uranium mine, a past-producing open-pit and underground mine in Wyoming. Construction of an on-site processing facility is planned for spring 2014 and mine construction could start in late 2015, despite the fact that the company is awaiting federal and state regulatory clearance and needs about $60 million in start-up costs, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Sheep Mountain has a projected mine life of 15 years and is expected to produce 1.5 million pounds of uranium annually. Once operational, the project will be Energy Fuels’ second production facility, behind the White Mesa Mill in Utah.

I’ve lurked here for some time and figured it’s time to throw my unique situation out there for folks to comment on and hopefully either provide a model for others or gain some knowledge!
 
I’m currently active duty in the military but planning to separate in Summer 2014. At that time, I will be simultaneously relocating, changing jobs, and looking to purchase my first home. I am also expecting my first child later this year, which adds an element of risk-aversion to the picture. My wife and I currently live *well* within our means, and save to an unusual extent (close to 40% of our net income). **My question: how much should I plan to save for this transition, and using what vehicles? Or should I be going about this all in a totally different way?**
 
To add some detail:
 
* Salary prior to Jul 2014: $80k/yr
* Expected salary beginning Jul 2014: $85-100k/yr (this is a big unknown, and obviously an important one)
* Relocation expenses will be fully paid by Uncle Sam
* I plan to use a VA Loan to purchase the house, with little to no down payment and no PMI required
* I expect to purchase a house in the $175-200k range, resulting in a total monthly mortgage and tax payment of about $1100/mo
 
To add some detail in case folks want to comment on the employment variable: I’ll have six years as an AF officer doing acquisition management and leadership development work. My undergrad is in EE and I’ll have an MBA from a decent technical university. I’m confident in being able to find employment in the range above.
 
Our current status:
 
* A comfortable amount in Roth IRAs and Federal TSP that I’d obviously prefer not to touch, contributed to at a high rate
* About a $7k emergency/flexibility fund, in a svgs acct, contributed to at $100/wk until it reaches $10k later this year, then taper off to $50/wk
* About a $7k savings account for any and all mortgage or house purchase expenses we might encounter, also getting $100/wk
* $12k remaining on an auto loan at 4%, which we’re on track to pay off by ~Feb 2014. At that point we will have **zero** debts.
 
My plan:
 
* Enter the transition with zero debt
* Pursue the VA Loan for house purchase; cover any associated costs with the ~$14k in the mortgage fund
* Dip into the emergency/flexibility fund if necessary if the job search goes beyond my separation date
 
My key questions:
 
* Does this general approach make sense, or should I try to attack one risky endeavor (job, house, or child) at a time?
* Is there a better vehicle for my mortgage savings than a savings account at ~0.5%?
* Should I consider saving less aggressively for retirement in order to put a down payment on the house? Assuming I get to choose the amount, how much?
* Am I underestimating the impact a child will have on my finances?
* Are there other variables I’m overlooking?
 
Thanks in advance for the help you may have to offer!

personalfinance,Trying to get auto financing with an unusual credit situation. (xpost r/askcarsales),"I'm looking to buy a car that's around $19,000. I have $12-$13K to put down, so I'm looking to finance about $6K to help my husband's credit...allow me to explain.

I'm a 660 (with a cosign repo and a chargeoff), and he's at 680. He has never had a credit card (only checking and savings accounts), no student loans, bought his car in cash. For all these reasons, he has very little credit history and we're having trouble getting approved when I've shopped around. His annual income is $75K. We could pay cash for it outright is push comes to shove, but I think financing a small amount like that could get the ball rolling on fixing his credit up. Also, this way I'm paying it off myself instead of him pulling from savings.

I applied at a VW dealership today, but they said they can't nail down the exact interest rate until the sales price is decided and they run our info through the system, but they quoted anywhere from 4.74% to 12%.

My question is, what is my best course of action for this? Is there a some sort of credit wizard that I can plead my case to, in exchange for a nice low interest rate? Seriously though, is there anything I can do besides just eat whatever high rate they give me?",finance,1366261793

“We must teach our youngsters that alcohol is a drug.” -former President George Bush



Many of you do not realize that alcohol is, also, a drug. It impairs your thinking, reflexes and ability to make rational choices. Alcohol abuse could lead to medical problems, unplanned pregnancies, suicide attempts, crimes like assault and rape, and AIDS. Look at the following facts that were recently reported by SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions):



*	One in three college students now drink primarily to get drunk.



*	95% of violent crime on campus is alcohol related.



*	90% of all reported campus rapes occur when alcohol is being used by either the assailant or the victim or both.



*	60% of college women who have acquired STD’s, sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS and genital herpes, were under the influence of alcohol at the time they had intercourse.



If these facts haven't fazed you, then maybe the following incidents is going to help you to realize the terrible, and in some cases, fatal effect alcohol could have on you. They were reported by the U.S. Center for Substance Abuse Prevention:



* A Southwest Missouri State University freshman died after jumping off a seventh-story building balcony during spring break on South Padre Island. Police said the student was tampering with a fire hose when a security guard confronted him. The student ran down a corridor and threw himself over the balcony. An autopsy showed that the 18-year-old student had been drinking.



* An Eastern Illinois University student who had fallen into a lime pit was hospitalized with second- and third- degree chemical burns over 63% of his body. The 20-year-old junior was found lying unconscious and said he had been drinking and could not remember how he got into the lime.



* A 19-year-old Lewis University student fatally shot himself with a .38 caliber revolver in a game of Russian roulette. According to his roommate, the student had apparently spun the chamber and pulled the trigger several times before the round fired, killing him instantly. Both students had been drinking prior to the incident.



* An 18-year-old University of Colorado freshman was killed after being thrown from the roof of a vehicle. The 18-year-old driver who had been drinking, as had all four passengers, tried to take a curve too fast and went off the side of the road, rolling the vehicle on its top.



“Drunk driving is among the most deadly scourges ever to strike modern times, and it's as crippling as crack, as random as gang violence, and it's killing more kids than both combined.....” -former President George Bush

Copper had a rough ride this week on concerns about a slowdown in economic growth, particularly in China and the US, and on the World Bureau of Metal Statistics’ announcement that supply exceeded demand by 129,000 tons in the first two months of the year. Thursday, copper came off an earlier 18-month low after data showed that business conditions were good for US mid-Atlantic manufacturers in March.

Copper was headed for bear market conditions Thursday, having dropped 20 percent below a peak reached in February last year, Bloomberg reported. A generally accepted definition of a bear market is a drop of 20 percent or more over at least a two-month period.

“The macro environment remains negative,” Guy Wolf, head of market analytics at Marex Spectron Group in London told Bloomberg. “There is a lot of copper in inventories. There is no reason for buyers to step in aggressively yet.”

But investors weren’t ready to yield all and clung to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, according to another Bloomberg article. This information shows that while business activity slowed, manufacturers in Eastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey and Delaware expanded in April. In addition, a rebound in gold prices prompted some traders who had bet on lower prices to exit the market, providing temporary relief for copper prices, The Wall Street Journal reported
On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three-month delivery ended little changed at $7,087.50 per ton, having hit the 18-month low of $6,800 per ton earlier Thursday. It was the first time the metal had fallen below $7,000 since late 2011. COMEX copper for May delivery was up 0.5 percent, at $3.2040 per pound, in mid-afternoon trade in New York.

Company news

Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold (NYSE:FCX) cut its operating cash flow target for 2013 to $5.5 billion, from the $7-billion target announced in January, due to lower estimated average copper and gold prices. For copper, the company now expects an average price of $3.25 per pound instead of $3.65 per pound, while for gold it expects an average price of $1,400 per ounce instead of $1,700 per ounce. The company’s average molybdenum price is unchanged at $11 per pound.

Rio Tinto (LSE:RIO,ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO) said the Kennecott Bingham County copper mine will produce 100,000 metric tons (MT) less copper than planned this year after a landslide along the mine’s northeastern wall. Separately, the company said it is in “advanced” talks to secure bank funds to expand its Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia, Bloomberg Businessweek reported. In another article, Businessweek cited Mongolia’s finance minister, Chultem Ulaan, as saying that the government will do an audit of the Oyu Tolgoi operation in order to understand reasons for an alleged $2-billion cost overrun at the mine. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal cited CEO Sam Walsh as saying that the company has no immediate plans to develop the Pebble copper and gold project in Alaska. The company owns a 10-percent indirect stake in the project through its 20-percent ownership of Northern Dynasty Minerals (TSX:NDM), which owns Pebble with Anglo American (LSE:AAL).

BHP Billiton (ASX:BHP,NYSE:BHP,LSE:BLT) maintained its production targets for the full year, stating that its Escondida copper mine in Chile is on track to increase production by at least 20 percent in 2013. The company also named a new senior management team that will join incoming CEO Andrew Mackenzie in May.

Glencore International (LSE:GLEN) said China’s Ministry of Commerce has approved the company’s merger with Xstrata  (LSE:XTA), subject to a few conditions, including that Glencore sell its post-merger interest in the Las Bambas copper project in Peru to a buyer approved by the ministry before September 30, 2014. The company must also commit to supplying Chinese customers with at least 900,000 dry MT of copper concentrate unless its forecast copper concentrate production increases or rises, in which case the concentrate offered to Chinese customers will be adjusted accordingly. Glencore now expects the merger to be effective May 2.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo banned exports of copper and cobalt concentrates, Reuters reported. Mines Minister Martin Kabwelulu said the move is intended to force mining companies to process and refine the metals before shipping them outside the country. The ban is unlikely to affect major producers such as Freeport-McMoRan and Glencore, which already process the bulk of their copper inside the country, Reuters said.

Junior company news

Sierra Metals (TSXV:SMT) said a prefeasibility study of its Bolivar mine in Mexico supports a 10-year mine life at an expanded output rate of 2,000 MT per day. Proven and probable ore reserves total 7.5 million MT, averaging 19.5 grams of silver per MT, 0.759-percent copper and 0.329-percent zinc.

CuOro Resources (TSXV:CUA) is considering strategic alternatives, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic partnerships and other corporate transactions, to enhance shareholder value. The company said it will not make a $1-million option payment that is due on the Santa Elena copper project in Colombia until it has completed a strategic review within 90 days.

Nevada Copper (TSX:NCU) is on track to receive, within the second quarter, two state permits it needs for the construction and operation of the Pumpkin Hollow mine project. The company said it expects to initiate full construction of the stage-one underground operation this year.

ABE Resources (TSXV:ABE) said IMX Resources (ASX:IXR) has purchased a 50-percent interest in the St. Stephen nickel-copper project in New Brunswick. The two companies will develop the project as a joint venture.

Copper Fox Metals (TSXV:CUU) acquired Bell Resources’ Van Dyke copper deposit in Miami, Arizona for a total cost of C$2 million. It will also assume “continuing obligations” with respect to the deposit.

economy,AMERICAN HOMEOWNER PRESERVATION HELPS NEW JERSEY HOMEOWNER AVOID FORECLOSURE,"American Homeowner Preservation (AHP) announced today it has completed a mortgage modification for New Jersey homeowner William Beltran, ending his 3-year mortgage ordeal and enabling him to stay in his home of more than a decade. After purchasing Beltran’s mortgage, AHP was able to provide a principal reduction of almost 30 percent and reduce his monthly payments to an amount affordable based on his current income, saving the family from foreclosure.

Beltran, a psychologist, initially ran into mortgage trouble after developing a chronic medical condition that adversely impacted his ability to work. He tried to resolve his mortgage problems in a number of ways on his own, including seeking a mortgage modification from his original lender, seeking an independent refinance, applying for help from the federal government’s Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), working with an attorney and turning to a local nonprofit organization. None of these efforts were successful, and many of them added further to his indebtedness–the attorney alone cost $11,500, which turned out to be wasted.

When he received an offer letter from American Homeowner Preservation, Beltran was skeptical. “It sounded too good to be true,” he said. After speaking with other homeowners who had worked with AHP and checking the firm’s record with the Better Business Bureau and elsewhere, he started to believe they really could help. Then, he called AHP to discuss his options.

“Talking to AHP was the first time in a long time I felt like I was treated with respect, not contempt,” Beltran said. “We had an honest discussion of my options and my situation, and I was not pressured to choose one option over another. Once I decided what I wanted to do, the process couldn’t have been easier. I only had to submit my documents once and they were received– before, I was dealing with never-ending document requests even after I had already submitted them multiple times.”

“William is a great example of how an unexpected health problem can snowball into a foreclosure situation. He was doing everything right, everything the government and big banks tell families to do, yet he and the majority of families end up worse off,” said Jorge Newbery, Director of American Homeowner Preservation. “To help him stay in his home and end his anxiety so he can focus on his health and his family is very rewarding,” Newbery continued. “And to be able to do that while still providing our investors with a solid return so we can help others in the same situation is even better. Doing good for families and communities and doing well by achieving attractive returns for our investors do not have to be mutually-exclusive–achieving both is possible. ”

William couldn’t be more pleased with the outcome of his relationship with AHP. “I am infinitely happy,” he said. “It is incredibly thrilling and humbling to be able to stay in my home, especially since, for a while, I was pretty much waiting for the sheriff to show up at my door at any time. Selling or moving was not something I even wanted to consider. This is my home – it’s where my children grew up and where I have a lifetime of memories. I am so grateful.”

American Homeowner Preservation (“AHP”) purchases pools of challenged mortgages from banks and other lenders and then offers borrowers who want to stay in their homes viable, sustainable solutions with reduced payments and discounted principal balances. If homes are vacant or families want to move, AHP offers deficiency waivers and incentive payments to cooperate with short sales in order to put the homes back into service.

investing,Commodities Analyst Mohr Urges Patience,"By Andrew Topf - Exclusive to [Resource Investing News](http://resourceinvestingnews.com/53749-commodities-analyst-patricia-mohr-scotiabank-junior-miners-gold-copper-silver-potash-price-mergers-acquisitions-quantitative-easing.html)

In a trying week for resource investors that saw most commodities fall, including gold, which suffered its worst one-day drop in 30 years, commodities analyst Patricia Mohr said investors willing to go long on commodities should see improvement in the next couple of years. Shorter term, Mohr is bullish on potash, zinc and uranium. INN Senior Editor Andrew Topf sat down with Mohr, vice president and commodity market specialist at Scotiabank, last Friday at her office in downtown Toronto.

Andrew Topf: At the PDAC conference in March, you said that the mining bull run is likely to return at the end of the decade. Why do you think so?

Patricia Mohr: We continue to think that demand growth coming out of China and the rest of emerging Asia will be good. The pace of that consumption growth for particular base metals and for iron ore may very well be slower than what it’s been in the last 10 years, but will nonetheless still be quite high and will be coming off a much higher base of demand. Once we get through the next few years, where there probably will be more brownfield capability put in place, particularly in copper, and of course a number of major nickel mines, I think in the second half of the decade, the supply-demand balance around the world will tighten up again with less mine supply relative to demand — and with that, I do think the bull run for many commodities is going to return. Copper prices, although they’re probably going to edge a little lower from 2013 to 2014, I’d expect to actually rebound quite substantially later in the decade.

AT: You also said in March that more mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) could take place in the next few years in the mining sector as companies sell nonperforming assets. Could you explain the connection between asset sales and M&amp;A? 

PM: I think we’re at a point in the business cycle in the mining industry where we still have a lot of economic uncertainty in the world, although we do think that global economic activity will perform somewhat better next year. But it appears that there’s going to be a bit more mine supply in the next few years for the key base metals. In particular, copper and nickel and a little more mine supply relative to demand for iron ore. In recent years as well, companies have been faced with rapidly escalating capital and operating costs, so I think we’re probably entering a period of several years where the mining industry will be much more cautious when it comes to new capital commitments and much more disciplined with its capital spending. In that environment, we tend to think that companies will want to sell assets that are not core to their holdings, so because of that, we do expect M&amp;A to pick up in the next few years.

AT: I’d like to turn attention to the copper market. The copper price has held up around $3.50 a pound, which is still quite lucrative for copper miners. Yet there is more supply coming onstream from places like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South America and Panama. Is this new supply going to push the price down?

PM: Yes, I think it probably will. There’s a lot of skepticism by many in the industry about some of these new developments. Through 2012, the actual pace of new mine development and expansion has proceeded very slowly. Even last year, actual mine production was only up maybe 4.5 percent, a little higher than some anticipated, but still fairly modest. I think in the second half of this year and going into 2014 to 2015, some of the brownfield expansions will come onstream in all sorts of countries: Peru, China, the DRC, Zambia, the United States, so probably the supply-demand balance will loosen and we’ll probably move into a modest surplus and the price will go down. I’m forecasting $3.20 a pound for 2014, and it may move down further from there and then snap back in the second part of the decade.

AT: What are your reasons for thinking that it will snap back?

PM: While we do think there will be new mine supply, like Cobre Panama and Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, it is fairly limited, and by the second half of the decade things are going to tighten up again.

AT: Turning to potash, there’s been some news that could impact potash supply. For example, we saw Vale (NYSE:VALE) cancel its Rio Colorado project in Argentina. Prices have been down lately, so that can’t be encouraging for producers. When do you see the potash price picking up?

PM: I think you’ll see some stabilization in potash prices in the next few months. The spring planting season in North America is being delayed by quite cold weather and heavy snow cover in many areas, so it’s going to be a very late spring planting, but once it does get underway, I think potash application will be fairly good; in places like Brazil and Southeast Asia, we’d expect fairly good application. Late last year, there was a lot of deferral of orders for potash, with buyers waiting for prices to move lower because of very poor business confidence across the world, and also because the market was anticipating that contract prices in China probably would be lowered. I think that the China price was the bottom of the market; it’s not moving up rapidly, but I do think that in the second half of the year prices will edge up. I think a lot of the producers this year are going to put more emphasis on getting the shipments rolling again, so I think 2013 will be a year characterized by higher shipments than last year.

AT: There have been a lot of rumors recently about quantitative easing ending in the United States, and that has caused great fluctuations in the price of gold. Where do you stand on QE and what do you think the gold price is going to do for the remainder of the year?

PM: The anticipation of stepped up quantitative easing was one of the reasons behind the rapid advance of gold prices over the last few years. But I think gold probably peaked at $1,921 per ounce in early September 2011 and the price has recently been consolidating (editor’s note: this interview took place on the morning of Friday, April 13, before the gold price took a precipitous drop). The gold market was a little unnerved in January, when the Federal Open Market Committee minutes came out, because there were some meeting participants who were talking about when the Fed was going to withdraw some of its asset-purchase program. We at Scotiabank do not think the Fed will withdraw that bond-purchase program for some time. They’re not satisfied with where unemployment rates are — they’re still at 7.7 percent and a normal level is 6.5 percent or less. So the Fed is not going to withdraw its program until they see real progress in the unemployment rate and that isn’t going to move to normal for quite some time, perhaps 18 months from now. I don’t see them withdrawing it, but I don’t see them increasing it either, and that’s been a bit of a worry for gold. In recent days, there’s been news that Cyprus may sell some or all of its gold holdings as part of its bailout package, and that has really unnerved the market and sent it lower. I’m not sure where the market is going to level out from here, I’m still in the $1,500 to 1,600 camp, but there are large risks around these numbers, so I wouldn’t want to put a spot forecast on it at the moment.

AT: We’ve also seen a lot of volatility with silver. When I talked to David Morgan in January, he was optimistic about industrial demand for silver picking up, yet that doesn’t seem to be happening yet. In fact, we’re hearing the market is oversupplied and that we’re entering into a bear market for silver. Would you agree with that?

PM: I think the industrial demand for silver is probably fairly strong, and likely to move higher in the next few years. You use silver in a lot of electronic devices, all mobile phones, flat-screen TVs, so I see the electronic demand for silver doing quite well. And so I’d say that while there’s a lot of uncertainty over gold prices, I think silver relative to gold will tend to hold up better.

AT: Our publication covers mostly junior mining companies, and as you know, this sector has been hit hard, with the TSX Venture at its lowest level since 2009. If investors take the long view on commodities — as you’re suggesting the bull run will return at the end of the decade — is there still hope for junior mining?

PM: I certainly hope so. The one positive is we do expect economic activity around the world next year to be better than this year, and certainly much better than in 2012. We see global GDP expanding perhaps 3.8 percent. It’s not a really stronger number next year, but it is better than the 3.1 percent of 2012 to 2013, so that will be a positive and could lead to some rejuvenation of equity interest for the junior mining companies. I do think mid-decade that zinc will outperform and there are a lot of little zinc junior miners that will maybe perform better because of that. I’m also hopeful that uranium prices towards the end of this year are going to look a little stronger, and that will help the junior mining sector as well. I do think it’s going to be a challenging time in the next couple of years, and then a much brighter future in the second half of the decade. By the time we get out to about 2016, it should start looking better again.

AT: Okay, let’s leave it on a bright note. Thanks very much for speaking with me.

PM: Thank you.

finance,Loans,"Im currently in a business class in school. In my class a student asked a question that was this: are you allowed to take out a large loan ( he used 2 million dollars) and put it into a high interest earning account for twenty years to earn money. The first thing I wanted to find out is how much money could be made. I had Alg 2 w/ Trig my next block in school ( I'm a freshman) and used the geometric sequencing formula into the calculator. IN the formula ( which I extended to get a net profit) I assumed that the interest rate was 5%. This is not normal, but in a money market account it could work. I also assumed that the 2 million dollar loan had a 7% interest charge for the twenty years. In the end, I calculated that with the 2 million dollar loan to pay off, someone could make about 3,100,000 dollars in twenty years. considering that the interest earning account may not be entirely realistic, I would say that someone could make 1,500,000- 3,100,000 dollars. This is an incredible amount of money ( this doesn't even include a normal salary). My big question is this: Has the  government found this loophole yet, and is it legal to do this. Also, what is the potential risk in an investment of this amount. Btw, first Reddit post so I'm open to advice on making post and on this post in particular. Thanks :)",finance,1366381832

**EDIT 202 1:31:**  It's basically been a lot of officers telling each other where they are going and general communication.  Nothing new.

**EDIT 201 1:30:**  Conference starting, link below.

**EDIT 200 1:26:**  Correspondent /u/potato_bus says another [press conference](http://www.myfoxboston.com/category/262392/boston-marathon) is coming up.

**EDIT 199 1:21:**  I have heard no updates on the old man with the dead switch or the location of White Hat.  I am only listening to the scanner but I do check messages for info.

**EDIT 198 1:20:**  Apparently the 'hostage' was frightened by a police officer with a gun.  

**EDIT 197 1:18:**  House with 'hostage' was clear.

**EDIT 196 1:17:**  They made sure the situation from 185/177 is definitely clear.

**EDIT 195 1:15:** ""Ambulance on the way to evaluate her.""

**EDIT 194 1:14:** People are telling me they said the hostage is safe.

**EDIT 193 1:11:** They are calling for an ambulance to swing by.  If something was said before it I missed it.

**EDIT 191 1:10:** A lot of garbled messages, SWAT is stepping in.

**EDIT 190 1:08:**  Front door opened, ""we have the message"".

**EDIT 189 1:07:**  Look if the hostage taker is reading reddit instead of listening to the scanner then he's screwing himself and we're helping the police.  

**EDIT 188 1:05:**  Attempting to contact hostage taker.

**EDIT 187 1:02:**  Possible house with hostage located.

**EDIT 186 1:00:**  Another suspicious package reported.

**EDIT 185 12:57:**  Situation from EDIT 177 is clear.

**EDIT 184 12:56:**  Possible hostage situation.

**EDIT 183 12:55:**  ""Everyone take cover.  No more units.""

**EDIT 182 12:55:**  ""A person is being held there by gunpoint.""

**EDIT 181 12:54:**  A man is trying to get through security but has no credentials.

**EDIT 180 12:53:**  Woman is being held by a man with a gun

**EDIT 179 12:53:**  Again, I don't know what the specifics of 173 are.  I'm not holding out.  They just started talking and then said 'we don't want this on the air' and then didn't talk about any specifics.

**EDIT 178 12:51:**  Reports are coming in that the White House situation room has been activated.  I'm looking up more now on that.

**EDIT 177 12:47:**  They are following up on another lead similar to the open basement.  Stuff has been moved since they last investigated the area.  (Look, do I think white hat is reading this instead of just listening to the scanner?  No, but i can be a little more vague when the detail doesn't matter.)

**EDIT 176 12:42:**  About EDIT 173, I don't really know what it is.  They aren't saying many details, they are checking on a vehicle, but other than that the only details are unit number and specific locations.  Which is exactly what they asked not be posted.  If something happens I'll post the aftermath.  And this is the first time they specifically said on the scanner not to mention something on the air.

**EDIT 175 12:40:**  They are checking on something but not being very descriptive.

**EDIT 174 12:38:**  There will be a controlled explosion in Cambridge later in the day as a precaution.

**EDIT 173 12:35:**  They just said something that they don't want on air.  Don't write a comment about it.

**EDIT 172 12:34:**  I'm still listening to the scanner and not the press conference so if anything new comes out in the conference please let me know.

**EDIT 171 12:33:**  EOD team being sent to another location.

**EDIT 170 12:29:**  /u/potato_bus posts link to upcoming [press conference](http://www.myfoxboston.com/category/262392/boston-marathon).  Police are very concerned about the security for the conference, or rather, making sure it is as secure as possible.

**EDIT 169 12:27:**  Open basement door that is being checked out.

**EDIT 168 12:24:**  /u/potato_bus said that MyFoxBoston is reporting that the helicopters are part of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), they are not military. 

**EDIT 167 12:22:**  CNN is confirming that the link is his twitter account: https://twitter.com/J_tsar/

**EDIT 166 12:17:**  /u/SolusLoqui posted a link to a [Guardian photo album](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2013/apr/19/boston-lockdown-best-photos-empty-streets#/?picture=407528614&amp;index=1) of Boston's deserted street.  Still waiting on press area to be cleared apparently.

**EDIT 165 12:15:**  As you've probably seen, military choppers have arrived.  Also news networks are reporting on the same twitter I linked.  I'm still leaving it down, but there are many cached pics of him.

**EDIT 164 12:13:**  Press conference should be sometime soon.

**EDIT 162 12:05:**  For those asking there have not been any recent updates on Suspect #2 (White Hat)

**EDIT 161 12:02:**  Suspect is ""clear"", safe for EMS to approach him.

**EDIT 160 12:01:** Numerous people from different areas have reported loss of power.  (Power outages were reportedly due to construction.)

**EDIT 159 12:00:**  /u/greenlep posted a different link to a ~~possible twitter~~ for Suspect #2 (White Hat).  Take it with a grain of salt, but looks more legit than the last one.  REMOVED  Cached profile pic was of Suspect #2 (White Hat) but it will stay removed until some source verifies it.

**EDIT 158 11:56:**  Still working on the old suspect, no updates on his status.

**EDIT 157 11:55:**  Apparently the ""jumper"" was not a person, but an area where a possible bomb may have been which explains why an EOD was sent to the location.

**EDIT 156 11:52:**  /u/riothedragonman lives near the area where the jumper was reported and says everyone has dispersed.

**EDIT 155 11:51:**  Someone asked, no update on hockey duffel bag drop off.  No update on jumper.

**EDIT 154 11:47:**  Four robots operating on the old man right now.  No word on device or explosive.

**EDIT 153 11:45:**  Press conference will begin soon, they are letting media with credentials enter the scene.

**EDIT 152 11:44:**  One area that was previously being investigated is clear.  Not the old man or jumper scene.

**EDIT 151 11:39:**  Second bearcat is arriving at the original scene with the old man.

**EDIT 150 11:35:**  They are doing police stuff that doesn't need to be reported.

**EDIT 149 11:30:**  An EOD team is being called to the overpass, no specifics.

**EDIT 148 11:28:**  Possible jumper on an overpass.

**EDIT 147 11:26:**  Because it keeps getting asked.  The suspect that is being searched by the EOD robots, that is handcuffed, that has the dead man switch, is a 60-70 yr old gray haired man.  He was specifically identified as having salt and pepper hair, even the age 90 was thrown out.  This is NOT White Hat aka Suspect #2

**EDIT 146 11:24:**  Investigating possible sighting of suspect #2 at different location.  (Most likely a false sighting, nothing else was said about this)

**EDIT 145 11:23:**  Unknown car has stopped within a security perimeter.

**EDIT 144 11:22:**  They said they need to bring in a second EOD robot and a second Bearcat (armored vehicle)

**EDIT 143 11:19:**  EOD robot is still clearing the suspect.  He will be interviewed after he is cleared.

**EDIT 142 11:18:**  Officials are supposed to give any update some time soon.

**EDIT 141 11:15:**  They are telling all non-SWAT to leave the area.

**EDIT 140 11:14:**  Subject definitely has some kind of device or switch in his hand.

**EDIT 139 11:11:**  EOD (explosive ordinance disposal) robot is attempting to remove the jacket from the man right now.

**EDIT 138 11:07:**  Been silent, EOD is on scene.

**EDIT 137 11:03:**  To further clarify, guy with the white hat has nothing to do with this (as far as we know).  He is still on the loose.  This suspect is an old man (60-70) with grey hair and appears to be holding a dead man switch.  

**EDIT 135 11:01:**  Negotiating with suspect (not white hat).

**EDIT 134 11:00:**  Apparently EDIT 126/128 was not clear.  This is not Suspect #2 aka White Hat.

**EDIT 133 10:59:**  Guessing they are still waiting on EOD.

**EDIT 132 10:53:**  ~~Hearing ""man down"" in the background, asking about another location.  Had two streams going and couldn't tell what was overlapping.~~  Not true.

**EDIT 132 10:52:** Making attempts to block a possible blast.

**EDIT 131 10:51:**  Suspect is shaking his head ""no"" and trying to arch his back up, speculating that he may be trying to do something with the device.

**EDIT 130 10:47:**  He has something in his right hand that he holding.  Last person had a dead man switch.  (If someone lets go of a dead man switch it triggers the mechanism)

**EDIT 129 10:46:**  Some people are saying they heard reports of a shot fired.

**EDIT 128 10:45:**  Waiting on EOD to move further.  Still no information on if the older man held at gunpoint has any relation to Boston Suspect #2.  Has anyone heard how they originally found him or if he approached officers?

**EDIT 127 10:44:** Suspect is being held at gunpoint and is in handcuffs.

**EDIT 126 10:40:** Waiting on mod position.  A different suspect may be found, may have transmitter on him.  They are being cautious, white male, 60-70 yrs old.  Brown jacket, device is in jacket.

**EDIT 125 10:39:**  It has been brought to my attention that the Boston PD has been asking that people do not post information from the scanner online.  As of now I will reduce updates only to information that either they want people to know (like the CRV info) or that can not compromise them at all.  Or stuff that is already on national news, like the man being held at gunpoint.

**EDIT 124 10:25:**  Some guy just dropped a hockey duffle bag by ""Save the Harbor Save the Bay"" and left, they are looking for him.

**EDIT 122 10:22:**  Looking at a red Crown Victoria now.

**EDIT 121 10:20:**  CRV was apparently found empty.

**EDIT 120 10:18:**  They say they have or have seen some possible suspects who look Russian.  ""We have him with us.""  Not entirely sure the specific.  I don't think it's the actual suspect, they were being too casual about it.

**EDIT 119 10:15:** Still looking for 1999 Grey Honda CRV License # 316 ES9 (thanks, sleepy dyslexia kicking in).  Suspect is believed to be driving/in the vehicle.

**EDIT 118 10:13:**  Pretty slow going right now.  Just making sure everything is in order.

**EDIT 117 10:07:**  Found a .40 caliber round casing.  Said it was in ""pristine condition.""  Found some distance from shootouts, said it looked like it might be one of theirs.

news,Sunil Tripathi - the second Boston Bomber suspect (Video),"Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPLjNLyJ398
(April 19th 2013 3:00pm est) The second Boston Bomber suspect is Sunil Tripathi. You heard it here first at GlobalLeaks. We came into contact with this information earlier, but were unable to report on it until now since we did not want to hinder any investigations. Sunil Tripathi was a philosophy student at Brown University. He disappeared on March 16th 2013. He left his phone, his wallet, everything but the clothes on his back. This would appear to indicate that he had no intentions of coming back. Sunil left a note before he left apparently hinting that he was planning some sort of 'publicised event'. Shortly after he left explosive were founds near the Brown University campus. This triggered an FBI investigation. On April 15th, Sunil Tripathi was one of two people that carried out the Boston Bombings.
Sunil Tripathi has been described by his family as a quiet person, incredibly intelligent, with a sense of 'helpfulnesses'. He was into philosophy, running, and cooking. He also had severe mental conditions. In 2013 he was engulfed in a deep depression. This deep depression mixed with some sort of outside influence may have been the reason why he carried out the bombings. We will update you with more information when we get it.",cryptocurrency,1366358003

personalfinance,The Top 5 Most Common Mistakes and Controversial PF Advice!,"There are two things I want to say before I get started: 

**EDIT** 

Let me make a clarifying statement/caveat: I made this thread to offer higher-income households an alternative view of how to think about wealth creation.

First, I know that many of you will disagree with this but let's try to keep the conversation civil. The following involves the purposeful use of exaggerations. 

Second, If you're poor, this isn't going to help you. I'm not going to draw a bright-line rule on what ""poor"" is, but I acknowledge my advice is of limited value. You need money to make money.  


**Conservatism to a fault.** Everyone wants to be conservative, but it's possible to be too prudent and miss out on an great opportunities. We can call this the prudence trap or loss aversion. Simply put, people on here  suffer more anxiety losing $1000 than they would be experience joy making $1000. Let's make one thing clear: this is a mental mistake. Instead, there should be a discussion of risk vs. reward. As a example, I often see this:

OP:  Should I buy a house as an investment property? I have NO experience as a landlord.

Reddit: This is a bad idea. Tenants could be troublesome, maintenance experiences can be higher than you expected. Worst of all, you could one day wake up and see your house 50% underwater! 

Bankster1: Great- thanks for listing the bear case. What about the bull case? What about a base case? Tenants could be great, maintenance expenses could be minimal and the home can appreciate! Is this house being sold below market value? Below replacement costs?  If yes, why would the house continue to lose value? This could be a real winner.  

Since you have no experience, I would look for a wider margin of safety. A 5% cap rate is probably too risky but at 15% you'd be crazy not too! A lot of things would have to go wrong for you not to make money in such a scenario. Saying things like ""you could lose 50% of your equity ""just because it happened in the past is silly.   


**Debt elimination vs. wealth creation.** It seems to be that people on here have a skewed sense of what debt is and what interest is. I think the best way to describe my view would be through an example: I still have ~$15,000 in loans at an average rate of 4.0% and $50K in cash in my bank account earnings 0.1% interest. 1) Most people on here would advise paying it off to ""lock-in"" the return. 2) Others would want to pay if off just to eliminate a ""fixed-cost"" and a 3) few just simply view interest as throwing money away. Each of the example above moves further away from reality. 

1)	Yea, you do lock a return but 4% is a pathetic rate and the optionality I get from having $50K is worth more than 4% to me. You never know when you'll see a great investment opportunity and a focus on minimizing your debt can eliminate your optionality. 

2)	Again, think about what optionality (opportunity cost) the extra cash gives you. If you can invest the money at a 8%-10% return you're making money with other people's money. An 8%-10% cap rate on real estate is pretty realistic is many different parts of the country. Or it's at least enough of a buffer to hire a property manager while you learn the ropes.

3)	Interest is the cost of borrowing. Decomposing the total cost of a mortgage into principal and interest over a 30-year period is comparing apples and oranges since it ignores inflation, opportunity costs, interest rate risk, etc...  


**Lifestyle inflation is not a sin, it's a reward.** I believe that rewarding yourself is a healthy part of life. For instance, I love to go to restaurants and I've dropped $500 on dinner for two more than once. I'm not saying go buy a new BMW (because new cars are often the worst financial decisions someone can make), but to chastise people because they're only saving 20% of their income when they have the potential to save 50% is ridiculous. It's all about balance and no one should confuse responsible personal finance with the goal of minimizing one's living expense. Mr.MoneyMustache says some pretty stupid things about this, imo. Some of the greatest experience in life are free, but more often than not, a great experience comes with a big bill. Sometimes it's worth the expense.  


**Early retirement is the dream!** I want to use this bullet point to expand on the above. I often see someone who just got a new job making ~$100K a year and the first things Redditers advise is ""keep living like you're still earnings $25K and you can retire in 10-years!"" I couldn't disagree more. First of all, this would usually require someone retiring when they're in their peak earning years (or sooner!). Second, I also think it's a waste for a healthy person to retire, especially if they like their job. I think work can be a great way to spend the day. Plus, even if I did retire all my friends and family would still be working. Third, the early retirement math implies no lifestyle inflation. I think it's a bad trade off to commit yourself to continue to live like a college student (which gets boring real quick) just so you can retire early when you're healthy enough and smart enough to continue building your wealth and improving your quality of life.   


**What about others?** No one on here talk about the cost of a friend's wedding or a parent's birthday. I love being able to buy my friends a bottle of Johnny Blue or my dad an iPad. Sure it kills my savings rate for the month but being able to give back feels good.

personalfinance,(xpost from /r/frugal) What credit card options are the best for an employed college student with no established credit?,"Hey /r/personalfinance

Here's the deal. I'm in a long distance relationship with someone I care about very dearly and we only get to see each other about once every two months. We both travel via airline most of the time since the distance is about 600 miles. I make enough ($9.25 an hour at around 20 hours a week) that I CAN pay the ticket price but it requires me to constrict my spending to an uncomfortable amount. I would much rather put it on a card, pay it off quickly, and have it completely paid off before I purchase the next one. 

So, what I need to know is, how can I easily (quickly, and safely) establish credit, and then which credit cards are available to me with the least features and (most importantly) the lowest interest?

I do NOT want something with frequent flier miles if the trade-off is going to be a higher interest rate. I'd like to be able to use this card for some things other than plane tickets occasionally, and I don't want to pay through the nose because of it.

*TL;DR:* No established credit yet. How do I get it? What are the credit card options with the least interest?

Bitcoin,"The difference between bitcoin and gold and the threat of online wallets, not what many of you think..","Its fairly obvious that a significant portion of the population don’t understand bitcoin.  You will often here people refer it as having the same problems as gold as a currency.  It does however have the potential to be very very different to gold and I am not sure how many here understand that significance so I am going to try and explain as most discussions I see completely miss the point.  I am also going to highlight a risk many may not have considered.  If this risk does become real it may destroy the potential benefit of bitcoin.


One of the key issues with currency up until now has been the requirement for a bank to keep it safe.  Given the high risk of theft, people always end up putting there owned currency in a bank, weather it be gold or other currencies that are not based on gold.  This inherently lead to banks sitting on very large amounts of cash. Eventually they figured out that could loan a significant portion of that currency at an interest rate to earn more currency.  This has a number of important effects, one is that it acts a currency multiplier, as people think they have money in the bank but its actually been loaned.  Thus the actual amount of currency in circulation is less than what people think they own.   Whats more, each time the bank loans out currency it inherently gets paid to someone who then puts it back in the bank to be loaned again.  Thus we have a currency multiplier which can be determined by the ratio of currency that has been loaned by the bank. In modern economies this ratio is typically very high, reserve ratios for the US for example are of the order of 3%, which means the amount of deposits the bank actually has is only 3% of what is deposited.  In other words, if only 3% of loans are not paid back, the bank will go broke and not be able to pay anyone back.  This is the inherent problem of gold, as when a bank makes such loans and currency multiplication occurs, should a loan falter and the bank go broke, there is no way to rescue the bank and its currency depositors as there is no way of conjuring gold to replace deposits.  Whats more, should that 3% of loans fail, and the bank fail, there is now a massive currency contraction, meaning other businesses which made decisions based on a certain amount of currency in circulation most likely also not being able to pay back loans due to currency velocity falling.  Banks have a further problem, if they stop loaning due to something being considered risky and deposits in the bank rise, then the velocity of money will fall and further businesses will not be able to pay back loans.  The bank has no choice but to keep making riskier loans, or current loans will eventually fail. Thus this system is inherently unstable and this is why modern economists do not like the gold standard.  Beyond the above there are also a number of other mechanisms which guarantee the system is unstable and without intervention must fail but I wont go into those details here as would require 50 pages and considerable maths so I hope you will think about the above and realize that the above is a big part of the boom bust cycle in modern economies.  Basically the boom bust cycle is mathematically guaranteed, and its not due to corruption.  In other words blame the system, not the people.


The above problem is solved in part by using currencies which are not linked to commodities like gold.  This enabled government to intervene by providing banks with more currency when needed to counteract the systematic instability of the loan based system.  For those familiar with control theory, you will understand currency intervention is in fact countering a pole (instability) in the system.  It does however have problems, which is obviously the continuous debasement of currency which favors those taking risks and not savers or those with capital assets as opposed to cash. Ideally the system should be balanced but the above is most likely one of the key contributors to the worlds declining and disastrous GINI index.  My assumption here is that GINI is getting worse as a function of the above system, and thus wealth is not in proportion to productivity. Ideally we should want a system that ensures a high correlation between wealth and productivity.


So here is where bitcoin comes in.  Bitcoin does not require a bank.  It has the potential to not suffer the instability of currency multiplication.  Since no one is putting their coins in a bank, there can be no currency multiplication and associated crash when a loan fails and a bank run occurs.  It is the multiplier effect that is the inherent driver of currency instability not the printing of currency.  I have however noticed that many of you are using online wallets.  So the question comes now, what is stopping the online wallets from loaning out your currency.  Remember, they will end up with a massive amount of currency at their disposal and the temptation to loan it will eventually become to great.  For example, imagine that the wallet company has 500million US dollars worth of bitcoins in storage.  Its very very tempting for them to loan them.  At first it will start as a small percentage, then over time, the inherent feedback mechanisms will encourage them to loan a larger percentage and so on until they fail.  It may take 30 years, but it will happen.  If they start making loans of bitcoins and those loans become an appreciable portion of the bitcoin float then currency debasement will happen and eventually those loans will fail and a bank run will occur.  Bitcoin does have mechanisms to allow you to determine if you currency has been loaned of coarse but it doesn't mean banks wont work around those mechanisms and people wont become lazy with regards to them.


TLDR: Biggest risk to bitcoin is online wallets becoming banks, loaning there currency, debasing it then failing when a single loan causes currency velocity crash that no one can intervene it.  Thus please folks, if you want this to work, ensure that the community doesn’t allow  large scale loaning by online wallet companies.  *big risk* If this does occur bitcoin will suffer the fate of gold.",cryptocurrency,1366459668
business,FBI warns of online scams seeking cash for marathon victims - EFORUMS,"http://www.eforum.com/threads/an-abney-associates-news-flash-marathon-victims-cash-scams.17082/
An Abney Associates News Flash
Heartless cyber swindlers have already set up as many as 100 bogus websites seeking money for the marathon bombing victims, while Internet trolls are using the attacks to spread computer viruses, prompting a pointed warning today from the feds.
“Individuals need to be aware of emerging fraud online associated with the explosions and how to take necessary precautions when using email and social networking websites,” a statement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation read today. “The FBI has received indications that individuals may be using social media and email to facilitate fraudulent activities online.”
A fake “Boston Marathon” Twitter account was created “soon after the explosions” that falsely claimed every tweet received to the account would result in a dollar donated to the victims. The account was pulled by Twitter.
The FBI also said more than 125 “questionable” Internet domains already have been registered which could be used for “fraudulent purposes.”
There are also spam emails flooding the web using the words “Boston Marathon” that are spreading computer viruses by uploading malware or spyware to unwitting users who open the messages.
“Based on previous disasters, cyber criminals may use this event as a means to further illegal activity to gain personally identifiable information,” the warning states.
The FBI warned people looking to donate to victims to research the charities and call authorities if they discover anything suspicious. The agency also warned the public to “be skeptical of charity names similar to but not exactly the same as reputable charities” and not to donate using money transfer services.

personalfinance,Severely disappointed with Ally Bank,"This probably belongs in r/offmychest more than here but it goes anyway.

I've been lurking on r/personalfinance for some time now and have learned a great deal! However, I'm burning with rage.  See, I had been searching for a bank that offers higher interest rates.  I've been with my current federal credit union for over five years and everyone in my family also uses it.  They offer only half of what Ally Bank does in terms of savings and checking accounts.  My research included reading old r/personalfinance threads where I found many glowing reviews of Ally.

So I open a savings and checking account with Ally.  They say they will send me a welcome package with checks and debit cards by mail.  It's been almost two weeks and I still haven't received that packet.  No matter, I can still be efficient and do all my banking online.

So I start transferring money from my old account to Ally.  At the time I did not know this but it takes at least three days for these funds to transfer.  Those transfers were then accidentally duplicated, meaning that I now had several overdraft fees from my old bank.  When I contacted Ally customer service, I was told to wait another day and then transfer back the excess money.  (I don't understand how I'm supposed to transfer money that doesn't exist.) 

So now I only have a fraction of my savings in my original bank account with the majority of it disappearing.  Forgive me for sounding upset but I truly am when it comes to 1.5 years of savings.  I don't appreciate having Ally's customer service offering absolutely no solutions.

The moral of the story: Stick with federal credit unions.",finance,1366433194

personalfinance,"Single Dad, looking for financial direction -- Save? Pay Debts? Move in six months?","Single dad, 28, with maximum earning potential this year of roughly $67k (heh ... always thought that was a lot of money) but I live in the SF Bay Area and I essentially break even financially, month-to-month.

**Some background with way too much personal information:**

  I have a ... fairly opportunist Ex-Wife.  I also have an amazing 6-year-old daughter. One dollar out of every 4 I earn goes to Child Support but I still need to provide kid with shoes and other essentials, and daughter spends 30% of her time in my apartment (with the rent being another 20% of my income, and taxes/witholdings taking another 25% ... ish).
Despite tremendous financial adversity (at one point renting a sofa, in an ugly part of town, just so I could get sleep, look for work, etc) I've clawed my way into something stable and been looking over my shoulder constantly, financially nervous, for the past four years since. Despite a steady job with a solid software company (without a single layoff in the company's entire history) I can't quit worrying about financial storms which *have* come my way, include $18k in legal costs for last year, and a $13k legal judgment against me this year (apparently Montessori Preschool is qualified childcare, even if I expressed I couldn't afford it).*

**In all, I have the following debts:**

  $14.5k Student Loans @ 5.6% fixed APR

  $12.5K Child Support Arrears @ 10% APR (I'm not a deadbeat! Ex got a judgment for Montessori Preschool tuition as ""childcare""!!)

  $3.5K  Balance on a personal loan from Chase @ 3% fixed APR (From $28k CC balance transfer in 2008 ... never saw another fixed APR offer, ever again!)

  $2k Remainder of Attorney Fees 0% APR.

  All my active credit cards are paid off monthly, so I pay zero finance charges.

**My ""Assets"" include:**

  $10K cash savings emergency buffer. 

  $16k in 401(k) (over 3.5 years of saving)

  $4K in very poorly diversified stock portfolio (10 shares of AAPL; hoping to recover loss from purchasing in mid 2012)

  $My sanity. Mostly. Aw, who am I kidding -- that's pretty spent as well.

**Income to Expenses**

  31% of my income goes to various state/federal withholdings, plus company insurance premiums

  20% of my income goes to my Ex Wife, as Child Support

  22% of my income goes to renting a 700sq foot, 1-bedroom apartment.

  2% of income goes into 401(K). I intend to retire shortly after the heat-death of our solar system.

  ... the remaining 25% of my income pays for gas, food, trousers (I'm informed they are not optional), car insurance, bandaids, allergy medicine, used computers and furniture on craigslist (hobbies, spending $100 /month ish when available).

Anyhow, my child's futon in the livingroom isn't always going to fit her (actually, it's as big as my bed, but I'd rather she have her own bed in her own room, and call it ""home""), and I can't provide her with her own bedroom without some serious change in circumstance. Living in one of the most ridiculously affluent places in the world makes that difficult. 

**So, first things first ...**
 given I can safely anticipate fewer financial curveballs in the next 9 months plus a goal to earn an extra $4000 this year (either with performance bonuses or through outside contracts) I'm trying to determine if I should aggressively pay the debts down, or leverage whatever cash I can get my grubby hands on and hope it performs better with interest. Or should I split the difference and drop more in my company 401(k) (with some matching, up to 5%).

Or, should I be shopping for new apartments, requiring 1/2 hour commutes and an extra $600 /month rent, roughly. Or am I already delinquent in saving for my daughter's college (in 12 years ... she's going to need $100k given current tuition raises, right??).",finance,1366432865

news,Senator to propose bill regulating black powder in wake of Boston Massacre,"[Source](http://www.examiner.com/article/senator-to-propose-bill-regulating-black-power-wake-of-boston-massacre)
On April 17, New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg issued a statement to the public that he intends to propose a bill or amendment to regulate black powder, and other forms of explosive components, in the wake of the Boston Marathon Massacre. The bill would demand full Federal background checks of anyone seeking to purchase the minor explosive, similar to recent attempts by Congress to require full background checks on the sale of firearms.

""In the wake of the deadly bombing attacks in Boston, U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) today announced that he will reintroduce legislation he has proposed in a prior Congress to require that sales of explosive powder be subject to a background check. He will also file the legislation as an amendment to the gun violence prevention bill currently on the Senate floor."" - Lautenberg.Senate.com

Early indications by analysts and observers of the horrific Boston Marathon bombings show that a black powder explosive may have been the primary element in the bombs that killed three people, and injured hundreds of others. The use of black powder explosives are considered small in potency when compared to today's high tech explosives, and their use has been found to date as far back as 220 BC.
Of the $27.8 Billion spent each year on firearms, ammunition, clothing, reloading equipment, optics, and accessories by the American public, only about 7-8% of all gun owners reload their own ammunition on a regular basis. This means that only a relatively small amount of people purchase black powder explosives each year, and in comparison to other flammable, explosive, and dangerous household products such as fertilizer and gasoline, the singling out of black powder for stricter regulation bears little statistical evidence that its use in criminal activity is widespread.
Politicians are well known for using tragic events for their own political gain, as seen recently by the addition of children as props during speeches and debates over gun control. However, the real issue is not the tool or elements used in the orchestration of a crime, but the person behind that use that should be the focus of any criminal indictment, or legislative regulation. And even as no suspect, nor full analysis of the bombing has taken place since the bombing, Senator Frank Lautenberg is choosing to propose legislation which would regulate black powder, and will potentially hurt a retail product that is part of the $67.8 Billion economic impact that hunting and firearm ownership adds to the nation's annual GDP.

personalfinance,Going off to college soon and I want to invest my savings fund.,"Hi everyone. Before I begin, I have read the commonly addressed topic ""I have X what can I do with it"" - I'd like to get your opinions too.

**Background**

* So next year I am going off to college for a 5 year program. Over these 5 years I will have (3) work experiences which pay $10-15k over 6 months. 

* I also have $30-40k in my savings account - unsure of the exact amount.

* My parents are taking care of college but I'd like to be able to pay them back someday, or at least pay for part of my 5th year. (They would rather have me save my money for when I want to start my own business.)

* I know its barely a qualification, but I did take ap macroeconomics this year so I do know about the stock market and all that. 

**Options**

My question is what option I should take. My parents use a financial adviser but he is new(er) for them. Would I be better off doing my own research and finding some blue chips to invest in? I know anything is better than the interest rate at the bank and I am losing money the longer I wait.

worldpolitics,DIVINE RIGHTS ABOLITION MOVEMENT,"Reality check... Whether you like it or not, the facts are as they are, and the truth often hurts.  

 Kim Jung Un, an American educated elite leader, is attempting to send the United States citizens and the world an important message. As is often the scenario, an egotistical greed based reasoning of educated and uneducated Americans are either not listening to or refusing to accept and see reality. With an open-mind, the message is clear:  The American military presense surrounding Asia, the employment of regime change focused on controlled leadership, strategic geographic and manipulated demographic sites (MIDDLE-EAST, PAKISTAN, AFGANISTAN, SOUTH KOREA, AUSTRALIA, NORTH ARFICA) all point to a CLEAR and PRESENT DANGER!  The true danger being one of planned domination by an alliance of WORLD IMPERIALIST's (otherwise known as the ULTRA-WEALTHY ELITE). 

The preëmptive strike strategy was utilized and the American majority (the 99 percent--while having great doubt as to the reality behind what they were told by the government) naïvely and deterministically accepted the falsehood of Iraq harboring nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare during the Iraq wars. Thus, as a result of blindly following the control and direction of a group who gained great wealth as a result of war, Iraq was destroyed and later rebuilt by the American Imperialist Elite.

Boldly, Kim Jung Un threatens to strike the United States and allies with nuclear bombs. Therefore, by the use of rhetoric and propaganda displays to the American majority that war can be exceptionally profitable for the ruling class elitists or exponentially costly; that is, if indeed the 99 percent majority looks at life in American society with an open-mind, they will clearly see that Kim Jung Un is not suicidal, but rather an alarmist who is fearful of the Imperailist strategy. An in your face and up yours strategy by Kim Jung Un that successfully negates the United States preëmptive strike policy and alerts the world majority to a focus on REAL EVIL.

The same EVIL that has caused HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DEATH DURING WARS---not the deaths of the elite, but rather the deaths of your personal blood-line family ancestry. Throughout history, ROYALTY, RELIGIOUS LEADERS,and the WEALTHY have enriched their cause through war and through the suffering of the common man's family (always proclaiming that it's for the better good of society). 

Utilizing the strategy of mind-contol techniques (mostly electro-magnaetic radiation) and propoganda, today, the Great Financial Institutions/BANKS (the one's that were bailed out while we were sold out) along with CORPORATE ELITE, MILITARY ELITE and Government puppets, send you to death to protect their paradise on earth at the expense of your HELL on earth!

There are many rumors afloat stating the strategy/intent is to have 90 percent less.  (read that as you may)  Is that 90 percent less humans on earth or 90 percent less wealth in the hands of the elite?  

Again, ask yourself-Who has the real power to mandate? Because China and Russia border North Korea, the same American Ruling Class, of whom from the American Revolution onward, always sends the common-man to death on the battlefield, will hold tight for the time being. At present, their (the Elite) life and livelihood is at stake!  War strategy for (New World Order) global domination does not happen overnight.  Decades of preparation and planning are at stake... 

The the Federal Reserve, the American Dollar, the Corporate Elite, the Military Elite, the Executive Branch Elite and the billionaire's $3805/hr/24/7 for the next 30 years (1 billion dollars net worth) (assets-liabilities=net-worth)  sell everything, pay off everybody and what you have left over is networth...livelihood is in great jeopardy.

SIMPLIFIED FOR THE SIMPLE-MINDED or CLOSED-MINDED MAJORITY--with an ability to stash away $91,000 per day, could you SURVIVE NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL or CHEMICAL WAR?

As a war based economy, America has always relied on war. With an unfunded 123 TRILLION DOLLAR UNFUNDED LIABILITY or a $1,089,000 LAX LIABILITY PER TAX PAYER the Elite is in desperate need of a VERY LARGE WAR. goto: National Debt Clock bottom Ironically, cause and effect of a preëmptive strike policy and strategy seems to come and go with profit potential.

Warning...BEWARE! The control strategy behind Miranda rights and Enemy Combatant rights is not intended for the few, but is intended for the 10,000's, 100,000's, or 1,000.000's of whom are about to take to the streets and demand change. (RISKS OF INCARCERATION WITHOUT RIGHTS IS PRESENT PLACE) 

America's future freedom and intellect depend on a United States majority which demonstrates by peaceful means or by use of force, the people's resolve of clear and present demonstration.  A majority of which no longer tolerates an upper-class and Eliteist system driven by greed at the expense of all others.

Neither control of the masses thorough outdated mythological based religions, nor expectations that the average person must suffer at the expense of grandeur, will be tolerated. The United States, as The World Divine Rights Abolition Movement leader, will help create a new world order of a majority through transformational intercontinental internet communicative means.",finance,1366582841

Bitcoin,Why (I think) Bitcoin can't survive if it's not at least $500 a coin,"&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; edit: This is meant to be very forward looking to when bitcoin is (hopefully) more accepted and used as a currency, the creation rate has been halved a few times. I guess I should have titled it: ""Why I think Bitcoin will be &gt;$500 a coin in the future""   
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Hello all, I've been a first discovered bitcoin in 2011 when it was about $1 a coin, right around the time SR was starting up and I've been watching it ever since. I'm an economics major so I find it incredibly fascinating to watch the markets and nomnomnom data. I wish I would have had more to invest in it, but I don't think it's too late to still earn nice returns. Here's why:

 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Getting to my point of the title, I was crunching some numbers the other night looking at data on the StLouisFed.org, specifically I was looking at the M1 money supply (which is basically all cash in circulation + all checking deposits in the U.S.) The supply has grown very quickly in recent years, going from 1.3 trillion to 2.5 trillion dollars in the past 5 years. As many of you know, this will cause each dollar that's out there to be worth less due to weakened purchasing power, this is known as inflation. We aren't seeing it yet but once the economy keeps picking up we should, in theory, start seeing our dollars not go as far. I'm not saying dollars will be worthless/fuck the Fed/etc, just saying that printing (too much) money leads to inflation.   
     
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  Moving along, let's say the current M1 supply is 2.0 trillion dollars and let's say that it exists only in $100 bills. That means there's 20 billion units to go around the entire economy. Now there's about 315 million people in the US, some people are too young to really have money and US dollars are used worldwide but let's stick with 315 million ""users"" of US dollars. Let's pretend we're communists and we're going to split those 20 billion $100's evenly, that means that each person gets about 63 1/2 100 dollar bills, or $6300 each. What's the point? The point is to illustrate that there needs to be a good bit of money available for each person in the US, this means there is enough liquidity that goods and services can be exchanged without having to barter. $6300 is a bit high relative to the past, however if we used figures from 1980 when the M1 money supply was $400bln, we'd still have almost $2000 for each person in 1980. The EU has around 9000 euro's per person\*    
     
     
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  Now, how does this relate to bitcoins? Right now there are about 11million bitcoins, half of which are gone/lost/inaccessible(I've seen estimates at 75% ""lost"" but let's call it 50%) and eventually we'll max out at 21 million coins total. Assuming people aren't losing coins now or in the future and subtracting the currently lost ones, there could be around a total of 16 million in circulation once coins are no longer released. Now since bitcoins are worldwide they're acceptance and demand can grow pretty fast, as we've seen recently. I wish I could get a accurate figure of how many people ""use"" bitcoins right now worldwide but let's assume that bitcoin will keep growing in acceptance and use as it has and that when we hit 16 million coins there will be 500 million people\**(about 7.5% of the world pop.) that use/accept/want bitcoin. At $100 a coin that would a be monetary base of $1.6 billion to split between those 500 million people, leaving just $3.2 for every person, compare that to our earlier figures of 2000USD for each person in our 1980 M1 supply in the US. Nobody wants a currency they can only find $3 worth to spend. So how much would bitcoin have to be per coin so that each person has $1000 available? About $31,000 per coin.   
     
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Am I saying bitcoin will be $31,000 a coin? Not at all. But when looking at other currencies I don't see any way that bitcoin can have a market cap of $1.6billion and actually survive. Even if only 50 million people end up using bitcoin in the end of new coins, that would leave $32 for each person, which can't work. The only way it could ""work"" that I can see is if bitcoin banks operating as fractional reserves start popping up. But then that creates an M2 supply and is counter to the spirit of bitcoin and puts it at risk.    
   
   
      
     
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  

    
    
     
     
\*The EU's currency base is a much smaller share of their M1 supply, so it's not quite as high as it seems. Both the US and EU have right around 1000bln currency in circulation.    
\**This is the only figure, aside from 16 million btc, that I've had to more or less pull out of my ass. If you think you can come up with a more accurate number please share.    
    
    
    
    
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  

     



tl;dr  

Whoever Satoshi is, he really thought this out. If you divide the 2008 US currency base / US population you get around $2800 per person. If you divide 16 mln btc at $100 coin / half of US population you get $10 per person (.1 btc) to go around, getting more than .1btc will be hard. 100 mBtc(.1btc) won't be enough for people if it's only worth $10. Maybe if .1btc (100mBtc) is worth $50 or $100 then it'd be enough for btc's survival. confused? read above. 
Just something to think about.

personalfinance,Valuing the Cost of College,"This is not a post about where to find spreadsheets of cost of attendance, but rather, to see if taking on the burden of private loans in addition to federal loans, is worth it. My brother recently was accepted to Berkeley and intends to major in Computer Science, however, the decision is breaking my parents' heart and possibly their bank accounts.

For out of state students, total cost of attendance is about $55k. With 4-year graduation rates of 61%, we are looking at costs potentially in excess of 200k, after about 5k of scholarships per year. With the school's top-notch reputation for computer science, from what we understand, median salary is at about 80k. We have no idea how far that takes someone as far as paying off living expenses in California, the state of his dreams, and college debt after that.

My parents just top $150k in combined income, have their house fully paid for, and have no outstanding auto loans or massive credit card debt. They recently purchased another home using a revolving line of credit and are hoping to convert that to a normal mortgage within the next few months. This is the home they plan to move into after my brother leaves for college, and wait until the real estate market bounces back a little more to sell our current home (or else they'd be losing about 25% of what they paid for it if they sold now). They otherwise have a fairly modest lifestyle, with maybe 1 vacation a year of less than 5k for all 4 of us.

I've told them over and over to run the numbers into a spreadsheet to see what they can actually afford to pay outright, but they ball park it around 25k/year, or 100k in total, with potentially having to dig into their retirement accounts or using their home equity.

The limit on his federal loans is a little under 7500 a year, including federal work study, so the remaining 20k or so per year would have to be private. Assuming it takes him 5 years to graduate, 100k in loans is no small joke. It's hard for them to see if whether his *potentially* high paying salary would make that doable though. It's also hard for them to justify digging into their own nest eggs when they see retirement just on the horizon. But it's killing them to have to tell my brother ""no"" just because of money, because with some stretching, it is possible. The question is, is it worth it?

We realize this is a very ""fortunate"" problem to have, as he could go to the state school for a fraction of the cost, but with significantly less recruiting options. Being from a state school myself, I understand that if you hustle and ""want it bad enough"", that these differences become negligible. However, I often do envy my friends whose resumes get put on the tops of the piles while we state-schoolers kiss ridiculous amounts of behind to even get put in the pile to begin with.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Furthermore, if anyone does have a more comprehensive spreadsheet beyond those that only include federal loans to input rates for private loans, as well as a ""beyond college"" outlook to see how exactly one might plan to pay those loans back assuming a certain level of income, that would be fantastic.

I've read online that the minimum payment on a loan is $50. If I have 8 separate loans (1 unsubsidized and 1 subsidized federal staffford loan each, per semester), will my minimum payment be a total of $400 if I don't consolidate my loans, or is there some sort of inherent grouping of loans that I need to pay $50 minimum on?",finance,1366504142
personalfinance,How to Take Advantage of the Low Interest Rates,"Interest rates have been at record lows for a while. Actually, they are near zero and have nowhere to go but up. For illustrative purposes, a graph of the 30 year fixed mortgage rate shows that we have gone a long way since the 1980s when the rate was upwards of 17.5%. (Source: Yahoo Finance) 
 
 The Federal Reserve has maintained the interest rates low in an effort to stimulate the economy by discouraging saving and encouraging borrowing Chairman Ben Bernanke said last month that while the U.S. economy has improved, it still needs support from the Fed to help lower unemployment. Bernanke says that short-term interest rates will stay near zero until unemployment falls to 6.5 percent. Forecasters expect that won't happen sooner than 2015. (Source: NPR News)
Do you feel like you should be doing something to take advantage of the interest rates at record low? Probably.  
Whether you want to save, spend or invest, consider your options and choose the strategies that best suit your particular financial circumstances. Here are five tips for low-interest-rate periods:
1.	Consolidate debt. With interest rates at historic lows, it makes sense to consolidate debt into one low-interest loan. For example, if you have outstanding balances on several credit cards, consider transferring those balances to one credit card with the lowest interest rate. If you qualify, it may be a good time to apply for a home equity line of credit to consolidate debt or make a home improvement.
2.	Shop around for credit cards with the best interest rates. You may be able to get one with better terms than the one you are currently using. Or, ask your credit card issuer to lower your interest rate to make it more competitive.
3.	Make large purchases now. If you've been thinking of making a major purchase like a house or a car, today's low-interest rates make it a good time to finance big-ticket items. However, make sure you have a good credit record and can pay off the loan before applying.
4.	Order a free copy of your credit report. Review the report carefully to verify its accuracy and dispute any errors. Errors in your credit report may affect your credit score, and higher credit scores can mean lower interest rates. If your score is lower than you'd like, pay down your balances and pay bills on time to raise your score. Read more about What to do if you are a victim of identity theft. 
5.	Keep saving. Just because standard savings accounts aren't paying a lot of interest now doesn't mean you should stop saving for your future. Your savings will still accrue, you'll be less likely to spend it and you know it will be safe. If you can afford to lock up your money for a while, longer-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) typically pay the highest interest rates. Specifically, Market Linked CDs are an extremely effective and popular solution as they are the only financial product that combines the guaranteed return of your principal and the protection of FDIC Insurance with the potential to earn reasonable rates of return.
In conclusion, although interest rates are at historic lows, it is important to ensure that whatever your strategy is, it makes sense in your particular situation. It’s probably not a great idea to buy an overpriced home now just because mortgage rates are low. Neither is it a good idea to acquire more debt just because it is cheaper to do so. 
In any economic environment, the strategy that will ultimately bring you closer to financial freedom is one that focuses on debt elimination and creating tax-free income.",finance,1366673441
personalfinance,Student loans- what to do government loans aren't enough to afford college?,"Ok, I am a sophomore in college. I commute to school, and each year my tuition is just over 10k (for both semesters). My first two years, my dad was able to use savings to help me pay, and this semester that is currently ending was the first time I had to take out loans. Because I did not take any loans out in the fall, that money was given to me for my winter semester. The problem now, is that FASFA and my school have awarded me some unsub and sub federal direct loans, but it is about 2.5k short for each semester. Now you may be saying that is easy to pay out of pocket but...

- my dad, while making good money, just recently experienced a drop in income
- my dad had to co-sign and pay interest on my sister's loans, and her loans are around 20k a semester ( I hope I made a wise decision to commute to class...)
- I make a bit over minimum wage, but hours are scarce.


Now I plan on saving, and looking for a new job, but in case I still don't have enough, my financial aid officer suggested a parent plus loan. I plan on doing research on this avenue, but I was wondering if there was any other options. I've applied for scholarships, but I'm not planning around the possibility of receiving them.",finance,1366666185
personalfinance,Need some help getting started with breaking down my debt.,"I’ve fucked up big time regarding all of my finances for several years and now I’m just realizing how much it’s biting me in the ass. I haven’t filed my tax return in the past two years due to them seizing my 2010 refund. They have yet to start garnishing my wages. I’ve completely ignored everything and I realize it’s time to catch up. I’ve spent the past month or so reading about repairing my credit and getting back on track, but I need some help in where to start.


Current take home salary varies from $3400-$3800/month. I budget using the $3400 value and anything extra is a bonus.

Savings is at ~$6K in an emergency fund and $1.5K in a separate account.

I do have a 401K valued at $11K. I’d rather not touch this.

I don't have many current bills (car + a few small ones), but that is due to change soon as I need to find a new place to live. My estimated cost for purchasing new (used) things that I will need for a new place to live is at ~2.5K. An exact breakdown of my monthly bills:

-Car - I’m in trouble with this one and screwed myself. It’s worth $13.5K (NADA guide), but I owe $15.4K on the loan. The car also needs about $2K in maintenance work. It has a ridiculous interest rate of 11.4% due to my poor credit. Current monthly payment is $370, insurance is $290 due to past transgressions, and gas is $120. I normally pay at least $50/month more than minimum on the car payment. I realize this is a huge money pit and I need to find a new situation for transportation. I currently live in CT and public transportation unfortunately isn’t an option.

-And other miscellaneous monthly bills total no more than $30.

For the future, I have to plan on budgeting a minimum of $550/month for rent and utilities. I’m having a lot of difficulty finding places in the area for that price, but I’m continuing my search. Most places I’m finding are averaging $750-850/month.


Past due loans (all student loans) are all in default and where I have already prioritized working with creditors, collection agencies, and the government in order to rehab the loans. Here’s a breakdown of those:

Collection Agency, $1,496, remains on record until 05/16

Collection Agency, $2,530, remains on record until 05/16

Collection Agency, $5,006, remains on record until 05/16

Collection Agency, $7,866, remains on record until 05/16

Sallie Mae, $1,046, claimed filed with government, on record until 07/15

Sallie Mae, $1,579, claimed filed with government, on record until 07/15

Sallie Mae, $3,500, claimed filed with government, on record until 07/15

Sallie Mae, charged-off, $11,472 written off, $8,002 past due, on record until 11/14

Sallie Mae, $5,500, claimed filed with government, on record until 07/15


My question is where should I begin? My gut tells me to cash out some of the emergency fund, repair the car, and pay down the loan significantly so that I can trade it in and get a used, more economical vehicle. After that is squared away, then it’s time to start firing off letters and getting the past due loans into order. Also, should I just plan on leaving the loan that is expiring off my report on 11/14 be? Work on all the other loans until those fall off naturally? I’ve heard it’s impossible to escape from student loan debt and the last thing I need is to think I’m in the clear only to have them sue me years later. I plan on starting with the federal loans as they don't need a judgement to garnish my wages.

It ended up being $10,000. They just sold it, and the money will be mine soon.

I'm living at home and have virtually no expenses other than my phone/gas/groceries. I borrow my dad's truck to get to work.

investing,Can Equities Cushion the Blow of Falling Gold Prices?: Peter Rose,"[Source](http://www.theaureport.com/pub/na/15171): Brian Sylvester of The Gold Report (4/19/13)

The recent fall in precious metals prices has investors on edge. Many precious metals equities were hurting even before the latest precious metals drop. In this interview with The Gold Report, Peter Rose, head of mining research with Fox-Davies Capital Ltd. in London, provides a European perspective on mining and advises looking at under-appreciated jurisdictions (think Europe) and neglected metals like tin, lead and zinc.

The Gold Report: Peter, can you give us your long-term view of the Eurozone as it lurches from bailout to bailout?

Peter Rose: Some major things have to happen in Europe and the sooner, the better. Unfortunately, I think it will get worse in the short term.

But from the mining industry perspective, these crises are bringing a lot of realism to certain governments. Greece has opposed mining, despite having quite good ore bodies, as do Portugal, Spain and Cyprus. Mining companies can generate real revenues, exports and jobs and contribute to the financial coffers.

In addition, the European Union has good rules of law. The tenures are pretty safe, there are pro-mining interests and there are deposits of strategic elements. If you compare the operating costs with Australia, the European infrastructure tends to be better; wage rates are significantly lower. It makes for a pretty compelling story.

TGR: You deal with many junior mining companies. In 2004, the junior mining companies listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX.V) averaged 27 million (27M) shares outstanding. Today, the average is 73M shares. Why have share floats risen so dramatically?

PR: I put it down to the euphoria about rising metal prices. There was a long period when it was very easy to raise money due to rising metal prices. On the TSX.V there was always a bigger focus on exploration companies. I believe these to be the major reasons, although sentiment is very different today compared with even two years ago.

A lot of exploration companies had no hope of bringing a mine into production, but it was very easy to raise money in 2004, so they did. Today, the writing is on the wall for quite a few of them. It is exceptionally hard for an exploration company with no near-term development potential to raise money.

From what I understand of the Canadian market, it is easier to raise money for exploration than development. On this side of the Atlantic, it has been easier to raise money for development because you get something at the end, even if it may not be much.

TGR: Your firm, Fox-Davies, helps public companies raise money. Which mine commodities and which types of projects are consistently getting funded now?

PR: It is easier to raise money for oil and gas companies. People like gold and copper, and while the outlook for tin is as good as for any other metal, it is has some in-built resistance.

The funds do not like obscure commodities. As long as you stick to the main London Metal Exchange-traded metals—copper, lead, zinc, gold, silver, and less so, nickel—the funds tend to be content with that.

TGR: But gold and silver don’t trade on the London Metal Exchange.

PR: No, but there is a good market for them, and they make the headlines quite often. Tin does not make headlines and nickel is in oversupply at the moment.

TGR: Have there been initial public offerings for tin juniors?

PR: A number of them are trying. We are looking at off-market financing for them. There are private tin companies out there.

TGR: What is your outlook for gold this year and beyond?

PR: I am not positive over the next three months. India has raised import duties to slow down the rate of imports and help with its balance-of-payments deficit. In addition, too many gold companies have chased production instead of profits, and people are a bit fed up, especially fund managers.

Longer term, I am not optimistic. When interest rates return to more normal levels, as they must do eventually, the gold price will come way down. Prices will overreact before stabilizing well off the bottom. However, I am surprised with the speed in which the market turned.

TGR: What is your timeframe for that?

PR: About five or six years.

TGR: What is your outlook for silver?

PR: In the short term, silver will track the gold price. However, given that silver is an industrial metal and that a lot of it is a byproduct of lead-zinc mining, I think there will be a disconnect between the gold and silver prices in 2014 and 2015. A number of lead-zinc mines will be nearing the end of their lives over the next couple of years. That will remove a lot of silver from the market, tightening up the supply side considerably.

TGR: Is silver’s recent price weakness an early indicator of global economic weakness?

PR: No, it is more of a sympathy move with the gold market.

While global industrial production is not exactly brilliant at the moment, certain pockets are performing very well. The British automobile industry, for example, is performing as well as it has in the last 20 years. The aerospace industry is going really well, too. These are sectors that use quite a bit of silver, regardless of price.

TGR: Should precious metals investors buy select equities for growth, protection or both?

PR: I think it is probably better to buy equities than the metal, quite honestly. I think you get better leverage.

If you think that your currency is going to be devalued dramatically, you are better off buying gold or silver, depending on what you can afford. But generally, you have more liquidity and better leverage if you buy the correct stocks.

TGR: Should investors be more optimistic than they are right now?

PR: Yes. You can make a valid argument that precious metal mining companies are finally listening to the fund managers and starting to think of profit and returns rather than ounces of production. I think that is a positive development.

TGR: What silver names can you tell our readers about?

PR: The sole silver company I cover is Hochschild Mining Plc (HOC:LSE). While I do not like it in the short term, toward the end of 2014 the company will have two or three mines coming into production. I think Immaculada in Peru will be a cracker of a mine. The gold grades there are better than at Hochschild’s other Peruvian operations, and it has good silver grades. At that point, its production will shoot up 50%. You will have to weather some hardships in the short term, but if you were to start buying 12 months from now, you could make some serious money.

TGR: In 2012, Hochschild posted earnings of $0.19/share. How long will it take to get back there?

PR: I am not optimistic that 2013 will be as good as 2012. Production measured in silver equivalents will be flat. Peru’s currency, the nuevo sol, has been strengthening against the U.S. dollar for about five years, resulting in some imported wage inflation. There also is inflation at San José in Argentina. Profits will probably be down a little bit. It has spent a lot of its cash, so interest income will be down as well. It will struggle this year, but 2014 looks better.

TGR: Hochschild has been something of an acquirer. Given the prices of juniors, might it use some of its cash for acquisitions?

PR: It made a big acquisition late last year. Hochschild also has been putting large amounts of money into exploration with a twofold aim. One was to extend the mine lives of its existing operations and the other was to find more company makers. I think it has 13 company makers in its exploration portfolio right now. My instinct says Hochschild will be more inclined to develop its own properties rather than buy more. However, with the recent dramatic decline in share prices, this may now change.

TGR: What gold names do you follow?

PR: I follow Randgold Resources Ltd. (GOLD:NASDAQ; RRS:LSE), Minera IRL Ltd. (IRL:TSX; MIRL:LSE; MIRL:BVL), Highland Gold Mining Ltd. (HGHGF:OTCGM; HGM:LSE), Centamin Plc (CEE:TSX; CNT:ASX, CEY:LSE) and African Barrick Gold Plc (ABG:LSE).

TGR: Would you like to expand on any of those?

PR: I think Highland Gold will emerge as an interesting company.

Apart from one prospect in Kyrgyzstan, everything Highland Gold has is in Russia, where it has been operating successfully for a number of years. The company’s Belaya Gora mine is coming into production this year, and its newly purchased asset, Kekura, has a pilot plant that will be in production very shortly. Initially that project will produce only 20,000–30,000 ounces/year (20,000–30,000 Koz/year), at a cost of $1,000/ounce ($1,000/oz). But that is the precursor to production levels near 200 Koz/year after 2017 with cash costs around $550/oz. There is a lot of synergistic benefit with its Klen property.

On its conference call on April 9, the company was asked about divestitures. Rather than giving a direct answer, the response was it would be addressed in its 2012 final earnings presentation. I think there probably are one or two divestitures in the pipeline to ease the funding issues related to developing its newer acquisitions.

TGR: Other gold mining companies operating in Russia have had issues with, among other things, nationalization. What gives you confidence something similar will not happen to Highland?

PR: Highland is a small company operating midsized deposits, not big, strategic deposits.

Highland is a good corporate citizen. It is developing mines in Russia and employing lots of Russians, very few Europeans or Americans. Its headquarters is identified as Jersey, but it is de facto a Russian company and will be left alone because of that.

Another thing that interests me about Highland is its Novoshirokinskoye lead-zinc mine, with byproduct gold and silver, which it has always reported as gold equivalents. Highland now owns 96% of Kazzinc and this project.

We are bullish on lead and zinc because a number of lead-zinc mines will close over the next two years, and the zinc price will remain very firm. If you combine that with the growing gold production, it becomes a story you can back each way, so to speak.

TGR: Nonetheless, there is a lot of resistance to investing in a Russian asset or a Russia-based gold producer.

PR: I have covered Highland for nearly six years, and apart from a fire just before I initiated coverage, there has not been a single hiccup. Production has gone up and down, but the ore reserves have gone up. Cash costs have remained around $550/oz. It has made some promising acquisitions. There have never been any concerns about ownership or shutting projects down, which you have with Randgold and Centamin, or the social issues faced by African Barrick. Highland has had a much smoother ride than those companies.

TGR: Minera has one producing asset and two at the development stage. The Don Nicolas mine is scheduled to go into production in 2014. Does Minera have enough cash and is it on schedule?

PR: When I asked Courtney Chamberlain, Minera’s executive chairman, about that in late 2012, he said he was looking at some innovative financing techniques in Argentina—options that would not be available if a company was developing a mine in Peru, North America or Australia. There are people with dollars in Argentina who cannot use them, and this has led to the development of locked-in funds. He was very optimistic about financing.

I am more interested in Minera’s Ollachea mine. The company recently released some very good drill results. If you draw some conclusions, you could estimate that there will be 300–500 Koz additional gold there. The latest drill results were closer to the mine portal than the main ore body, and suggest there is continuity all the way across. I think annual gold production will exceed what is in its feasibility study and the mine life will be longer.

TGR: But Minera has to start generating cash from Don Nicolas before it brings Ollachea on-line, right?

PR: That was the original plan, but I think it might finance the properties separately. Ollachea will certainly lag Don Nicolas, but you might have construction at both sites at the same time.

TGR: There have been some permitting issues in Peru. Is Ollachea fully permitted?

PR: No, the permitting process has only recently started. Peru does have some permitting issues, but if you do your groundwork and get the community on your side before you start, it minimizes the issues. Minera has been exceptionally good at this, so I would not expect any real problems. The environmental and other permits are not too far off, and I expect a good outcome.

Overall, Peru is a very positive place to go mining.

TGR: In a downmarket for mining companies, Randgold had a record year of profit production and earnings per share. Where will its growth come from?

PR: I do not think the Loulo-Gounkoto complex has reached its full potential, and the life of the Morila mine is going to be extended. Its joint venture in the Congo with AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AU:NYSE; ANG:JSE; AGG:ASX; AGD:LSE), Kibali, should be coming into production late this year or early 2014. That will be a huge, low-cost producer with a long mine life.

TGR: Many investors are nervous about the Congo. What is the risk profile of that joint venture?

PR: Everything has gone to schedule and very smoothly to date. Villages have been moved, a hydro system installed and a road built. The project is far from where a lot of the problems in the Congo have been. The lack of problems might be a reflection of excellent management.

TGR: Centamin is a direct contrast to Randgold. It had an awful 2012, but your research report says it could rebound this year. Tell us more about that.

PR: I am not a big fan of Centamin, but having said that, the preliminary quarterly production figures it released this morning were quite good. Its guidance for 2013 is 320 Koz.

I was under the impression that production would ramp up across the year, as the mill moves toward full production and more higher-grade ore was mined. We also expected better recoveries as it improved the carbon stripping. But it actually produced 87 Koz in Q1/13. If you multiply that by four, you have left guidance far behind. It is off to a good start.

When the mine was shut down in December, the company brought some maintenance forward from March 2013. If that maintenance had been done when initially planned, the company probably would not have had quite as good a quarter.

My problem with Centamin is that it based its five-year plan on underground ore reserves that do not exist today. They may exist when the new reserves resources statement comes out in the middle of this year, but not today. When you get to the end of the underground, the grade drops to about 1 gram per ton (1 g/t), with a cash cost of $700–750/oz. Once you add royalties, head office expenses and such, it moves quite swiftly into losses, given my view of the gold price.

But there are a couple of interesting points about Centamin. First, the underground is open and there could be a lot more there. Second, Sukari Hill, located in Egypt, could contain mineralization. Even if it is only 1 g/t, that would halve the stripping ratio. Right now, its stripping ratio life-of-mine is about 5.6:1, which is quite high for a low-grade deposit. If Sukari Hill, which has to be moved, contained metal in downhill-loaded holes, the strip ratio would probably go to 2.5–2.8:1. That could transform the economics of the ore body.

TGR: Nearby assets with significant potential cannot find funding. Is Centamin looking beyond Egypt’s borders?

PR: Definitely. Centamin has been investing in companies operating in other countries, but it has to be careful in the short term. Its ramp-up to 5 million tons per annum (5 Mtpa) is going faster than I expected. The next ramp-up will be to 10 Mtpa. In mid-2014, the Egyptian state starts taking its share: 40% for two years, 55% the next two years, and then to a straight 50/50 ownership.

It would be wrong to focus too much on other things in the short term, when the company has a major expansion underway. Once it gets the Sukari mine up to 10 Mtpa, it would have a much clearer run at acquisitions or joint developments outside Egypt.

TGR: Are African Barrick’s social issues at its Bulyanhulu project in Tanzania behind it?

PR: I think they are improving. At Bulyanhulu, most of the problems were related to Tanzanian superannuation. It was thought that if the mine kept working, workers would lose some of their pensions. As a result, a lot of the workforce resigned to make sure it got it all. To be honest, I think the problems were driven not by African Barrick, but by the Tanzanian government.

TGR: What are the next catalysts for African Barrick? Is this one of your better stories in 2013?

PR: I hope it is. But when Barrick ran these assets and gave guidance for all its areas, the African assets never met guidance on price, and perhaps once on production. That is an appalling track record.

As Bulyanhulu goes deeper and farther from the shaft, it will have to refrigerate. That will raise its mining costs and add a lot of pressure. I would rather pay up and invest in Randgold.

If Centamin can continue at a run rate of 87 Koz/quarter, it will smash its guidance. Its share price would have to come up on the back of performance like that. If it gets a good 12-month run in Egypt, its share price will strengthen significantly.

TGR: Do you have any words of wisdom for investors in this space?

PR: I would be optimistic about mining in Europe. If you are selective, there are quite good reasons to be upbeat.

For example, I cover Colt Resources Inc. (GTP:TSX.V; COLTF:OTCQX). The company has a gold deposit and a tungsten deposit in Portugal, and I think the tungsten deposit is currently the better of the two. It had a maiden gold resource last year and increased the gold resource this year. None of the drilling has been deeper than 200 meters. It has about 30–35 kilometers of strike. It is right in the middle of civilization. The company wants to develop it small and fund ongoing exploration out of cash flow. I think it has a good game plan. Portugal has a lot of unemployed people the company could employ fairly cheaply. It will not take long to get permits; the Chaminé, Banhos and Casa Novas deposits are on an Experimental Mining License.

investing,US Mine Approval Times a Growing Concern for Investors,"By Adam Currie - Exclusive to [Rare Earth Investing News](http://resourceinvestingnews.com/53964-us-mine-approval-times-a-growing-concern-for-investors.html)

As US-based rare earth mining companies continue to battle a market monopoly out east, they are also facing big challenges on their very own doorstep.

While most developed countries are constantly seeking to improve the length of time it takes to get a mine to production, the US continues to struggle in this regard. Obtaining the permits and approvals needed to build a mine in the US takes an average of seven years — that is one of the longest waiting times in the world. In a ruthless market environment where timing is everything, more and more rare earth mining companies (as well as a number of other commodity-focused firms) are struggling as a result of seemingly endless delays relating to permitting.

An unwanted ranking

This point was underlined recently when Behre Dolbear Group, an international mining and mineral advisory group, released its latest report, 2013 Ranking of Countries for Mining Investment: “Where Not to Invest.” It states that of the top 25 mining countries in the world, the US and Papua New Guinea are tied for having the longest permitting process. Putting that into context, Australia, another large mining center, takes an average of one to two years to process permitting approval.

Of increasing concern to producers, as well as investors, is that little is being done to rectify the issue. In an interview with Rare Earth Investing News last month, Daniel McGroarty, president of US Rare Earths (OTCBB:UREE), a US-based rare earth development company, underlined his concerns by noting that other industrialized democracies run permitting processes that are far less lengthy and Byanztine. Commenting on the latest findings, he told the American Resources Policy Network, “[j]ust 4 years ago, in 2009, the same study found that the U.S. permitting process took an average of 5 to 7 years. Today, it’s 7 to 10 years – a 40 percent increase in delays. Thanks to onerous federal rules on U.S. mine permitting, we are mired in last place with Papua New Guinea for the second year in a row. Meanwhile, other mining nations are leveraging their mineral resources to fuel manufacturing, drive economic growth, and create jobs without sacrificing environmental protections.”

The consequences are dire

This mindset has not only been reserved for investors and mining executives. At the 2012 Alaska Strategic and Critical Minerals Summit last November, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), advised attendees that it was time to make a “yes” or “no” decision on permit applications, adding, “[i]t has persisted as an unfortunate reality for nearly every project in the country and the consequences are really dire.”

“Rare earths garner many of the headlines, but we need to look at the bigger picture,” said Murkowski. “We are 100-percent-dependent on foreign sources of 18 other minerals and more than 50-percent-dependent on foreign sources for some 25 others.”

What makes this scenario even more puzzling from an investor standpoint is that these increased delays are coming at a time when many in Washington have expressed concerns about the potential risks of the United States’ overreliance on other countries to supply rare earth elements (REEs).

That was highlighted in the Department of Energy’s (DOE) December 2011 Critical Materials Strategy document, which notes that supply challenges for five rare earth metals (dysprosium, terbium, europium, neodymium and yttrium) are likely to affect clean energy technology deployment in the coming years. That proved to be such a real concern that the DOE announced earlier this year that it will allocate up to $120 million for the creation of a rare earths research facility aimed at decreasing the country’s dependence on REEs from China.

A benefit to all

While investors continue to be frustrated by drawn-out wait times, a new study suggests that streamlining these processes would benefit REE producers and investors, as well as taxpayers. A study commissioned by the National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA) suggests that states with rare earth resources could improve revenue by $724 million, add approximately 3,600 well-paid jobs and increase gross state domestic product by almost $40 billion.

“With economic and military demand likely to grow in the next few years, the United States must reform its mine permit process and safety regulations to take advantage of the vast underground store of raw materials that could drive growth, add jobs and bring revenue to state budgets,” Tom Tanton, author of the report, told the NCPA.

“Non-governmental organizations and environmental groups create additional challenges, which delay project approval,” states the report. “Currently, mines in Arizona, California and Wyoming are facing multiyear delays in the development of rare earth resources.”

It adds that the US should be trying to model Australia and Canada’s successful regulations and should aim to dramatically reduce domestic permitting times.

“The federal government should consider a trade mission to both countries to discover how they permit mines in one-fourth the time it takes in the United States, while meeting similar worker safety and environmental protection goals,” it notes. Among the potential benefits of rare earth mining in the US, the report named the creation of 1,000 potential jobs and state revenue of $160 million in Alaska; 1,150 jobs and state revenue of $250 million in Nebraska; 430 jobs and $116 million in state revenue in Illinois; and 600 jobs and state revenue of $90 million in Wyoming.

“A key issue for the country’s future economic growth”

The issue of delays came to a head recently when the National Mining Association (NMA) came before a congressional subcommittee to question whether US mining really needs HR 761, the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013. Hal Quinn, CEO of the NMA, told the House Subcommittee on Energy and Minerals Resources that the measure “addresses a key issue for the country’s future economic growth and manufacturing revival: the painfully slow permitting process for the miners that supply metals and minerals essential for our basic industries, our national defense and the consumer product we use,” according to a report by Mineweb.

“Overall, when view through the lens of resource potential, the U.S. is underperforming, a fact that will have increasing consequences as global demand for minerals becomes more competitive due to the demands of development economies, where millions are being propelled into a rising global middle class,” he noted.

“In fact, the length, complexity and uncertainty of the permitting process are the primary reasons investors give for not investing in U.S. minerals mining,” he added. Quinn also noted that in 1993, the US attracted 20 percent of global exploration investment dollars, adding, “[t]oday, our share has eroded to just 8 percent.”

This issue has become particularly potent as REE prices continue to slide. While there are a number of great opportunities presenting themselves within the US REE landscape, such as Ucore Rare Metals’s (TSXV:UCU) Bokan Mountain heavy rare earth element project in Alaska, investors will be viewing these projects with a degree of skepticism when weighing them up against competitive projects based in countries with more efficient regulation processing regimes.

An example of how delays are effecting the sector is the fact that Molycorp’s (NYSE:MCP) Mountain Pass mine in California was closed from 2002 to 2012, despite having completed the required Environmental Impact Statement in 2004. Similarly, Rare Element Resources (TSX:RES,AMEX:REE), has an exploration permit to expand its test drill programs at its Bear Lodge Project in Wyoming, but is still facing at least three more years before final federal permits are issued.

The hope is that US-focused rare earth mining firms, and indeed the mining sector as whole, will generate momentum for reform. For that to occur, the process will need a significant shift in public policy aimed at advancing resource development.

That does not necessarily mean the sector will need to increase risks in areas such as environmental reviews. An example of a country on the right track is Sweden, where extractive industries account for roughly 20 percent of its annual exports. The country is simultaneously ranked in the top 10 of Yale University’s Environmental Performance Index for 2012.

The mining sector, and indeed the open market, will not wait around forever. Mines delayed in the US will simply be built elsewhere. The US mining sector needs a more efficient resource development strategy and it needs it now.

worldpolitics,"Reality check... Whether you like it or not, the facts are as they are, and the truth often hurts.","AN OPEN DIALOGUE BETWEEN PEOPLES WHOM WITH AN OPEN-MIND CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES...

Kim Jung Un, an American educated elite leader, is attempting to send the United States citizens and the world an important message. As is often the scenario, an egotistical greed based reasoning of educated and uneducated Americans are either not listening to or refusing to accept and see reality. With an open-mind, the message is clear: The American military presense surrounding Asia, the employment of regime change focused on controlled leadership, strategic geographic and manipulated demographic sites (MIDDLE-EAST, PAKISTAN, AFGANISTAN, SOUTH KOREA, AUSTRALIA, NORTH ARFICA) all point to a CLEAR and PRESENT DANGER! The true danger being one of planned domination by an alliance of WORLD IMPERIALIST's (otherwise known as the ULTRA-WEALTHY ELITE). 

The preëmptive strike strategy was utilized and the American majority (the 99 percent--while having great doubt as to the reality behind what they were told by the government) naïvely and deterministically accepted the falsehood of Iraq harboring nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare during the Iraq wars. Thus, as a result of blindly following the control and direction of a group who gained great wealth as a result of war, Iraq was destroyed and later rebuilt by the American Imperialist Elite.

Boldly, Kim Jung Un threatens to strike the United States and allies with nuclear bombs. Therefore, by the use of rhetoric and propaganda displays to the American majority that war can be exceptionally profitable for the ruling class elitists or exponentially costly; that is, if indeed the 99 percent majority looks at life in American society with an open-mind, they will clearly see that Kim Jung Un is not suicidal, but rather an alarmist who is fearful of the Imperailist strategy. An in your face and up yours strategy by Kim Jung Un that successfully negates the United States preëmptive strike policy and alerts the world majority to a focus on REAL EVIL.

The same EVIL that has caused HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DEATH DURING WARS---not the deaths of the elite, but rather the deaths of your personal blood-line family ancestry. Throughout history, ROYALTY, RELIGIOUS LEADERS,and the WEALTHY have enriched their cause through war and through the suffering of the common man's family (always proclaiming that it's for the better good of society). 

Utilizing the strategy of mind-contol techniques (mostly electro-magnaetic radiation) and propoganda, today, the Great Financial Institutions/BANKS (the one's that were bailed out while we were sold out) along with CORPORATE ELITE, MILITARY ELITE and Government puppets, send you to death to protect their paradise on earth at the expense of your HELL on earth!

There are many rumors afloat stating the strategy/intent is to have 90 percent less. (read that as you may) Is that 90 percent less humans on earth or 90 percent less wealth in the hands of the elite? 

Again, ask yourself-Who has the real power to mandate? Because China and Russia border North Korea, the same American Ruling Class, of whom from the American Revolution onward, always sends the common-man to death on the battlefield, will hold tight for the time being. At present, their (the Elite) life and livelihood is at stake! War strategy for (New World Order) global domination does not happen overnight. Decades of preparation and planning are at stake... 

The the Federal Reserve, the American Dollar, the Corporate Elite, the Military Elite, the Executive Branch Elite and the billionaire's $3805/hr/24/7 for the next 30 years (1 billion dollars net worth) (assets-liabilities=net-worth) sell everything, pay off everybody and what you have left over is networth...livelihood is in great jeopardy.

SIMPLIFIED FOR THE SIMPLE-MINDED or CLOSED-MINDED MAJORITY--with an ability to stash away $91,000 per day, could you SURVIVE NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL or CHEMICAL WAR?

As a war based economy, America has always relied on war. With an unfunded 123 TRILLION DOLLAR UNFUNDED LIABILITY or a $1,089,000 LAX LIABILITY PER TAX PAYER the Elite is in desperate need of a VERY LARGE WAR. goto: National Debt Clock bottom Ironically, cause and effect of a preëmptive strike policy and strategy seems to come and go with profit potential.

Warning...BEWARE! The control strategy behind Miranda rights and Enemy Combatant rights is not intended for the few, but is intended for the 10,000's, 100,000's, or 1,000.000's of whom are about to take to the streets and demand change. (RISKS OF INCARCERATION WITHOUT RIGHTS IS PRESENT PLACE) 

America's future freedom and intellect depend on a United States majority which demonstrates by peaceful means or by use of force, the people's resolve of clear and present demonstration. A majority of which no longer tolerates an upper-class and Eliteist system driven by greed at the expense of all others.

Neither control of the masses thorough outdated mythological based religions, nor expectations that the average person must suffer at the expense of grandeur, will be tolerated.

Every team has submitted two candidates from it's roster as choices for the tournament style voting.  We have made a group on facebook entitled- Yip 2014.  For those of you on this subreddit who may play EA's NHL game franchise, or who are just fed up with EA's nonsense as of late with any of their games, this is the gaming community's chance to say something back to them.  Yip, putting it nicely, is not one of the better know players in the league (He's a Nashville Predator, for those who don't even know that much about him), and he's far from the Superstar player EA usually has grace the cover.  What a great message it would send to EA if our collective votes decided that a 4th line player who virtually no one has heard of, makes the cover.  Think about kids that buy the game just because there's some big name, superstar, recognizable player on the cover.  No, this probably won't mean much to EA.  But I can bet they won't be too happy about having to put a player on the cover that most casual fans of the game didn't even know existed, and there's the possible threat that a player not easily recognized (In Yip's case, not at all recognized) by the casual NHL fan or NHL video game fan, could cause them to take a hit in sales, which is, as we all know, the only threat EA would take seriously enough to do something about; if people stopped buying their games.  We aren't asking for a lot, you don't even have to join the group if you don't want to, all we're asking, is that if and when NHL fans go to vote on the cover athlete, they vote for Brandon Yip.  Hopefully we can spread the message, and in the event of a minor miracle, we can secure this win and give EA a little taste of their own medicine back, so to speak.

personalfinance,Credit repair strategy - how to do it without shooting myself in the foot?,"I'm a recent divorcee looking to rebuild my credit. Right now I'm unemployed but have unemployment coming in, as well as some savings. It looks like I will be moving come October, and my credit score right now is about 543, down from 580. My ex-spouse had a major spending problem, and at some points we were barely able to afford food and rent.

I'm trying to devise a repair strategy that will help me do this. 

I've got $35k in student loans that are on unemployment deferment for the next 6 months, this is the first time they've been deferred. Because of the divorce I had to drop out of school and I'll probably wind up paying out of pocket for at least one semester until I can get my federal financial aid back (I lost it because I did not complete enough credits in a year, again with the divorce I was pretty much gone mentally).

I don't have any open credit cards, lines of credit, or loans besides the student loans. With being unemployed, I'm not sure how to go about this, and in my line of work a bad credit score can keep me from getting jobs (turning it into a Catch-22 situation).

personalfinance,I’m almost out of debt. Critique my long term financial plans!,"I graduated school about 3 years ago with just under 100k in student loans. I am 28 and luckily I have a great and stable job ($125,000+/year). I have been really focused on paying these loans over the last few years. I can now finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. After I finish paying them off, I am going to have a quite a bit of extra money every month, and I would like someone else’s input on what I should be doing with it.
First, here is where I currently stand on my debt:

* Federal Loan: $5149, ($1489 at 6.55% APR, 3660 at 2.14%)
* State Loan: $766, 5.0% APR
* Private Loan: $4444, 3.0% APR
* Car: $2045, around a 3.3% APR, will be fully paid in December.
* Rent + Utilities: $850ish per month
*

As far as work goes, every year I max out my 401k. I did this as soon as I started working. I figured since I was not used to having money, I would not miss it if I didn’t see it. Over the last 2 years I have usually paid about $2500 on my student loans every month. I have been paying more lately as I have been able to pick up a ton of extra hours at work (this will be ending shortly). In the next few weeks I will pay off the highest interest loan, my federal loan at 6.55%. I am also planning on paying off the state loan at 5% as well. That will just leave me with the lower interest private loan and the low interest federal loan. The low interest federal will go away quickly too, as I am locked in a payment plan of about $750/month.
So, here are a few questions. Should I start to invest and just take forever to pay back my lower interest private student loan? I only pay about $70/month on it. It seems that I can do better than 3% with most mutual funds.

* Assuming that I have an extra $2500 each month here are my plans.
* Car – 300 – I want to save away about $300 every month to put in a fund for a car. I will own mine in December, but I don’t expect it to last a whole lot longer. 
* Microinvesting – 500 – be it lendingclub, or something similar to it.
* Vanguard Account – 500 - I plan on opening an account soon and investing in some of the more stable and dividend paying mutual funds available.
* Blue Chips* – 500 – I also plan on investing in some of the more stable blue chip companies as well.
* Hobbies – 500 – I have a few rather expensive hobbies. I also want to reward myself a bit.
* Riskier Stocks* – 200 – I am planning on setting aside a bit to invest in some riskier stocks or start ups.
* *these will be a rolling amount. I probably won’t only invest 500 in a blue chip, as I am guaranteed to lose about $15 in buy/sell fees. I’ll probably buy one every 2 or 3 months after I have a decent amount of money accumulated.
*

So, can anyone offer me any advice on my intermediate / long term plan? I know that everyone here is going to mention an IRA, but I really don’t want to put any money into one right now. I am still young, and in another 5 years or so, I might want to open a business or buy a house. In years, I can sell off my shares in a mutual fund or a blue chip company in a matter of minutes (and hopefully at a profit). At this point in my life, I don’t want to put any more money away that I can’t touch than I already do with my 401k. As I mentioned earlier, I am still pretty young, so I don’t have any problems playing a little risky with my investments. 

Also, I have about $9,000 put away in an emergency fund, which can certainly last me a while once my loans are killed off.

Thanks for any help!

personalfinance,Saving money vs paying down student loans,"It appears I am in need of some advice on managing my money and student loans. Let me break it all down for you. 

I have 84k total in private student loans, this is broken into 3 loans, one is for about 21k at 11% (bad I know), the other is 32k at 10.5%, and the last is about 29k at 7.75%. I don't have many expenses, rent is around $700 with utilities, auto insurance is $100, some federal loans at $260, phone bill is $60, and credit card is usually about $75. I bring in around 2800 a month.

My private loans require a minimum of $923 monthly. I usually pay 1150. After a couple of bonuses at work and tax returns I have been able to save about $13K and I usually have around $5000 in my checking. 

I always thought it was important to save money first and foremost but a conversation with a friend about my finances really struck a chord. They insisted I put 5 to 10k into my private loans immediately from savings. I never really thought about it but it makes sense. I think I am just scared to see such a large amount of my savings gone but I am young and I guess I can earn it back anyway.

I want to get advice on such a drastic money move. Is this the way to go? Thank you in advance, as I am in obvious need of some financial counseling.

On another note, if anyone has personal experience in consolidating their private student loans I would love to hear about it. I have tried but got turned down by 2 institutions with a credit score of about 730.",finance,1366742854

I'm 22 years old, have an associate's degree, work 24 hours a week (~$270/wk before taxes) in IT and still live with my parents. They've been very supportive. Currently, the only bill I have is for my mobile phone plus any personal purchases (for what very little shopping I do). I have about $6k in a checking account, and $1.5k in an IRA (3 year CD @ 0.3%). I have only been working since July 2012, with a couple of weeks full-time in March 2012. I'm looking for more part-time work to fill in the two non-working days I have in the week.

My money is sitting in a checking account mostly because of simplicity and interest rates. As regards simplicity, when I set the account up I knew I'd be ""saving"" most of my money, but didn't know how much to set aside in a specific savings account, so I just mentally earmark it as savings.

My question is this:
With no bills, how can I be most effective with my income right now?

- Should I just save, say 80%, and feel free to play with the other 20%? I'm thinking: of that 80% I would split it into retirement, safety net, future house/car, etc

gaming,Would you play this game? (original concept),"So, I had this idea for a survival/bushcraft game, let's say a cross between Bear Grylls and Ray Mears.

Here's how I imagined it might work:

First of all, you can create your character and give him your age, sex, height, weight and fitness level.

* **1) Challenges**

You pick a survival scenario from a list, e.g. air crash survivor, shipwreck survivor, lost contact with your group and so on.

Then you can select a location, e.g. urban, desert, jungle, tundra etc.

Then you select the difficulty level which would give you varying levels of supplies, availability of natural resources and time as well as severity of weather. You could also pick what clothes your character would be wearing and if they are well fed/hydrated before the scenario starts or not.

The goal is to make it to civilisation in a given time.

Your allocated time to starvation/exhaustion/dehydration would fluctuate depending on how good a use of your environment you make.

Along the way you can start a fire, look for water, set traps, skin and cook animals, eat bugs or plants, use plants as remedies for injuries, create a shelter, drink your own piss (of course), create tools etc.

You are allocated a final score based on several criteria besides time which would indicate your overall health, use of your tools and the environment, skills trained and acquired and the impact you had on your surroundings (you lose points if you accidentally start a fire or pee and poop everywhere and so on).

The hardest level could be a stealth mode level, i.e. you have to survive but leave no trace of you ever making your way through the given environment.

* **2)Bushcraft / Discovery mode**

In this mode you start by selecting an environment e.g. tropical jungle and you can just walk around and learn things, you can explore and pick various plants to learn things about (the information here won't be repeated in the challenges, so you have to know your shit to make it through a challenge).

If you choose to and you have the right supplies around/with you, you can initiate a fire making tutorial, you pick a method and start practising. The better you get at this, the faster you can make fire, which will help you in the challenges.

You can also learn of varying methods of cooking in the wild, how to make your own clothes (shoes or coat to keep you warm and protected), tools (something to carry the fire with you, a canoe, an oar, a cane) or weapons (bow and arrows, spear etc).

Above all, this mode will be about you appreciating the wild and roaming around nature, getting accustomed to the environment and learning to recognise things around you as more than just pretty stuff and as tools for your survival.

In terms of technicalities, it would have to be an open world third person game, the mechanics could be something like ""Assassin's Creed"" but without prancing about on trees. 

As far as the fire making and learning to cook and make tools goes, I thought you could have a ""Heavy Rain"" type of control scheme that changes based on what you are doing and is very intuitive.

So, would you play this game? :)

22 April 2013

What follows is my response to a question that was posted on the Rugatu website asking, ""What is the legal status of Bitcoin?"" (http://www.rugatu.com/questions/16612/what-is-the-legal-status-of-bitcoin).

After composing this over the course of 10 minutes or so, I realized I liked the response, and decided I want to ""polish it up"" into a better op-ed style article. Any feedback, positive or negative (though keep it constructive, please) is appreciated.

-------------------------------------

While it is true that the UNITED STATES (or, as I like to call it, the American Federal Empire) Treasury Department issued rules (or rather guidelines) regarding Bitcoin financial transactions, the fact is that Bitcoin is an international phenomenon… so, the joke is on the regulators. The American Federal Empire has no authority or power to regulate Bitcoin! Nor, for that matter, does any other ""government"".

Sure, they can issue arbitrary decrees for anyone within the artificial lines drawn on a map over which they say they rule, but can they enforce? There is a reason this is called a ""cryptocurrency"", people. They may bring the hammer down on a person here or there, but their efforts are futile, especially if people take on the attitude that these criminal gangsters have no power or place here, and simply ignore their impotent decrees, as should be done.

I, for one, will not comply with The Empire or their so-called ""laws"". Many, many others will also ignore this shriveling Empire which is withering away as we speak. The Empire's currency is weakening and within our lifetimes will break… that is why Bitcoin has taken hold as it has. When that break happens, The Empire will die…. plain and simple.

Now, here is the big secret (which really isn't that secret)…. if you look into the history of the concept of Bitcoin, where the idea started and who the early phase 1 and phase 2 adopters are, you'll discover that the destruction of The Empire is the goal of these people, and a Bitcoin-like concept has always been seen as a tool to achieve that goal. The idea of Bitcoin came out of the crypto-anarchist Cypherpunk movement of the mid-90s, and the earliest adopters of the currency have largely been people in the ""liberty movement"" (libertarian, voluntarist and anarchist movement), especially participants in the Free State Project in New Hampshire (as evidenced by the fact that the largest concentration of Bitcoins held in any one geographic region has been reported to be New Hampshire).

To sum it up, Bitcoin smashes empires…. that is what it was designed to do. The ""legal status"" of Bitcoin is irrelevant. These gangsters calling themselves ""government"" really don't get the Internet, and they certainly don't get Bitcoin. They don't understand that it is the doom of their power.

They can write all the rules on paper that they want to. It will be meaningless. Magic scrolls only exist in Dungeons &amp; Dragons games…. the decrees of these criminals have no such magic and should be treated as the impotent babblings of the ignorant that they are.

I know this doesn't really answer the question, per se. But it does bring a different perspective to the question... one which is very present within the Bitcoin community. As such, it does in its own way, answer the question.

Last week, two major discoveries were announced. First, physicists found compelling evidence that dark matter—which comprises some 95% of the universe, yet has never been directly seen or observed—may in fact be positrons, the detritus of colliding energy. Just as worms leave digested matter behind as proof they exist, electrons and antimatter leave behind positrons. Physicists are overjoyed at this significant discovery. As they see things, it clearly justifies the billion-dollar spectrometer aboard the International Space Station. The other discovery from last week came in Asia, where it was found that China’s foreign exchange reserves have reached an all-time high of $3.4 trillion. Western scientific economists, who have also been on a search—for where all the world’s stimulus money went—were horrified. Or perhaps gratified. There are two ways to weaken and kill something. One is to starve it of nutrients, cut off its calorie support and watch it wither away. The other is to force-feed it until it becomes toxic from excess calories that become fat. This overfeeding results in morbidity. It appears the West will attempt to kill the Chinese economy the latter way. China was just handed a credit downgrade by Fitch. If you read between the lines it was because they have too much liquidity, too much cash. The result: every other Chinaman is in the loan business. The official term for this is “shadow banking”, but on the street it means every CCP branch, every local business group, every locality and tens of millions of plain loan sharks are out there financing everyone’s “Chinese dream” at exorbitant interest rates. Usually these “loans” can only be paid off by raising fresh capital. Hence, a Ponzi-scheming army of Marco Polos has officially arrived in the East. Since China has the Renminbi fixed against the dollar, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is responding by pouring hot money into China, and it looks like Haruhiko Kuroda (the Governor of the Bank of Japan) will soon be following America’s lead. Because the Chinese government controls the flow of money into the country, it ends up holding tons of cash that it has no idea what to do with, and which it cannot spend in China—unless it wants to trigger inflation on a scale the world has never seen.

news,Boston Conspiracy,"I'm no conspiracy theorist, actually I'm usually the one laughing at most of them. I believe though that once we've been lied to by officials about one thing then there's no more legitimacy in anything else they are telling us. Had this business with the Saudi national not occurred I would have never thought to look at this case again, but the government outright lied to us about what went on with him- opening the floodgates of questions about what else they're lying about. It seems an awful coincidence that a man who had been previously flagged as 'inadmissible into the United States due to concerns regarding his potential terrorist organization involvements' was at the finish line of the race where a terrorist attack just occurred, and two days later after some shady business (altering his status on official documents so he's no longer a terrorist related the Boston Bombing as it originally stated) and successfully confusing the country through the media, he's ordered to be deported and never heard from again.

Convenient. Suddenly a theory developed in my head and I realized I had become a conspiracy theorist :)

We all know what's going on with the Budget Sequestration Law for 2013 in which they propose extreme budget cuts for federal spending in various areas. Its estimated that cuts for defense programs would total 454 billion dollars by 2021. The only way that security organizations could protect their funding and ensure they can demand unlimited is if there was a direct terrorist attack in our country. It occurred to me that perhaps in 2011 when the FBI interrogated Tsarnaev, that they realized he was becoming radicalized and was someone who would legitimately carry out an attack here. They saw the opportunity and allowed it to continue, but not without having an insider oversee the actual attack plans. The Saudi. They had him organize the details of the attack and tell the brothers where to go, where to put their bags, what kind of explosives to use, all so that damage could be relatively minimal but the point would be made.

Doesn't it seem suspicious that the store security camera that caught the younger brother putting a bag down is from a large department store across the street? If you had a store wouldn't you direct your camera's onto the sidewalk in front of your store or would you point them across the street where you couldn't see anyone who might actually break in? Can it be that the Saudi guy gave the brother's an exact spot where they should drop the bags- directly in the path of that camera? Can it be the arrangement with officials and the Saudi was made beforehand that once it was over he would be cleared to go home in exchange for his silence? It's possible the brother's never directly met this man and just knew him as their anonymous local terrorist partner, which would avoid any suspicion's later if they survived and heard that a saudi man was deported. It wouldn't even occur to them that this was related to them. That would also explain why those security agents were at the scene of the race, as well as the bomb drills and bomb sniffing dogs that many marathon runners reported to have seen at the finish line. Whichever government agency responsible for this wanted to minimize the fatalities and damage, but make their point. And that they did.",cryptocurrency,1366830632

You guys are awesome.  Here are a few more details about the loans I am talking about: 
They are all Federal loans Max Stafford in subsidized and unsubsidized, with the remainder in Grad Plus (Not the parent version).  So the interests range from 6.8% for the subsidized to 7.9%.

personalfinance,Being crushed by student loans and looking for mortgage advice.,"I'm 30, married, no children. My net pay per month is $3,700 and my wife's is $2,100. My wife has a sales job and makes quarterly commission that can vary anywhere from several hundred dollars to $4,000 every 3 months. I live in the NYC area.

Our monthly expenses are as follows:

-Rent $500 
-Food $400
-Bus $280
-Bills $350
-Car $350
-Gas $75
-Insurance $60
-Student Loans $1000 minimum payment is $800/month, but I overpay to $1000 to help pay it off a little faster though I'm not sure how much it is actually helping.

We try to live pretty frugally. We go out maybe once or twice a month. We have never traveled or taken any vacations other than for our honeymoon 2 years ago.

My student loans are as follows: $17,577.22 @2.875%, $21,670.85 @3.25%, $23,243.20 @5.5%, $35,824.78 @5.5%. My mother is a very ""in the now"" kind of person and basically went through life wracking up all kinds of debt. She just went through her second bankruptcy. When it came time for me to go to college, she figured I should go to the best private university that I could get into and costs/loans be damned. Being a teenager, I didn't really care to understand the financial implications and just went along with her. Unluckily for me, I got into an expensive university and I'm now paying (literally) for not doing my due diligence when I was younger.

My wife has a 401k at 4% monthly contribution that her job matches 1:1. I work for an international organization that has a pension fund where I contribute a mandatory 7.9% which comes out to about $450/month. 

We currently deposit $1,500/month into a savings account that we plan to use for a mortgage. It just passed the $80,000 mark.

My questions are the following: 

-We currently plan to live in our current situation for at least 1 more year before we start house shopping when we plan to have $100,000 to cover at least a 20% down payment, closing costs and have an emergency fund. Is this a good track to follow?

Though Nevada is known as the “Silver State,” it is one of the most productive gold jurisdictions in not only the United States, but also the world. This state, which hosts resource-rich areas such as the Cortez trend and Battle Mountain-Eureka trend, is responsible for nearly 7 percent of global gold production, according to the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM). In recent years, gold mining companies have been lured to far-flung regions, but some expect to see a resurgence of interest in Nevada.

The state has a long mining history that includes the early 1900s boom and bust story of Goldfield. This historic mining town is said to have grown from a handful of tents to the largest city in Nevada, boasting a population of around 20,000 after a span of about four years. The BLM states that Nevada has an estimated 300,000 abandoned mine features, remnants of the state’s rich mining past.

It was the 1962 discovery of the prolific Carlin trend that revived interest in Nevada’s gold-mining industry and gave rise to the thriving gold industry that exists in the state today. Considered one of the world’s premier gold fields, the Carlin trend is credited with driving innovations such as the now common open-pit and heap-leach operations.

Newmont Mining (TSX:NMC,NYSE:NEM) started producing gold from the Carlin deposit in 1965. Nearly half a century later, the company is still working in Nevada and has 14 open-pit mines, four underground mines and 14 processing facilities.

Other major miners in Nevada include Barrick Gold (TSX:ABX,NYSE:ABX), which holds mines such as Bald Mountain, Ruby Hill and Cortez. The company holds a minority interest in the Marigold mine, in which Goldcorp (TSX:G,NYSE:GG) has the majority interest.

John Kaiser of Kaiser Research told Investing News Network that he has been pounding the table about Nevada exploration for some time.

He foresees a return of interest to the US resource and exploration sector. And when that happens, he expects investors to find Nevada particularly attractive.

Nevada has interesting and unique geology that bears “Carlin-type” deposits. These deposits can span across vast areas, but contain fine-grained particles of gold. Many of the remaining deposits are believed to be buried deep beneath layers of sedimentary rock. But as history shows, once discovered, they can be extremely productive. And despite Nevada’s long gold-mining history, it is estimated that about half of the state remains unexplored.

Add to that attractive attributes such as a stable political environment, royalty-free mining on federal land, excellent infrastructure and a reputation for being a mining-friendly jurisdiction, and it is little wonder that an array of junior miners are also active in the state.

Junior miners in Nevada

Given the geology, a lot of blind drilling is conducted in the state. Nevada Exploration (TSXV:NGE) is of the opinion that traditional exploration techniques do not work well in covered settings like Nevada. The company thus developed proprietary hydrogeochemistry technology to explore covered basins. This groundwater chemistry sampling method identified high concentrations of gold and trace elements in spring water flowing from beneath the cover at the company’s Fletcher Junction project in Mineral County.

Spruce Ridge Resources (TSXV:SHL), Nevada Exploration’s partner, recently reported further positive results at the project. The first diamond drill hole at Fletcher Junction “penetrated the Aurora basalt and the gravel beds and intersected 324 metres of bedrock with alteration, and anomalous to highly anomalous pathfinder elements,” according to a company press release. The alteration and geochemical anomalies are the type that typically form halos for a few hundred meters around epithermal gold deposits, the company reported.

Gold Standard Ventures (AMEX:GSV,TSXV:GSV) claims to be the third-largest landholder in the Carlin trend. Work at the company’s flagship Railroad gold project led to a significant gold discovery, the high-grade North Bullion Fault Zone. Gold Standard recently announced that drilling extended the 1- to 3-gram envelope of gold mineralization to the north and south by more than 1,500 feet.

With a focus on the Western US, Orsa Ventures (TSXV:ORN) has found two properties in Nevada. Orsa has the option to earn a 100-percent interest in Coal Canyon, which is located in the Oreana trend. The primary exploration target is a sediment-hosted gold deposit. Last year, the company reported that road-building, trenching and a sampling program resulted in a gold discovery.

Pershing Gold (OTCQB:PGLC) has decided to focus on building a portfolio of properties in Pershing County, which it believes is an underexplored area of the state. The company has already acquired the historic Relief Canyon mine and heap-leach processing facilities. Its goal is to fast track the project and reopen the mine with a relatively modest capital investment.

This year, Klondex Mines (TSX:KDX,OTCQX:KLNDF) plans to be busy with its flagship Fire Creek project. Located near the center of the Battle Mountain gold belt, Fire Creek currently has 1.65 million gold ounces indicated and 458,000 ounces inferred. The company’s 2013 agenda includes beginning an environmental assessment, baseline studies and bulk sampling. Klondex recently announced a toll milling agreement with Veris Gold (TSX:VG), which will provide the company with a place to process mineralized material from Fire Creek and add to its third-party processing revenue stream.

Midway Gold (AMEX:MDW,TSXV:MDW) recently received a water pollution control permit for its Pan gold project in White Pine County. That is a key step in its production plans. Construction is expected to start later this year, with production from the Carlin-style deposit targeted for mid-2014. A draft environmental impact statement has been published and the BLM has opened the public comment period.

personalfinance,"Dodgy student loan collection company, a LONG rant","So awhile ago my student loans went into collections because I forgot to continue deferring them and I moved twice in a short period and didn't update my address (and therefore didn't get the notices). 
 
I admit it was completely my fault for not keeping up with it. 
 
Anyway, back in December I contacted the collection agency (Account Control Technology) that held my students loans. I gave them all my current information and agreed to give them a certain amount up front and then start paying them $XXX per month and enter into the student loan rehabilitation program. 
 
So they asked for my details (address, phone number, etc.) and then went on to state: ""So, you agree that we can debit your account $XXX + $23?""
 
At which point I said no, we agreed on $XXX, I JUST wrote it down. And they were like ""Oh, right. $XXX."" 
 
And then a little while later the representative said ""So, you agree that we can debit your account $XXX + $15?"" and I went through the entire thing again. 
 
Then they asked me for my payment information and I said I'd need to call them back at 6pm when I got home from work because I needed access to my check book first. 
 
They then told me that didn't work and I needed to pay immediately because their lawyers were just about to file a lawsuit against me if I didn't pay right then. And I said that I physically could not give them the information because I was at work and my checkbook with my account number and routing information was at home. They then said that I really needed to pay right that moment or else they'd sue me that day. I then told the agent that I HAD CALLED THEM AND WANTED TO ENTER INTO THE LOAN REHABILITATION PROGRAM, I WASN'T BEING DODGY and to basically cut me some slack. 
 
They then transferred me to a supervisor to get ""approval"" to hold off on suing me right that moment. The supervisor also tried to strong arm me into paying right then, but I told them I didn't have my checking information in front of me and wouldn't be able to get it until 6pm. 
 
The supervisor then acted like they were doing me a favor and said they'd put a note in my file to hold off suing me that day as long as I called before 6pm and gave me their extension number.
 
Anyway, I called before 6pm, gave the supervisor my payment information and the supervisor was like: ""So, you agree that we can debit your account $XXX +$21?"" I said no, we had agreed on $XXX. And they were like, oh right."" *sigh*   
 
Anyway, I asked the collection agency to send me a DETAILED list of my loans with the collection fee and interest rate information, which they promised to send out. They also told me I could log onto their website and get said information. 
 
I created an account (which really just seemed like an information phishing thing). It said I successfully created an account. I tried to log onto their website and it...did nothing. I repeated the entire process again and it didn't work. I tried in a different web browser, still nothing.  
 
I tried again to make an account/log in in February when I still hadn't received the detailed list of my loans from the collection agency. Still no go. 
 
On my most recent (April) statement I noticed that they had increased my collections fee by almost $200 over the course of 4 months. It was just slightly less than the amount they had charged me in interest. O_O So I called them again and asked them about it and they said that it was usafunds (the original holder of my loans) that assessed the collection fee and they must have incurred some extra expense in attempting to collect my student loans since I... voluntarily... entered repayment back in December... Which just sounds like a blatant lie/scammy bullshit. Anyway I asked again for a detailed list of everything which they, again, promised to send me. 
 
I also attempted to make an account for their website while on the phone with the representative on two different web browsers. It kept saying it didn't have any record of my account. He made some excuse that I needed to clear the cache and to try again some other time. I immediately cleared the cache (which takes two seconds) and tried again without letting him off the phone. Still didn't work and all he had to say was basically I'm SOL. But he'd send the detailed information I requested (for the second time). 
 
Needless to say I'm pretty unhappy with the dodginess, strong arming tactics, questionable increased collection fees and general lack of forthcoming information from them when I voluntarily contacted them to get back on track. I'm so pissed it's not funny.",finance,1366816406

personalfinance,When will my IRA be a better investment than my savings account?,"I'm fairly new to the game of personal finance, so excuse me if I'm embarrassing myself. 

I opened a Roth IRA through Fidelity (where my 401k is), in January and contributed $5,000 (to the 2012 year), then another $500 in February (to the 2013 year). My total is now at $5,500.09. As in, since January, I have earned $0.09.

In February, I opened an Ally savings account with an interest rate of 0.85%-0.90% and contributed $7,000. I've earned $10.82 in interest. 

I try not to look at the Roth IRA more than once a month, but I'm kind of confused. I know it's supposed to be a more long-term investment, but how and when will I see it grow? In four months, it's made 9 cents, whereas in three months, my savings account (with only $1500 more) has made almost 11 dollars. It makes me hesitant to contribute to the IRA rather than my savings account.

**Edit:** I am realizing I made a horrible mistake and Roth IRAs are way, way more complicated than I realized or was prepared for.",finance,1366814746

De rota igenom dina sopor, lura dig att dela personlig information, svep plånboken, jakt runt din Internet-anslutning - precis som inbrottstjuvar som bryter in i ditt hem.
Tjuvar är ute för att få dina pengar och använder olika metoder inklusive teknik för att skaffa och använda din personliga information till sin fördel, säger tjänstemän för brottsbekämpning.
Federal Trade Commission, i en mars blogginlägg, säger identitetsstöld är på toppen av sin lista över konsumentklagomål för femte året. Mer än 2 miljoner klagomål byrån fick i 2012, nästan en av fem var om identitetsstöld.
Statliga polisen Trooper Shannon Yorke, gemenskapen tjänster och offentliga informatör på soldaten N huvudkontor i västra Hazleton, sade är det svårt att säga om identitetsstöld brott har ökat lokalt, eftersom hon känner många händelser rapporteras aldrig till polisen - även om det är förmodligen en av de viktigaste sakerna att göra.
""Du är ett offer för ett brott, definitivt rapportera det. Vi vill stoppa det,""sa hon.
FTC, som försöker förhindra bedrägeri, vilseledande och otillbörliga metoder på marknaden, säger identitetsstöld är ett allvarligt brott som kan skapa kaos med ekonomi, kredithistoria och rykte, och tar både tid och pengar att reparera.
Enligt byråns hemsida är tjuvar mest sannolikt att gå efter en persons löner, regeringen förmåner, skatteåterbäring, eller kreditkort och bankkonton. Andra öppnat verktyget konton, fått medicinsk vård, tog ut lån och hyreslägenheter med en annan persons identitet.
Statliga polisen Trooper Adam Reed, baserat i Harrisburg högkvarter, sade några identitetstjuvar göra det som en primär inkomst, medan andra motiveras av en drog-vana.
Tjuvar dra full nytta av teknik, sociala medier och e-post, sade han, försöker få sina offer email lösenord och kontoinformation bank online. Andra, dock kommer att försöka erhålla personlig information via telefon, sade han.

personalfinance,Is there the equivalent of an offset account in the U.S.,"Often on /r/PersonalFinance I see lots of threads about emergency funds and how best to utilise that money while keeping it liquid (today is no exception with the top post titled ""Where do you store your emergency fund?""). I've recently moved to the U.S. (2 years ago) from Australia and I'm yet to see something as ""efficient"" as what I have available to me, though it only seems to exist in Australia (well, at least it doesn't exist in the U.S. - not sure about the rest of the world).

Living in the U.S. and having my emergency fund in Australia does have its downsides (exchange rate, delays with transfers etc) and I'm wondering if there is an equivalence here in the U.S.

Essentially, I keep all of my money in something we call an ""[offset account](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_loan_(finance))."" Basically, your emergency fund is 100% liquid, 100% available to you any time you need it. However, it offsets the interest that you would otherwise pay on the net balance of your mortgage - your offset account. As an example, if you had a $150k mortgage, and you had a $50k emergency fund in an offset account, you would only play interest on $100k but you would have access to $50k in liquid cash anywhere, anytime. The only penalty is that you would pay more interest in your next mortgage payment.

Now, I understand that here in the U.S. interest rates are quite low ( personally have a mortgage with 2.8% interest) so it might not be *that* beneficial. However, I'm currently paying ~6% on my loans in Australia, so I'm happy to have my emergency fund offsetting my interest there, knowing full well that I can access that cash at any time (with a ~3 day delay).

I guess my question is: Is there any similar banking instrument/facility here in the U.S. and if not, why not?",finance,1366783858
Bitcoin,The coming ecosystem of virtual money.......this needs to be seen by experts,"Internet technology has a history of dramatically reducing capital costs associated with certain activities and enterprises, which brings wide availability to the people.

For example, today anyone can publish a book, create a video channel, set up a website, blog, online store, or get a project funded without all the overhead of inventing and maintaining these complex systems.

As the technology spreads and becomes available to anyone, the old organizations which used to be the biggest and most efficient can no longer compete because their core infastructure has become commoditiezed. For example, the music industry's distribution ability and production studios are slowly becoming commodities. Newspapers and broadcast television is no longer the only source for news.

Bitcoin is doing this to the banking industry. The system of trust, bank transfer protocols, and exchanges are becoming commodities. All that overhead isn't fundamentally needed anymore.

But I don't believe bitcoin will replace the current system as a singular competitor, because that's never what happens when entire industries become commodities.

What will happen is that anyone will be able to start a crypto currency just like anyone can now start a youtube channel - the difference being we're talking about governments and corporations rather than individual people.

All that is required is that payment for employees and raw materials be paid for in one's currency, and one accepts one's currency in exchange for whatever goods are produced.

For example, we could have usacoin in which the US government requires taxes to be paid in it, and it uses it to pay for government employees and other expenses. There could be cokecoin which Coca Cola uses to pay it's employees and expenses, and which it accepts for Coke products. There could be amazoncoin, fordcoin, etc.

The value of any one of these coins would depend on how many there are and the total gdp of whatever the sponsoring entity is.

This would solve a number of issues. The money supply would be flexible because anyone could create their own currency as needed, as long as they had something of value to offer. The issue of early adopters getting very rich simply so people could gain access to bitcoin would be solved because there would be no singular deflationary currency. The entire system would self-regulate because every unit of currency would represent some sponsoring group producing a real product. There wouldn't be an artificial need for a reserve currency simply so two producing entities could trade with one another.

Loans would no longer be needed to start new enterprises. The debt-based model would yield to the intrinsic money model based on goods, services, and credit. Investors would buy the coins early, and if a successful business is created, those coins would become much more valuable. If there is a default, assets would be liquidated and bid upon by whoever holds the coins.

Fractional reserve banking, loans with interest, debt-based money, and central monetary policy to balance money supply with economic activity would all become a thing of the past. None of that will be needed anymore for the simple reason that money will no longer be limited by monopolies, interest rates, or physical supply. Rather, it will be directly proportional to credit and economic activity.

Note that strictly speaking none of these would be currencies, but rather they would be money. Currencies do need to compete in the market since they are simply a medium of exchange, but money doesn't compete with other money since it has or represents value. Another difference is the inflationary or deflationary aspect. It might be ok for money to be deflationary, but there could be issues with a currency being deflationary.

I'm hoping we can get some experts (economic, monetary, technical) to analyze things from this perspective to determine if this is realistic, and if so, what the implications are.",cryptocurrency,1366774520

For example if you win by domination you could start out as a very war-like society with an Imperial government like The Empire in SW or Romulans/Klingons and continue your domination of the stars, or if you won a ""peaceful"" victory then your starting government might look more like Star Trek's Federation of Planets.",technology,1366931262
Bitcoin,Anyone knows of any Bitcoin trading platform that accepts leverage?,"Investors would add bitcoins in their account, and when a trader would use their BTC to trade, they would get paid a % of interest, daily.

Traders would add BTC in their account.  They would then be able to trade BTC and leverage their BTC assets by borrowing BTC from investors.  If the BTC value falls under the trader's margin, the BTC would be sold and sent back to the investors portfolio.

It would be possible to short/long BTC/USD.

Of course, all the borrowing and the interest rate payments would be done automatically.

Is there any project like this one?  Maybe someone is working on such a project right now?  If not, would this interest you?",cryptocurrency,1366930661

hardware,Buy two printers -- color inkjet + b/w laser??,"I've been searching around reddit and elsewhere after my last printer died and can't decide what to do. I bought a [Samsung CLP-365W](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-CLP-365W-Wireless-Printer/dp/B008HSIVVC/), but it does not work wirelessly (a frequent complaint in Amazon comments) and I'm tired of having to transfer everything to the computer it's next to. I called Samsung tech support, but the tier 2 guy couldn't get it to work (after an hour!) and I don't really believe that someone else is going to call me back in the ""next 3 to 5 days.""

So I'm looking at doing an exchange on Amazon. There really aren't any other comparably priced color lasers and most of the cheap ones have bad ratings anyway. I've seen the advice here and elsewhere about going with a monochrome laser instead. Most of my printing is b/w, but I do need color from time to time -- enough that I don't want to have to run to FedEx/Kinko's.

Does buying a nice but expensive-to-print color inkjet plus a cheap-to-print monochrome laser make sense for me? I'd want both to be wireless. Any advice on which printers would be the best for my purposes? Or a better idea on what to do?",technology,1366922302

solar,Forecast on NJ SREC market?,"I'm a homeowner in NJ with a sunny south-facing roof, and considering the economic viability of installing panels. We used about 6 MWh last year. The house had a new roof put on in 2010, so one impetus is that if we do have panels installed, earlier in the roof's lifespan would be better.

With the NJ SREC market dropping from $600 to $100, and a lack of state rebates, the financial decision is not so clear. On the pro side there is still the 30% federal tax credit, the apparent reduction of installation and equipment costs, different financing options, property tax assessment increase exemption combined with an increase in home value, and potential for higher energy prices in the future (although it's possible they could drop AFAIK).

I've heard that with new SREC legislation kicking in later in 2013, the SREC price might bounce up to around $160 or so. Anyone with experience with the state's situation care to weigh in? Thanks!",energy,1366911837

personalfinance,"What are your ""10 Commandments"" for Personal Finance?","These are the ones I put together myself, using what I've learned about personal finance:


* **Be Honest with yourself and your loved ones about finances.**  - Lying will only make things bad in the short run at best, and horrible in the long run at worst.
Learn to understand cash flow, and how it impacts your life. –  People don’t get in financial trouble from debt, they get in financial trouble by using debt to augment their cash flow.
*  **There are two fundamental components to getting out of debt faster: spending less and earning more.** – If you are serious about getting out of any debt you have, these are your options.
* **If you have any question about being able to afford something, you can’t afford it.** – Sure, a 70″ LED TV would look great in your living room, but the $1400 it would cost at 26.99% interest that that store card will charge you is not worth it.  Would you rather work 200 hours or 253 hours for something?
* **If you don’t have a plan, you’re falling behind.** - The old saying, “Failing to plan is planning to fail” is  very true with your finances. If you want to get the most out of them, you need to have a plan. Whether you want to systematically eliminate your debts, buy a house, or retire, you’ll need a plan to get there. Living paycheck to paycheck and hoping for things to “just work out” is a recipe for disaster.
* **Good or bad, own your financial decisions.** – Whether you went and bought a boat, or you decided not to take that trip to Mexico with all of your friends, the decisions we make can go beyond our bank accounts, so the important thing to know is that you never want to deprive yourself of experiences, or be unable to make ends meet because of your decision to either save or borrow too much. As with all things, moderation is the key.
* **Never be afraid to ask.**- When I was young and dumb, I was always afraid to talk to my creditors, so I didn’t.  As a result, I likely missed out on the chance to fix a lot of things, and pay lower interest rate. Just about everything in life is negotiable. Ask for lower interest rates for everything you have to finance.
Don’t become a slave to your credit score. – A single number will not define your value as a human being.  Check your credit report every 3-6 months to make sure it’s up to date, and pay down your balances to under 10% of your utilization (with the optional step of closing your newest credit line) 2 months prior to a major purchase (Home, Car, Boat, etc.)
* **Pay your bills on time, not early, not late.** – If you have an interest checking account, paying early will lower your average daily balance for the monthly interest, and paying late will result in a late fee.  Getting in the habit of paying on the due date will make your life much easier and have a (marginal) financial benefit for you.
If you can’t keep your finances straight, use multiple bank accounts or the envelope method.  – This will help you avoid overdrafts, especially if you have multiple accounts, but only one of them linked to a debit card. Personally, I use a cash back rewards card that gets my spending money transferred to it bi-weekly to pay off the balance.

Student Loan GrpC: $8,354 @ 7.65%

Student Loan GrpD: $3,971 @ 7.65%

Student Loan Minimum: $1050 (yes I know about IBR, ICR, Forbearance)

Rent (to Parents): $200

Gas: $150

Phone: $5

Car Insurance: $30 [I have a 94 camry w/170k on it.  I plan on driving it into the ground, but as of right now, I have no car fund]

Food: $200

Entertainment: $300

So monthly I have a surplus of roughly $850.  As of right now, every cent goes towards paying off Student Loan D.  The minimum payment on this particular loan is $175, so killing it frees up a lot of extra capital which I can then use to build my emergency fund, car fund, and snowball my other loans.  Until then, I'm willing to accept the risks of not having this cushion.  

Current plan: 

All student loans are Federal.  I've made all payments, all on time.  I may elect to put all loans into forbearance next week.  This is a little complicated, but doing that allows me to pay off loan group C and D much faster at my current rate of contribution.  Ideally, come February 2014, I will have paid off Loan C, Paid off my Credit Card before the interest rate skyrockets, established a bare bones emergency fund, and possibly killed off Loan D as well.


So. Finally. When can I get out of here? I have found a good place, within biking distance to work, that I would be very happy in.  Rent is $600/month, utilities included (internet would likely run around $50).  I need to build an emergency fund, and though my car could die, I'd survive without one for a while if I get this new apartment and can walk/bike everywhere. This would also save me gas money, though I doubt insurance could get any lower.  All advice welcome.  Thanks.

I've made leaps and bounds since I graduated college in 2008 and a lot of help goes to you guys.  My credit score is up to 700 and I haven't had a negative credit incident since 2007.

But now I am here to tackle another issue.  At 26 years old, engaged I need to start paying off these student loans and I'd like to get rather aggressive with them but the interest rates are too high.

- 1400$ bi-weekly take home pay
- 500$ bi weekly is deposited into a joint account with my fiancee.

- Enjoys German Shepherds and coffee.

* 18,856.82 at 9.25%
* 18,400.25 at 8.25%
* 4,267.87 at 6.75

Minimum payment per month is 442.35 which is just covering the interest.

* Idea Number 1: Pay more every month, as opposed to just adding another 250 dollars from my automatic debit at the beginning of the month.  In an effort to get the principal down further.

* Idea Number 2: Personal loan to pay off Sallie Mae and get down to a hopefully a lower, fixed interest rate where I can make headway on the 

* When my fiancee and I look for a house, rolling the college debt into the house.  I am in the NY area so an average house is in the 325k range mind you.

I have been mulling these ideas as I would prefer that this wouldn't be a burden on my eventual family.  Any bonuses or tax returns in the future will be going directly to the principal but I would prefer not to wait or hope for those.

personalfinance,Financial idiot about to enter grad school. How much should I actually take out in loans?,"Hi PF! Apologies for such a basic question, but I'm a complete dumbass when it comes to money and have never dealt with loans before.

**Some background:** I worked/saved through high school for college, but was fortunate enough to receive a full scholarship at a top-5 school in my undergrad program. The amount I initially saved (fast food and theme parks FTW) has been sitting in a savings account for 5 years now and is presently a neat $19.5k. I have no debt, a $1k limit on a credit card I pay off monthly, and a $1.5k emergency fund.

I'm going to graduate school in August for a two year master's program. Annual tuition is $44k. They've offered me $11k per year in merit aid and $7k to cover field work abroad next summer. I intend to get both research and TA positions, have a startup on the side, and estimate that these will bring in $1k per month. I also have reason to believe I'll be a strong candidate for a full tuition scholarship my second year. The loan package I've been offered for this year is as follows:

**Federal Perkins:** $4k

**Federal Direct Grad PLUS:** $41,829

**Federal Direct Unsubsidized:** $20,500

**Total: $66329**

Now, I lol'd pretty hard at this because obviously it's much more than I'll need. But how do I decide which loans to take out, and when? When should I use the $19.5k I have in the bank? Should I take out loans for the worst possible scenario and then pay them back if I don't need them? Do I pay for the 1st semester on my own without loans and then rely on them for the rest of the time to minimize interest?

I’m 24, I have 60k from my personal savings and another 60k in a leftover college fund in my name. No student loans or credit card debt (I’ve never had a credit card, been wanting one to establish credit). My living expenses aren’t bad compared to my salary, so I’ve been trying to save about 50% of my take home pay a month (saving ~$2,100/mo). Also hitting the max 4% employer match on a Roth 401k with Paychex. Savings goals are all pretty typical/long term - retirement, possibly a house in 5+ years, and future kids/college funds for said kids.

Last month I set up a Roth IRA with Vanguard and put the max 5k contribution in a target retirement fund. That’s essentially the only investing I’ve done so far outside my 401k, and I’m wondering where to go from here. Is it worth trying to bump up/max out my Roth 401k contribution, or should I instead focus on investing in a personal Vanguard account? Also, I could use some help coming up with an asset allocation plan, and figuring out which funds are best for me. I essentially have 100k to invest, as I want to keep ~15k as an emergency fund.

Most of my financial knowledge at this point is from reading “The Boggleheads’ Guide to Investing”, I certainly agree with their be lazy/hell yeah index funds strategy that is also in line with this subreddit, and want to go with a strategy that fits with that. I know I want to shoot for 10~20% in bonds with the rest in stocks (with some split between US and international), but I’m not sure if I should consider anything else/which funds to go with.

Finally, I think my fund selection in my Roth 401k could also use some work. I picked these based on advice on which were decent from my financially savvy grandmother, but didn’t have any sort of plan in mind at the time. It has just over $5500 in it now, with this allocation:

* 35% ACMXX (Federated Automated Cash Manage. Trust, Money Market Taxable .65% Expense Ratio)

Now, the school I go to is fairly expensive, but luckily for me, most of the cost is covered by financial aid and federal aid, so I only have to worry about roughly $250/semester. After paying the school and being fairly irresponsible with the rest of my money (with no income on campus), I am now left with about $200 to my name.

I graduated from college almost two years ago with a degree in computer science. I got a job in Silicon Valley at a small education based start up and have been working ever since. I have never really made investment decisions before and come to you for advice and direction towards good resources to plan for my future.

Me, by the numbers:

To start, I have no credit cards and no physical property (cars, homes, etc.) and I earn an annual salary of 110,000 USD.

Cash: 26,130 USD

Investments:

- Company 401K: 14,833 USD
- ROTH IRA - FAMRX: 5,412 USD
- 10,000 Options (5.25 USD per share in a currently privately held company)

Loans:

- Federal Perkins: -4,976 USD (5.00% interest rate)
- Direct-Subsidized: -827 USD (6.55% interest rate) 
- Direct-Subsidized: -4,123 USD (5.75% interest rate)

- Direct-Unsubsidized: -1,892 USD (6.55% interest rate)

My Goals:

I want to emphasize I am not interested in micro-managing my investments nor am I interested in becoming a day trader. I do not believe I can beat the market and I don't have dreams of becoming incredibly wealthy doing this. 

As of right now, with my limited understanding, I believe I would like to focus on dividends and DRIP programs for passive income, and mutual funds and index funds for long term gains. With my current cash assets I am interested in paying off some of the higher interest loans and then investing the rest.

My current plan, without anyone else's input, would be: 

- 10,000 USD towards paying down my loans, beginning with those whose interest rates are over 6%.
- 5,000 USD towards my ROTH IRA
- 5,000 USD to a mix of dividend stocks and a funds, probably at Fidelity like FCNTX

personalfinance,"Young college who just inherited $90k, want to buy a condo, is this a bad idea?","Basic background of my financial situation: I have about $5k in federal student loans, with about 5-6 quarters remaining, should accumulate about $25k total in federal student loan debt at graduation if I kept funding tuition through federal loans as I have been.

I currently make about $2000 a month in the winter and $3500 a month in the summer (service industry job that fluctuates based on tips and business levels). I will be graduating with a very competitive major and resume and expect to be easily employable once I have my degree.

finance,[Student help] Money Market Hedge question,"I have the solution to this problem, which is as follows: 

&gt;1.
Use the following information to answer the questions below: Sutcliff Company has an accounts
receivable due to be paid in 6 months in the amount of EUR300,000
. The current spot exchange rate is
$1.15 and the 3
month forward rate is $1.16. The annual interest rate in the EU and U.S. is 3%. A put
on the euro has an exercise price of $1.15 with a premium of $.02.

Question is:
**A. Describe the steps the company would take for a money market hedge,
and compute the cash flow
of the hedge.**

Now, here is the answer, which I understand how to compute. 

1. Borrow present value of the receivable in euros at the 3
month interest rate (0.75%): **PV = EUR300,000/ (1 + 0.0075) = EUR297767**

2. Convert loan proceeds to USD at spot rate;
**EUR297767 ($1.15) = $342,432** 

3. Include opportunity cost of funds for length of receivable:
**$342,432 (1+0.0075) = $ 345,000 cash inflow to Sutcliff Company**

What I *don't* get is why? What does the company accomplish by taking out these Euros as a loan? They are already receiving 300,000 euros in 6 months, what are they trying to hedge against by taking out more? I get why you'd want an option hedge, I think, by taking out the put, but why the money market?",finance,1367179969

Some background on my situation. I'm 22 and earn ~$53k/year gross. I pay off my credit cards every month. I own my car and it should last some time more- 2005 with 75k miles. The only debt I have is the $15k student loan. I contribute enough each month to fully fund a roth IRA.

Forex,EUR/USD Weekly Outlook &amp; My Trade Setup (29 Apr),"**EUR/USD Weekly Outlook 29 Apr to 03 May**
  
This week’s events will very likely provide the necessary encouragements for volatility on the EUR/USD. Last week’s price action tells us that traders wanted more than a few estimate misses, they want to see a real shift, even if mostly symbolic, of policy stance. The Euro Unemployment and Markit PMI will serve well to prepare market participants for the rate decision due later this week. The consensus is to expect a 25bp cut to 0.5%. Other event risks to watch for from Greece, Cyprus, and Spain. First up, EU is scheduled to decide on Monday on the next tranche of aid for Greece, with the condition that Greece will accept another round of austerity. The Cypriot parliament will also vote on Tuesday whether to accept the bailout from EU and the associated harsh conditions. Spain Q1 GDP is also due, although one might argue that the effects will be minimal since their recent downgrade.
  
**Technicals &amp; Trade Setup**
http://i.imgur.com/2gBkzmy.jpg
  
The pair was in a narrow down-range last week, twice failing to break the 1.3100 level. Current price levels also presents a misalignment of price versus the negative expectations, in other words, the pair is artificially inflated above the 1.30 levels. Therefore, holding a short bias for this pair this week will likely yield a higher r/r if the fundamentals line up.
  
**What I Seek**
Below are notable issues that I want to see. Failure of either will cause me to exit or hedge my trades.

EUR
The pair is now ambivalent towards minute economic data/events, so I would only pay attention to major ones:
  
* 30 Apr: Euro Unemployment is expected to remain at 12% – I expect to see a miss
* 01 May: Market PMI overall is expected to show a slight decrease – I look for the decrease to be met
* Is there a cloud of negativity to the conditions of the bailout, or is there an expectation of a Cyrpus exit – No longer news, will have to see how price reacts
* Will tensions in Greece allow for another round of austerity and hence the aid – Very subjective reactions but more can agree with bitter medicine  
  

USD
The dollar has been the better child, I wouldn’t need to ask for much just that it remains neutral:

* 03 May: NFP – the abysmal 88k we saw last month leaves much room for improvement. As long as figures DO NOT cross below 88k
* 03 May: Unemployment – Remain the same or better
* 03 May: PMI – Consense of -0.3 or better
  
**Update:Apr 30--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Positive news from European banking sector showing high margins from Q1 investment banking activity, lowering expectations of a rate cut, and hopes of ECB President Mario Draghi to deliver (as usual), is helping the EUR edge higher. We see from price action that the markets really favor buying EUR/USD, with higher up moves than down moves.

The USD weakness. It appears that the failure to print higher/nearer inflation at the 2% target, drop in Chicago PMI is prompting a slight shift in bias from 'possibly winding down QE' to 'possibly maintain'.

Risk to downside should be noted. Once again, watch for the 50% fib level. I still prefer shorts because of potentially higher r/r now that we are nearing 1.32. Good stop above 1.32

**Positives:**

* Draghi Effect
* rate cut already priced in
* Expectation of dovish Fed to maintain QE instead of slowing due to GDP miss, inflation &lt; 2%, PMI miss.
  
**Negatives:**

* Poor data
* Low inflation
* Expectation of Draghi to deliver 

**Update: May 02-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

The ECB is not introducing additional measures yet, but stressed continuance of current measures. It however mentions using ABS as a tool. The expectation of something more has somewhat been missed.
Meanwhile, US Initial/Continuing Jobless Claim is expected to deteriorate, but has beat expectations by improving instead.

1.3230 Holds, downward bias stronger. Next respectable support ~1.3055

gaming,An idea for an RPG game,"We've all been getting fed up of the same artstyle and theme of a game; dark, dank, realistic etc. What if we got another adult game, but with a brighter, friendlier approach? I think I know a way of doing this.
The main plot would work somewhat like this: You play a knight or prince/princess, but in a collection of events you are whisked away from your kingdom and dumped on the other side of the fantasy planet. It is your goal to make it all the way across the land, across country after country all the way back. 
But there's a twist. Unlike other games where you have a health bar, mana bar etc, in this game you would have other things to manage. You would have a hunger bar, which you fill up with food(obviously) and you would have an energy meter which is replenished through sleeping. If either of these meters decrease, you would first of all suffer a slowing of movement speed, then a slow decrease of health, then eventually you would faint, losing money.
Food would be hard to obtain too. There are two ways; one is through buying. You would obtain money by doing randomly generated jobs eg. killing monsters that are causing trouble, or doing fetch quests. The other method would be through stealing, Alladin style. This would basically be a QuickTime Event, nabbing things like bread or fruit while running throught the market.
Doing this would give you a bad name though, and soon assassins will start to hunt you down. You would randomly be ambushed, more frequently depending on how much you stole. Throw in a few story fights and events, and you have an RPG",technology,1367162866

gaming,"Game: Warp, Creature: Zero(the alien). Desire = Stuffed Plushy of ""Zero""","Calling upon all gamers (mostly those who have played the game ""Warp"". PSN game (and playable elsewhere if i'm not mistaken).

Here's the deal; I played Warp and fell in love with ""Zero"" the alien. I mean...maddly in love. He's adorable..cute..and deadly. Since the game came out, I've been on the hunt for a Stuffed version of Zero (or plushie if you will.. ).

However I've almost given up trying to find one. I have gone so far as to contact Fez himself..in the hopes he would know where to get one..or would get the hint and commission a few to sell off. 

For those unfamiliar with the game or Alien. Here is a link ::[ Link](http://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/wp-content/uploads/warp-Zero-01.jpg)


For those curious about what the hell ""Warp"" is :: [Link](http://trapdoorinc.com/playwarp/)


So please, if you know where to find a stuffed version of Zero, or keychain, or backpack. Or ANYTHING. Let me know. I would greatly appreciate the help in hunting these things down (mostly something i can sleep with at night to help keep me safe in my dreams)",technology,1367142541

personalfinance,Question about where I should be putting my very small amount if extra money.,"I live paycheck to paycheck and I'm pretty much one financial disaster away at any given time to complete wruin. But since subscribing, I've become a lot more aware of my money so here goes... 

I have about 400 bucks in my checking, 300 in savings, and 500 in credit card debt. After all the bills are paid, I have about 150 to play with. Out of that 150 I put 50 away in my savings every month, and another 50 to pay off the credit card. The remaining 50 gets blown on food/entertainment. 

My question is should I just throw everything in my saving account and get my credit card paid off ASAP? Or should I stop putting money into my savings account and pay 100 off each month until it's paid off in 5 months?

 My interest rate on my card is something ridiculous, like 24 percent, and I don't know what the savings account does for me. It's probably 00.1 or something since I've never seen my money actually grow since I've started putting money into it about 6 months ago. I just have it to keep it separate from checking account in case I need the money for an emergency. I use mint and it's just nice to watch that number grow. But if I could be doing something smarter with it it would be nice to know. I've just started paying closer attention to my financial health, so sorry if this is a no brainer question, but any tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1367118032

personalfinance,Would love some advice (I know we get this a lot),"Alright, here goes nothing:

Currently I have a job where I make $47,000 annually pretax.  My employer gives me 8% (~$313) on my salary towards retirement (currently $11K) with no match required.  I am also in graduate school so my pay checks are going to be taxed a lot harder than they normally are because I receive tuition remission from the University, from the looks of it I will stand to lose $1,000 EXTRA a month in taxes and this will occur 9 months out of the year.

I live at home with a parent, no rent, paycheck is currently $2399 a month after I put $500 toward my work 403b retirement fund on top of the $313 i mentioned that they give.

I have student loans that are $74,000 and $4,2000.  The loans are both in deferment, but the larger one gains interest and it is up to $2,600.

I was wondering what you guys thought, should I keep trying to save and improve my savings (Barclays =2,000) or should i pay down the interest asap in order to attack the principal of the larger loan.  The 4,200 loan is subsidized and is not a worry in my eyes at the moment.

I'll be in school for 2 more years and then after that should have a job where I make over $80K, but will also be on the verge of marriage/buying a house (currently 23 years old, been with a girl for 7 years).  Also might need a car in the near future as I have a 2000 accord with 175,000 miles.

If I owe money at the end of a tax year, I usually wait until close to the tax deadline to send in my check.  (I don't see much point in handing the money over sooner than necessary?)  Usually, the feds cash my check pretty much immediately, but this year still nothing.  

I'm concerned about the proverbial ""lost in the mail"" possibility.  My state tax check was sent at the same time and was cashed last week.

personalfinance,Reasons NOT to buy down interest rate on existing loan?,"I have the opportunity to drop the interest rate from 4.0% to 3.25% on my CU 15 year mortgage for a one-time $1500 fee. This is not a refi, just drops the interest on the loan for the remainder of the loan period (about 13 years if minimum paid, though I do already overpay the loan.) It does not reset the length or other terms of the loan, just adds $1500 to the principal, with a resultant $8300 drop in total interest paid. No appraisal or other requirements. Home value estimate is about $325K, I owe $147K currently. I had no idea I had this benefit via the loan until I was chatting with one of the CU employees about something else, and this came up.

I have a 6+ month emergency fund in place, max out retirement savings in 403b and Roth already. I've been here for 15 years and not going anywhere soon. ""Golden handcuffs"" at my job in the benefits department of nearing full years of service for paid medical in retirement (after age 65,) 35 days of vacation earned per year, etc. My daughter will be in college starting fall 2015, and I've undersaved for that, but she can contribute with loans/scholarships.

personalfinance,Should I refinance? Details inside.,"I am not the most personal finance savvy person.  Anyone have any help for me?  Glad to add details if I leave something out.  Credit average for calculation is 694.  I thought it was up in the 720s but I think recent use of a credit card bumped it down.  

Current Loan:

Three full years in on a 30 year fixed FHA loan (with PMI) at 5.25%.  Original loan was appx $133,000, and I've paid payments on schedule, and also paid more toward principle a few times, such that the balance is now ~$125,000.  Payment is $951.xx, including escrow of $225.xx.  

Refinance option (from Quicken Loans):

30 year fixed at 3.75% with no money out of pocket.  The loan costs would be rolled into the new loan, at $4,400.  This yields a payment of $831 per month, and gets me out of PMI (if house appraises at around $165,000).  (If it doesn't, I pay for the appraisal, and just keep on a-walkin.)

Question, I suppose is how long I plan to be in this house.  I really don't know.  I think we hope to move, but haven't made plans, and we are currently not really financially able to consider it.

My main goal in a refi would be to get rid of the PMI, and lower the interest rate.  I can currently pay the payment of $951, but would welcome a lower option (and still probably pay 951 anyway) ((actually I pay $1000/mo now anyway)).

personalfinance,Allocation of Savings - Retirement vs Student Loans,"Trying to determine the proper allocation of long term savings.  Specifically, whether it makes sense to aggressively pay down student loans and cut down on retirement savings for 1-3 years.  Here's the big picture:

Married couple, 28 y/o

Savings:

* Emergency fund: $3k Savings Account ($6-8k total including MMA and other S/T investments); I'm aware this is lower than recommended and the risks thereof

* Retirement: $80k ($52k 401k, $12k vested pension, $13k Roth IRA, $3k IRA)

* Other Savings: $24k Taxable Investment (saving for down payment in 5-8 years)

* Other Assets: $8k in prepaid rent (basically get two months free rent in the next year), $2k security deposit from old apartment (should receive this week)

Debt:

* $178k Federal Student Debt (various rates from 5.5% to 7.5%) - $2.2k minimum payment

* $1.2k Private Student Debt (fixed 3% rate); ~$50 minimum payment

Current Allocation:

* $4k Federal Student Debt Service (looking to move this to $5k in June/July after vacation and $6k in October after wife's raise)

* $1k Taxable Investment

* $150 Private Student Debt

* $250 to 401k (matched 100% by company)

No significant assets or debt other than the above.  

I may also be looking into additional schooling starting next August, but I am only considering a high ROI degree (looking at a competitive MBA); obviously that would change the financial picture a lot.

Having children isn't a consideration for the next 2-3 years.  My wife is planning to continue working for some time, but may transition to a lower income job.

In the very long term (&gt;20 years), we will possibly both be inheriting money from our parents (~$1M+).

My wife's company does not provide a 401k match.  In the past two years, I've funded my Roth IRA with my year end bonus, but we weren't able to fund my wife's last year due to moving into a new apartment (long story, had to front about $20k).  In addition to the above savings, my wife gets two bonuses a year (~$3-5k net each) and I get one at year end (~$12k net).  I'm looking to switch jobs so I may not get a year end bonus this year although I should be able to negotiate a pro-rata signing bonus wherever I end up to cover the difference.  

I want to start saving more for retirement, but it's important for us to get out from under our debt burden as soon as practical.  My wife just started working, but it's clear to both of us that her job situation isn't sustainable for longer than 4-5 years without adverse health consequences for her.  Plus, we'd like to be out from under her debt once we have children.  At the same time, she isn't willing to transition out of it until our debt is more under control and I'm not currently in a situation where I can support both of us.",finance,1367254967

1.     In more normal circumstances, how would an increase in the public’s holdings of currency affect the federal funds rate?   A reduction in Treasury deposits at the Fed? 
2.     When the market for reserves is in equilibrium, what is the relationship between required reserves and excess reserves, on the one hand, non-borrowed reserves and borrowed reserves, on the other?

Bitcoin,"A note on the printable bitcoin ""tips"" to give to waiters and service folk. It's a horrible thing. Don't do it","*EDIT* This post is geared towards people in the US. We all know tipping works differently in different countries. 

I'm finishing up my 8 hour shift. The last customer rolls in. Instead of 5$ on the table I get some slip of paper which promises to give me money if I follow an obscure, complicated internet download. It's spam, I throw it out and am frustrated someone stiffed me.

To someone who has not heard of bitcoin or is not tech-savvy, you are basically just ripping them off or throwing your coins down the toilet. On the off chance they have heard of bitcoin, and on the off chance they might use i - great. But 99.99% of the waiters and bellboys you will come in contact with wont have. 

Do us all a favour and just throw them a 5ver. When bitcoin is prolific and everyone has a wallet this would be awesome. Right now it's scammy and complicated and offputting. To the uninitiated it just reeks of scam and ripoff. ""just go onto this website/download this thing to claim your prize"" type thing. we know it's not, but to them it is. it's as bad as leaving those religious ""jesus bucks"" in lieu of a dollar. 

if you leave a regular tip *and* want to throw in a little btc to spread the message on top of that - awesome! or if you know for a fact the waiter knows what bitcoins are and would prefer them to cash, cool. but it's unfair to force a layman to run through extra hoops to get the few bucks they expect for their work. 

**edit** wow im getting a **LOT** of hate pms and comments, most of which has to do with tipping in general. service workers need tips in order to survive. most make less than 2$/hour without them. tipping is not optional guys- tipping IS the wage for waiters. would it be better if waiters got an actual wage from their employers so people diddnt have to tip? yes. germany (and loads of other countries) do it wonderfully. is that the system we have in the US? no. in the US it is assumed that waiters will receive compensation for their work directly from the customers. our laws are written to reflect this. 

should it change? yes. will you stiffing your waiter do anything to change that? no. failing to tip is just robbing them of money they need for food and rent. want to change things? talk to the employers, write to your congressman, but don't take it out on the little guy

**Just clarifying: you're buying/selling the option every month, and they each have a one month expiry - so you're writing/buying a fresh one next month when your current one expires**

Just a follow up question as I've been researching a strategy that apparently has yielded higher compound returns than the S&amp;P over past two decades - write ATM put options every month collateralised by cash in an interest bearing account. I've gone to some length to detail the strategy here, please do check it out! http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1amszs/question_for_the_option_traders_of_investitt/

But shouldn't buying call options every month be technically the same over the long term? Calls will cost more depending on the interest rate thanks to the Black-Scholes formula, but as a trader, which would you prefer and why given they should be theoretically identical strategies? 

I figure it depends on what sort of trader you are. Would you rather lose a bit most months of the year and make a killing every now and then, or would you rather gain a small amount most months and take a huge hit every now and then? 

Another consideration is the apparent mispricing of insurance due to fear - data has shown that the volatility implied by options has always been higher than the actualised volatility. Being a perpetual seller of volatility might play into this fact.

The reason I ask is because I'm researching different ways to gain long term bullish exposure to the markets, whilst letting the collateralising cash sit in a home loan offset account (which in Australia, yields me 5.7% p.a.)

personalfinance,"PF, I need some advice regarding the best way to handle my student loans.","**Background:** I graduated last May with my bachelor's degree and have been working full-time since July. I am currently set up to max out my 401k and my employee stock purchase plan. I have also fully funded my Roth IRA for the past two years. I have one federal student loan in my name (~$5300 @ 6.5% fixed) and my parents have one student loan in their name (~$11000 @ 7% fixed) that I am paying for. Both student loans have minimum payments of less than $100/month, but I have been making $500/month payments on each.  In addition to retirement savings, I have been able to accrue ~$20K in cash savings.



So, do I go ahead and pay off the loans with my cash savings right now or go another route?

Another option I have been tossing around is taking out a consolidation loan so that my parents are off the hook and I have full control of the account. My credit score is ~760, so I'm also hoping I would be able to get a more favorable interest rate than the 6.5/7% I have right now. If I don't use the cash savings to pay off the loans and went this route, I have been looking into using it as a down-payment on an investment property.

If I decide to go the consolidation route, should I keep making the high monthly payments or start funneling more cash into investments? I don't know if paying the loans down that aggressively is the best use of resources or not.

If the consolidation option is best, what would be the best place to start looking at loan options?

Any other approaches I should consider? General advice?",finance,1367197006

investing,Buying the 10 day low: a back test,"I've been playing around with trading strategies the past couple days and this one piqued my interest.  It's based off Larry Connors and Cesar Alvarez's strategy about buying 10 day lows.  Essentially this is my set-up and results:

**Signals**

Buy

* Security is priced above the 50 day MA, and
* Security is priced above 100 day MA, and
* Security hits a new 10 day low

Sell

* A new 10 day high is met, or
* Price drops below the 50 day MA, or
* Price drops below our stop loss, or
* We've been holding the security for 10 days

**Results:**

Annual returns | Average number of trades:

* 2008: 45.74% | 33
* 2009: 82.90% | 38
* 2010: 71.11% | 36
* 2011: 32.32% | 31
* 2012: 42.66% | 39


**Methodology**

tl;dr: I backtested every ticker in the SP500 and collected every trade that could have been made.  I walked through each year 1,000 times randomizing my sequence of trades to return an average annual return and standard deviation. 

The program begins by back testing a predefined set of tickers (SP500 in this case) using the buy and sell signals listed above.  In order to reduce biased results I ‘walk’ through the time period, that is I fed the program a single day at a time.  Each day I calculated buy signals and if the conditions were met I'd purchase the security, hold it, and continue to cycle through each proceeding day and calculated sell signals.  

Once the security was bought and sold I'd write down the trade and move onto the next day. The end result was a list of every single trade that could have potentially occurred in the predefined date range with the predefined list of tickers.

I'd sort these entries by purchase date in ascending order (oldest first) and every trade that fell on the same day was put into a list and archived in a dictionary with key-word purchaseDate.  The result was a data structure I could query and pull a list of all trades that could have occurred on a specified date. 

I then had all the information I needed to begin the actual back test.  I began with the first possible purchase date, searched the dictionary to obtain a list of all possible trades that could have occurred on that day, chose one at random, wrote down the trade's information, and moved onto the next available purchase date.  

Once all dates were exhausted I calculated an annual return by finding the product of all the year's trades. I did this 1,000 times in order to obtain the average and standard deviation of annual returns.  Since my data didn't tell me which trade occurred when it was impossible for me to define the exact sequence of trades.  My idea was if I got enough random trade sequences I could create a universe of possible scenarios with the most likely being the most prevalent -- it was a way for me to calculate a return and cover all my bases at the same time.

investing,Three Points to Consider When Investing in the Canadian Energy Sector,"By Adam Currie - Exclusive to [Oil Investing News](http://oilinvestingnews.com/9574-canada-energy-oil-gas-investing-foreign-investment-northern-gateway-keystone-pipelines-lng.html)

Despite increased oil price volatility, crude demand is continuing to rise. That has led to a positive Canadian energy demand growth forecast as well as a robust energy production outlook moving forward.

The past 18 months have been challenging for the Canadian oil and gas sector as a whole as producers and investors have been forced to tackle a number of challenges, including persistently wide price differentials and substantial decreases in capital spent by producers.

The share prices of oil and gas companies declined substantially last year, with the average market cap for small- and mid-cap companies coming down 19 percent, according to energy-focused law firm Stikeman Elliot. Despite such drops, a large number of investors and analysts retain the bullish belief that the Canadian energy sector could record significant growth in the medium to long term. Here are three key points for those looking to invest in the Canadian oil sector to consider moving forward.

1. Foreign investment

Investors should be aware that strong growth in energy demand and constantly evolving energy supply profiles could drive foreign investment in Canada’s natural resources even though drastic changes have been made to the country’s foreign investment legislation.

Investors watched with interest last year as the federal government approved two separate takeovers of Canadian oil and gas companies: the $15.1-billion acquisition of Nexen by CNOOC (NYSE:CEO,HKEX:0883) and the $6-billion deal that saw Progress Energy Resources transfer ownership to Malaysian energy giant PETRONAS. At the same time, the government used the occasion to announce that it had made changes to foreign investment rules: with the issuance of the revised guidelines for investments by state-owned enterprises, the Canadian government confirmed that moving forward, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will be permitted to acquire Canadian oil sands businesses only under “exceptional circumstances.”

“To be blunt, Canadians have not spent years reducing the ownership of sectors of the economy by our own governments, only to see them bought and controlled by foreign governments instead,” Reuters quoted Prime Minister Stephen Harper as stating in a rare public address on corporate concerns.

While the new rules do not place any further restrictions on private foreign investment in Canada, investment by foreign SOEs will be altered dramatically moving forward. Investors need to realize that there will likely be a shift in the market as a result of a decline in SOEs looking to acquire Canadian oil assets and an increase in alternate investments, such as joint ventures, which allow SOEs to invest in the country’s natural resources without acquiring full control of businesses.

2. Technological advances and production sources

While the junior market has taken a hit over the past 18 months, impressive progress has been made both technologically and in terms of production. Technological advances have ensured the viability of previously uneconomical shale gas plays, and with the resulting decline in local prices, market analysts are forecasting strong long-term energy demand from Asian markets, especially in terms of natural gas. Many investors hope that this demand will lead to increased investment in Canadian unconventional production sources and will direct more capital toward the development of liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities to service foreign markets.

While there has been much debate surrounding crude pipelines across North America, there has been a surprising amount of support from government and aboriginal groups regarding the development of LNG facilities in areas such as Prince Rupert and Kitimat, British Columbia. The market is set to benefit from this cash injection in that these facilities will increase Canadian producers’ ability to export to more lucrative markets based out east.

There are currently a number of projects planned, and with the prospect of sizeable LNG exports by 2020, there has been a significant increase in the amount of Canadian and foreign investment aimed at gas-producing regions.

3. Pipelines

The Canadian oil sector faces a major challenge in that it needs to be able to increase both its access to local markets and its distribution of crude and bitumen to global markets. However, until now, both producers and investors have been left frustrated as they struggle to deal with increasing objections to crude distribution channels from various groups. As a result, oil pipeline expansion will likely challenge the long-term growth of the industry.

Protests over the Northern Gateway pipeline project, a proposal to construct twin pipelines running from Alberta to Kitimat, and the Keystone XL pipeline, a pipeline system aimed at transporting tar sands oil from Canada and the Northern United States to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, have hampered project development and the overall expansion of the oil sector.

Canada lost out on an estimated $25 billion in oil revenues last year due to pipeline and production bottlenecks and is expected to lose $15 billion a year going forward until it deals with its infrastructure deficit, according to a new CIBC report. “It’s increasingly important that Canada move on one or more of the alternative pipelines to get our product headed Asia’s way,” said Avery Shenfeld, CIBC’s chief economist. The report argues that “clarity on the pipeline front” will help attract the capital needed to support oil sands expansion.

The importance of streamlining this process has not been lost on the Canadian government. That was underlined by the passing of the Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act, which is aimed at curtailing what it deems to be increased use of the regulatory review processes to delay development. The act includes enhanced powers to ensure that reviews are conducted in a timely manner and gives the governor in counsel the power to issue the certificate of public convenience and necessity, which approves pipeline construction and operation. While analysts agree that there are likely to be short-term challenges, investors expect that new federal and provincial regulatory regimes will result in review processes that are more streamlined, hopefully leading to a more robust and investor-friendly market environment.

Bitcoin,Warning for the tamper proof paper wallet stickers being sold,"I haven't really looked into this... But ive seen a lot of positive reaction over the holographic stickers being sold. 

I just want to raise the issue that these stickers mean nothing if  everyone has the same ones. The way that holographic tamper proofing works is that no one should be able to duplicate them and whoever produces them should be the only one using them. 

I'll give you 3 examples of why stickers don't work if everyone can buy them...

1. You give me a paper wallet with these stickers. You claim it had 10btc on it, have the stickers glued on it and in fact, you already emptied the paper wallet before you stuck the stickers down.

2. You give me a paper wallet, I own the same stickers, I remove the stickers gently but it still tears the paper. I then empty the wallet, seal it back up, no one knows the difference and I claim you stiffed me. Everyone sees the wallet is sealed and they accuse you of stealing since no one knows I have the stickers... But they know you do

3. Same as above but I intercept the wallet or steal it, empty it's contents and then return it to whoever it was meant to go to. They open it, see that it is empty.... Accuse each other of stealing.

The issue I want to raise is stickers or no stickers, if everyone can buy the same online, there is no difference.

I could always be wrong though...",cryptocurrency,1367328761
investing,Some technical bond questions...,"With some people worrying about the eventual rise in interest rates I'm interested in how that will affect bonds. 

Say I buy a 10 year $1,000 bond paying %1 interest (and ignoring compounding for simplicity). The first 5 years I make $50 total in interest. But then interest rates spike to 5% on the 10 year. Now the price of my bond will decline to $800 for a 20% loss. The bond will lose $200 because that's how much the price needs to drop to make up the higher %5 interest rate investors can currently get.

1) My first question concerns if I just keep the bond until maturity. Then the only real loss is from presumably higher inflation, right? I don't really lose in the sense of getting less money then I invested. I just lose purchasing power. Is it then just better to hold until maturity if you can or does it depend on market conditions? 

2) Now an extreme example. Let's say I start with that same 10 year $1,000 bond paying 1% interest. Then after 5 years interest rates spike to 25%. The difference between what you could earn with my 1% bond and another paying 25% is greater than the price of my bond, so is my bond worthless? Is that what bond investors mean when they talk about negative yield?

3) My final question has to do with TIPS. How is the coupon rate determined? I know the principal adjusts for inflation semi-annually but the coupon rate is constant and I'm not sure how that's figured - I think at auction, but not sure of the process. Does that have anything to do with how they get negative yield TIPS?

&gt; Heise Online writes:
""In the case of the Bitcoin24 bitcoin exchange[1] which is closed at the moment, the Public Prosecution Office of Berlin has seized a bank account of exchange operator Simon Hausdorf. According to a bulletin in the juridical part of the Federal Gazette[2], Hausdorf is being investigated against for alleged fraud; maybe-victims can assert their claims under civil law. Hausdorf is claimed to have attempted to withdraw funds that exchange users had transferred in for trading in order to use them for his own purposes.

&gt; Two weeks ago, Bitcoin24 has suspended all operations[3]. At first, users were told that Poland-based accounts belonging to the company had been frozen by local investigators. An order for account seizure (translated from Polish), a search warrant from Berlin authorities for the operator's home and office, a search record and an objection from Bitcoin24's legal counsel were posted on the exchange website. It seems that German authorities have raised investigations in Poland by requesting administrative assistance.

&gt; As SZ reported last week[4], a charge with goods and service fraud has been filed with the State Criminal Investigation Agency of Berlin; a bank from Germany is said to have filed a charge as well. Deposits of noticeably high amounts as well as ATM withdrawals of abnormally high amounts raised suspicions at the Bremen-based bank where the account is held.

&gt; On monday, a letter[5] from Bitcoin24's attorneys was published where they stated that they were in contact with investigation authorities and bailing out all of their options. They emphasized that frozen funds were safe. All in all, the lawyers assume that exchange operations will resume eventually but they don't know when that would happen.

&gt; In a board posting[6] that is believed to be authentic, the operator himself described the charges as ""ridiculous"" and affirmed that his withdrawals weren't funds belonging to his customers but rather profit from his business. He also said that he had explained to his bank in detail how he would be using his accounts.

&gt; A few affected users have set up a help forum[7]. One of the site founders announced[8] that he had filed a charge against Bitcoin24, too. A list of 129 further victims whose claims sum up to € 1 000 000 is said to be sent to the Prosecution Office as well.

&gt; It seems that only a court will be able to determine whether this is a case of fraudulent business conduct or just simple dilettantism of the operator (as some assume).""

How to start fixing?","I just finally had the talk with my partner (not legally married or otherwise unioned) about his law school loans. He graduated 3 years ago and has never made a payment. I knew about this in a vague way but finally got brave enough to press for details. He had a good job for the first two years - I really don't know why he never started paying his loans, but I've decided to accept, forgive and move on toward fixing this. He is very emotional about it (understandably, perhaps, when you see how much he owes..) so I am trying to take the lead, as much as possible, on figuring out how to make this manageable and not so big and bad.


**The loans:** I just looked through all the paperwork and it looks like he owes, it's painful to type this, about $220k to 3 different lenders (including interest and collections fees - principal is about $160k). The collections agency that has the biggest loan, of about $100k (principal), has sent a Ford Consolidation application for $123k with IBR/ICR, and another, to which he owes about $20k, has sent a financial information form in what appears to be a first overture toward offering a consolidation.

**This is what the rest of our finances look like:**
He's unemployed and I'm in grad school. I currently have about $1000/month coming in from my stipend, which just covers rent and utilities, with the rest coming from my small loan and, initially, savings. We don't have any savings left. I may be able to bring in up to $3000/month over the summer months, but I also have a credit card balance I would like to pay down. He is looking for work but is in a relatively specialized field and has not had any luck so far. We have a shared bank account but it looks like it would be a good idea to separate our finances as soon as possible. We each have about $20k in our individual 401(k)s but are not considering cashing them out. Also, he just had over $3000 of state and federal tax refunds garnished, but I'm not sure from looking over the paperwork which loan that went to. Getting money from parents is not an option.

**Here are my immediate questions, but any and all advice is appreciated.** (Note that we understand and accept that his credit is trashed for a long time.)

- Is it safe to call the collections agency that offered to consolidate the biggest loan and discuss their offer? In what ways might they try to screw us that we should watch out for? 
- Can we consolidate even though we can't make any payments right now?
- The ideal situation, I think, would be consolidate into a single loan with IBR/ICR, which I am hoping would mean no payments right now since he does not have an income or assets (besides his 401k which, my understanding is, they can't touch). How much of a fantasy is this?

It was easy for me to stay calm earlier today when he was upset, but writing this all feels pretty damn terrible. Help!

**Edit**: Maybe I should have been clearer with my questions. I am looking for advice on understanding what it means to be in default and what the consolidation process looks like, and whether there is anything we can do to get into better standing in our **current** situation. To those who suggested that he should prioritize getting any job, thank you, I will bring that up. However, I would also appreciate advice on whether this is anything we can do to handle this in his current unemployed state or whether we need to keep ignoring it until there is money to start paying.

To be clear, as many of you pointed out, I had nothing to do with getting into this problem - and the person who did is not reading this thread, so I would appreciate it if you withheld your judgment and your assumptions about our propensity to acquire future debt.
