personalfinance,"How to strategically maximize the benefits of unemployment benefits in the long run if you live in California, USA?","How do you strategically maximize the benefits of unemployment benefits in the long run if you live in California, USA? This question is actually for my friend, but I am interested in this question too since it may affect me in the future.

He makes $100,000.00+ a year as his salary and he just got laid off. He has been working at that job for 5 years. 

1. How much unemployment money will he get per week?

2. What is the maximum number of weeks at the California state / federal level that he is eligible to receive unemployment benefits?

3. Let's say he maxes out his unemployment benefits window time period which is like 99 weeks (I am just making up numbers for an example), then he gets a new job, then gets laid off again, is he eligible for another 99 weeks of unemployment? In other words, is the time for unemployment benefits eligibility get reset with each new job?

4. My friend claims he thinks he can get another $120,000 salary job within a month with this one connection he has as a software engineer. Should he try to get that job first before filing for unemployment benefits or file now and cancel it later if he gets the job?

He has been unemployed for 3 days now. He has $100,000 worth of emergency funds in his bank account right now.",finance,1367451197

personalfinance,Consolidating Private Student Loans,"Hi everyone, 


I need some information, if it exists, on private student loan consolidation.  I've done some digging through here and general google searches and from what I have found, federal loan consolidation programs exist, but in terms of private loans what I see available is Wells Fargo, though from what my application displayed, I wasn't eligible as I did not meet the minimum $50,000 private loan requirement minimum.   

I currently have about $45,000 in private loan debt and an additional $25,000 in federal loan debt. I've never missed a payment, I have a good credit score, but I shell out about $1,100/month between my student loans and I can't be crazy in thinking that there has to be a way to lower it. My interest rates range from 5.4% to 8.9% with loans ranging from $1,300 to $22,000 left to pay off. 

I've looked into my credit union, but unfortunately the closest applicable loan option to what I need is personalized with a pay off that must be completed within 5 years.  

Any advice would be so helpful.  I haven't been able to locate anyone I know that has made an attempt to consolidate their student loans, let alone private ones, so I'm a little lost at what seems to be legitimate and what's  a scam.",finance,1367441145
personalfinance,"Should I pay down my special-circumstances student loan debt, or start saving for a house?","So, here's my dilemma.  I'm a state government lawyer, and state government lawyers don't make that much money compared to private practice.  

I owe $165,000 in law school loans, but my school covers the loan payments, provided I work for the government or a nonprofit.  That said, I can still throw money at the student loans (which are at the borderline usurious federal rate) above and beyond what the school pays for.

I would like to settle down and buy a house eventually, but I'm also terrified that I'll get sick of working for the government and then I'll be stuck in a lousy job.  So, would it be worth it to pay down the student loans above and beyond what is currently covered, or to just save money and look ahead?

I have about 90K in student loans thanks to law school.  My monthly payment is about $700 a month.  I can make that payment without a problem.  The loans are divided into about seven different categories (PLUS loans, graduate loans, etc.) that I don't really understand, but all of the interest rates are pretty high (between 6-8%).  At that rate, even though I am paying $700 a month, I think I'm scheduled to pay them off in like 50 years.

I take home about $4-$5k a month.  Although I have modest savings/paying-off-CC goals, I can probably afford to throw an additional $600 a month towards my student loans.

My questions:
* god, my interest rates seem VERY high.  is there anything I can do about this??
* how did my interest rates end up so high?
* should I consolidate all those loans?

personalfinance,Parents promised to pay 1/3rd of my college,"Hi everyone,

I had two critically important things happen last year: a relative passed away, leaving me an inheritance of around 90k in two non-Roth IRAs, and my parents, who had been promising my whole life to pay a third of my college education, committed a number to that promise.

**EDIT**: When reading the below, please note something I missed: My dad sees the third he promised as a pride thing. He's frustrated that he can't just pay it and always saw it as something he should have put away for, etc. My parents are very proud people though they have little money. Please realize that when I'm talking about this stuff below, they _want_ to pay the third very badly and I don't know how to best fit it in while being responsible. I'm exceptionally grateful for their gift and all of this, it's just very complex.

My college education all told, including interest, was $117k (I know, right?!?!), and I've already paid over $66k of that out of one IRA. I still have approximately $45,000 in one IRA that is growing. The only reason I haven't used that money yet for the remaining debt, which stands at $19k in their name and $31k in my name, was upon advice by a financial adviser that it was best to wait until the following tax year (2014) to avoid extreme taxes on that money- we calculated I would lose approximately half of it to taxes.

So, on January 1, 2014, what should I do? Let me break this down simply again:

- **$50k** Total remaining debt - 19k in my parents name, 31k in mine.
- **$45k** Inheritance left, available in 7 months
- **$35k** Parents pledged to pay (total * .333, actually was $39k*)

\* My parents have already paid $5,000 of this share.

-----
So here are my questions:

1) I, perhaps erroneously, sunk the entirety of the after-tax income from one IRA on my student loans in my parent's name, which at that time stood over $70k, reducing them to around $19k. I did this to kneecap the rapidly growing interest and because their interest rate, as a parent PLUS loan, was much higher than my Unsubsidized personal loans. (I was taking the government maximum out in my name, which is $7,500 a year). While this was the smartest solution from an interest point of view (I saw it as my parents and I being in this together) I look worse on paper now than if I'd wiped out my own personal loans entirely, but it benefited the team. So, I now have personal debt around $31k, excluding ~$1000 on credit cards which is almost paid off. **Has this screwed me?**

2) My credit score is high last I checked, around 730, but I would like to be free to qualify for a home purchase sometime in the relative short-term (say 2-3 years). I don't want my personal share of the debt, _even though it is pledged to be paid by my parents_, to impact my chances of pre-qualifying. I am on track to save at least $7,500 this year and will have no other debts (credit cards) by the end of summer. **In 2014, how should I spend the remaining $45k?**

3) While my parents have promised to pay the third, they do not make or have very much money, and have to do it just as if I would be doing it myself -- making monthly payments. I love my parents and their promise means a lot, but they will not be able to do this quickly. **Does it make ANY sense whatsoever to have them take out some sort of debt-consolidation loan to essentially transfer the $31k to their name?**

My current plan is as follows:

- Save like normally this year and make payments on my loans when they go into repayment in August or so, 6 months after graduation.
- Have my parents start paying their own loans when they go into repayment. I'll debit those check amounts from the promised $35k.
- In 2014, use the after-tax income from the last inherited IRA (probably will be around $35k) to wipe out my personal debt. Add the difference, if any, to my personal savings.
- They'll continue to pay on their share of the loans until gone, at which point, well, they'd start owing me money and paying me, which is a bit weird.

I trust my parents to do this last part, but it definitely would make me feel more comfortable to have a nest egg sooner, rather than getting it over the next decade as they pay me $35k-19k= $16,000 - it's just plain awkward. I've already 'forgiven' $10,000 that we took from my share of the inheritance to pay for the burial expenses, so I do want to be hard-line on that amount. When we spoke about it last, my dad discussed instead opening some sort of personal 401k (I'm a freelancer) that they'd contribute into instead of sending me personal monthly checks, which I'd vastly prefer. In other words, them giving me the third was their idea -- they see it as an honor thing.

personalfinance,I created a salary calculator based off of your student loan debt,"I created a Gross salary calculator based off of how much student debt you have/expect to have.

I made this while I was weighing the option of going back to get a graduate degree in my field. I wanted to see if my future earning potential would justify the cost of going back to school. 

[**Salary Calculator**](http://www.manventist.com/tools/minimum_salary_calculator)


*A few notes* 

1. [This is based off of the student loan counseling everyone goes through](http://i.imgur.com/jg7DhUs.png). Recommendations from the government is that the student loan debt should be between 8-15% of one's income. I've seen other places recommend 8-12%, which determines the minimum and ideal amounts in my calculator respectively.

1. The interest rate is the same one used for the government student loan calculators you can find online, 6.8% which is the same as a the unsubsidized stafford loan. Ideally you're student loans are lower, but some may be higher private loans while others are much lower. I did this out of simplicity, but if there's enough demand I may change things so that you may add your individual loans and interest rates to calculate out the results.

1. I've also included the graduated repayment plans that can be offered, as well as ""minimum raises"" to keep up with the gradual yearly increases in these plans. 

1. Income-based repayments are not included in this since it's highly variable.
 
*Note that this shouldn't be taken as the the final say, but just to give a general idea.*

Part of my motivation is also to help some of my younger friends to understand the costs associated with their education. I remember not paying any attention to my entrance and exit loan counseling in school, until my first student loan payment came due. 


*Full Disclosure: This calculator is associated with a blog I manage. You can ignore the blog, there's no advertising or revenue being generated on the calculator page.*

I'm 26, have no student debt, and make 33K in a modest job that should be stable for at least the next three years. I have about 12K surplus income yearly that I save and invest.

I have been told that I need to ""build credit"" in order to get better intrest rates on car and home loans in the future. The problem is that I cannot find an ethically/morally acceptable way to do this!

With ( what I assume is ) no credit history, I am unable to qualify for even department store credit cards, and the only credit card offered though my bank is ... shall we say, highway robbery: exorbiant unfixed interest rates, yearly fees, and inactivity fees. I am physically incapable of voluntarily subjecting myself to such exploitation.

My current understanding of ""credit score"" is that it reflects how much banks can make money off of you. A poor score can mean that you are unreliable in paying your debts, but in my case, it means that I live within my means, don't take on excess debt, and pay back any debts so quickly that they don't accure much interest. 

I am also hesitant about using even a ""good"" credit card because of the ethical implications. If the same company is selling easy, high interest, credit, to people who are unable to handle finances correctly, then I feel that taking a card from such a company makes me complicit in the exploitation of a vulnerable population, which is wrong.

Is there any way to build credit that both ethical and not explotative?

Bitcoin,i'm thinking about building a business on top of bitcoin...,"I'm considering building some online services to help people make money with bitcoin.  I think there is a lot of opportunity that is yet to be explored.  

I also want to invest in bitcoin, but I don't have much money to buy coins, so I figure the next best thing is to earn coins.  It also seems like the best long-term strategy.  I'm not going to go into great detail about my ideas, because someone with deep pockets could replicate them easily enough, and being first to market is a huge advantage.

Without going into too much detail, an example of something I might offer is allowing someone with a large number of twitter followers to sell tweets.  So the buyer would pay my network and send the info to the seller, the seller would send out a tweet, it would be verified, and then I'd take my escrow cut and send the rest to the seller.  If the seller didn't tweet within a certain period of time then the buyer could dispute the transaction and get their money back.

My first question is on fees.  I don't really understand how fees work.  When I go to a site like CoinTube.tv, I can watch some youtube videos, and they'll deposit something like 20 uBTC for every video I watch.  How are they able to do this, when the fees are usually around 25 times this amount?  

I'd like to be able to pay people right away, but if I'm only paying them a buck or two it seems like the fees would add up pretty fast.  But I know from previous experience that the faster someone gets paid for something the more excited they get about using a service more.  Any fees I pay out cuts into profit margins, so if I want to only charge them say 1% for my fee, but then I'm paying out like 5% for bitcoin fees it makes it much less appealing to me.

I'm not sure if I'm correct in my assessment.  But I think that if you generate new addresses on an existing wallet, and have money tied to the address, but still pooled in the main wallet?  If this is true, can I move micro amounts of money from one address to another address within the same wallet without generating fees?

One idea that I have is doing some sort of escrow and storing people's money in a new address of this pooled wallet for view-only access.  And then when they accumulate a certain amount of money in their account, say $5 or $10, they will have the option to withdraw those funds into their own wallet they have linked up.  This would would allow for dispute resolution and refunds within a certain short window of time, mitigating risk for both parties.  It would also allow me to charge service fees before releasing funds to them.  But again I'm not sure how to crunch the numbers without fully understanding how the fees work.

There are also some other things for me to consider, like encouraging people to spend the coins they earn on other services within the network, possibly by reducing or waiving fees on new purchases within the system.

I'd also like to set up some sort of cost-per-action affiliate program, whereby if someone makes referral to the network, I can pay them some small amount for every person they get to sign up, and give them some additional bonuses, for example if the new sign-up sms verifies their account, or purchase an upgraded membership or something.

If someone could explain to me how generating new addresses for a single pooled wallet, that would help me understand the system better.  And if I can move money around between addresses within the same wallet without charging fees it would make my idea work a lot better.  However, if fees are going to be a problem, I could use virtual credits in the system instead of real bitcoin addresses that can be blockchain verified.  My plan is to generate a new address for every person who signs up with the system.

The next question I have, is if there is some way for me to sandbox things so I can test my system without having to do a bunch of real transactions? (namely because I don't want to pay fees)  I suppose I could fork the bitcoin source and make my own currency to test with, but that seems like a lot of effort.

While I want to keep things in bitcoin, I also am trying to think of a good way to approximate fiat currency pricing to take into account the daily price fluctuations.  So if the seller wants to always charge, for example, $2 instead of say 15 mBTC, I'd like to be able to accommodate this by setting the amount of bitcoin to the current market rate.  And since it would be global, it would be nice if the person could set up their preferred fiat currency in their account preferences (such as USD, EUR, GBP).  One thing I do worry about is someone logging into their account from one day to the next and seeing that their current fiat balance is say 20% less because their balance is always going to be in BTC and not in fiat.

I'm also not sure where to start with automation; I would prefer to never upload the private keys to a pooled wallet, and instead keep an encrypted wallet on my own computer (with plenty of backups of course).  I think if I processed batched payments once or twice a day that ought to be enough initially.

I'm very concerned with being DDoS'd.  I don't have the budget to get hosting that would be willing to fight attacks vs. likely booting me from the network.  I'm not sure how to prepare for DDoS, other than saving up and allocating funds for a high-end hosting configuration once I can afford it.  By keeping the wallet offline, if my service gets hacked or attacked then they can't get at the money, so I'll just be offline temporarily while I figure out how to work around the problem.

Finally, I'd like to be able to make it friendly enough to introduce new people to bitcoin, and to get them excited about it.  I think it will help people get started with bitcoin, because if they have something to offer than they can get paid some bitcoin without having to mess with exchanges or invest hard cash. 

A major concern I have right now is the volatility of the market, where the money someone earns might not be worth as much a week from now as it was when they earned it, and the issues that the exchanges have.  In particular I'm really concerned about how bitfloor suddenly poofed out of business (apparently taking the BTC that I still have in my account there with them), making me worry about my reputation.  I tried doing some similar things with egold back in the day and got burned.

The major advantage I have right now is that I really don't need to cash out a lot of bitcoin to make this work, so I'm planning on keeping the majority of it in bitcoin.

Anyway, thanks for reading.  Any suggestions are appreciated.  I'm just trying to understand how bitcoin works a bit better so I can create a viable business and be a contributer to the community.",cryptocurrency,1367373245
personalfinance,New to the market and have a question about timing...,"I am new to the investment game (exception of my 401K). My overall goal is to invest in something I can invest in and forget about, don't want to manage it daily/weekly. I did some research and selected the 10 mutual funds below based on morningstar rating, historical risk/reward and fund expense ratio. Although I have selected the funds I want to invest in, I haven't invested in them yet, but I have funds ready.

My main question is when should I jump into the market. I am a little reluctant to hop in now because practically all funds are at or new 52 wk highs, Should I hold off a bit and wait for the market to decline a little first, or just get in now?

I have some people saying get in now, the market will probably continue to climb, especially with interest rates so low. Also that with the tax implications of mutual funds, it best to get in as early in the calendar year as possibly.

On the other hand I've heard...

That the market is due for a decline probably soon. Also, once the S&amp;P, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones reach a certain mark, there will be a flood of selling causing the a major decline.

Keep in mind, I plan to stay invested for multiple years, 5-10, so I know these minor shifts don't mean much in the grand scheme of things but hate to buy at all time highs. Also knowing my luck, as soon as I invested the market would have a large drop and I'd see my principle affected right away.

What do you think, any suggestions/advice for new investor?

personalfinance,"$36,000 in debt, monthly income of $1,600. Am I doing this right?","Hello, I am a 21 year old female in NW Arkansas that will be getting a bachelor's degree this summer. I am taking my last course right now. I have acquired student loan debt of $36,000, about half is from two private loans, and the other half is from a federal loan. I have not consolidated my federal loan since that would increase the interest rate. The interest rates for my private loans are 7% on $10,000, and 9% on $7,500 (I have already paid off about $500 on the latter loan). I know the interest rates for those are higher than the federal loans, so I am paying more than the minimum for the private loans. I am not required to start paying my federal loan until July, and I will have to pay a minimum of $120 for that.

* My credit score is 684

* At the moment, I make approximately $1,600 a month after taxes and social security and such. 

* I am paying $200 total a month for both private loans (minimum is $120)

* Rent and bills combined are a total of about $350

* Gas for my car is $120 a month

* Groceries/prescriptions/pet food are around $300 a month (I eat tons of fresh fruit and vegetables, and I prepare my pet's food myself which is why this seems like a lot of money for one person)

* I put $200 a month into my savings account (I have $2000 in savings right now) I have no real reason I am doing this though, I just thought it may be handy in case of an emergency.

* I spend $200 a month on entertainment, clothes, and misc.

So by the end of a month, I'll usually have around $200 sitting in my checking account, which is good, as I'll be using that to pay for my federal loan come July. My parents pay for my car insurance, which is only about $20 a month for me. I am also on their health/dental insurance.

I am looking for a higher paying job since I am graduating soon. Also, my current job is very secure, and I may just move up with my current employer.

Are there any spending adjustments I should make? Should some things be a higher/lower priority for me? I don't feel stressed out about money, but I think I will come July when I must pay my Federal loan back. Well thank you for reading this, I appreciate any and all advice.",finance,1367537435
personalfinance,"I am graduating soon and have a lot of questions about my budget over the next few months, as well as some current financial troubles and could use some help.","Hi, everyone! I'll try to explain everything thoroughly in an easy to understand way. Sorry this will be so long!  
  
**My situation:**  
-I am 21 years old, and am graduating in July with my BA in polsci.  
-I have been offered a job with a large financial company with good benefits at $15/hour, 40 hours a week. However, as I am not graduating til July nothing is 100% solid yet. They are very interested though and keep checking in every few weeks to make sure I'm still interested. No definite date, but will likely be starting in August.  
-I receive the GI Bill, but it randomly did not pay out this semester. I still have a $456 balance on my tuition for this semester. I have tried talking to the VA office here, and all they say is ""It will come. Your account is on hold, no worries. (hold=school hasn't been threatening to drop my courses or anything)."" I e-mailed them again earlier today and haven't heard back yet. I am using my dad's benefits, by the way. I fear I may have lost it due to bad grades or something. I do not have that money.  
-I was just approved for my first credit card with a $500 limit.  
-I do not have a car.  
-I am planning on moving in with a friend who works by the place I will be working. The rent there is $400/month each, very cheap for the area. And, I could ride the bus or maybe even walk to work.  
-I still have to take summer classes the 2nd summer session, totaling $1.3k. Without my GI Bill I currently have no way to pay that.  
-My family is kind of strange and randomly hates me sometimes because I don't agree with them politically (something I don't bring up but they do A LOT) and also because I'm vegan? It makes no sense really, but yeah I don't have any financial support from my family and asking them to so much as cosign a loan isn't going to happen.  
  
  
**My thoughts/concerns:**  
-I am thinking of using the $500 credit card to pay off my tuition.  The school hasn't been harassing me but online it says tuition is absolutely due Monday. I am waiting to hear back from the VA, but I don't have high hopes. I absolutely do not have the money to pay $456 right now. I would make the minimum payment throughout the summer and then when I get the job immediately pay this off. This sounds so dumb to me but I don't really see any other option.  
-I was thinking about getting a private loan for the $1.3k I'll need for summer session 2. No idea if that's possible without a cosigner, though.  
-I would like to save up for a down payment on a car once I start working the full time job. I intend to buy something like a $4-5k Honda/Toyota sedan with &gt;150k miles on it. Something that will last me 5 years or so and won't constantly need repairs. I am totally open to suggestions on this, though!  
-I need to save up at least $800 for the first month's rent + security deposit on the new place. I'd also love the extra $450 (100 nonrefundable, 350 refundable) for the pet deposit to bring my kitty down, but that can wait as my boyfriend can watch her for a month. :(  
  
  
**My earnings and expenses:**  
-I make $8 hour. This week and next I have shitty hours because of finals (15 and 18). For the 3 weeks after I'll get 24 hours, the next 3 weeks around 35. And then the last 4 back to about 24. I pay 6% state income tax and 15% federal (SHIT, that's a lot). So by my math, minus taxes that's $1933.52 this summer.  
-My expenses for June and July:  
Rent: $200 (x2) = $400  
Utilities: $50 (x2) =$100  
Internet: $11 (x2) =$22  
Vet Care: $30 (x2) =$60  
Greenpeace Membership [yeah yeah, I know]: $17 (x2) =$34  
Food: $120 (x2) =$240  
Credit Card Payment (If I pay my tuition with it): $35 (x2) =$90  
Total=$946  
So **$1933.52-946=$987**  
  
I also will be getting my security deposit back on my old apartment (lease ending May 30th, $233.33) and whatever money for graduating. I have absolutely no idea how much. I plan on putting all of both of these into savings, though.
  
Is that a reasonable budget? And I could really use advice in relation to the tuition payments, applying for a loan, and buying a car.  
  
  
I really appreciate anyone who reads this wall of text. I have been really stressed and down lately about the tuition and stuff and also senior year chaos with finals. It seems like everyone I know has parents who give them money when they need it, pay for their school, bought them a car (my own brother included), pay their rent, pay for their gas, etc. I pay for everything myself and don't even have my licence because I can't afford the insurance I need to get it (which my dad also pays for for my bro, who has a better job than me making more money, and lives at home but whatever). I know I should be proud that I've taken care of myself without any help whatsoever from family financially, but sometimes it's really hard not to get jealous. Sorry to get sad but I'm just super stressed about all of this. &gt;_&lt;",finance,1367537003

I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit, but I'm at a loss...
I have no job.  So I'm at a cross-roads of which is my next step.  My Aunt has helped me out a ton financially, but I cannot let that happen too much longer. In the meantime, I have been applying to different organizations/schools around the area for a job.

Without a job I am not able to pay my student loans, which are all private right now and amounting to CRUSHING debts (when I regain a job I will have ~$5,000 at least in late payments).

I've contacted a few personal financial advisors and they've literally told me, ""I'm sorry but there's nothing you can do."" 1) If my parents own the house, they can take out a 2nd mortgage and use that money to pay off the private lender, then I can pay back my parents at a lower interest rate [which they will NOT do].  That, or get a better paying job. That's it.  I've spoken with a few different people, and that's ALL they offer as advice.

Am I literally this financially screwed? 

How bad will not paying my loan screw me up credit-wise (it's been three months)? 

How do I move forward without obtaining another degree?  

In contrast, without grants, financial aide, or scholarships, how could I afford getting an additional degree to get a financially better job?

Additional info: Other bills are: Gym, Groceries, Gas, Cell phone, Car Insurance, Credit Card, I pay very small fee for rent, living at an Aunts house in the woods.

personalfinance,Student Loans: How much to borrow?,"I'm starting a two year masters program in the fall, and am currently trying to figure out my student loan situation.  I am eligible for $20,000 per year in federal loans at %6.8.  Edit: Interest will accumulate while I'm in school.

Basically, I will need ~$5,000 per semester for tuition.  I make ~$1,200 a month working part time, so after food and rent, I will have $500 a month remaining for savings.  I feel like I have three options:

1.) I take out $10,000 this year, and build up savings/pay interest while I'm in school (and repeat next year).

2.) Take out, say, $7,000 for this year and use all of my savings to pay remaining tuition next semester (and do the same next year).

3.) Take out all $20,000 this year, use it for both year's tuition, and use remaining income to pay off the loan each month.  

The first option seems the most logical, but I'm not sure if doing one of the other two would save me enough money in the long run to be worth doing.  Any advice would be much appreciated.",finance,1367529324
personalfinance,"26 y/o new full-time student, quitting my job and need some help","A little background: I was 15 when my father ran out on my mother and I. He moved in with another family (he'd been cheating on my mom for months and had a secret ""double life"" apparently), had our power and phone service cut off, reported our cellphones stolen, etc. My mother was, at the time, only working minimum wage for money to make ends meet. My father was the bread winner. As a result, I had to start working full-time at minimum wage as well as finish high school just to afford a house to live in and a car for us to share. The money we both earned together wasn't enough, and having the power cut off for weeks at a time and being evicted became a pretty regular occurrence. Because of all of my mother's delinquent accounts, we had to start putting utility bills and the car insurance policy in my name. And, sure enough, we still weren't able to keep up. As a result, my credit is completely destroyed and I have absolutely nothing in savings.

Fast forward to today - after finding a cheap area to live in, my mother is finally able to keep up on her own which now leaves me free to leave the nest and pursue my dream of higher education. I've been accepted to a decent school and just had my room assigned to me. I'm very excited, but I honestly have no idea how I'm going to be able to pay for everything involved with going away to college.

I'm going to be a full-time student living on campus, so I'll be quitting my current job. I need about $8,500/yr for school (not including books and other supplies, a computer, etc.) I've filled out FAFSA and my state's aid form and currently have only been awarded $3,000 by the state. I'm hoping my federal aid at least matches that, but as of now I have no clue. I'm pretty confident I won't be able to obtain any sort of loan because of my terrible credit, and I still need some way to get a computer and pay for my books. I applied for over a dozen scholarships, but so far have been awarded none. I think aid may be tough to come by as a 26 year-old white male.

So, /personalfinance, I really need help. Where can I turn for financial aid? I'll even take a high interest, long-term loan if I must - any possible way to pay my way through school and get the supplies I need.",finance,1367526838
personalfinance,should I take a personal loan to pay off my credit cards?,"Hi, thanks in advance.  This is an alt account, but I read this sub regularly and have a lot of respect for the good answers people give here.

So here goes.  I don't think you need my full history, but I have 2 credit cards with standing debt on them.  One is closed and I have been paying it off regularly for a couple years.  I am down to about 1K debt on that.  The other one is open and maxed out at about $3K.  I just got an offer from Discover to take a personal loan which would allow me to consolidate the credit cards onto this one loan.  I had previously looked into opening a credit card to transfer my debt to, but wasn't able to get that.

The Discover loan says it will have a rate between 7.99% and 18.99% (depending on how they view my credit, which is about 605).  Both my credit cards are over 20% interest rate.

Obviously I would need to be smart and not take any more than I need, I have to set up automatic payments (forgetfulness is way too easy for me), and I need to not use my open credit card.  Well, I should use it a little, but make sure I set up automatic payments to pay it off completely every month.

So...should I do it?

personalfinance,Pay off student loans/mortgage or contribute to retirement?,"I'm a few months away from a fork in the road financially and would like to get some input on how to best invest my money once I get there.

I'm 25 and a homeowner.  I bought the house 2 years ago, rent out bedrooms to my friends that pay me directly on the 1st of the month.  Everything is in my name, so all tax credits and equity go directly to me (as do the bills when stuff breaks, but that's a different topic).  The income I get from them, almost to the penny, covers ALL of my monthly bills: house, utilities, insurance, car payment, minimum student loan payment... everything.  All of my employment income (I make 67k annually in Cincinnati, for a cost of living perspective) is available for personal spending and investment.

I took out quite a bit of relatively ""bad"" debt upon first getting the house to set up the scenario I have now (buying furniture on layaway, taking on a lot of credit card debt, etc. to come up with a down payment and furnish the house to attract the tenants), that by the end of this month I will finally have paid off in full after chipping away for nearly 2 years.  My next step(s) will be, in order, to set aside 6k in emergency funds to a savings account (I generally spend too much money in bars, traveling, other entertainment so my monthly personal expenses are about 1000-1200).  I'm anticipating having that done by early September, and then my car totally paid off by the end of 2013.  

That means that in January 2014 I will have an extra $300/month from no car payment, and presume to still have the same tenant income (as I have others willing to rent out rooms if they become vacant).  All said and done, after all the bills are paid and personal spending is accounted for, I should be looking at about $2500-3000 per month leftover.  I'll have about $32,500 in student loan debt from a variety of lenders averaging 3% interest rate and about $128,000 left on a 3.625% 30-year fixed mortgage (just refinanced, so no PMI and May is month 1) as the only outstanding debt in my name.  

I'm currently contributing 8% salary (with 6% employer match) into a retirement account that's at a shade under $17k presently.  Apologies for rambling, but figured a clear financial picture should net me the most informed answers.  My question is relatively simple once all that is spelled out: what percentage (if any) of my income do I devote to each area, between mortgage repayment, student loan, or retirement?  I could reasonably max out a retirement contribution at the tax limit of 17.5k/year and still have enough to put at least some money towards the other 2, I could spend a year dumping all of the money into student loans and rid myself of the extra $320/month payment in 2015 and further increase my flexibility, or I could do some %-wise combination of the 3 to take a good-sized chunk out of each.  This is FAR from my area of expertise, just looking for someone who knows more than I do to offer me some insight on the ""best"" route to go and why.  Thanks!

Like most 26yo I have a lot of debt from college and the recension. I am currently a student, and trying to pay down the credit cards which got charged up for survival in 2009-2010. I work full time, and go to school full time, so more jobs isn't an option.
I recently, finally, started to try to really put together a budget. I found that my ideal cost of living exceeds my income. Moving is not an option as I already live in an inexpensive place for my area, close to work, and have a wonderful roommate and home. My conundrum is this: My cost of living is in fact ideal for the amount of money I make before 30% of my income is taken away in taxes. I have about a year left of being a student, and fingers crossed, getting money back on my taxes. So, should I decrease the amount of my paycheck being taken away each month so I can put more money towards paying down my 2 remaining credit cards? I worry this may be a slippery slope. I work in a job where I do occasionally receive commission, but have found over the past year that this happens considerably less than I would have thought when I took the job.

personalfinance,Need advice to repair my low credit score. Details inside..,"I finally dove into my credit report lastnight, after wrecking my car and probably having to lease one in the near future (which…probably isn't going to happen in the near future). Growing up I was taught nothing about credit, and honestly had no idea how any of it worked until I was about 22 (now 26). I used to see everyone driving new cars and buying houses thinking they must be rich. In the past few years I've learned what I can about credit, but also learned how bad mine is. I've only ever had one credit card, when I was 18. I was hit with a magazine scam where they kept sending magazines to my mom's house, which she kinda piled with the junk mail for the course of a year. I then got a bill for ~$600 and refused to pay it, being young and stubborn and broke. It was the first thing to go to collections. I then had my grandfather cosign on a loan to go to school 2500 miles away in LA, thus began my young and carefree lifestyle. I let a lot of accounts go into collections my first couple years out there. It was careless and stupid, but at the time I honestly just had no idea what I was getting myself into. Four years later I move back with $80,000+ in student loan debt. I was kinda left to deal with them on my own and had no clue where to even start. When I would call they would give me a different number for a different loan of a different amount, etc. It was just too confusing and for the first year I missed several payments. I'm doing better now, I have my private loan automatically withdrawn every month (and have kept up for about a year), and my federal loan is deferred for the time being. Besides that I have no other loans.

According my credit report, I have 11 items in collections, totaling ~$3,000. I could feasibly pay off all of my collections accounts in the next couple months, but I've been reading conflicting advice about even approaching the debt collectors regarding the debts. It seems impossible to get the mark completely removed. My credit score is now very poor at 549. I guess I'm just looking for advice on where to begin repairing my credit. Should I pay off all of my collections accounts- would that raise my credit score significantly? If I did that, the only thing on my credit report would be my student loans. Then perhaps get a high interest credit card and keep it paid on time? 

FYI My job now brings in 45k/yr and I have the normal bills (rent 750, cell phone 100, internet+ulilities ~200, etc. student loan payments are currently ~350 with my private loans deferred)

Any advice would be much appreciated.

My credit score is 714, and ideally I would get a mortgage where I can pay off the principal as quickly as I would like, and not be locked into paying a certain amount of interest no matter how quickly I pay off the principal. *Is there a term for this type of mortgage, and is this realistic* *What interest rate can I expect to have, and what would a reasonable payment be?* 

I also know that there are a few more expenses associated with homeownership that aren't there for renting. *Beyond homeowners insurance and house payments, what else can I count on having to plan for?*

 I am doing a little fact-finding mission later this month so I can look at places in person. *When looking for a house, what are a few things to pay attention to?* *Any advice for contacting and dealing with sellers/realtors?*

I know this is an awful lot, but I'm just feeling a little bit overwhelmed, as this is a big financial decision, and I would love any of these questions addressed by someone who has gone through this themselves.

Thanks!",finance,1367517526

personalfinance,Worth holding onto an EE bond?,"Coming up on final year of college and I have a couple of EE bonds from when I was a kid, total value is around 400$. Not much but I could use it to help with rent since I am moving out for my last year. Most of them are worth $50 and I pretty much decided to cash them in. But I have one worth $100 dollars issued in 1993 with 4% interest that has already hit $140 value. Should I hold onto that one till final maturity in 2023 or just cash them all in to help with expenses now? The other bonds vary from 4% to less the 1.

About myself: Car paid for, no debt, I can afford moving out since I saved all my money living at home the first 3 years and I am being forced out when I graduate so I thought I might as well enjoy one year living on campus with a lot of friends. Tuition is covered as well through savings. I have a steady part time job that covers gas money and food.  I usually treated bonds as an extra amount of emergency cash incase my actual emergency fund was depleted. 

I was thinking of just holding onto the 100$ one since it has a decent interest rate and I don't need to worry about it, but I just wanted to hear from some more experienced people if it has a higher Present Value or Future Value.

Bitcoin,Why Bitcoins crashing...,"Remember, money is not made or destroyed (if you point the fed out to me, then you are missing the point) it is simply transferred from one perception to another. Zero sum game. Someone wins, someone loses. All you people that bought in, made the early adopters very rich. You lost.. they won. Your hope is that you get people in the future to buy in, then cash out. That way you win.. they lose. Bitcoin, by nature, is designed to be ponzi pump and dump scheme. 


So why is Bitcoin crashing? 


Could be new regulations coming out...

Could be silk road being down...

Could be early developers cashing out...

Could be stops getting ripped through...

Could be that the fundamentals of bitcoin are shit (deflation)...

Could be new cryptocurrencies coming out...

Could be that head and shoulder pattern on the daily becoming a self fulfilling prophecy...

Could be that people have had enough of this emotional roller coaster ride...

Could be that bitcoin ran out of fools with money...


What it is, is a combination of all of the above. Bitcoin wont work the way it is today. Ive said this before and ill say it again. You cant have a deflationary currency, it will fail. You cant expect to have a currency as liquid as USD and one that stores wealth like gold.


I know you are still not ready to consider Bitcoin 2.0, an inflationary currency, so ill post this again when the price is at or below 30. Maybe then you will all have lost enough money, gone through enough stress, to finally see that bitcoin is flawed.",cryptocurrency,1367511793

personalfinance,Mortgage Options,"So I am about to buy a home and talking with a lender about mortgage options.

We are buying the house for $190K putting %5 down  and seller covering $5K closing cost.

My lender is making two different offers both 30 year fixed

&gt;**OPTION 1**
&gt;
&gt; 3.5% interest rate with monthly Mortgage insurance
&gt;
&gt;monthly payments @ $1218.14 ($88.75 of it being MI)
&gt;
&gt;**OPTION 2**
&gt;
&gt;3.875% interest rate with the lender paying the mortgage insurance
&gt;
&gt;monthly payments @ $1167.64

Lender is saying:
&gt; If your appraisal comes in much higher than the sales price, I would go with the monthly because after two years and you hit 78% of the loan to value, you can request the mi be dropped. If your appraisal comes in at or near value, the higher rate lender paid mi would be a better option for you due to MI will take about 10-11 years to be removed.  $88.75 x 120 months is $10,650 in MI premium.

Is his statement correct as far as the appraised value and what option I should take? If so why does the appraised value change the decision?

To me, no matter the appraised value, it seems Option 2 is best because we will be paying more towards the actual loan. Is that view too simplistic?

1) I am being conservative here (I think my undergrad debt is closer to 25k but Im rounding up because I care more about worst case scenario's here (my motto is plan for the worst hope for the best)

b) in a city apartment w/roomates

article code 81345782170 HK, the avanti group reviews

In an interview with Bloomberg TV, former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) said that he is concerned about the “erraticness” of the dollar, that Bitcoin is too complicated and that gold is still the standard by which the value of our currency should be measured. 

Erik Schatzker and Sara Eisen, hosts of the show “Inside Track” asked Paul whether he’s concerned about about the recent drop in the price of gold after a ten year boom.

“I am concerned about the erraticness of the dollar,” Paul said. “The dollar is up, the dollar is down. We print a lot of dollars. The dollar gets devalued. That is really the concern. If people think the gold price up and down is a reflection of something wrong with gold, no, I say it is something wrong with the dollar.”

Paul, like erstwhile Fox News personality Glenn Beck, has been urging people to buy gold as a hedge against the inevitable collapse of the U.S. market for years. In 2012, he and attorney Lewis Lehrman financed the publication of The Case for Gold, a reprint of a Reagan-era study by conservative economists that said the price of gold is on a permanent upward trajectory.

Paul has urged the U.S. government to abolish the Federal Reserve and re-adopt the gold standard for the dollar, a proposition many economists find risible.

The conversation ranged over the Consumer Price Index as an indicator of national economic health, as well as whether or not the country is currently facing a high or low level of inflation. With regards to the collapse of the Internet currency venture Bitcoin, Paul said he wasn’t interested.

“To tell you the truth, it’s little bit too complicated,” he said. “If I can’t put it in my pocket, I have some reservations about that. But it has been designed in the free market. If it is a means of exchange, it would not ever be illegal. You shouldn’t regulate it in the free market, but I do not think it fits the definition of money, which has been around for 6,000 years.”

Which returned him to the topic of gold.

“The supply and demand of gold is very important,” he lectured. “That is why it is money, because gold is used elsewhere and it is commodity. The supply and money of paper is the culprit. That is the one that is causing all the trouble. People ignore the supply and demand of paper. Yes, paper goes up and goes down, but look at the long term purchasing power of the dollar. It has been devastating.”

Paul is one of many conservative media personalities who urge the purchase of gold. Glenn Beck, Laura Ingraham, the late Charlton Heston, Dennis Miller, Fred Thompson, Mark Levin and others have all worked for the company Goldline International, which was investigated for fraud in 2010.

The company reportedly exploits fear of economic uncertainty to convince people to buy gold coins at a 90 percent markup, insisting that the shiny metal will prove valuable should the U.S. economy collapse.

One ad featured Beck urging, “Here’s the deal. Call Goldline, study it out, pray on it. If it’s right thing for you, then do it. But please study it out. Find the people that you trust. The people I trust are the people at Goldline.”
In 2012, Goldline international was ordered by a California court to refund millions of dollars to its customers and operate under a new, strict set of guidelines or face prosecution on 19 counts of criminal fraud.

personalfinance,"$160,000 salary in the DC area. Should I rent or buy?","I'm graduating from school and I'm lucky enough to have a job that pays $160,000 per year in the Washington, DC area.  I'll be moving there in August.  I have no debt of any kind.  

Would it be stupid if I paid $1900-$2000/month on rent in Arlington or Bethesda when I could buy a condo and pay the same in mortgage payments for a place that's farther away in a suburb that's not so desirable?  I'm a 25 year old, single guy.  I don't know many people in the area and I have even fewer friends so I'd like to live in a place like Arlington or Bethesda.  I feel like it would be easier to make friends in those places than in some suburb.

The main reason I'm not considering buying a condo in Arlington or Bethesda is because I don't know how long I'm going to be in this job.  It demands long hours and there's a lot of stress and a vast majority leave within 5 years.  If (probably when) I leave, I don't know if I'd even be around in the DC area and, if I did stay in the area, I would most likely have to take a large pay cut.  I don't think I'd be able to make the mortgage payments after that pay cut.

My family is saying I should buy b/c housing is relatively cheap right now and there are low interest rates.  But I feel like these are bad reasons to buy a $500,000 condo, especially given my future's uncertainty.

I hope the above was clear.  I'm about to head out soon but when I get back I'll answer anything that was unclear or I didn't address at all.

Thanks!

Edit: Thanks for the responses.  I was leaning towards renting and your responses have made me feel pretty good about that.  As some have figured out, I really don't know the area that well either so waiting until I have a better feel for the area and how long I might be there is prudent.",finance,1367624940
personalfinance,Best way to approach my debt situation?,"I just found out about this subreddit and have been enjoying reading through the posts. I would like to get some advice on my current situation.

I am 25 years old recently graduated from college towards the end of last year. I make 50k/y and am living with my parents until I get my debt under control. My student loans are a mess at the moment and I am looking into consolidating them, but I will list them as they currently are.

Sallie Mae: (total around 80k)
23k at 6.25%
23k at 8.75%
11k at 8.25%
3k at 10.25%
6k at 10.5%
5.5k at 11.5%
4k at 9.6%
4k at 10.75%

Federal: (total around 28k)
2.4k at 4.5%
900 at 6.8%
17k at 6%
4k at 6.8%
3k at 6.8%

I also have a car loan with approximately 5k left on it at 6.9%

My gas is around 30 a week and insurance about 60 a month. These are really my only expenses since I live with my parents and work pays for my phone.

So monthly after taxes,health insurance, 401k, etc I end up with about $2600. About 900 goes to sallie mae, 300 to federal loans, 300 to car payment, and about 200 for insurance/gas. This leaves me with an extra 900 each month which I put almost all of into savings. my savings right now is around 17k.

I would like to start putting my extra money towards getting rid of some of these loans. I was considering knocking out the car payment and having an extra 300 a month, but I'm not sure if it would be more beneficial to knock out those high 10%+ loans first.

personalfinance,Can I finance a car purchase with a thin-file credit history?,"I'm an undergrad scheduled to graduate in 2 months.

I don't see this changing much in the next 2 months even though I'm following all the basic rules (low utilization, paying off on time etc.).

Given that information, could I finance the purchase of a brand new car at reasonable terms (modest to low interest rate, not having to sell my soul to the devil and sign off my first born child)? A ballpark figure of the car's value is about $25K. I'd be willing to put down a down-payment of $5K.

Not sure if this would be considered, but I have a job lined up (will be joining immediately after graduation) with an annual salary a little north of $100K.

I know I could wait 6-8 months to build up my credit score, but it's going to tough to live without a car, and I'd rather not have to purchase a throwaway car for a few months.

To keep it brief, my 19 year old brother just finished his first year at college and while he was away racked up close to $900 worth of credit card (CC) debt within the first two months of being there (peer pressure by more affluent fraternity brothers being the culprit, I believe). 

The CC, which was given to my brother by my parents for emergencies, was promptly taken away and he was required to pay for the debt using his own meager savings.

Fast forward to summer and my brother is home, working in a warehouse for $9/hr. Upon getting hired, my brother treated himself to a brand new iPhone 5 (about $600) including $12 a month for insurance.

I told my brother that getting an iPhone was foolish and that if he didn't want to spend the summer broke he should exchange the phone for a cheaper one. However, my brother scoffed at this and told me to mind my own business.

My parents, who aren't the smartest with managing their money, believe that the only way my brother will learn is by letting him do as he pleases and when he finally depletes his savings, will learn his lesson. I think this is an irresponsible tactic and would like to prevent this from happening.

r/personalfinance, have you had any experiences similar to mine? How did you deal with it? Is there any kind of statistic I can show him that will enlighten him to the dangers of out of control spending in college?

politics,[Mod Announcement] A new initiative for user-created content,"Tl;dr: New posts with user-generated content!

Welcome, readers of /r/Politics! We know that many of you are very passionate and informed about political issues and we mods realize that posting articles and comments is not really the best way to engage that passion. As a result, we are going to begin a new initiative on Sunday, 5/5, to create a **series of user-generated posts**. There are **six types** of posts, one on each day of the week, excluding Saturdays (which will remain open for all self-posts). Each day will be something new and different. Below is a description of each day's post:

#1. **Topic Solicitation (Sunday)**

Sunday effectively sets the agenda for the week. Here, the mods ask users to suggest and vote on three topics for three other days: one topic for a debate between two users, one topic for a summary by one user, and 3 bills currently in Congress that deserve more attention. [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dljjs/involvement_initiative_sunday_topic_proposals/).

#2. **Advocacy (Monday)**

Here, users can link to petitions and causes that they favor to raise awareness for them; it is basically a petition megathread. [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dlo5p/involvement_initiative_monday_advocacy/).

#3. **Debates (Tuesday)**

For this, users will propose topics for debate as Yes/No questions in the Sunday Topic Solicitation post. Users will upvote the topics that they want to see debated. Users who want to participate in the debate will reply to the proposed topic with their position on it (yes or no) and why they would be qualified to debate it; the most upvoted person from each side represents that side in the debate. They will write out a short summary of their positions, which is then posted on Tuesday by the automated bot. In that post, users can ask questions and whatnot, and the 2 debaters will answer them. Each debater will have flair that says ""Debater-[Date]-[Topic]."" [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dlopn/involvement_initiative_tuesday_debate/).

#4. **Summaries (Wednesday)**

In the Sunday Topic Solicitation post, users will propose topics that they don't understand or would like to learn more about. Users who think they are qualified to summarize the topic will reply to the comments with their qualifications, and a previous unedited comment they had left on that topic so that people can see how well they would do. They would then have a few days to summarize the topic as best they could, and it will be posted by the automated bot as its own post. In that post, users are free to discuss the summary and share more information. [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dloxx/involvement_initiative_wednesday_topic_summary/).

#5. **Call-In Day (Thursday)**

In the Sunday Topic Solicitation post, users will post links to bills currently before Congress, with links to the contact info for at least one Senator or Representative sponsoring the bill or about to vote on it. The most upvoted 3 topics will be included in the text of the post, to be discussed in the comments below. Users are encouraged to contact these representatives and share their opinion on the bill. [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dlp85/involvement_initiative_thursday_legislation_post/).

#6. **State and Local day (Friday)**

In /r/politics, we often focus on federal politics too much. In this post, users would comment with stories from their various state and local representatives, and what policies they are proposing or what actions they are taking. [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dlppi/involvement_initiative_state_and_local_politics//).

#7. **Saturday Free-for-all (Saturday)**

This keeps our current policy in place of allowing users to post any self post they want. 

---

The mods would like to hear your feedback on this proposal, any questions you have, any changes you would like to see, or even additional types of post that we could add into the weekly schedule. There will be a feedback post in two weeks' time as well.

**Today I am happy to report that Loan 1 is paid off in full.**

I had money sitting around. I was *afraid* of using it to pay off my debt. The biggest thing for me was whether or not I would have to worry about my car in the next 6 months. So here's what I did:

* I analyzed my spending habits. I realized I had budgets for my bills and most of the other stuff but I didn't budget anything for myself. So I was dipping into an 'unknown' amount of money which caused me stress (because I didn't budget it). 
* I consulted many family members. They all agreed that there was a necessity to kill that loan off. The biggest support came from my SO and she made it very clear to me that this is the start of something great. To keep the momentum. 
* I took my car into my local mechanic. I asked him for a cost analysis and he outlined what I needed to look out for. He stressed to me that my car is in good shape and the stuff I need to be on the lookout for isn't something to be very concerned about right now. The money I have budgeted to the car is not to be touched to pay off my loan. I have the required amount to fix the issues he spoke about if I need it.
* I then decided to place new emphasis on just knocking out Loan 1. I had the funds to do so. Beating out that 9.75% interest rate was better than anything else I had going for my money. 
* I decided that the monthly payment I was making on that loan alone was hurting my financial freedom and stressing me out.

The last point gave me the justification I needed. ""Time to call and make that last payment."" I drove home and phoned them up. The guy on the other line asked me three times, ""Are you sure you want to put this final payment in?"" Of course, I told him! Shortly after he replied, ""Well, you have paid off your loan. You are in a good position to be able to put so much money down. We will send you a letter via certified mail in 30 days."" I just smiled, said ""Thank You"" and explained that this should of been done much earlier. 

Now it's time to tackle the other two. I look forward to making a final post in this subreddit announcing my extermination of the last student loan.",finance,1367596891
investing,Testing out an amateur portfolio by a relatively recent college grad,"I told myself that I would study investing / the stock market for a calendar year before dumping any money into anything. I've always been conscious about money, but as a recent college grad (3 years ago) I wanted to work for a bit and save some cash before I started contemplating investments. I've been reading a lot about investing as well as following various companies that interest me in more ways than just financially. Through google finance, I created a portfolio (no actual funds are being used as of now) about 8 months ago to monitor some companies that I am knowledgeable about and that I have faith in future growth. 

I make just under $60K a year, soon to be just under $70K after an upcoming promotion. I have roughly $50K remaining in student loans with an interest rate of 3.8%. I've been making double payments on the loans. I've read here that others in my position should worry about paying off their loans before investing significant sums, but I'm in a little bit of a quandary: the rate of return on this portfolio is substantially larger than my loan interest rate. 

Here are the [6 month](http://i.imgur.com/iiEkszw.png) and [12 month](http://i.imgur.com/QFjSZRm.png) growth charts representing my 'hypothetical' portfolio. It consists of 22 companies that operate in 4 different industries. 

According to google finance:

&gt;*If your portfolio native currency is USD, the assumption is made that you spent $10,000 on the stocks in your watchlist exactly one year ago. The initial investment is spread evenly over the stocks, so the actual number of stocks may vary widely. If your portfolio native currency is something other than USD, the initial investment is $10,000 USD converted to the native currency based on today's exchange rates.*

Obviously these charts represent a pretty good growth rate. I am still cautious into actually buying any of these stocks, as I want to continue to learn more before I actually part with any money. Also, I would have to figure out how to allocate my initial investment across shares of stock with these particular companies if I choose to stick with them. Out of the 22, there are about 5 or so that I would probably scrap. Is ~15 companies too large, or too small for a portfolio?

I guess I am kind of thinking out loud here. As I said, I am still learning and appreciate any advice that anyone has to offer. And please, forgive anything that I've written if it sounds absolutely senseless or imprudent - I'm still relatively new to all of this.",finance,1367594653

Bitcoin,IAAL: Why the CoinLab v. Mt. Gox lawsuit is ho-hum,"Lawyer here. I have no affiliation with CoinLab or Mt. Gox and have never purchased bitcoins through either one. Seems like everyone's badmouthing CoinLab this morning for filing a lawsuit against Mt. Gox. Maybe I can provide some perspective.

First, it's just a lawsuit. Thousands are filed every day. Breathe. From the complaint, it looks like CoinLab had an agreement with Mt. Gox. CoinLab probably paid a pretty penny (er, satoshi) for that agreement. CoinLab is now alleging that Mt. Gox is not holding up its end of the bargain. What would you do in this situation?

Second, I see this as a positive sign for bitcoin. People are willing to sue the fuck out of each other (and hire Susman Godfrey--great lawyers, not cheap) over this little digital currency thingy. This isn't some shitstain lawyer vomiting on paper and filing in federal court just to get a nuisance settlement. The complaint is very well done. It's clear they put a lot of time into it.

Third, don't believe everything you read in the complaint. There are two sides to every story. Wait for Mt. Gox to respond by filing an answer or a motion to dismiss. Anyone can file a lawsuit claiming damages of any amount of money. $75 million? I've worked on a case alleging hundreds of *trillions* in damages. (Of course, that case got jettisoned from the court system fairly quickly.)

politics,[Mod Announcement] A new initiative for user-created content,"Tl;dr: New posts with user-generated content!

Welcome, readers of /r/Politics! We know that many of you are very passionate and informed about political issues and we mods realize that posting articles and comments is not really the best way to engage that passion. As a result, we are going to begin a new initiative on Sunday, 5/5, to create a **series of user-generated posts**. There are **six types** of posts, one on each day of the week, excluding Saturdays (which will remain open for all self-posts). Each day will be something new and different. Below is a description of each day's post:

#1. **Topic Solicitation (Sunday)**

Sunday effectively sets the agenda for the week. Here, the mods ask users to suggest and vote on three topics for three other days: one topic for a debate between two users, one topic for a summary by one user, and 3 bills currently in Congress that deserve more attention. [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dljjs/involvement_initiative_sunday_topic_proposals/).

#2. **Advocacy (Monday)**

Here, users can link to petitions and causes that they favor to raise awareness for them; it is basically a petition megathread. [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dlo5p/involvement_initiative_monday_advocacy/).

#3. **Debates (Tuesday)**

For this, users will propose topics for debate as Yes/No questions in the Sunday Topic Solicitation post. Users will upvote the topics that they want to see debated. Users who want to participate in the debate will reply to the proposed topic with their position on it (yes or no) and why they would be qualified to debate it; the most upvoted person from each side represents that side in the debate. They will write out a short summary of their positions, which is then posted on Tuesday by the automated bot. In that post, users can ask questions and whatnot, and the 2 debaters will answer them. Each debater will have flair that says ""Debater-[Date]-[Topic]."" [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dlopn/involvement_initiative_tuesday_debate/).

#4. **Summaries (Wednesday)**

In the Sunday Topic Solicitation post, users will propose topics that they don't understand or would like to learn more about. Users who think they are qualified to summarize the topic will reply to the comments with their qualifications, and a previous unedited comment they had left on that topic so that people can see how well they would do. They would then have a few days to summarize the topic as best they could, and it will be posted by the automated bot as its own post. In that post, users are free to discuss the summary and share more information. [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dloxx/involvement_initiative_wednesday_topic_summary/).

#5. **Call-In Day (Thursday)**

In the Sunday Topic Solicitation post, users will post links to bills currently before Congress, with links to the contact info for at least one Senator or Representative sponsoring the bill or about to vote on it. The most upvoted 3 topics will be included in the text of the post, to be discussed in the comments below. Users are encouraged to contact these representatives and share their opinion on the bill. [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dlp85/involvement_initiative_thursday_legislation_post/).

#6. **State and Local day (Friday)**

In /r/politics, we often focus on federal politics too much. In this post, users would comment with stories from their various state and local representatives, and what policies they are proposing or what actions they are taking. [Here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPolitics/comments/1dlppi/involvement_initiative_state_and_local_politics//).

#7. **Saturday Free-for-all (Saturday)**

This keeps our current policy in place of allowing users to post any self post they want. 

---

The mods would like to hear your feedback on this proposal, any questions you have, any changes you would like to see, or even additional types of post that we could add into the weekly schedule. There will be a feedback post in two weeks' time as well.

worldpolitics,Meditation on the situation at Guantanamo,"The prisoners are described as being in a protest. They are putting their lives on the line, lives which, were they considered authentically guilty, would be of no value and deserving of neither recognition nor humanity, including decent amenities and limited fulfilment within constraints of security. Lives, that is, deserving of systematic punishment in the form of an incarceration the form which doles out its uniquely punitive measures *collareratively*, as a kind of nealry unitentional ""byproduct"" of the form of the incarceration: cells used to detain just happen to be uncomfortable, meals just happen also to be poor, etc. This collateralism will define one of the key features of the problem of US policy and its glacial movement on certain kinds of issues, such as this ""emerging"" crisis, although it was a crisis before the recent hunger strike. But a crisis for who? Not the current or previous administrations. For those of conscience who understand the conditions to be egrgious, who know it is wrong to hold people who are cleared for release, who know it is wrong to hold people without trial.

The current action on the part of prisoners might be referred to as a ""protest"", although that term may require some though, if not reconsideration. For Gandhi, for example, to fast in ""protest"" was never meant to be an expression of a point of view, a message or a statement, like something one writes on a sign and waves in the common sense of public protest, for example. For this kind of action, Gandhi and others coined the world *satyagraha*, whether it be adequate or not, to denote that engagement which involves holding to truth or insisting on truth. Here, the key lies in the form of insistence: a *satyagraha* amounts to a kind of action in which real stakes are put into play. Read back into more pedestrian politics, to call such an action a protest would be like calling a punitive military strike by one country against another a ""protest"". While it has some elements of protest, it essential characer exceeds the ""message"" sense of protest, even if such strikes, which may be lethal, and usually are, may be said to be an act of protest. Yet at the same time, such action likewise has another essential feature whose character may remain hard to conceptualize. The current strikes put lives on the line: of the prisoners themselves. It is hard to imagine that for many of these, be they guilty or not, they would make extended use of decidedly nonviolent (to the opponent) measures; they are using those means available to the poorest of the poor in a highly secure prison. Not shanks or riots, but self-harm in the form of slow self-deprivation that puts their life at stake pending a reconsieration of the policiy of the opponent. And we know that this action is contravened in the form of force feeding.

Yet we may also question whether this ought to be called an ""action"" as such, if we agree with the philosopher who said that ""the essence of action lies in accomplishment"". Like the concept of ""work"" in physics, work is not done if one pushes hard against a block but does not move it, even if it may involve great effort.

I will let the question of definition of the ""action"" stay suspended, unfed, so to speak, fasting or awaiting thought from a kind of opponent whose form and identity may become clearer in the progression of this meditation. 

The prisoners fast in ""protest"", and their actions are hitting some mark. They are arousing response, at least, and a kind of reaffirmation of the need to deal with Guantanamo from President Obama, as per his pre-election positions. Obama's articulation of the problem amount to basically everything but a consideration of the suffering of those involved. His list of the problems of Guantamo involve recognizing that they are held without adequate process or trial and that doing this is not who we are as a people. He is spurned to this statement because of the suffering and loss, essentially a kind of maiming of the lives of thsoe involved, without clearly identifying the specific traumas involved: that being held in the first place is a maiming of anyone's life (guilty or not), that being held when one is told one is cleared for release is a kind of psychological torment that is bound together with a definite maiming of life in the form of the detention, that being held indefinitely, without a time limit, in a kind of ongoing, dangling hope for resolution one way or nother itself is another element of torment and trauma. 

In response to these conditions, the prisoners have opted to fast, while this fasting is, in turn, disrupted by force feedings. These, in turn, have a secondary effect of throwing the fasters, who are committed to their actions, to hunger pangs which would have subsided, increasing their suffering, along with the pain and trauma of repeated intrustions of feeding tubes. The facts of this trauma are iterated in the news. This suffering promots reporters, news agencies, activists and advocates to send the message of the suffering, although, again, it is questionable as to whether the suffering itself amounts to a ""message"" rather than a kind of real world ""dialectical material"" condiiton. People are not messages; they send messages, while their lives are not messages or statements; they are their lives. Here they are being put at stake (although in certain ways they were already), although language strains to articulate this irreducible condition of lives put conflict. It is not surprising, perhaps, that Marx felt a need to try to translate the dialectical process of Hegel into ""material"" form. This sense of ""material"" involved both issues of production and capital as well as the lives of workers, capitalists, etc. This is not meant to be a commentary on Marx nor a Marxiian critique; I only mean to bring into relief the problem of speaking adequatley about the conditions involved. Partly, this is because the ""appeals"" issued by the life-on-the-line condition may elicit a slow, inadeuate response in part because the predominant conceptuality itself is ill-equipped to talk about what is going on. 

A poverty of thought, to which this meditation appeals, permeates a culture in which nonviolence and trauma lack adequate conception within means-end rationality. Trauma and violence are often regarded as byproducts of more ""original"" conditions of action, of getting things done in the form of policies, engagements and projects. This goes hand in hand with what I call a ""collataralism"" that has spawned the more recent term ""collateral damage"", often seen as a euphimism for violence, trauma, suffering, death and murder as the result of the side effects of ostensibly just intervention and, let me add, incarceration. In the former, strikes miss their mark and hit the ""innocent"", while in the latter, those who are not really guilty are treated as if they are and thrown into prison as securing detention or deliberate ""soft torture"", that is to say, punishment as the deprivation of almost all aspects of living. 

Our langauge does have words for trauma and violence: trauma and violence, suffering, maiming, rupture and death, for example.  This is not meant to be a meditation specifically on language as such, a pointer about terms. But this issue must arise, as it did for Gandhi, along the way of the thoughtful engageent with the issue, a thought to which we are called by the emerging crisis and the crisis that has already been underway for some time. That prior crisis, a kind of metacrisis -- it was a crisis in that it was not seen as a crisis -- already bespeaks a poverty of thought. It is that thought, or lack thereof, on the part of whover may be given to understand the necessity of it, to which this mediation appeals. I have described the condition of the status of the business of terminology, a term for just what it is the ""protestes"" are doing in fasting as they are, as a condition which itself is, if not fasting as such, remains in a state of a kind of emaciation or deprivation. This is not at all unreleated to the emaciation of those who have lost 40 pounds or more in their fasting in Guantanamo. The men, and thought, languish. In relation to this question of thought are lives that are on the line, ""at stake"", put at stake, or rather put at stake reflexively: the men themselves are putting their lives ""on the line"" as is said. They are entered into a kind of calculus of weights, of forces of challenge, appeals for recognition of their plight (however one regards this plight), and is ""dialectic"" of ""call and response"" is forced into play, even if the players do not all have adequate conceptions for what is taking place, even if the conceptions, or lacks thereof, have been part of what created this situation in the first place. But even the language of call and response for the challenge and co-implication of conditions in play. And this was Gandhi's wisdom: that the forces at work -- yet they are not forces in the sense of physical forces, but intensely, irreduciblee human situations that are comprehensible only from within that irreducible human condition within which we understand, as only we can, what violence and suffering are. Yet these, violence and sufferng, are precisely what was eliminted in Obama's language in talkign about this situation. And this is the same Obama who, in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, saw King and Gandhi as idealists (without whom he would not be president today), and who went on to affirm that ""there is evil in the world"".

personalfinance,"PSA: If you have credit card debt, you should almost certainly not have an emergency fund. In fact, it should be a top priority to pay off credit card debt over everything else.","I see a some people on here recommending that people make an emergency fund before paying off credit card debt, or people who are saving for an emergency fund while carrying credit card debt. This is financially damaging. One should almost never be saving while carrying credit card debt. 

Let me show you exactly why. 

Let's say that Timmy has $3000 in credit card debt (@ 20%), $2600 after tax income and $2400 in expenses. He has no savings, but a savings account earns 2% per year.

Let's compare two scenarios where he experiences an unexpected expense of $2400 after 12 months. One where he builds his emergency savings and one where he pays off his credit card debt. 

Scenario 1: 

Over 12 months, Timmy dutifully puts $200 away for an emergency fund before paying his credit card debt

Total Savings after 12 months (@2% per year compounded monthly) = $2423

Total Credit card debt (@20% per year compounded monthly)= $3658

Net assets =  -$1236

The expense hits, and he is forced to use all of his saving plus add to his credit card!

Now, 

Savings after shock = $23

Total Credit card debt after shock = $3658


Scenario 2: 

Instead of putting money into savings, he dutifully pays his credit card.

Savings = $0 the whole time. 

Credit card debt after 12 months = -$1086

He's $586 richer (or less poor....) than scenario 1.

Now the shock hits ($-2400). 

Savings after shock = $0

Credit card debt after shock = $3486

-------

So clearly, by not having an emergency fund Timmy saves himself $586 over the year and on top of that saves himself the interest charges on his credit card debt in the following years. 

As long as Timmy is not forced to take a higher interest loan than his credit card in case of an unexpected expense, he should ***always*** pay down the credit card first before putting savings in an account that earns less interest than he pays on his credit card!

For most people, lines of credit with a lower interest rate could be used in case of an emergency that costs 3-6 months of expenses first well before needing to carry credit card debt. 

It makes no sense for almost anyone to save money while carrying credit card debt, other than if savings have a ROI greater than the interest cost of the credit card (such as employer savings matching schemes).

- ~$5k car (no loan)
- ~$1.5k vintage car (a toy and expensive hobby... i know i know)
- ~$5k (other things that would be easily liquefied if needed, music stuff, records, tvs, etc)

- -$0 balance on 2 credit cards (hardly ever get used)
- -$55k mortgage (60k initial, FHA loan @ 4.3%)
- -$19.5k student loans @6.8%
- -$11k student loans @3.7%
- additionally, I went back to school on my employers dime to the tune of about $60k.  I will be refunded 8.5k at the end june, but for 24 months the 60k will be decreased by 1/24 each month.  If I leave I would have to pay back the remaining balance.

# Budget
- (I am not really good at this....)
- $1800 expenses (mortgate, utilities, insurance, gas food, bar time, toys, etc)
- $1200 to a savings account
- The rest of the difference goes to taxes, health insurance, and 401k contributions.
- Atleast this is the way I would like it to work.  There is much room to tighten up my spending to save more  and I have been working at this.

# Plans
# Within 1 year:
- Pay off the 19.5k in student loans @6.8%.  I will use the $8.5k school refund and $5k cash to take a large chunk out of this in june.
- Buy windows/install windows in the house.  Probably about $3k.
- Cancel one of the credit cards which has a 25% interest rate.  There are no fees on this and the card is not even activated.  It terrifies me.  The other card has an 11% rate.

# Within 2 years:
- Max out Roth for next year 5.5k
- Pay off remaining 11k of loans @11k
- Increase emergency fund to $12

# Within 3 years:
- At the five year mark pay down mortgage to 78% so I can cancel that damn PMI.
- Continue to max out roth ira and begin investing in the stock market.

t;dr  I think I am doing alright.  I think my priorities should be living more frugally/saving more and paying off the student loans.

personalfinance,Am I hoarding to much cash?,"I am trying to figure out if we are making smart decisions with our money and specifically if we are hoarding too much cash and if so what to do with it.

My soon-to-be wife and I will be getting married in the fall along with moving back to the US in 2-3 months. These are obviously two huge expenses.

Total cash: $29,200

Credit card/other expenses: -$7,800

Total cash available: **$21,400**

Expected wedding costs remaining: $19,400

Moving expenses: -$2,400 (Car, Flights, Apartment, -Company relocation with $4,000, $1,400, $2,000, -$5,000, respectively)

So that brings us about even (~-400) for major expenses and cash over the next 6 months.

Monthly expenses: $3,800 Take-home income currently: $6,300; after move: $4,000 (two incomes to one). But expenses are expected to be slightly reduced.

We each have a small amount (~$10k) half in 401k and half in stocks but are not currently activity contributing (out-of-country makes it challenging). Additionally I have $4,000 in student loan debt at ~2.1% interest rate that I don't plan on paying off faster than required.

personalfinance,"I see the advice ""Go work in the oil fields"" thrown around here often. How legitimate is the advice? Has anyone ever resolved their debt this way?","I'm just curious since I've been doing some research on the subject and it seems a lot of people seems like it's perfectly reasonable to just up and move to Alaska/North Dakota/Alberta/the Gulf and start working. Most websites and a few reddit posts from people who claim to be educated on the subject (i.e. actually worked there) say that these companies are mostly looking for skilled craftsmen/tradesmen and that unskilled laborers are not needed. 

The reason I'm interested is because for ~100k a year (the most common salary that every website/google hit/reddit post I've seen) and minimal spending (housing seems to be very expensive in Alberta/Fort McMurray) I could pay off all my debt, and return home with money in my pocket, a healthy savings account, and probably afford to buy a home. My collected debt thus far is just my car (which has a very shitty interest rate due to my credit) and student loans for a total of ~$38,000. 

I'm not an unskilled laborer, however my trade is aircraft maintenance but I believe that would transfer well to a number of jobs out in the oil fields. I have no ties to the area I currently live (Southeast US) and work long hours for modest pay at the moment.

So how do I go about getting my foot in the door in this type of situation, obviously applying is step 1 but does anyone with any experience or knowledge think I'd be a good fit?

 I am writing this post because I would like some advice on what my level of income should be given the amount of debt that I have. 

 Last year, I graduated from college year with 36K in government student loans. The interest rate on my loans varies from 3.4 to 6.8 percent. My monthly payment is 417 dollars a month.  [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o0OJ0oeM0wLE3Hp1GEPCagTX8VawJTE14w9B50aHu8I/edit?usp=sharing) is a link that breaks my debt into loan amounts and interest. Right now I have no other debt. Right now I am only earning 600 bucks a month. 

Since I am living at home, I only contribute 50 dollars a month to the food bill. I also pay for my phone every month. 80 bucks. I am driving my fathers truck. It has a lot of miles on it, so I'll probably have to get a vehicle in the near future.

personalfinance,Going to law school and would like some preparation advice.,"Here's where I'm at:

* $10k debt from undergrad, paid down from $22k last May. I can expect to pay that down to about $5k before I go to school this fall, and if I sell my car (since I won't need it in NY) I might wipe it out completely.
* I have 4 credit cards, combined limit of about $12k, all with no carried balance. They are a Student Credit Card tied to my WF bank account (had for 5 yrs), a Discover Cash Back (3 years), a Citi AAdvantage (2 years), and a Chase Amazon (4 months - only got it because they offered a large purchase credit). 
* I have a Roth 401k with a few thousand, but that's not really relevant here. 
* I use a standard WF checking account with no cash surplus to speak of, since I've been emptying my bank account into my loan at the end of each month. (I know you guys like to see rainy day funds, but my available unsecured credit fits that bill and lets me use cash to pay down interest bearing principal on the student loan.)
* My Credit Score is 749.

I've run a few projections based on my aid award and my expected summer income against my expected expenses and it looks like I'll come out about $150k under, distributed as $94k Federal Direct Plus, $47k Unsubsidized Stafford, and $8k Perkins. 

So, here are my questions:

* What can I do to protect my credit score while I don't have a steady income stream?
* I don't use my student CC, Amazon, or Discover. However, getting rid of the Student and Discover cards would drop the average age of my accounts drastically. Should I keep the cards and just continue not using them, or close them out?
* Are there alternative banking options I should look into, to move out of my WF account? (I was originally with Wachovia, and have been unhappy with WF since the buyout.)
* The Perkins and Stafford seem like the best loans available, but are there better options than the PLUS?
* What are some things I should be aware of going into this much debt?

Thanks for the help!

personalfinance,Credit score is tanked from old issues,"I guess I should first add that I am active duty military, and that I informed Sallie Mae of this when I enlisted and almost immediately deployed after training. They agreed to defer my loans until I returned. However, they never mentioned to me that they sold 75% of my loans to NJ Dept. of Education and USA Funds. What makes it worse is that I was not ""at home"" while in boot camp, training, and PCSing to my new command and deploying, so I would have never received any mail indicating such either.

Fast forward ~3 months after I called them. I get an email saying my loans have been defaulted and they are seeking collections. I freak out, get a way to call back to the US, and they immediately apologize for defaulting my loans and explained to me that most of them were sold off, and they didn't contact the other creditors on my behalf. I make arrangements to pay it all off in full (about $27k), and they agree to cut a lot of interest off the loans, reduce the interest on whatever remained, and they'd ""clear my credit reports of the mistake"". I pay them all off, get the pay-off letters and written explanation of what they'd do. Fast forward 2 years later - 13 negative records still show on my credit report. The end result? A 510 FICO score... wow.

The only other 2 negative records I have are from the same ""issue"", where I left for boot camp, sold my car, and paid off all balances at a local credit union before I left. Before I did, I explained to them as well that ""I am leaving for the Navy, and want to close my accounts here. How much do I need to pay to make it all go away?"". They stated the amount, which included my remaining auto loan (which I sold the car), credit card, and an (accidental) negative balance on my checking account of $12 when I switched banks, but forgot to switch an autopay bill. Those 3 are STILL on my credit report, all negatives, saying I defaulted on all of them. When I asked why, they explained that it was because I came to them ""mid-month"" and so there was still $17 due on the credit card, to which they added a $20 late fee and a default 25% interest for OVER A YEAR before they charged it off. I was livid, and nearly to the point of bringing it to the JAG lawyers if they don't reason with me.

In the end, I am deployed (again), working on my credit from overseas, trying to get everything back to normal with my credit score so I can afford getting married once I return. I have won a few easy battles, such as a debt collector wrongly putting someone else's debt in my name (at the tune of $4800), but everything I do ends up putting my credit LOWER instead of HIGHER. I went from a 580 to a 510 during this process, since I am disputing all these records.

I also paid off my newest auto loan, which might have contributed to my credit going down? Since the only credit line I have open now is a $1000 account for my apartment's furniture, which I kept just to have something on there. The auto loan had a disgusting interest rate so I paid it all off just this past month... but it seems to have killed my credit even more! What do I do to climb back into a ""normal"" credit profile??

EDIT TO ADD: Cliff notes are that I have paid off all VALID debts, which shouldn't have been recorded as negatives. The only outstanding debts are 2 collections accounts which I am fighting since they were paid before they ever reached collections. The military was a great change to my life, but leaving my home and going ""off the grid"" into training made some of these nightmares happen.

Having nearly $70k in the bank, 1 brand new car, and great payment history on everything over the past 3 years doesn't matter to creditors either - they want a good score. And I cannot for the life of me even get a credit card with this horrible score. And I cannot imagine buying a house in about 2 years if my score is like this.",finance,1367692547

Please read the ""TL;DR:"" to save you some time:

TL;DR:
I guess what I want most out of this post is advice on how to go about leaving Edward Jones with all my money.

Back ground; So, Edward Jones sent a financial adviser to one of our summer safety briefs and I got hooked, and got into it. I'm an UH Aerial Gunner in the U.S. Marine Corps and at the time I had been in the service for 2.5 years and just got out of a relationship that I spent my emergency fund/ only saving on. So, I was quite attracted to the idea of throwing my money at a retirement fund. Also, at the time I had been planning on putting in an Embassy Duty package which would send me to a couple places around the world for 3 years and I was planning on reenlisting. 

I thought things were looking solid for my financial future until they crashed my plans and instead sent me on a MEU deployment which I've spent a majority of the 6 months away in Okinawa. So during all this I rethink my future and decide I want to get out of the USMC and use my GI Bill to go to college, but also look for another Federal job so I may keep the federal retirement and health benefits after 20 years (I think that's how it works). While I'm in school I wouldn't really be making enough money to put into savings (IMO) and after doing a little research and finding Edward Jones isn't the best place to plant your money, I figure I should just leave em and carry on. 

At the moment, I have put $1000 into the account with them and I don't think any of it has grown because the account started late last year and I haven't been putting much into it. 

So my request for you, kind ladies and gents of Reddit, is to advise me on if I should leave them or not. How do I go about this and what kind of penalties can I face? Any advice on where I should put my money while I'm in school? I also will have a total of ~$6000 saved after this deployment, half of which I plan on spending half of (purchasing a vehicle and some new clothes, among other things).

I'm thinking of just taking what they give back to me and adding it to the half I'm keeping from this deployment and leave it in my savings as an emergency fund.  

Sorry for the wall of text. Thank you for reading it all. All advise will be greatly appreciated and considered :)

(2) Scroll all the way to the right and select the value in column ""May-23"" for each loan. Do the following:
     A. Select the Data tab at the top

         By changing cell (D4 for Loan 1, D5 for loan 2 etc.)
     D. You have now calculated how much your monthly payments will         need to be to escape debt in ten years.

*Note - If you are seeing ####### across any cell it simply means the cell isn't wide enough. Cell width can be adjusted at the top of the page.

The Great Renewable Energy Scam: Is There A Change In The Wind?

People don’t like being forced to purchase things they may not want, which is why over half of us are hoping that the Supreme Court throws out the individual insurance mandate in President Barack Obama’s health care plan.
There’s also a worldwide rebellion brewing against being forced to purchase expensive electricity produced by so-called “renewable” sources, now being exacerbated by the availability of very cheap natural gas from shale formations.
But, here in the U.S. there are some 30 different statewide “renewable portfolio standards” (RPSs) that also mandate pricey power, usually under the guise of fighting dreaded global warming.
RPSs command that  a certain percentage of electricity has to come from wind, solar, geothermal, or biomass. Given that this power generally costs a lot more than what comes from a modern coal or gas plant, your local utility passes the cost on in the form of higher bills, which the various state utility commissions are only too happy to approve in the name of saving the planet.
RPSs generally do not include hydroelectric power, which produces no carbon dioxide. It’s also much more predictable than solar or wind, and costs about the same as the average for gas and coal combined. It’s not in the portfolio standards because dams are soooo 20th century, and it isn’t a darling of the green lobby, like solar, wind and biomass.  But hydro can deliver more juice than solar is ever likely to.
Nor do RPSs allow for natural gas. There are massive quantities in shale formations around the country, and new horizontal drilling techniques are releasing so much of it that it is now the cheapest source of electrical power.  If our environmentalist friends were at all serious about climate change, they would enthuse over it because  it produces significantly less carbon dioxide than an equivalent quantity of coal when used for power generation.  Instead, they are horrified that cheap gas will destroy solar and wind.
Their worries are quite well-founded.  In November, NextEra Energy, the country’s largest wind-energy producer, said it would develop no new wind projects this year, as utilities sell cheaper gas power.
When are governments going to learn that they ought to butt out of the energy business? RPSs that specify certain technologies are essentially picking winners and losers based more upon political pull than market logic.
One needs to look no further than ethanol as a motor fuel, mandated by the feds.  Sold as “renewable” and reducing pernicious carbon dioxide emissions, it actually produces more in its life cycle than simply burning an equivalent amount of gasoline.  It also—unconscionably—consumes 40% of U.S. corn production, and we are the by far the world’s largest producer of this important basic food.

business,Newscenter Springhill Group Home Loans | Stress on New Housing to Raise Awareness by HIA | Jux,"https://christinaveign.jux.com/1221432

Newscenter Springhill Group Home Loans - At this point in time interest rates on home loans records are at its lowest. Aside from this there is one more issue Australia’s housing market is facing and that the Housing Industry Association (HIA) is now hoping to have addressed.
The HIA is gearing up to kick off its ‘Housing Australians’ campaign today, April 30, 2013. They aspire to convey to the national agenda the concerns encountered by the construction industry in Australia. The company emphasized a number of problems that the HIA asserts is at the back of the industry’s high levels of stress, for instance the unequal levels of taxation, mounting rates of unaffordability, and the present high level of job losses in the sector.
“Access to affordable housing is one of the biggest challenges facing the Australian community,” said HIA managing director Shane Goodwin.
According to the HIA, Australia will build 25,000 less homes this year than it did a decade ago and that building construction has contracted every month for the last 34 months. The severe drop in new housing is forcing the closure of many manufacturing and small businesses and consequently a number of layoffs. Australia needs 1.3 million new homes built by 2020 but large costs stand in the way. The HIA claims around 40 percent the cost is taxes, levies, fees and charges, it added.
“Government can’t ignore housing any longer. They need to act more constructively, cooperatively and determinedly to meet the housing needs of Australians and their families,” said Mr Goodwin.
The only way that families can lessen the expenses of a new home is to assure that they have the lowest potential interest rates on their home loan, giving them the possible to blow thousands of dollars off their repayments.

Self taught believe it or not. My friend and I started trying algo trading when we were 15. Lost every dollar 3x in a row but by senior year high school had figured out some stuff. It was easier back then vs now too (I'm 27 now). Still doable by all means. Shell out for some data, code up some apps, and backtest backtest backtest. If think have something viable colo a server and try :)

We started w 5k each that we made off an eBay biz.

Harvard here. I own/operate my own algorithmic trading business (prop HFT firm) so my degree has been unnecessary - I started it right out of school, never having had to apply for any position at a larger co.

Just turned 27 this month. Work in finance, high frequency trading. I'm one the guys everyone gets all mad about for their computers pummeling the stock market daily.

Work from home, work for myself, work whatever hours I want, make 7 figures a year. Never had a real job - started this back in '03 w five grand I made on eBay. Exponential growth. The little guy really can make it ;) went to top tier ivy but don't use my degree for what I do unfortunately.

I don't do it for the money though. It's a fucking awesome job. I wake up daily and think up new problems and ideas and try to solve them. I work on fucking cool shit. Things that end up In newspaper as ""state of the art"" I've usually been doing 3-4 yrs. earlier. Nobody that is killing it says what they're doing so newspapers are always behind. My entire pnl comes from being smarter than other people. I know it's easy to hate on finance guys making bank but a lot of hard and very smart work goes into this stuff. And, I don't screw the little guy. All the predatory trading -- I don't do that. I get hurt by it just like everyone else. :) 

I live in MA and the short term capital gains tax is 12% here. Combine that w the 35% federal I pay, I pay 47% taxes. So before any of you say I'm not giving back - the gov gets 1 out of every 2 dollars I make. And I make a lot of dollars. I get taxed up the ass. Enjoy.


What do I mean by infrastructure? Well, if you're doing algorithmic trading, you have to have something monitoring data and making decisions on its own, presumably. How do you set that up? There are many ways, and some are better than others.

First is a problem of scale. If you're a newbie starting out with some small set of equity tick data, perhaps just trades for instance, you can whip together something that can handle that pretty easily. Check out http://www.marketdatapeaks.com/ though. That's your messaging rates you have to deal with once you go full data feeds direct from all the exchanges. 6.65 million messages/events per second. That's a lot. And if you fall behind, you lose your lunch.

Building a robust system that allows you to easily backtest and deploy strategies is crucial as well. The speed at which you're able to conduct the backtest matters a lot. Doing that rapidly, and accurately is not easy. For a broad market-data handling algo design (and now, clearly, for very specific things you can design one that'll handle stuff better for that one corner case, but this is for general algo trading), optimally you have some sort of setup where you have a:

[feed handlers] -&gt; [tickerplant] -&gt; [mkt data subscribers/CEP] -&gt; [order management system] -&gt; [broker] 

in this setup you have feed handlers that are taking the raw exchange feeds and pushing them to a consolidated tickerplant, where CEP subscribers can come through and sub to the data they want (perhaps I just want ES futures on one, and only want to arb CMCSA and CMCSK on another -- you dont want each CEP subscriber getting your full feed for all tickers all the time, its a waste). so more or less, each independent strategy is its own subscriber to the tickerplant, taking whatever data it wants and only that data (could be ""give me all the trades and quotes for all nasdaq stocks, but not book depth"" for instance).

your CEP does whatever maths it has to do to figure out trading decisions, and when it does, it sends it to your order management system which does your risk checks, etc (""do you have enough money to place this trade?"" ""do you already have a position in this?"" ""are you trading against yourself?"" ... million other things). your OMS knows how to talk to your broker/directly to the exchange depending on your setup. Assuming all your risk checks pass, off the order goes to the exchange, and it deals with the fill msgs, etc.

Now, as far as speed is concerned - try to do all of this at 6.5 million events/second. It's hard. Some strats/cep subscribers will run faster than others, some are slower, some need to keep a full book to work while some work on just trades. Your OMS depending on if youre using only market data sources may need to keep its own book to place orders on behalf of your subscribers if they lack information about various markets (think all the twitter trading bots these days for instance), etc.

If you look back at the above setup as well, you'll notice some interesting things. [tickerplant] -&gt; [cep subscriber] portion can stay the same for live trading or backtesting. This is huge. The only thing that changes here for backtesting is that if you're trying to backtest, you can take historical data (query it out of your hopefully column-store database) and push it into your tickerplant rather than having it come from a live feed through the feed handler. Your tickerplant and cep subscriber will never know the difference, so you can use the same exact code for backtesting as you can for live. On the other end, you obviously cant send historical orders to your live broker, so you need to code a simulated OMS that does the backtest simulation (another huge piece of software to code that is hard to do well). But, for backtesting, your setup is staying largely the same except those two end pieces. This means that testing/deving/deploying strats can be pretty rapid, and uses the same code base for live and historical, which helps you eliminate bugs and have to code everything twice.

Backtesting design: [historical mkt data db] -&gt; [tickerplant] -&gt; [mkt data subscribers/CEP] -&gt; [order management system simulator/backtester]

These are just a few of the many problems that you hit when trying to dev good infra. There are like a million more. Point was simply, it's complicated. And C++ is a good lang. I use a wide variety of languages depending on exactly whats going on and how fast the code needs to be. With a proper tickerplant design, youre using some ipc protocol so a subscriber can be coded in any language. Check out http://www.zeromq.org/ -- thats an excellent piece of software to use to make a tickerplant out of, think they even have a design for one in the docs if I recall. With that, your CEP subscribers can be in any language - perhaps pure C if you need the speed, perhaps .NET or Java if you dont (check out http://esper.codehaus.org/ for a Java implement of a CEP subscriber, nEsper for the C# port of that I believe). But I use C, C++, C#, python, R, x86 asm for a few very minor things, and a lang or two I can't mention here.

Not arguing w that at all, and you can't colo w IB afaik. Their API over WAN, VPN or CTCI on direct line only. If you colo at Nasdaq and clear through Lightspeed you're talking microseconds (which is where my actual low latency strats are). But yes, I suppose for IB I should have mentioned ""low-ish"" latency rather than actual low latency. So I'll add a caveat to the newbs - don't try to do ECN arb (or any other super-low-latency strat) or market-make (their cancel fees will kill you) the entire equity universe through IB. It won't work. They're not suitable for that.

My 50-100 reference was for WAN IB clearing for these guys probably using their API through IB gateway or TWS, which is how most would likely start. Doubt they're diving head first into ECN arb day one - they probably wouldn't be doing lowest latency stuff, most peeps start w some sort of trend following strat in my exp and you can work on those timescales w those. Trying to give advice for people starting out, not for other already pro algo traders.

But yes, finprogger is correct, IB would not be a suitable broker to use for a competitive ultra low-latency strat. They are too slow.

Since I've been doing this since late 03 I have colo machines in Chicago and NYC, and have direct exchange data feeds etc.

I mentioned in a prior post though, for someone starting out on algorithmic trading, I'd recommend Nanex for tick data and Interactive Brokers for your brokerage account. IB has a robust and easy to use API. It won't let you do the most low latency stuff bc you can't colo at the exchange and have to clear through their order management systems but if you are looking at opportunities that exist in the market in excess of 50ms it's probably a good place to start. If not, go Lightspeed imo, but that'll cost you on the colo/data a lot more.

Think I had to sign an NDA on pricing w them so can't get specific. Depends if you want realtime or just historical data. Historical obviously cheaper, realtime more. The prices aren't crushing though, one of cheapest tick data vendors around. You get pros and cons to that though - data is time stamped at 25ms and sent over WAN. But they also have self healing tapes w backfill etc so if your server knocks offline for a while you fill the gap when back up etc.

IB will get you in the ballpark but Lightspeed obviously for the more low latency stuff. You can colo w Lightspeed at Nasdaq and can get direct market data feeds etc. that's not something I'd recco for someone starting out... Expensive for most budgets. Once you get going though, worth it. IB will let you work with opportunities on the 50-100ms level.

I don't think telling these guys to go with NewEdge from day one and colo globally would really help anyone get started algo trading. Wouldn't have the capital or scale. Trying to give actual useful advice to them.",finance,1367723030

personalfinance,(CA) About to move into new apartment. Is it a good idea amid my student loans? I'm freaking out. Wall of text warning.,"Pretty stressed here. I'm all over the place, feeling dizzy/shaking. Have the appointment tomorrow to fill out paperwork unless we cancel. I apologize for the wall of text, if my thoughts are all over the place. **TL;DR: Is adding 2 hours of my life everyday worth losing out on nearly $400 of income?**

Long story ""short"": My SO and I are in the 'burbs are looking to move into the big city (Toronto) because we're both under 30 and dammit pretty soon we're gonna be popping out babies and moving back to the suburbs. I have 2 student loans: 1 federal ($20,792.76) and 1 student line of credit: ($18,870.95). I've been paying down the credit line like crazy, but I got into a small collision in April so it had to go up a bit to make room on my visa :\ . I also have 1 credit card (1,459.92 :\ ).

Right now we're renting 1 apartment (2 bed, 1 bath, 850sqf + parking+utils included) for a total of $1340/month. We rent out the 1 bedroom right now for $550. I have two jobs: I work contract based gigs though i'm on the look out for some more industry steady/permanent full time  work, and I work a retail service job with decent weekend hours. $10.25/hour. (I am however on leave until September, trying to get into a bigger company but I need a killer portfolio and I see a tutor $60-100) The deal:

* **NEW RENT**: $2270/month + hydro (budgeted $100) + $120 parking spot. 

**The Good**: Extra bathroom (SO has UC, super important), incredible location (super trendy area near every amenity possible, would walk everywhere), en suite laundry, lower gasoline bill, few compromises on square footage (slightly less storage), I get back 2 hours of my life every day that I lose in the commute which can go to portfolio, freelance gigs. It's amazing/beautiful. If I'm working industry gigs, I wont have a problem making the half rent payments of $1135 and putting the $750 to debts, plus an additional $650 payment. 

**The Bad**: More expensive. If I'm between contracts I have to work over 30+ hours a week at my retail gig which I might not get guaranteed. Gotta scrounge up some freelance gigs. More hustle/stress. If I can't transfer to a store in the city, I might have to commute to current location of store (same commuting costs, unlikely, but possible, kinda shitty because I like my team). 

**The Living Situation**: 3 people. Split 3 ways $756. SO would take care of parking, hydro and possibly groceries ($200/month, but with price matching, I could get it down to $100-$150). SO brings in net $1600/month, but growing steadily/exponentially in the next few months maybe (his service is doing well? he's a web dev, works from home). Could start to bring in an extra $500+ in the next month or so. Once his big service is done...well, it could be a couple thousand a month, but I can't bank on that yet because it hasn't happened yet &gt;_&gt;; 

If SO and I split the rent 2 ways and keep the tenant rent (it's a tenant agreement, btw, not roommate as we provide EVERYTHING, fully furnished room, etc) it's $1135 but I'd count the $720 as income towards my student loans. Things are looking up for him financially. We've discussed if he can afford to pay all of the rent/bills all of my income+tenant rent could go to paying back debts.

* **CURRENT SITUATION**: $1340 (going up to $1414 in august)

**The Good**: Spacious, quiet area, currently cheap. However, I split the rent 50/50 with SO right now ($670 right now) and count the $550 as income that goes directly to loans. I also just starting working in industry this year since I graduated last year. I'm making $600-$800 a week right now (currently $800) but they're super short contracts. My $800 one officially ends at the end of May, and *could possibly be extended* but there's no guarantee of that. Currently looking for next gig. When I work weekends at my retail job that's super close to my apartment I make an extra $400 a month. So if I continue living here, whether I'm working industry, or I'm in between contracts I'm in the black. Will always have student tenants because of proximity of college (awesome apartment, 5 min walk from school).

**The Bad**: This is really bad. I have a 2 hour commute to and from the city with my car and it's really, really draining. I spend anywhere from $60-90 a week on gasoline, not including regular maintenance due to added wear and tear.  Additionally, by the time I get home I'm so exhausted/drained I don't want to work on anything else (freelance gigs/adding to my portfolio, etc). My social life is non-existent because all of my friends live in the city. I'm constantly sitting. Laying down in bed, sitting for breakfast, sitting in car, sitting at work, repeat in reverse until I go to bed, wake up and do it again.

**The Living Situation**: 3 people. SO and I split the rent ($670 each, $550 tenant rent goes directly to loan)

I also have phone: $75 and gym: $45 but my new place has a gym so i wont renew when it's done. 

CAN SOMEONE TELL ME IF THIS IS A GOOD IDEA? SERIOUSLY I NEED SOMEONE OTHER THAN MY SO TELLING ME WE CAN DO THIS ;___; We go in tomorrow at 10am to sign out the preliminary paper work. If you've read this far, you're amazing. I'll be online all night working on freelance gig (+$800).

* Paid off minor utility debt, put all utilities on auto-pay to avoid future issues  
* Finally paid off lingering credit card debt  
* Able to use my one active credit card responsibly and pay off the full balance each month

I am back in school and now have new student loans (federal government only), but those will get worked on later as far as repayment. Outside of my current student loan, I am in a position to be able to become DEBT FREE by year's end. Wheee!

The good news is that a couple of those bills were cleared and forgiven later when a trip to the ER allowed me to apply for ""charity care,"" and the hospital went, ""Wow! You're practically destitute! All current and former bills you had with us are now gone! Poof! Feel better soon!"" 

But the bad news is that I may still owe money to some auxiliary medical offices associated with the ER. I do want to do the right thing and pay them for the treatment that saved my life.

personalfinance,Financial advice needed for a recent law school graduate who has a ton of debt and wants to start investing/saving for retirement.,"Financial advice needed please

I provide the following information because I would like to start saving for retirement but am unsure how to responsibly do that given my student loan debt.

Background:

I’m a recent law school graduate working in the public sector (judicial clerkship). The nature of this position is temporary and serves as a stepping stone to a career in either the private sector or public sector. Typically these clerkship positions are one to two years in length; however, I will be working in this capacity for three years based on my hiring agreement. It is important to know that although I’m a salaried federal employee, I don’t qualify for a 401(k) / Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) since I’m considered a temporary employee.

Student Loans:

To make this part short and sweet, my law school education was finance entirely using federal loans. The total amount is approximately $187,120.82. The average interest rate is approximately 7.25%. Here is a more detailed breakdown (1. $81,081.51– fixed 7.65%; 2. $44,361.13-fixed 6.55%; 3. $23,619.21-fixed 6.625%; 4. $38,058.97-fixed 7.75%). It’s important to note that all these loans are all eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, provided I meet other payment obligations, such as payment method and reporting requirements, (which I am).

Payment Options:

Last point I’ll make before asking my question. Given the fact that I am working in a public service position, and make a “public service income,” I am currently making minimal payments via the federal Income Based Repayment program (IBR). In short I am paying 15% of my AGI based on the previous year’s statement, which means very low and manageable payments (obviously interest is accumulating; which is may or may not be a factor. See below.)  

After my 3 year commitment working in this capacity I will use two career scenarios(for the sake of simplicity) that I will base my investment questions on.

Option 1: Work for a large law firm, where market rates begin at $160,000 a year in my area. Many firms differ on when they promote associates through the partnership track but one could reasonably expect to make $210,000 or more after 3-6 years in a big law firm and even more depending on whether a person makes partner. Since this is a private sector job, I will not qualify for any loan forgiveness. I will have to pay the entire loan balance and all the interest that has accumulated over the years.

Option 2: Continue to work for a public service qualifying job (such as District Attorneys’ office, U.S. Attorneys’ Office or any government agency) for 7 years, make IBR payments (15% of income) and take advantage of the 10 loan forgiveness program.  Market rates for these positions in my area are (starting $80,000 – 7-10yrs exp. $133,000-154,000).

Question:

Assuming I would be completely happy working in either field despite the difference in work hours and/or type of work, I am seeking advice on the following financial questions.  

1. If I KNOW I’ll go with option 1 right now, what do you recommend I do with my money (a) now and (b) when I start that job?

2. If I KNOW I’ll go with option 2 right now, what do you recommend I do with my money (a) now and (b) when I start that job?

3. If I DON’T know which option I will end up pursuing, what do you recommend I do with my money (a) now and (b) when I start that job?

Please let me know if I can provide any other information that would be useful. 

Also, if you have any suggestions on who can best provide me with an answer please feel free to suggest!!

personalfinance,Should I sell my house and buy a new one to spend less? [x-post from r/frugal],"I have just begun switching to a frugal lifestyle, as I am trying to secure my financial future...

Just recently swapped an Acura TSX for a Jetta TDi for lower payments and less fuel expenses (24 mpg premium gas vs 42mpg Diesel)... My fiancee and I have been eating more home-cooked food... I don't even recall the last time I bought new clothes :-/....

I have been working two jobs and one of them may end, hence the need to switch to frugal living.

Anyway, I bought a townhouse for 200k, financed for $1200 monthly payments. I then refinanced to 15 yrs at $1400 when the interest rates dropped... smart move... but with one of my jobs going away, I need to be even smarter about my expenses. It will be a drop from 97k to about 78k... but I am job-hunting (just got my master's in CompSci to go with my CompEng undergrad)

Now, the house was appraised last year at 220k, the house down the street with only about 100 more square feet sold for 220k recently, and I only owe about 162k. Would it be worthwhile for me to search for a new single-family home, possibly asking for 220k and settling at 200-210k, and going for a house in a lower range (i.e. 150-175k)? I figure my equity would be my down payment, so I would not owe much on the new home... also, I would be looking for a home a bit farther from work too (12 mile commute currently vs possibly a 20-35 mile commute)


Would this be a stupid move?

software,"Looking for an osx music organizer, with possible cloud features a bit like iTunes.","I am looking for a music organisation app for a mac with quite specific requirements. I have resorted to reddit after a fair time googling and trying out several apps.

My friend, who is a music teacher, will regularly import tracks, albums, sound effects, key changed duplicates and goodness knows into her iTunes library for work purposes. However, she is getting fed up of work tracks getting mixed in with the tracks she purchases for her personal consumption. As you can imagine, her library is getting slowly out of control.

So, I am looking for an app that will overcome this that she can use for her work stuff. But it should have the following features.

**Must Have**

* Playlist Support (hundreds)
* Add Tracks from iTunes &amp; local folders to playlists
* Ability to convert any files to MP3

**Would Like**

* Sync playlists to iPhone/web interface (dropbox?)
* Share playlists
* Clean modern mac style UI
* Keep track of file-type conversions and file edits


I understand that iTunes does pretty much all of this, but something separate is needed so personal life (iTunes) can be kept separate from her work as much as possible.

Thanks.

personalfinance,Advice Needed on How to Tax Shelter Second Income Stream,"Here's the rundown:

Salary at present job around 70k. Wife around 40k. Just acquired second ""job"" that will be paying 8k/year. It's techinically a salaried position so it is subject to normal taxes (i.e. no contracting, self-employed, etc). One issue I am dealing with is that the biweekly checks from this are so small they are not taking out any federal tax (they are taking out FICA, SS, and State).

What I want to do is take that entire 8k and ""remove"" it from my taxable income. 

I am not maxing my 401k yet but will in some form or fashion within the year (expected year end bonus will go all into 401k and should come close to maxing it with my current deferral (3%) + match (100% up to 3%)). Likewise with an IRA. This 8k will go to helping towards one of those goals. I see a couple options but want input on what I am missing.

Option 1: Up my deferral from salary to my company 401k by 8k/year thereby reducing my salary by 8k and filling in the gap with this new income. One concern here is how the lack of federal taxed being taken out of the 8k will come into play when my base income is reduced by 8k (and subsequently the taxes on that base are reduced proportionally). The other concern is that my bonus puts be over the 17,500 limit and then I am taxed at bonus rates on the excess of the bonus that is paid out because it can't be put into the 401k (which I'd like to avoid, but such is life).

Option 2: Work out some system with the second employer where the entire pre-tax amount is deposited into an IRA (up to the 5500 max). They have a retirement plan but it is quite shitty. In this scenario, I am left with 2500 of taxable income that I can't put into an IRA. 

Option 3: I could, I guess, throw the entire amount into their retirement plan and then roll it over into my base company's 401k. One problem with putting it into their retirement plan is (I think) that amount would count against my 17,500 yearly limit and I am back at option 1/square 1 anyway. However, it might be simpler to have the entire 8k just put into their retirment plan and then rolled over rather than allocate from option 1 and worry about tax implications on this new 8k.

Option 4: You tell me.

TL;DR: Have an extra 8k income from second job that I want to completely tax shelter. How should I do it.",finance,1367851373
personalfinance,30yo. Earning AUD$80k p/a. A single ‘investment’ property going nowhere. Where do I go from here? (AU),"Hi All, I had no idea reddit had a PF sub – was very pleased to find this and discover that it appears to be serious and helpful!

Anyway, as per the title – a quick background for me:

*Im 30yr’s old

*I earn AUD$83k + Super p/yr (Currently paying standard 9% into super currently ‘geared’ to a low-medium risk profile/rate of return).

*I own a single ‘investment’ property which I rent out, however as matter of lifestyle I rent a property elsewhere to live in. I’ve had my property for 3 years now and after a recent evaluation I discovered I have in fact likely lost money since I purchased it (value has decreased approximately 5% over 3 years). Taking into account all income and expenses from both my rental property (including tax breaks) and what I pay in rent myself - it essentially costs me next to nothing to hold my own property on an ongoing basis (excluding the aforementioned 5%!)

*I currently have approximately $300 p/week of disposable income - $100 of which I am paying of extra towards my mortgage in an offset account. The other $200 keeps me entertained and sane.

edit: I have no other significant personal debt (personal loans, credit cards etc)

My problem is that Im 30 and I kind of feel that I’m not really going anywhere fast. I’m curious as to whether I can do anything better with my money? Is it worth seeing a professional financial planner or am I too ‘small time’ to bother? Should I take a loss, sell my house and invest elsewhere or sit tight and hope that my property will grow? Do I look at investing more in Super? Financial markets? Do I sell my house and spend my mortgage repayments on drugs and strippers and deal with having nothing when Im 55yrs old? Where do I even start!

personalfinance,Starting a new job this fall and need to buy a car.,"Hello /r/personalfinance!

This October, I am starting a new job and I need to buy a car. 

Job Details:
Currently I'm a contractor living in Center City Philadelphia. My new job is in King of Prussia (not in the city). In addition this is a salary position so I am loosing about 7k in yearly but am getting benefits/grad school money/PTO. As a result of the new job's location, I need to buy a car and move to a more car friendly area (and cheaper). I would like a new/lightly used car. Ideally either a '13 Mazda3 or a '13/'14 Mazda CX-5 ranging from 17K - 25K. 

Question time:

Currently CX-5's are listed at around 22K, come October will I be able to see a price drop? Are there any Mazda deals similar to a Columbus Day Sale/etc that I could take advantage of? 

Is a low interest rate a good thing (i.e. 0.9% APR)? 

I plan on keeping the car till it dies and won't be jumping ship 5 years later so its really important to me that I get the car that I'm happy with and can afford.

Assets:

* $40K in 401K
* $6000 in HSA account
* $5100 in a traditional IRA
* $7000 in checking/savings

Debts/expense: 

* $18000 loan at 5% interest rate
* $10000 loan at 5.5% interest rate
* $5500 per year for living expenses (including rent+utilities+food--I don't drive or have a kid so that's why this is so low)

For the current 2013 year, I have directed $1000 to be put per paycheck (bimonthly) into my 401K until the max is reached.  My firm is profit-sharing so there is no matching; there is just a specified amount that is put into my account at the end of each fiscal year.  For the 2012 year it was about $2000.  I am not vested till I'm there for 5 years, which I do not know if I will be so I am not relying on this amount.

For the IRA account, I didn't plan accordingly in 2011 so did not make any contribution.  For 2012, I basically just put $5000 in it on April 10th of this year (so i didn't make monthly contributions like I did w/ my 401K).  Should I be making earlier contributions to my IRA before my 401K? Should I do a Roth instead? 

Should I be doing something else instead of maximizing my 401K since my company doesn't match?  Should I pay loans first instead? 

I also maximize my hsa contributions as well.  Should I do this instead of investing somewhere else?

personalfinance,What's your take on this situation?,"I'm a 27-year-old single graphic designer living in Western Pennsylvania and I wanted to get this subreddit's take on my somewhat bleak financial picture. 

I made about $43k last year through a full-time design position (37k) with freelancing on the side (6k). My income this year will probably be about the same I imagine, although freelance might fall off.

My general debts are the following:

* $94k for my education (bachelor's degree graduate 2008 (original cost $73k); $545/month)
* $57k mortgage (purchased house in 2012 for $60k @ 3.5% 30 years; $565/month)
* $7k credit debt (pay random amounts)
* $6,700 owed to parents (borrowed $6,500 for closing cost via home equity loan from parents (@ 10%); paid down to about $4k now; also owe parents about $1,700 for a few other things) (usually about $200 to home equity loan; $150 to parents)

Other facts:

* Embarrassingly, I have no savings, no assets, and no retirement plan. 
* I have no car payment at the moment (father helped me out with a car; I take care of the general maintenance costs).
* Credit score was 666 as of 4/2013 likely because I'm carrying balances on the credit cards close to their limits; never missed a payment on anything.
* Have 0% promotions on mostly all credit cards.
* I am paying my federal student loans via income-based repayment.
* My student loan payment will be reevaluated this month and I believe it may go up to $785/month. 
* I had no cosigners for any of my debts; all are my responsibilities.
* I've been writing down everything I buy and adding the monthly sum. I don't really use the information but it lets me get a general idea of which months are more expensive, and when I buy more gas.

I'm a pretty reckless, self-destructive spender as I've had next to no education on this subject, just a terrible influence through my father from where I learned to be acquisitive. Had I been wiser about college, I would've looked elsewhere before going to such an expensive for-profit school. I really don't have any financial goals, or even ever imagine myself getting out of debt because of the student loans. None of this really bothers me as I'm grateful for what I have now. I have the home I've always wanted and believe I would only ever move if I couldn't find work in the area.

personalfinance,What should I do with this petty $300 a month after expense?,"** Current Situation ** 
I have been sucked into what feels like a lifetime of debt due to student loans. I'm pretty sure that I have been through just about every emotion that comes with the debt. Anger, denile, anger again, exceptance, and attack mode. I've been out of college for a little over two years now, and it was really hard at first, because I was having a difficult time finding a job. Well I now have a well paying job and I make enough to pay off my loans plus an additional amount each month.  Currently I owe at this point 80k for a degree in software engineering. So here I am applying almost 1875 a month to my loans and will hopefully have them
payed off within the next 3.5-4 years or 42 months approx. Basically, I am applying the snow ball effect, and so far it has been working really well. (I've already paid off my first loan, nice.) On top of that, I am also putting away about 300-450 dollars away in my emergency fund. So that's all well and good, I feel very fortunate that I am able to make larger payments to my loans, make all my living expenses, and put money into my emergency
fund, while still having money left over.  Here's my dilemma though, I have this odd impatience when it comes to the other side of the coin and that is wealth and building wealth. At the moment, after all my
expenses, I still have at least 300 bucks left over each month that I would like to do something with. I would really like to put that money to work in an index fund, but I feel like everyone saying, ""Oh pay as much towards your loans first before investing"" I think that is sound advice, but I feel that I am missing out on some powerful compounding interest. To put it bluntly, I feel like I want to ignore that advice and start investing that money, even though it's a small amount, I want to get started. Am I being stupid thinking this? It's 10k over the life of my loans that I could put to work and feel like I am starting something.

EDIT: interest rates and amount due

Due: $2050 @6.8% $50 min monthly payment

Due: $3900 @6.3% $58 min monthly payment

Due: $8500 @5.25% $108 min monthly payment

Due: $23150 @2.9% $150 min monthly payment


Total min amount: $791 + (Additional $500 every two weeks towards smallest loan.) Averages out to $1875 a month that I am paying now.

EDIT 2: changed 3 years to 4 years, typo on the calculator. Thanks for pointing that out ResoluteMan.

EDIT 3: Thanks everyone for the help. I guess I should consider remaining patient until I am almost 100% out of debt. So for now I will be diverting the additional funds towards my loans.",finance,1367803233

I am trying to fix my finances. I tend to have issues with late bills and I want to fix that.

*  I also have a ton of credit card debt that I am axing out.  As in about 4K in debt that feels like it will never go away.
*  I get paid weekly, and have $50 of every check go into an emergency account (because otherwise I have issues with saving). It has its own debit card and is not associated with my ""main"" credit union account just so I never touch this money.  I end up clearing this most months to put extra on credit cards.
*  Around 40k student loan debt in most of a degree I never finished due to my current job.  Those go into repayment this June and I intend to make the minimum until credit cards are paid off.
*  I do want to go to school but my longterm goal is to axe this debt ASAP and pay for school in cash rather than loans.
*  I have absolutely no savings because the credit cards seriously stress me out and I admit I would rather pay those off first.  They all have interest rates between 15 and 30 percent. I am paying extra on the 30% one and minimum on the rest but I admit it is disheartening because I feel I am getting nowhere.
*  Pets: Cat and dog cost me an average of $100/month TOTAL.  Once a year, they cost me $400 which when figured over 12 months comes to an extra $33.  So pet total budget is $143 per month, and I am typically able to stay well below that.

Here are the steps I am taking:

*  Got a room mate so the 1225 of rent will be cut in half.  I actually recently moved here so it has been a bit more expensive since I had to get basics ie towels, a frying pan, and other basics.  I cheaped on basically everything but the toilet paper - not going for that sandpaper crap.
*  [Made a god damn spreadsheet so I can see what bills have to be paid from what account.]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As7NjoXEyGPYdDROQjRvRDVqRGJBY3VsZnNpU0NIVlE&amp;usp=drive_web)
*  Tax return will be $1600 and I do intend to put part in savings and the rest onto debt.  Is this a good plan?  I would probably want to put it on my highest balance card to knock most of it out (though it would not cover the whole thing...). I am adding a second sheet to my spreadsheet with my credit card details so that maybe I can get some advice of what to do.
*  Misc bills include a Netflix subscription and medical bills. I have crappy insurance so I pay out of pocket for a monthly doctor visit and prescription. Otherwise that is really it, and I like to budget around twenty bucks for going out.

Part of the issue is I am paid weekly and so sometimes I come out with 600 more than the previous month. I want to budget that so that I can pay off these credit cards.  Or maybe it should go to savings?  I guess I just want some feedback you see where else I can cut back.  Plus I feel I already live pretty frugally...  So it is even more disheartening that I can't do anything with the 50k/year I make. Which is my fault for poor decisions in college.

Anyway typed this up on mobile so just ask if I need to clarify anything. Thanks!


**EDIT**:  Just to emphasize, I can't get rid of the car.  I tried for over a year, and I'd need to come up with several thousand to be rid of it.  I need a mode of transportation that is RELIABLE, and I owe more on it than it is worth.  Again, already looked into selling it, I can't.

* Work cafe is brought up often.  It costs around the same amount for me to eat at the work cafe as it would be to have breakfast/lunch at home, and it is a well rounded, healthy meal.  I have a certain disorder that requires me to eat relatively healthy, so I literally cannot survive without a certain type of diet that would otherwise be very expensive.

* Cat/dog - I get it.  Get rid of them, even though I'm otherwise alone without them.

* **Again, let me emphasize I'm trying to figure out what to do with my $1600 tax return.**  I want to put it toward credit cards, but I'm not entirely sure WHICH ONES to throw it on or if it should go directly into savings.  My assumption is my higher APR, higher balance card rather than knocking out the smaller cards.

*  In addition, figuring out what to do with months with an extra $600, such as this month (which is actually an extra $500 since I just moved and had to deal with getting basic necessities such as detergent - sorry, I find it pretty hard to live with dirty clothes...)  My thought was to continue snowballing it onto credit cards vs. just sticking it into savings.  Once my room mate moves in, this will move to an excess of $600 and $1200, every other month.

*  How would I properly budget when I am paid once a week - I am used to being paid twice a month, and I wish to reform how I look at my money so that I can get myself out of this mess and avoid being in it again.

**EDIT 2** People appear to be fixating on certain information that I really can't help and don't have control, so now I'm just not even receiving the feedback I need.  Snipping it out.

     I created this throwaway to get some advice for a recent college grad about to start his big boy job. I've read a few posts here and am pretty blown away by how knowledgeable everyone is, so I figured I'd detail my situation and see how bad everyone thinks it is and what I need to do to get off on the right foot.

**My current debts are:**

* $25000 personal loan @ 2.9% (payments begin Nov)

* $154 credit card debt #3 @0.0% (min payment $19/mo, 0.0% expires in Nov, goes to 8% - tire center charge card)
* $906 balance at University @ $30/mo

**Total: $30910 in debt**

**Current Situation**

* Monthly Income - $1552/mo
* Rent + Utils - $425
* No Car payments (paid off)

This is until July, when I go active duty in the US Air Force.

When I start training this July, my income will be: 

* $3007/mo (pre-tax)

This could, and should be higher based on flight training pay, housing allowance if I move off base, etc, but this is the only guaranteed pay right now.

When I start Active Duty, I will be going through flight school and shouldn't have any housing costs unless I elect to move off base. Should I move off base, my housing allowance would be about $800/mo and I would get a roommate to attempt to live off about $500/mo rent &amp; utils. My question is pretty basic:

Given the above information, what should my course of action be moving forward? I obviously want to get this debt off my back as soon as possible and have been reading all the Dave Ramsey I can get my hands on, but I didn't know if there were any plans of action that you all would suggest.

It is as follows:

12000 on a legit student loan        PMT:  100

4000 on a Credit Card(maxed)        PMT: 100

Rented Furniture                         PMT:  140(35/wk)

This does not include rent, utilities, phone, insurance, food and occasionally buying toilet paper so the night watchman doesn't think I shit at work all the time(I only do it on the clock). 

Clearly I have made massive, massive mistakes in the past. I'm attempting to work through them, but I am currently about 2-3 weeks behind on bills, and I'm finding very little wiggle room. I know I made my bed, but I swear to all that is holy I'm having insane amounts of trouble keeping my head above water. I do want to pay this debt off, and I know it will feel absolutely wonderful. I also know some will think that the consolidation is merely a handout, but I really think I'm flirting with disaster. I just don't know how to fix it.

Would this be a terrible idea? Would it be even legal to do so, if I enrolled full-time? My current degree is in Business, and it did not help me get my current position at all.

business,Gold Bells of Alarm?,"Golden Doldrums

After a raging bull run for 12 years, gold prices across the world fell spectacularly. In New York, gold meant for delivery in June fell by as much as 9.7% in just one day – greater than the 9.6% fall in February 1983. On April 12, 2013 gold dropped below $1500 an ounce for the first time since July 2011 and the nadir of $1380 came on April 16. It has recovered to above $1400 an ounce since then.

This time the drop came despite bad economic news. Such reports are usually a signal for more investment in gold, for other assets classes are expected to go down. Furthermore, the long term fundamentals for gold are strong at present. What went wrong then? Is this decline a short lived phase or is it the signal of a greater collapse?

Suppressors of Gold

Probably, the most important cause is a hint by the US Federal Reserve of an early discontinuation of Quantitative Easing (QE) or money printing. The Fed prints $85 billion per month to pump up a falling bubble economy. Discontinued QE transforms into lower inflation and lower prospects for gold.

Compulsions of a global, bubble economy will prevent such discontinuation, for the asset bubbles in American economy and in the linked global economy will collapse and bring down the whole global economy.

Reports of possible sale of gold reserves by Cyprus to raise €400 million is another cause. Cyprus has to raise €7 billion by itself in order to qualify for the bailout package from agencies European Union and the International Monetary fund (IMF).

Cyprus doesn’t hold much gold reserves. But, if other troubled economies with greater gold reserves such as Italy, Portugal, Greece, and Spain follow Cyprus, gold will certainly tumble down. This cause is speculative, but markets operate more on sentiment than on anything else.

Emerging economies such as China and India create over half of the demand for gold. If these nations grow slowly the demand for gold comes down. With indicators pointing to a continuation of the current global economic crisis, such a reduction in demand is on the cards. Again, this is speculation.

Talking of speculation, the World Gold Council (WGC) blames speculative traders in the futures market of gold for the drop. These speculators were probably acting on the assumption of an imminent fall in price. Use of ETFs or paper gold and futures trading simplifies the purchase and sale of gold thereby exaggerating its rise and fall.

Haruhiko Kuroda, the new governor of Japan’s central bank launched a $1 trillion ‘Yen Carry Trade’ Program whereby cheap yen were made available for investment into higher yielding overseas assets including gold. Instead, Japanese investors have started to bring money from their overseas holdings into the Japanese market for investment and hence the reverse effect.

Considering the fact that Japan is in a prolonged economic slump, the increased vigor of investment into the Japanese market will not last for long and neither will the fall in price of gold.

Sound Long Term Outlook

Ever since the first grade inflation in Athens in 407 B.C., gold has always done well in times of economic distress. Even as investors withdrew from gold ETFs and futures, demand for physical gold surged, most notably in India, China, and Dubai.

Central Banks around the world are also expected to remain buyers and drive up the demand as the global economy sinks further in the quicksand of bubbles. Despite such minor hiccups, the price of gold is headed only one way – upwards.",finance,1367935581
business,Plunge Protection Team (PPT),"Interventions and manipulations in the stock market are not unheard of. The landscape in these markets changes frequently and requires a foresight laden proactive approach in order to maintain relevance. It goes without saying that not all such activities are strictly within the boundaries of law and neither are all of them geared towards the larger public interest.

Raging inflation of the 1970s was a result of elimination of the connection between gold reserves and dollars, and this spilled over the next decade. The 1980s saw the cat and mouse game of the inflation-deflation cycle as the limits of monetary policy in controlling the cyclic market fluctuation stood exposed. The crash came on ‘Black Monday’ – October 19, 1987.

Taking stock of this crash as well as of the repeated market fluctuations of the decade, the ‘Working Group on Financial Markets’ was established through a presidential directive in 1988. The group was nicknamed as the Plunge Protection Team (PPT), for its task was to intervene in the market to prevent stock market crashes and obstruct the rise of strategic goods such as gold.

Towards this end, resources were made available to this group that consisted of the US Treasury Secretary, chairmen of the Federal Reserve – the US central bank, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC), chiefs of some of the colossal Wall Street banks, and some others.

Unsurprisingly, the group kept away from the glare of the media and the public and came into the limelight only after the market crash induced by the September 11, 2001 terrorist strikes. Evidence of its market intervention activities is now available in the form of minutes from its meetings and from congressional testimony.

Gold and dollar usually move in the opposite directions in the international market. A strong dollar and a buoyant stock market attract domestic and foreign investors and keep the American economy afloat despite 70% of it being dependent on consumption. A booming stock market not-very-strong gold is, therefore, in the interest of the American economy.

A common technique employed to preclude the rise of gold is the sale of gold reserves by central banks such as the Federal Reserve. Back in the 1960s, the London Pool was a multinational institutional mechanism to maintain the price of gold in relation to the dollar.

It is widely whispered that gold, oil, and other key assets were held down to influence the results of the November 2006 elections. This is said to have been done through large scale sale of these assets in the futures markets by brokerage firms at the behest of the government. However, evidence regarding this allegation is limited at present.",finance,1367933851
personalfinance,Maintaining an emergency fund vs. paying off student debt?,"Hey all,

Long story short I'll be graduating in a couple weeks and I'm looking for some guidance on paying off the dreaded student loans. Here's a quick rundown of my situation:


Student Loans (all federal, half at 3.4% and half at 6.8%):       $33,500

Starting salary (in October):      $55,000

Current Savings account:         $9,000


I'll be living at home for probably a year and my car should be fine in that time so I don't see myself having any major expenses (not that people see them coming).

I am debating whether or not to use virtually all of my savings ( probably $8,000) and paying off a chunk of that debt right away or if I should keep a lot of it so I can have an already established emergency fund when I begin working. I've read numerous times on here and appreciate the importance of an emergency fund so I feel like it'd be great to have one established pretty much instantly. On the other hand, I know student loan debt is something that many people advocate paying down fast and aggressively. What does PF think?

Edit:

Thanks for all the input everyone, I really do appreciate it (this sub is always great). I like the idea of taking a little piece from everyone's advice. I think my best course of action will be to not begin payment until the grace period expires and then use all but $2000-$3000 of my savings to pay some down instantly. As a 22 year old with no real expenses and having various support channels if necessary, I certainly don't need $8000-9000 sitting around but will still keep a smaller emergency fund. After that I plan to put virtually all of my take home pay to those loans until they are no more.",finance,1367931576
business,"How to make Stealing Legal – yours truly, Fed Reserve","$85 BILLION a month fueling the growing Global Currency Bubble, essentially stealing from us through devaluing our dollar… legally!

Contrary to popular misconception, the fact that the US economy will be the least hit by busting of the world’s bubble economies will not be good for the dollar. The reason for this is that the exchange rate between currencies is a not entirely a reflection of the relative performance of the economies – it primarily depends on the simple rule of supply of demand.

Demand for the dollar comes from:

     Liquidity Supply: the US has been supplying liquidity to global markets since 1952 at least – it sells safe liquid debt assets such as treasury bonds and invests into risky assets that have longer maturity periods such as equity and direct investment

This explains why the dollar is the reserve currency of the world and why US debt instruments are regarded as safe. During the panic that followed the collapse of leading investment banks in early 2008, the demand for US Treasury Bonds increased because they were the only investment avenue regarded safe enough

    Investments into American Assets that requires conversion of currencies into dollars and, therefore, creates a demand for dollars

Busting bubbles in the American economy will hurt investor sentiments as they stop getting huge returns on their investments. They will then start to sell their dollar denominated assets and seek safer and more productive investment avenues, mostly in Europe. Initially, investors will merely stop buying dollar denominated assets followed by sustained sale and finally followed by panic sale.

But because the US provides liquidity to the global markets, because it is the largest economy in the world that is also much diversified, and because of the sheer volume of its imports and exports, the dollar will continue to be among the most widely traded currencies in the world.

Collapsing multi bubble in the global economy will be good for gold as it appreciates in comparison to falling values of global currencies. Apart from economic reasons, gold is a much favored item in many cultures around the world, especially in Asia and the Middle East. India purchases about 20% of the world’s gold as compared to US that purchases only 10% of the total – the same as is done by an economic minnow such as Turkey.

A gold bubble, therefore, will be a natural consequence of these developments. This too will bust one day or the other. But before that, it will present huge wealth transfer opportunities for the intellectual, proactive, and decisive investor. This is precisely the undervalued asset class that was referred to in the earlier part of the chapter.

Decline of the dollar and rise of gold is inevitable as wads and wads of dollars are printed. The covert sales of gold to maintain the value of the dollar cannot go on forever because the gold reserves in the world are finite. Right now, gold is the undervalued class.

The billion dollar question is: are you ready to take the informed plunge?",finance,1367930048
business,The Mother of all Bubbles,"If nothing succeeds like success, nothing fails like failure.

Upward and downward spirals are a part of life as they are for an economy. A host of factors are expected to combine and pull down the US economy in a downward spiral starting with end 2008. And unless, fundamentally sound economic measures are initiated, hell will break loose in what most experts predict 2014-2016.

Falling prices of real estate and inflated stocks coupled with fall in discretionary spending and private debt will systemically cause foreign investors to pull out of these sectors. This will reduce demand and, therefore, the value of the dollar. Without investment, production of goods and services – the basic economic activity – will slow down, regardless who won the Presidential election. Naturally, wealth and employment creation will decline. Government has already aggravated the situation by borrowing to fund stimulation of economic activity through state or state sponsored spending – leading to increased debt and deficits that cause inflation. Our sick economy will scare away investors and complete the downward spiral.

Bursting of bubbles or the sudden fall in the price of certain entity is very difficult to predict. Part of the problem lies with living in denial. When the price of an entity is on the rise, people refuse to see beyond the obvious, just as they regard the calm before the storm to last forever.

I believe, the US economy is headed for a disaster in between now – 2016ish as the dollar falls continuously and foreign investors resort to panic sale of their investments in the dollar denominated assets. The government will then be left with a huge debt that was availed to fight the economic slowdown and the world refuses to finance a defaulting borrower.

One of the Problem: Too much foreign investments in U.S. Assets

Any asset that can lose its price value is a bubble. People invest in those assets whose price is likely to rise so that they can profit by selling it in future. Non-American, foreign investors can invest in American assets if they convert their money into dollars. Such foreign investment, therefore, creates a demand for dollars.

Now, the price of all entities – assets, goods, services, currencies etc. – rise when the demand for them is greater than their available supply. Foreign investment creates a demand for dollars increasing its price value. Relative values of currencies depend much less on the relative strengths of the economies that they represent.

Till the early 1980s, the demand for dollars was due to a growing US economy and rising productivity. Expecting greater returns, foreigners invested into US assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate and other dollar denominated entities. Markets function largely on sentiment or perception. If the price of assets is ‘expected’ to rise, investors flock to purchase that asset and vice versa. With foreign investors flocking to US assets, their prices went up and demand for dollars pushed up the dollar’s price.

These created a ‘multi-bubble economy’ where prices of assets and of the dollar rose due to increasing foreign investment. 4 such bubbles currently exist in the US economy:

     Housing (yes still… popped but partially still inflated)
    Stocks
    Private Debt
    Discretionary Spending

These were on the rise and, to a certain extent, aided the economy. Increased discretionary spending by people creates demand for goods and services and stimulates production that drives the economy. Similarly greater borrowing for capital and personal needs respectively create business and demand that further drive the economy.

When overdone, increased spending and debt become counterproductive as they can respectively cause inflation (due to rising demand) and bankruptcy. And when one chip collapses, a contagiously negative market sentiment ensures a downward chain reaction.

Breaking it down – our current situation:

This has been happening since the housing bubble collapsed in late 2007. Default on mortgages led to foreclosures of homes and brought the housing prices crashing down. Non-performing subprime mortgages had been packaged into securities and sold in globally connected capital markets by investment banks. Now, even tho stocks seems to be going up, it will have a significant correction due to the trillions of QE dollar pumped in by the Feds.

With fears of a recession running high, spending and borrowing automatically came down, therefore decreasing interest incomes across the board. The third and fourth bubble busting. These areas were no longer regarded and productive foreign investors pulled out with two results that will further aggravate the situation:

    Decline of Dollar as its demand decreased. From a high of 87 cents to a Euro in 2000, the dollar has declined to $1.4 to 1 Euro. It is not even necessary for net funds to flow out of the US economy for the dollar to lose out. Even if the net present inflow of $2bn a day is reduced to, say, $1bn a day, the still dollar falls.

    Rising Debt and Deficits as the government struggles with a malignant economy. At end 2009, the debt is touch $11 trillion. This is less than the US GDP, but more than five times the tax income that is used for debt repayment.

Aggravating the situation is the stimulus packages worth $12.1 trillion handed out for economic recovery. Governments is suppose spend and invest in infrastructure and manufacturing during economic slowdowns, enabling people to earn money that they can spend to create demand and stimulate the economy. Instead, government choose to print money which is inflationary and increase deficits.

The deficit is already at $16 trillion as of 7/2012 and deficits are inherently inflationary. With debts, they reduce the credit worthiness of the borrower and lenders refuse to lend or do so at exorbitant rates – both further increase debt and deficit. A debt of $20-$25 trillion is estimated to be the credit limit for the US when lenders refuse credit or charge sky-high interest.

I don't know much about it, and I need to enroll. I tend to ramble on selfposts, so I'll try to keep it short. Some information about me:

Age: 23 years old
Pay: ~$1900/month after taxes, expected to go up
Total expenses for bills/rent/loans: ~$850
Current debts: Student loans 13k, CC 1k, misc 1k
Current savings: 0, zilch, nil, nadda. I was out of work for 3 months, and my car decided to explode on me. Between falling behind in rent, loans, bills, and borrowing a little cash, I'm still in the process of getting caught up. All of my money has been going towards that.

That gives a little bit about my finances...now about my 401k. My company matches 50% of my contributions up to 6%. I also am able to invest in a Roth 401k (which I have NO clue what it is...but I read that I should invest in it if I can), and I know I want to have a healthy 401k for retirement. 

How much do I invest? My current setup is 7% before tax 401k, and 3% Roth 401k. I did 10% total because that's how much has been coming out of my paycheck each payday so far to pay for my gaming license, so I literally have never seen the last 10% of my paycheck, and cannot possibly miss it. 

My main concern is that I will be contributing too much early on, and it will put more strain on me being caught up. Also, once I get my smaller debts out of the way, I'd like to just flatout destroy that pesky student loan debt early on, without much interest effecting it (not that the interest rates are too high...I just hate interest)

Also, for the asset allocation...I had NO clue what to invest in, but my limited knowledge of general investments told me to diversify. I put 30% spread across 6 lifestyle portfolios, 5% in a bond asset, and the rest spread evenly across stocks/index stocks. Was this wise? 

I appreciate any and all advice. My personal philosophy is that retirement should be the best time of our lives... as kids we have all of the time in the world, but no money. As adults we have money, but no time...as retired people we have both (and hopefully energy!).",finance,1367927791

Foiling Phishing With Authentication
In its new report on using e-mail authentication to fight phishing attacks, BITS offers a list of best practices and recommendations, including expanded use of the DMARC security protocol.
BITS, the technology policy division of The Financial Services Roundtable, believes that the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance protocol plays a key role in mitigating phishing schemes.
DMARC standardizes how e-mail receivers perform e-mail authentication by providing a uniform reporting mechanism that's built on reputation.
""DMARC is pretty helpful in a couple of different areas,"" says Andrew Kennedy, senior program manager for BITS' security initiatives, in an interview with Information Security Media Group [transcript below].
Kennedy sees DMARC as an overlay of the Sender Policy Framework [SPF] and DomainKeys Identified Mail [DKIM] protocols, which aid in e-mail authentication.
""If there was an authentication failure for one of those protocols, it leaves you in the lurch if you don't have a policy in place to deal with that, and DMARC helps close the gap there,"" he says.
Also in the interview, John Carlson, executive vice president of security programs at BITS, stresses that an essential component when fighting phishing is for banking institutions and their business partners and customers to follow similar authentication strategies. ""It requires extensive collaboration from many different groups within the company and outside in order to implement these controls,"" he says.
During this interview, Carlson and Kennedy discuss:
     All of the e-mail protocols that address phishing attacks and how the protocols work in tandem;
    Why spoofed websites are increasingly concerning; and
     Steps banking institutions are taking to get business-partner buy-in for the DMARC initiative.
At BITS, Carlson works with members to strengthen the security and resiliency of financial services through best practices and strategies for secure IT systems infrastructures, products and services. He also collaborates with the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council for Critical Infrastructure Protection and Homeland Security, or FS-SCC, and co-chairs its Threat and Vulnerability Assessment Committee. He re-joined BITS in December 2011 after serving as a managing director at Morgan Stanley.
Kennedy, now the program lead for BITS' security initiatives, previously served as project manager for the BITS Vendor Management Program. He interned at BITS in 2006 and worked as an IT professional and security consultant in the biotech and software industry in California.
E-Mail Authentication Guidelines
TRACY KITTEN: Before we get into some of the details, could you talk a little bit about what prompted BITS to update the guidelines that it first issued about e-mail authentication back in 2009?

I'm a 26 year old federal civil servant earning $75k and striving for a promotion to $89k by the end of 2013. Monthly, I'm contributing ~$300 to get the 5% 401k match and contributing $600 to Roth, currently totaling ~$25k. I only have about $600 in a few individual stocks. I have $10k in a savings account as an emergency fund, and about $3k in the checking account. I have no outstanding debt other than monthly credit card bills which I have always and will always pay off completely (while taking advantage of credit card rewards points earning potential). My credit rating is about 800.

I live in the heart of DC splitting rent with two friends - my portion comes to $1150 per month. Utilities total ~$150 per month. I typically spend about $200 per month on entertainment around the city (concerts, sporting events, movies), and about $700 on food/dining (groceries, restaurants, beer/wine). One thing I learned here on personalfinance is that the best way to save money is by cutting spending. I fully intend to do that, but I'm very much enjoying the city lifestyle these days. I sold my car in the fall, allowing me to shift that expense (altogether close to ~$500!) to enjoying the city around me a bit more and saving a bit more.

My savings goals include: house down payment in 3-4 years (can't imagine I could make it any sooner), a mutual fund (??), and plane tickets every so often to visit family and travel elsewhere.

So here is where I ask for a sanity check from you guys and gals: Are my spending habits inherently contradictory to my savings goals? Am I killing my financial future by continuing to live in the city? 

And I guess the biggest question of all: is it better to spend the money I earn or to save it for a higher degree of financial security?

personalfinance,Refi rental home? Need advice please.,"So, we had a house in a marginal neighborhood in Atlanta and the value got hammered in the bust. While interest rates were low and values down we bought a new house in a nicer established neighborhood and are renting the old house. 

The old house is financed with an ARM and a Heloc. We owe ALOT on it compared to the value. We have a good renter and we want to do a short sale with her and we are investigating options if that falls through. As I see it we can do a few things. 

1. Refinance the home to a 30 year fixed rate (4.4% is what we were offered). This would lower our first mortgage payment about $40 month and get us away from the uncertainty of the ARM. It would involve closing costs of about 3000 though. And the Heloc stays as is. 

2. Keep current ARM and hope interest rates don't go up until we can unload the house. 

3. Mail the bank the keys. While not optimal this would not be too tough for us because only one of us is on the first house loan so the other person would not take a credit hit. Bad news is we would have to get rid of the tenant and we like her. 

So the questions I'm asking are: What would you do and do the refi numbers seem to make sense? Is it a good option if we decide to stick with the house?

Our main goal right now is to be able to buy a house, as we want to start having kids in about 3 years.  We also want to do the best we can to invest for retirement.  There's such an overload of information here that I was hoping to get some targeted advice.  I'll start with a summary:

Me: early-mid 20s, 80k salary, ~10k in bonuses, somewhere from 10-50k in self-employment income

Her: early-mid 20s, 45k salary, ~5k in bonuses, ~10k in self-employment income

So our total income is somewhere from 160-200k, but probably on the lower side of that.

Debt: 15.5k in student loans that range from 5% to 6.8%.

Investments: We each started our Roth IRAs this year and made the full 2012 contributions, so right now we have about 11k.  She has a 401k that matches fully on the first 3% and half on the next 3%, my job does not offer any 401k at all.  There's no money in the 401k yet, only because she has just started her job.

Liquid: We have about 10k in the bank which should be sufficient as a three-month emergency fund.

Right now we live in a high cost-of-living city in the US and spend $1900 on rent alone.  We have two dogs, so to get a pet-friendly place with any kind of yard we couldn't really pay much less.  At the end of the year, we plan on moving to the PNW to be closer to family (our jobs are remote and can come along with us), so we can definitely reduce our living expenses then.  Unfortunately, we cannot move to Washington in order to escape state income taxes, as our companies are not willing to incur the B&amp;O tax that would come along with our residency.  So we are thinking about somewhere in the Portland, OR area.

So currently our money allocation priorities after needs are as follows: Her 401k up to company match, then student loan debt, then...we aren't sure.  We could hit the contribution limit on her 401k.  We probably would fund our Roths (assuming we don't exceed the AGI limits), although from what I read I might be in a tax bracket where it would make more sense to contribute to a regular IRA instead.  But I also hear about how it is good to diversify the taxable status of your retirement income.

Then there's this goal of saving for a house.  I'm not really questioning whether to do it at all.  I understand home ownership is a lifestyle choice, and as someone who works from home and whose main priority in life is raising a great family, it is definitely what I want.  Looking at housing prices in Portland, I'm thinking that we'll want to buy something around 350k, which I assume means we'll need 75k or so saved up for the down payment and closing costs.  But how to save up this money?  I've read that you can take contributions to a Roth IRA out penalty-free after the account has existed for 5 years, and this would be a great way to save for a house while not losing the opportunity to grow that money, but I don't want to necessarily take from retirement money.  We could just set up taxable investment accounts, but I hear that this is a risky idea for anything less than a three year timetable.  Really I have no idea if we should be trying to buy a house in less than three years or not.  Everyone keeps talking about how mortgage rates will go back up in 2015, but doesn't that also mean that housing prices will fall?  Finally, I know that we could just stick money into a high-yield savings account, but interest rates on that are so poor that I feel like it is wasted opportunity.

So in summary, my questions are: How much should we put into my partner's 401k and our Roth IRAs (or potentially IRAs)?  And how should we be saving for a house down payment?

Thanks all!

I'm starting graduate school in the fall, and while savings will cover part of the bill, I'm still looking at $20,000-$30,000 in loans when all is said and done.

Now that Stafford loans are no longer subsidized for graduate students, would it be more economical to pursue a private loan? I have good credit and my parents (who have impeccable credit) would be willing to co-sign, so I've been wondering if that would make a private loan more competitive.

However, I've also heard that private loans can be tricky to navigate, so I thought I'd ask for advice here first. Can anyone recommend reputable companies or comparison tools? Is it worth taking a federal loan at a slightly higher interest rate for other reasons?

I didn't take out any loans for undergrad, so all of this is new to me. Thanks!",finance,1368042015
personalfinance,Buying vs. Renting with low interest rates,"I've been a lurker for a while in PF and now I'm looking for a little advice. Hopefully you guys will be kind enough to help me :) 

My wife and I are serious about buying our first home. We are getting to the point where the payment (with hazard insurance, mortgage insurance, city and county taxes, and HOA fees) for a move in ready townhouse in an area we like would be the same as what we are currently paying in rent. In buying we would be gaining square footage, better location for possible resale down the road and building equity instead of throwing money away on rent. We have looked into moving apartment complexes but they are all generally in that same price range unless we move out of the city, which would create a longer commute.

We are in our mid 20s with steady, full-time jobs (she is a Nurse and I work in IT). The problem is that we have a TON of student loan debt. But that's the only debt that we have. Our cars are paid for and we have no credit card debt. We have been pre-approved for both FHA (2.75%) and Conventional (3.625%) loans below fixed for 30 years. We plan to pay off our student loan debt and then use that money every month to pay off our mortgage early. 

We have enough saved to pay the 5% down (conventional) plus closing costs (all itemized on our pre-approval form) and keep a couple thousand for emergencies. Should we be buying a house? It seems like the right idea but I can't help second guessing myself. I would prefer that we had more money saved up but with rent going up so much I hate to not take advantage of low interest rates.

I was recently hired, like in November. While I was unemployed, looking for a job, I kind of maxed out my credit card. Currently this is at 2264.55 and the apr is 29.9%. I have been making payments on it for 300 each month and I know I can get it down by xmas or close to it at that rate but obviously I am getting a shitty deal.

I am looking at getting a new credit card and canceling this one. I would prefer a visa but I am open to anything. My score is excellent, too (above 720), so pretty much any card will probably accept me. 

What is a good card to apply for? I would like a 0% apr for while I pay off the balance transfer and then have extra deals and/or a low interest rate. Clearly this isn't all possible. Also, since looking at cards, I am not much of an entertainment purchaser but an online shopper, and huge gasoline consumer, if this helps narrow down a better card.

I was looking at getting a chase freedom but some of the reviews I read were poor (I realize that this is going to happen, but whatever) and I was wondering if r/personalfinance world have better recommendations or have had good luck with this card. Also, this card is the reason why I mentioned what my spending habits are since it gives 5% back for entertainment purchases like movie theaters (which I hate going to).

Also before any body asks why I have such high interest rate on the card, this card has been my emergency card that my parents got me when I went to college. It is thru their local bank.

Married.  I'm 28, she's 27.  Wife will be working (expect 35-45k gross).  Total expected debt load will be 120k.

What complicates the scenario is the debt benefits I'm expecting.  I plan on going into public interest law (gov't or non-profit) which will qualify me for the federal government's loan forgiveness program.  Make 120 payments (based on the IRB scheme) and the rest goes away.  Further, the law school I'm attending has a loan assistance program for public interest lawyers.  That means I could in some cases have every dollar I spend on loan payments reimbursed by the school.  But a conservative estimate would be 50% of the IRB amount.

Now, for the big question.   We are comfortable with our emergency savings (15k or so), but have an additional 10k in a separate savings account.  My wife wants to keep that money very safe (savings or a CD) while I'm in school, and try to keep saving extra.  Her idea is that it's ""insurance"" in case the expected loan benefits don't pan out.  Then, she wants to just throw that entire amount and take a first ""bite"" out of the loan amount.  But I think it's a better idea to be more aggressive with the money because (1) we probably won't need to throw it at the debt, and even if we do it won't be an emergency. So we could ride out a few bumps in the stock market if we had to.

So what should we do with that 10K?  How big of a difference could it make if we do one thing or the other?

business,Institutionalized Inequality,"Blatant Extravagance

Except for God, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. For a long time America was the land of opportunity. It still is, but much less so. The long held belief of all men being created equal is fast losing appeal as we become a land of prejudiced opportunity.

Witnessed during and after the financial crisis of 2008 was the divide between the one percent elite and the rest. Furthermore, the top brass was arrogant and insensitive even during such hard times. At the root of this divide lie the fractured financial foundations that perpetuate and expand this rift.

Consider this, the financial elite refused to be transparent on their share in the over $12 trillion bailout handed out to fight the economic slowdown, a slowdown created by these very institutions. And, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs paid billions as bonus to their employees while average Americans were losing their jobs, savings, and homes.

Decoding Convolutions

Economy and finance appears complicated and are deliberately kept so by the Wall Street and the financial elite. This maintains their financial monopoly and lets them get away with institutionalized fraud. For years, America was on the gold standard – every dollar in circulation has gold backing it up at the Federal Reserve. This way, the money supply could not expand suddenly because gold expanded slowly with economic growth.

Politicians and bankers had to be fiscally prudent and governments could not sponsor secret bailouts with freshly printed money. This was a major impediment for the elites and they remedied it on August 15, 1971 through President Nixon who cut the connection between gold and dollars. Now money supply could expand without any limits.

But then, increase in money supply reduces its worth in relation to goods and services i.e. there is a price rise. Inflation hits the low and middle income groups the hardest as they have to spend a greater part of their income on food, clothes, gasoline, and healthcare. This is precisely why two incomes are now needed to support an average American family.

Chief beneficiaries of money printing scheme are:

    central banks that make a fortune by lending money that costs nothing to print

    governments, corporations, and other large banks that get to use this freshly money before it enters circulation and loses its purchasing power

    producers of commodities and owners of assets that appreciate with inflation

Large banks and financial organizations get this cheap money as bailouts before it loses its worth and are able to lend the same at exorbitant rates of interest. This way, they profit while the society suffers – the top 1% Americans now hold 40% of American wealth.

Recently, a study by Washington Post found an over four-fold increase in the paychecks of CEOs of top American companies since the 1970s even after inflation adjustment. Over the same period, the income of an average, non-supervisory worker dropped by 10%. Widened disparities are why Americans are poorer than their parents for the first time in our history.

Divide between Wall Street and Washington has almost vanished. The financial sector employs over 3000 lobbyists – over 5 times the number of Congressmen. And if people like Henry Paulson, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs is made the Treasury Secretary, whose interests will be protected?

Light at the End of the Tunnel?

No one can play God. Not for long. Prompted by the crisis that just doesn’t wane, Americans are exploring the merits of the gold standard. We live in a democracy and the elites can’t fool all the people all the time. A revival of the gold standard, therefore, is not impossible. Well, monetary standards change once every 30-40 years and the present one has not since 1971.",finance,1368019523

business,Bradley Associates Financial Solutions Blog: DDoS,"DDoS: How to Report the Details
When it comes to reporting cyber-attack activity to the Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. banking institutions should avoid a boiler-plate approach and be mindful of the details, says Doug Johnson, who oversees risk management policy for the American Bankers Association.
""The SEC back in October of 2011 clarified existing rules and guidance as it related to what an institution that's publicly traded has to do, in terms of responsibility for reporting these types of events,"" Johnson says during an interview with Information Security Media Group (transcript below).
That disclosure, he adds, needs to be tailored to a company's individual circumstances (see Top Banks Offer New DDoS Details).
""The institution should avoid the boiler-plate language associated with the attack,"" Johnson explains. ""They should describe what the attack looked like, what the materiality was, what the company has done to address those risks, and what the costs and consequences to the company would be.""
As distributed-denial-of-service attacks continue to strike financial institutions of all sizes, publicly traded institutions have certain reporting obligations set by the SEC they must keep in mind, he adds.
Failing to adhere to those reporting requirements could result in fines and penalties later down the road, Johnson says.
During this interview, Johnson also reviews:
•	How banking institutions should communicate about an attack with customers and the general public;
•	The challenges banking institutions face when it comes to sharing too much information;
•	Why collaborating with industry peers, law enforcement and banking industry groups is becoming increasingly critical.
Johnson leads the ABA's enterprise risk, physical and cyber security, business continuity and resiliency policy and fraud deterrence efforts. He has assisted in the ABA's release of a series of resources designed to help deter bank robberies, assess information technology risk, deter phishing, safeguard customer information and buttress emergency preparedness. He also represents the ABA on the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council, which advises the federal bank regulatory agencies on homeland security and critical infrastructure protection issues, and he serves on the BITS/Financial Services Roundtable Security Steering Committee, in addition to his involvement with FS-ISAC.
Cyberthreat Landscape
TRACY KITTEN: Can you give us a brief overview of the current landscape and the cybersecurity concerns banking institutions are most focused on?
DOUG JOHNSON: First, I think that you're correct in portraying the majority of the cyber-attacks as being disruptions of systems, rather than intrusions of systems. But that doesn't mean that disruptions and intrusions can't happen at the same time, and I think that's one thing that we, as banking companies, are very, very mindful of - the fact that these attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. With their sophistication, they could take on various different types of attack vectors. They can attempt to disrupt, as well as intrude, systems, so we need to be aware of both. We need to be aware that the volume of attacks is going to be increasing as well, as we've seen over the course of the last year. Attacks will take multiple fronts.


Reporting Responsibilities
KITTEN: In late December, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reminded banking institutions that they're required to track and report DDoS and other cyber-attack activity. What exactly are banking institutions' reporting responsibilities?
JOHNSON: There are a variety of different responsibilities. Some of the responsibilities do relate to the reporting of suspicious activity through suspicious activity reports. Some of them involve talking specifically to the field examination functions. Your primary federal regulators, obviously, have a very important role here, and the specific examiners that examine your institution are going to be very interested in whether or not you're being attacked as a company and what you're doing, essentially, to respond to that attack. Some institutions, because they're publicly traded, also have reporting responsibilities associated with security filings and the like.

personalfinance,"""Why Invest in Bonds At All?"" Answer:","[First, some charts showing historical returns based on stock/bond ratio](http://lazytraders.com/insights/stocks-vs-bonds-diminishing-returns-of-100-risk-allocations/) - note that as you approach 100% stocks, the magnitude of your bad years starts to spiral ever more steeply toward the abyss. 

Second, bonds reduce volatility, and [less volatility can mean more wealth](http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=116038&amp;newpost=1690871) (edit: [See Clarification by kurds_way below](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1e09lp/why_invest_in_bonds_at_all_answer/c9vk4il?context=3)), all else being equal - lowering volatility is not just downside protection, though that is part of it.

Third, bonds also hedge permanent equity-market meltdowns and long recovery periods, which often coincide with personal unemployment (e.g. the economy tanks, taking your portfolio balance and steady job along with it). Don't take my word for it - check out the risk-adjusted results via a [backtesting spreadsheet](http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2520).

Fourth, most of the [Trinity Study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study) data and wise industry figures advocate at least some cash (basically a zero-duration bond) if not some bonds at all times. I realize this is a bit of 'appeal to authority' but if you read books by Benjamin Graham, Jack Bogle and the like, you'll find they can back up their arguments well.

Finally, though all-stock active traders seem to forget this, bonds may provide an opportunity to [rebalance during the downturn](http://lazytraders.com/insights/market-myths-5-active-trader-mistakes-about-down-markets/) - if the market tanks but your job is intact, your (safe) bonds are likely flat or up, and rebalancing will naturally allow you to get equities at relatively cheap prices. This is not a riskless strategy (stocks could go down further) but can work to a long-term accumulator's advantage.

**tl;dr Benjamin Graham has a good rule of thumb - never be less than 25% or more than 75% either stocks or bonds** - push the limits of that range and you expose yourself to risks (be it equity volatility on the one hand, or inflation and interest rates on the other).",finance,1368114932
personalfinance,Finance check request - recent college grad with new job.,"Hi PF -

Avid lurker, hoping some of you wise folks can take a look at my situation to make sure my head is screwed on correctly. Here's the breakdown:

* 23 y/o male, recent college grad with Engineering degree, landed a job a few months ago with salary $53k before taxes, plus annual bonus and yearly raises.
* About 108k in student loan debt, both federal and private, ranging from 4.5% to 11.375%. Minimum monthly payment is about $1120. **Before you ask** - I took this debt knowingly, going for a lucrative degree with a salary I expect will grow rapidly above the entry level one listed above in coming years with experience.
* $790/mo rent + $180/mo utils on nice 2br apartment, will be much lower once gf moves in in a few weeks.
* $70/wk groceries
* $25/mo gym membership
* $100/mo gas/car maintenance budget
* $200/mo bar budget
* $50-100/mo miscellaneous (or stashed into savings)

Other stuff:

* I had $9k in emergency fund, tapped into it for ~$3.5k for the move to the new job, most of which will be reimbursed (rest of it went to outfitting the apartment, dishware, kitchen stuff, etc). Interested in getting it back to ~10k (I like a nice big safety net).
* Started 401k with 50% company match, currently contributing 3% while I get my feet wet and budget figured out, will increase next year (or earlier).
* Paying as much as possible towards student loans - I shoot for $1300-1500/mo (avalanche method), which unbury.me targets an 8 year payoff with.
* Reliable car paid off, cell phone lovingly covered by parents
* No CC debt or any debt other than massive student loans - I decided on bigger loans during school to cover everything, rather than smaller loans + credit cards for books, etc.
* Only current goal is to pay off the loans, rebuild emergency fund, and buy something fun (likely a nice muscle car cruiser, ~10k) to enjoy my 20's with. No rush on the cruiser though. No house or marriage planned in the near (5 year) future.
* Credit score is ok - somewhere around 712 when I checked a few months back (and before a bunch of on time loan payments).

So...how does it look? Any recommendations? Any additional info needed?

All advice welcomed! Thanks.",finance,1368109694

Abney Associates News Blog Warning: Foiling Phishing With Authentication

In its new report on using e-mail authentication to fight phishing attacks, BITS offers a list of best practices and recommendations, including expanded use of the DMARC security protocol.
BITS, the technology policy division of The Financial Services Roundtable, believes that the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance protocol plays a key role in mitigating phishing schemes.
 
DMARC standardizes how e-mail receivers perform e-mailauthentication by providing a uniform reporting mechanism that's built on reputation.
""DMARC is pretty helpful in a couple of different areas,"" says Andrew Kennedy, senior program manager for BITS' security initiatives, in an interview with Information Security Media Group [transcript below].
Kennedy sees DMARC as an overlay of the Sender Policy Framework [SPF] and DomainKeys Identified Mail [DKIM] protocols, which aid in e-mail authentication.
""If there was an authentication failure for one of those protocols, it leaves you in the lurch if you don't have a policy in place to deal with that, and DMARC helps close the gap there,"" he says.
Also in the interview, John Carlson, executive vice president of security programs at BITS, stresses that an essential component when fighting phishing is for banking institutions and their business partners and customers to follow similar authentication strategies. ""It requires extensive collaboration from many different groups within the company and outside in order to implement these controls,"" he says.
During this interview, Carlson and Kennedy discuss:
	All of the e-mail protocols that address phishing attacks and how the protocols work in tandem;
	Why spoofed websites are increasingly concerning; and
	Steps banking institutions are taking to get business-partner buy-in for the DMARC initiative.
At BITS, Carlson works with members to strengthen the security and resiliency of financial services through best practices and strategies for secure IT systems infrastructures, products and services. He also collaborates with the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council for Critical Infrastructure Protection and Homeland Security, or FS-SCC, and co-chairs its Threat and Vulnerability Assessment Committee. He re-joined BITS in December 2011 after serving as a managing director at Morgan Stanley.
Kennedy, now the program lead for BITS' security initiatives, previously served as project manager for the BITS Vendor Management Program. He interned at BITS in 2006 and worked as an IT professional and security consultant in the biotech and software industry in California.
E-Mail Authentication Guidelines
TRACY KITTEN: Before we get into some of the details, could you talk a little bit about what prompted BITS to update the guidelines that it first issued about e-mail authentication back in 2009?
JOHN CARLSON: We'd be happy to talk about the BITS e-mail authentication policy and deployment strategy for financial institution firms. The reason why we had issued this paper was to help our financial institutions to better leverage several protocols and tools to detect and reduce the number of spoofed e-mail messages that reach consumers and business partners. A key component here is that e-mail is a critical communications channel for business today, and many of our institutions are dealing with spoofed e-mail messages that oftentimes are the vector for transporting malicious software or for tricking users into thinking it's coming from a legitimate user. We decided that it was important to issue this paper to help our financial institution member companies better leverage these protocols and gain some of the significant benefits from use of these protocols in terms of reducing fraudulent e-mail to customers and prospective customers, to reduce phishing attacks against high-value or trusted domains, to increase customer and partner confidence and trust in the authenticity of the sender's e-mail, and, very importantly, to enhance the brands of institutions in terms of the exposure of customers to phishing attacks that could lead to fraud or malware infection on their computers.

personalfinance,Am I an idiot for not participating in my work's employee stock purchase program?,"So my work offers this employee stock purchase program where we can set aside anywhere from 1% to 15% of each paycheck towards the automatic purchase of the company's stock. The cap is a max of $25k per year. The stocks are sold at a 15% discount of the fair market value of the stock at the end of each month. 

So basically they take out whatever percentage of each paycheck you determine and put it into your account, and at the end of each month they purchase however many shares that balance buys at a 15% discount of the stock price (no broker fees).

The advice was i buy a used car for a decent price at a high interest rate and refinance it after my credit got back up.. SO i do

About six months later i make my second mistake. The dealership contacted me and told me that they could take my car in as a trade in and pay off my debt (didnt mention the roll over) and fit me into a 2013 for not much more then my old car. ( old car was 14G which i could afford and new car was 19 which i can afford) However i had no clue about the rollover debt and thought i was getting a good deal but i am now bottoms uup on a car i dont like.

personalfinance,Buy a home soon or wait a few more years?,"My wife and I (both 27) are moving to Portland, Oregon for work this fall. If all goes well, we plan to stay out there for a very long time. We will definitely be renting for our first year, but we hope to buy a home soon afterwards hopefully in the 400K to 600K range.

What we’ve been debating is when will be the best time to do so. If we buy in a year or two, we’ll most likely still be able to take advantage of low loan interest rates and a recovering housing market, but we might not be able to save the 20% for down payment that we would ideally want. If we wait four or five years, we might be able to save 20%+, but there is a strong chance that house prices and interest rates will be higher (I know this is unpredictable, but it seems that the current conditions are such a bargain for buyers).

Here’s some pertinent info. I’m glad to elaborate if necessary:

* We’ll be grossing ~180K to 190K combined.
* Our combined student debt is not trivial but not too burdensome. At our current rate, we’ll be done after paying 10K for the next 12 years, but we might be more or less aggressive depending on circumstance.
* We both have very good to excellent FICO scores and are financially responsible.
* She has ~12K in an IRA and ~25K in a 401(k)...all invested in Vanguard funds at fairly appropriate allocations for a 27 year old. Her company contributes 3% flat.
* I have 13K in a Roth IRA (Vanguard stuff again) but nothing else (finishing grad school). My future company will pay 6% flat into a retirement fund after one year there, which fully vests in 6 years I believe. I don’t know what this job will bring, but if they like me and I like them, then I’d be happy to have a career there.

Side question: Is it ever a good idea to dig into IRAs for a first time home purchase? I have 13K to contribute from my Roth and she can contribute 10K from her IRA without penalty (yes, I know taxes would hurt). If those extra 23K mean getting to the 20% down payment level, is it worth it?

personalfinance,"So, my income based repayment plan dropped my payments to $0, but...","So, let's just all agree up front that I owe way too much money in student loans, and that student loans are stupid, and that I shouldn't have gotten in to this mess. I have my excuses and I'm making progress on my finances, but i ran into something unexpected today. 

I called my lenders and discussed direct consolidation, but after running the numbers I figured out that I'll save money in the long run by leaving them separate (all my loans are serviced by Great Lakes, so it's one payment and consolidation would've ended up raising my interest rate on the loans with the largest principals), if I'm wrong about that, lemme know. 

Anyway, I went ahead and set up my income based repayment plan today. I'm carrying $65k in federal loan debt (I realize this isn't the worst, but that's a big number, thus the preface). I haven't found a job in my area yet, and even when I do I'm probably not going to make much more than half of that. Because of that, my minimum monthly payment is $0, so I can pay whatever I can afford, and if I can't afford anything I can make no payment and I will still be listed as having paid on time (woo free credit). 

Here's the thing though. The average interest rate on my 7 loans is about 6.6%, so my monthly interest is about $360 (!!!). That alone is more than I can afford, so even if I pay every penny I can scrape together in a month, the principal is going to continue getting bigger. So I'm not sure what to do. 

My first instinct is to throw my hands up and say screw it, the number will keep going up, but since the IBR minimum payment is a function of principal to adjusted gross income, unless I land a gig where I make $140k this year (in which case, sweet, I'll keep living frugally and pay them off ASAP) my minimum payment will stay $0, and if I stay on the IBR for 25 years, the remaining balance is forgiven with plenty of time to enjoy middle age. But, I'm guessing this probably isn't the right choice. But why, exactly? 

I guess I could see the huge and growing balance destroying my debt to income ratio and making it hard to get a mortgage in the next couple of years (after 10 years I'd rather burn my money than continue renting). But what's the alternative? I can only slow the rate of increase, so how much worse off would I be versus just saving the money I would give them for the privilege of having the balance swell more slowly. 

I'm confused, I was feeling pretty good about getting the IBR figured out, but now I'm feeling like I'm still getting effed in the a. 

TL;DR: I got my student loan payments dropped to $0 but i can't afford to pay the interest, much less make progress on the principal. What do I do?

personalfinance,tuition reimbursement program,"thus far I have completed two degrees, and have 17k worth of federal student debt, no problems paying this off monthly, but I have a compounding factor to introduce. 

the company I work for has a tuition reimbursement program in place for employees to go to college. I also work for the flight department of my company, they have given verbal approval to pay for my flight training to become a pilot! which is absolutely fantastic!

there's just one problem, the lab fee for the first semester courses comes to $10,200.00, and I need to pay this and the course fees, a total of $11,709.00 in order to get the reimbursement from the company. 

I have no clue as to what the best way to go about this is, I have read the contract multiple times and understand all the requirements of the program, but I basically need 12k for a semester to be paid back in full when I submit my grades.

personalfinance,2 dumb/obvious questions that have probably been answered a million times,"After a lifetime of living paycheck to paycheck I finally have money in the bank and am opening an IRA.

1. Before I bother linking the investment account to a checking account I think I want to switch banks. I had been with ING specifically because I did NOT want to be with a shitbox megabank, and then they got bought out by Capital One. So I would like to switch. It seems like Ally or a credit union are the best options, Ally for the interest rate or CU because...I don't know why, everyone just says they are better. Which one should I go with, and if CU, then again, which one/how do I find one?

2. I owe about $55,000 in student loans (no other debt). Mint.com tells me I have about $7,500 cash. My fixed bills are $660/month (not including food/gas/variable expenses), income is about $2200/month. a) How much do I put in the IRA up front? b) How much do I contribute to the IRA vs paying down debt each month?

We sat down and talked about or finances. We did disagree but I just want to say that the advice on here was good, and we now have a plan that includes working off this debt at a reasonable pace, purchasing a car (we found out his uncle, who owns a used car lot, is going to an auction and he will look for a car for the amount we are getting back. I know this is riskier than a dealer but since a dealer is purchasing it for us, we are probably going to get a good car.), renting at the same price, but cutting back on some silly purchases. We have a plan now, and should have both our credit card debt gone by the end of the year. Also, today I haggled with my credit card company and got my interest rate down to 13% and now have 0% apr on new purchases, tho I do not plan on using that. But it's nice knowing. We did adjust our student loans but this is temporary since a car is a must. It is much more expensive for us to be taking public transit since we live in a city and work far away from each other (30 miles). For us to do monthly passes of public transit it gets to be 480/mo, versus the 200 in gas plus just 100 for one monthly pass (hence the reason we are moving, so it is cheaper for public transit). Since we will not be taking a loan for the car, that will not be added to our finances. The car insurance is taken out of his pay check before we even get it, so though it's in our budget, is what I would call an invisible budget our something like that.

All this means we end up with roughly 400 dollars walking around money for each of us though I plan on sticking a lot of that into savings, despite already including that in the budget.

I just want to say thanks. We were just a bit disorganized but I think we are on our way to becoming more aware of our finances and organizing them fire the future. We've promised each other too that we plan on sticking to the budget.",finance,1368210805

personalfinance,Finished with DMP - What CC should I apply for?,"My last credit card is about to be paid off and closed. Now it's time to start rebuilding my credit. For the record, I don't have any late payments or delinquencies in my credit history, but the fact that I'll have no open lines of credit will surely be a deficiency. According to creditkarma (for whatever that's worth), my FAKO score is about 730 (pre-dip for this last closed card). 

So, it's time to apply for a credit card so I can start building credit (because I want to buy a home in a few years). I think I'd like to apply for the Southwest Airlines premier card (yes, annual fee, but it's set off by bonus miles) or the Amazon.com card. Both are issued by Chase. BUT, I don't want to apply for cards that are sure to deny me and hurt my score further. How can I know what the best yet safest card to apply for is?

personalfinance,how does selling a house with a mortgage work? and refinancing a car?,"Ok, I know this is going to sound stupid... but google is just confusing me even more!

Two questions:

1) selling a house with a mortgage (I made up the math.. it might not be perfectly logical, but its easy numbers)

Say I bought a house and take out a 30yr mortgage/loan for 300k (principal). Say if I paid on schedule over the entire life of the 30 year loan, I would end up paying 540k (300k principal and 140k interest).

But, 10 years into the loan I want to sell my house. At this stage (I'm making up my own amoritization schedule, but pretend its right..) after 10 years, I have reduced my principal balance to 200k. According to my fictional schedule, if I paid according to schedule I would pay 300k over the next 20 years (200k principal remaining plus 100k interest).

Now, when I sell the house... does the buyer take over just the remainder principal balance of 200k? Or do they take over like, 300k (the remaining principal AND interest left on the schedule for the next 20 years)?? 

(If that was too confusing - in other words, assume that interest is paid evenly throughout the loan. I know this is wrong, but pretend. So say I have one year left on the loan, and I want to sell my house. I have $8 principal left on the loan and $2 on the interest left. When the buyer buys, do they take over the full $10, or only the $8?)

 
2!)

I have an auto loan for a few years, and now it has gone down to 8000 principal. Over the next 3 years, I will be paying 9000 (8000 principal and 1000 interest). If I want to refinance it to a lower interest rate, does my new lender consider my 9000 the new principal then tack on their own intersest ON TOP of that? Or do I only ""re borrow"" the remainder principal of 8000? 

I went to get my auto loan refinanced today because they promised me 1.5% lower than my current loan rate. But he told me that I would then be borrowing 9k, and then 1.5% on top of that 9k. I thought I would simply be borrowing my 8k remaining principal.. but I guess not?",finance,1368155848
investing,Rental Income(loss) vs Market Returns,"Sorry if this is in the wrong spot, I didn't know whether to put this here or in personal finance.

I've got a keep it or sell it question.

Shortly after I got out of college(1990) I didn't want to pay rent, so I scraped together the money and bought a condo for 49k. It was a 30 year ARM that has never gone up, it has only gone down.

I lived in it for about 7 years before before I met my wife, we bought a house, and I got a renter for the condo.

The condo fees for this place are very high, because its got a pool and all utilities are included.

I've always paid a little extra on the mortgage, and I've always lost a bit on the rent vs mortgage payment + condo fees. I haven't kept detailed records for that long, but its in the ballpark of losing $50 bucks a month. And I don't think the mortgage will go the whole 30 years, but I am also not sure when it will get paid off at the current rate, I owe 15k.

I think I am charging pretty close to the max I can for the rent in that market. I have had a good string of tenants for the last 5 years ( a lady, then her cousin) 

During the housing bubble the price of these went up to 100k.

Fast forward to now, they current sell for about 40-45k. I owe 15k on the mortgage, the interest is 3% exactly.  I am getting $650 in rent, and I the minimum mortgage payment + condo fee is $700.  So I am losing $50 a month, but gaining in principle.

There are TONS of short sales in the community. I guess from all the people who bought at 100k. And the neighborhood is well, not getting better, I joke with my friends that I am a slumlord.

I figure if I sell it now, I'll get 45k at best (minus taxes minus Realtor percent) and take a loss. But I'll be able to put that money into something gaining market returns.

If I keep it, I'll continue to lose, but eventually it will get paid off. It will turn into income, about $250 profit a month. The condo fee is so high about $450 a month now, so the whole rent won't turn into profit. Plus I'll owe taxes (not sure how much, right now its coming out of escrow) 

Also, I 'could' pay it off now, but the interest rate is only 3% and the market is doing better than that, so I have left that money invested elsewhere. 

So, I've been a bit paralyzed not knowing what to do, take the loss now and put that money somewhere else? Or hold on and it will eventually turn around, and who knows maybe the property will turn around, it's in the Washington DC suburbs, not downtown Detroit or something.

Should I sell it or keep it?",finance,1368150341

http://www.zimbio.com/IT+Security/articles/Jfrzwh58d04/Abney+Associates+FTC+cracks+down+tech+support
Phone con attempted to convince people that their computers had a virus and then sign them up to multi-year contracts
The US Federal Trade Commission has carried out a huge international crackdown on a number of ""tech support"" scams being run out of India which have conned people in the UK, US, Canada and elsewhere out of millions of pounds since 2008.
As explained by the Guardian in 2010, the scams used ""boiler room"" tactics, dialling through phone books for English-speaking countries. People who answered the phone were told the call came from Microsoft or their internet service provider, and that the person's computer was ""reporting viruses"". The caller would then perform an unnecessary ""fix"" on the computer and charge the person for it – and sometimes sign them up to multi-year ""support"" contracts. The cost could run to hundreds of pounds.
People in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were targeted because they, like the people carrying out the scam, are English-speaking. The Guardian understands that the scam was worth millions of pounds a year to the organised gangs carrying it out.
At the FTC's request in six cases, a federal district judge froze the US assets of 17 people and 14 companies that have been accused of taking part in the operations. The FTC has also shut down 80 internet domain names and 130 phone numbers used in the US to carry out the scams.
The FTC is seeking an end to the scams, and repayments for people who were conned out of money.
Though the FTC said it could not put a figure on how many people had been scammed, or how much they had lost, Microsoft – which has been working with the commission for the past two years to try to catch the criminals – provided data on more than a thousand people who had been scammed, whose losses averaged $875 each.
Microsoft has repeatedly pointed out that it would not call people about any problems with their computers. In some cases, the scammers would try to sell antivirus software from reputable companies, and in some cases would install new copies of Windows on a machine. However the licence key used on the software allowed Microsoft to trace it back to its buyer, which aided the investigation.
The fraud occurred in several English-speaking countries. Joining the FTC in the enforcement action were the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency. David Vladeck, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said it was working with law enforcement officials in India to catch the alleged perpetrators. The commission has also referred the cases to the US justice department for possible criminal prosecution.
The companies whose assets have been frozen are: Pecon Software; PC Care247; Connexxions Infotech; Connexxions IT Services Private Ltd; Zeal IT Solutions; Lakshmi Infosoul Services Private Ltd; Virtual PC Solutions, First PC Solution; Direct PC Solution; Virtual IT Supports; Global Innovative Service; 24x7pchelp; 24x7pctech; Transfront Solutions; New World Services; Megabites Solutions; Mega Bits; Greybytes Cybertech; Bluesystemcare; Shine Solutions Private Ltd. The FTC has also named 17 people who were singly or together directors of the accused companies.

The companies involved had US locations which were used to funnel money back to India. Some also have UK offices. However the FTC asserts that the companies used ""virtual"" offices which were in fact just mail-forwarding facilities. The scam also used voice-over-internet phone lines to make them appear to be calling from inside the country being targeted, when in fact the caller was in India.
The Guardian's own investigations have found that one gang was using locations and accounts in Canada to transfer money from the scams back to India.
The defendants have been charged with violating the FTC Act, which bars ""unfair and deceptive"" commercial practices, breaching the Telemarketing Sales Rule and illegally calling numbers that are on the National Do Not Call Registry.
The scheme involved getting a computer user to look at a program called ""Event Viewer"" that is a standard part of the Windows operating system. That displays logs of events occurring on the computer, sometimes with the label ""Warning"" or ""Error"" – but which in fact have no significance to the smooth running of the computer. The caller would then say that these were due to ""viruses"", that they had been alerted to them remotely, and that they could fix them. They then would use a remote login program to appear to ""fix"" the computer.
""Clearly the defendant's [modus operandi] was to exploit these fears about malware hiding in the machine,"" said the FTC chairman, Jon Leibowitz. ""These scams fleeced English-speaking consumers worldwide likely to the tune of tens of millions of dollars and resulted in innumerable Do Not Call violations in the US.""

My wife graduated 6 months earlier, and she's looking for part-time work right now. Combined we have about $50,000 in student loans to pay off, and my monthly income is enough to live comfortably while also saving about $600-800 towards a down payment on a house and also a new car.

Our current cars are completely payed-off, I get 14% of my salary into retirement (including employer matching), and we have about $9k in the bank. We really want to save up for a decent house down payment, but we also want to pay off our loans as fast as we comfortably can while still making progress towards our goals.

Right now our loans are just through Sallie May (all federal loans), with interest rates varying from 3.4 to 6.8% (mostly towards the higher rates, though). Is there a way to go to a bank and get our student loans consolidated into a lower interest rate? Considering our current debt-to-income ratio, our good credit scores, and having our cars completely payed off, is this good enough for a bank to consider us for a loan consolidation?",finance,1368383235

personalfinance,Young (23) and in my first career position with a solid pay. Would you do anything differently?,"Hi all,

I think I am happy with the way my finances are going, but I wanted to see if I'm missing out on any pitfalls or if you would do anything different. This won't be a super detailed budget, but picking out the main points:

* Take home pay (bi weekly) - $1,068

**Loans:**

* Student loan: $5,271 at 3% (federal)

I start paying back this loan next month (graduated in December) and intend on putting $200 towards it a month.

* Car loan: $8,330 at 4.5% (through my credit union, edit: and this is a used car, not new)

Currently I pay $167/mo car payments, although I intend to increase this as soon as I have an emergency fund that I am happy with.

**Savings**

* Currently $1,500 in emergency fund. Trying to throw at least $200 per paycheck at this, so around $400 a month. 

**Living**

* My boyfriend and I live together and split rent of a two bedroom apartment. I pay close to $500 a month for everything (fluctuates depending on electricity). 

* Car insurance is $115. I have to get full coverage in order to have the car loan.

**Other**

* I have a rewards credit card with a $3k limit that I use for my daily purchases and pay off monthly.

* I have no other debts, and I have decent credit for not having a lot of history. I opened up my first credit card (still around with a whopping $400 credit line) when I was 19 or 20, so about 3-4 years ago.

* My father is keeping me on his cell phone line, and with all of the discounts I have been able to get for his cell phone line in the past couple of years, I have essentially paid for my portion of it. 

**Thoughts**

I think I will be done with my emergency fund after next month, and will start putting that money towards the school loan while still putting extra in savings. I have $200 per paycheck automatically sent to my credit union which is the bank I intend on using to pay off my car loan and student loan.

I am very likely getting a significant pay jump in a few months. My boss is already putting together an agreement that I have to meet certain parameters and then I will get about a $6,000 pay increase. He expects it to take 3 months minimum/6 months maximum to meet. Of course, this is NOT guaranteed, but it is something for me to consider.

**Questions**

* Should I pay minimally on the student loan and get the car loan paid off first? They're very close in interest rates, and I feel like there would be a great deal of satisfaction to see it paid off. Then I could put all of my energy towards the car loan.

* Would there be anything else that you would do if you were my age? I think I'm fairly solid in financial terms (of course it will be nice to get rid of the loans, but they're most definitely manageable).",finance,1368379013
personalfinance,Soliciting thoughts on investing strategies.,"I enjoy learning from you guys, but was hoping to solicit some advice on my situation, as it seems to be a bit different from many out there that are regularly tackled on this forum. Specifically on 401k/retirement funding/and personal finance strategies in general.

Some background:

- currently single (much to my mother's dismay). PSA: today is mother's day!

- However, will likely be getting married soon. Important because my SO's debts, then, will soon be ours (see below)

- been at my job for just under a year. my base pay puts me into the 25% marginal tax bracket.

- my company has a generous 401k protocol: they contribute 10% of my base salary to the 401k **whether I contribute or not**. I contributed the maximum $5000 last year and am pace to contribute the max $5500 this year.

- the fees for this particular 401k are not bad (~0.45% on average for my selection of funds) though admittedly not as low as a Vanguard ETF (or similar).

- I am 34. the fund's allocations are ~90% equities.

- I have ~$15K in student loans from various providers at an effective rate of 2.853% APR. I had been taking a very aggressive path to paying this down (down from ~24K a year ago), though I have recently transitioned to paying only about $500/mo toward this. It seems foolish to pay any more, and perhaps I should do even less (i.e. min. mo. payment?) at that low rate.

- My SO has about $12K in loans at about that same rate. She is currently paying the minimum toward this (by necessity, not choice).

- My job security in the short term (next 5 years) is exceedingly high. After that, it is still very high, though not guaranteed. 

- However, my SO is slated to begin postgraduate work soon (in 15-18 months). Depending on what path she elects to take, she (we) will incur anywhere from $80K-200K in student loans. These will be far less friendly in the interest rate department (~7.0%). On the upside, regardless of the path, her earning potential after postgraduate work will range from being equal to (or slightly higher than mine) to much greater than mine (hurray for being a kept man!).

- I have little in liquid assets...about 1 mo. salary on hand.

- I would like to save to purchase a house: my target purchase date is within 3 years, though 5 years would be ok, too. Realistically, in the area I live, this means I'll need to target a down payment of ~$50-60K if we buy in 3 years or ~$70K if we buy in 5 years.

The biggest question I have, really, is ""am I using the 401k effectively?"" Since my employer puts in the same $$ regardless of my contributions, the whole ""free money"" argument becomes invalid, right?

To summarize (sorry, ""TL;DR"", first post and all that): Currently, I have $3100/mo. to apply toward: 1) paying down loans, 2) saving for retirement, 3) building a bit of an emergency fund, 4) building a fund to help defray the costs of my SO's upcoming postgraduate work, and 5) saving to purchase a house. Any thoughts on how those funds should be allocated each month?",finance,1368370090

personalfinance,"School loan repayment plans, credit scores, and 401(k)/IRA conversions - seeking advice!","Hi personalfinance!

 

Long time lurker, first time poster. Y’all seem like some fiscally savvy folk, and have given me hope that my financial situation may not be as terrible as I had thought. I come to you today seeking advice on two specific issues: student loan repayment plans and Traditional 401(k)/Roth IRA consolidation. Lot’s of stuff here, feel free to pick and choose questions. I’d be most grateful for any advice.

 

My info:

 

* Federal Direct Loans: $15k @ 4.4% subsidized and $14.3k @ 6.8% unsubsidized

* Great Lakes: $3.4K @ 4.75% subsidized consolidation loan

* Firstmark: $7.3k @ 3.3% SELF loan

* Chase: $4.3k @3.68%

* 2013 AGI: $15.5k

* Take-home pay: ~$1k biweekly

* Expenses: Minimal (~$200/month?) – I live frugally and am slumming with my folks.

 

**Questions The First:**

 

I graduated last year (BS Biochem), and took a contracting gig with sub-par pay because I needed the health insurance. Since I only worked there for half a year, my AGI is artificially low. According to the federal direct loans website, this makes me eligible for a bunch of different repayment plans. The two that stand out are the Income Based repayment plan and the Pay As You Earn repayment plan. Both of these would bring my minimum monthly payment amount from $350 to $0 for just that particular loan group. I’m thinking that would be good as it would allow me to funnel payments into paying down the 6.8% loan principal rather than spreading them over mostly interest on all of my loans. The questions:

 

**1a.** What is the difference between the Income Based and Pay As You Earn plans?

 

**1b.** There was a thread recently (can’t find it now) where it was mentioned that if your minimum payment is less than the interest the government will pick up the difference. Does this apply to either of these plans?

 

**1c.** I’m considering starting grad school fall of 2014. Will this affect what I should be doing now?

 

**1d.** The above student loans are the only debt that I have, and I have an “excellent” credit rating. I’ve heard mentioned that carrying some debt and making timely payments helps build good credit. I hope to purchase a house in a few years time. Will paying these debts off fast hurt me in the long run?

 

**Bonus question:** What has better earning potential, getting an MBA, or going MS/PhD?

 

 

 

**Questions The Second:**

 

I’m 27 now, and am getting worried about retirement. I contribute to my 401(k) up to my employer max, put money into an HSA (which carries over from year to year), and am trying to figure out how to do this Roth IRA thing that everyone is talking about. I have a 401(k) from a previous employer that I’ve been neglecting and which is getting eaten up by fees. This old 401(k) has about $1.5k in it which I’m fully vested in. When I have medical expenses my first instinct is to reach for my HSA debit card since “that’s what it’s for”, but on second thought this is pre-tax money that is earning me interest and which I can spend tax free on health expenses at any time.

 

 

**2a.** Does it make sense to pay for medical expenses now with my post-tax dollars and let the HSA grow until I’m old and decrepit and my health-care costs rise, or am I over-thinking this?

 

**2b.** What are my options for the old 401(k)? Can I still roll it into my current 401(k), or the Roth IRA that I’m hoping to open soon?

 

**2c.** Please recommend an easy to open Roth IRA, preferably one where I don’t have to pay fees.

Wall Street strategists are having trouble keeping pace with this rally.

In his latest research note Goldman Sachs GS +0.55% strategist David Kostin points out the S&amp;P 500′s 14% year-to-date surge has already surpassed his 2013 price target. While Kostin didn’t change his estimate — he’s still calling for 1625 and the index currently trades at 1631 — he’s still pretty bullish on U.S. stocks.

“The S&amp;P 500 reached our 1625 year-end forecast much faster than we expected on strong price-to-earnings multiple expansion,” Koston said in a note to clients. “Index valuation is full but we see continued upside to our 1775 year-end 2014 forecast and 1900 year-end 2015 target driven by earnings growth.

“Under ideal conditions, where real interest rates remain very low alongside above-trend US economic growth, multiples could rise further.”

Kostin isn’t the only Wall Street strategist who has seen the rally blow past their year-end targets. Research firm Birinyi Associates says the 14 leading Wall Street strategists they track (including Goldman) have an S&amp;P 500 year-end target of 1583.

That’s more than 3% below Friday’s closing price. Only three of those 14 strategists currently have forecasts that are above the S&amp;P 500′s current price.

“The market has risen faster than we expected in 2013,” Kostin says, “but we still forecast considerable upside to the S&amp;P 500 during the next few years.”

personalfinance,Need advice becoming an entrepreneur (EU),"I'll start off with a little background story.

From the period of 2001 till late 2009, my father had a really good job.
Late 2009, he realised he was at the top of his field, and getting any higher would only require ass-licking - something my father has never done or wanted to do in his life. The only option was to become an entrepreneur to have some sort of challenge in his life.

So he did, he bought a diner and a hotel. Everything went really great, until the financial crisis. A noticable amount of 25% LESS profit is generated. Not only at our businesses, but at every hotel/cafe/diner in our region. This is something that has been investigated by several experts.

Last year my father was at the edge of going bankrupt. He immediatly responded to it, by cutting in staff and many other things. Me, being 18 years old that time also had to deal with the fact my parents were recently splitting up.

Normally I helped my father in the peak times, which is between May and Septembre. 
In November, 2012, I had 2 choices:
- Either start my studies to become a Sales Manager, let my dad go bankrupt and let him basically throw his life away.
- Or quit school and help my father run the place, with a possibility to take over the place once I am ready for it.

I eventually chose to help my father. I had many chats with school about this, and the teachers had faith in me because of the many good results I had. 

Since I am in charge, with my father, we've achieved a lot of stuff. 
The only problem is that we're still in debt, for like €-60.000,-.
If we compare our results so far, with last year, we can see last year had a lot more profit, but way too much staff costs and purchase costs. This leads to the fact that this year actually is a better year than last year, gaining us a €40.000 higher profit than last year. (In the period of January till May)

My question is, being relatively young, is there any stuff I have to be careful of? The €-60.000 is a debt as in loans/bills. There's still like 100k to be paid in terms to the bank. I had a chat with my father about all the ""what if's"", for example: If he did not have to pay any interest etc. since he owned the place, till 2015, it would've yielded him a profit of 2M. 
I am just not sure if it all sounds too good to be true, are there any experienced people here who can help me for what to look out for?

My native language is not English, so sorry for that.

business,"Reviews by Abney and Associates, Code 85258081704: FTC cracks down on tech support scam run from India","http://communities.ptc.com/groups/abney-associates-aa

The US Federal Trade Commission has carried out a huge international crackdown on a number of ""tech support"" scams being run out of India which have conned people in the UK, US, Canada and elsewhere out of millions of pounds since 2008.
As explained by the Guardian in 2010, the scams used ""boiler room"" tactics, dialling through phone books for English-speaking countries. People who answered the phone were told the call came from Microsoft or their internet service provider, and that the person's computer was ""reporting viruses"". The caller would then perform an unnecessary ""fix"" on the computer and charge the person for it – and sometimes sign them up to multi-year ""support"" contracts. The cost could run to hundreds of pounds.
People in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were targeted because they, like the people carrying out the scam, are English-speaking. The Guardian understands that the scam was worth millions of pounds a year to the organised gangs carrying it out.
At the FTC's request in six cases, a federal district judge froze the US assets of 17 people and 14 companies that have been accused of taking part in the operations. The FTC has also shut down 80 internet domain names and 130 phone numbers used in the US to carry out the scams.
The FTC is seeking an end to the scams, and repayments for people who were conned out of money.
Though the FTC said it could not put a figure on how many people had been scammed, or how much they had lost, Microsoft – which has been working with the commission for the past two years to try to catch the criminals – provided data on more than a thousand people who had been scammed, whose losses averaged $875 each.
Microsoft has repeatedly pointed out that it would not call people about any problems with their computers. In some cases, the scammers would try to sell antivirus software from reputable companies, and in some cases would install new copies of Windows on a machine. However the licence key used on the software allowed Microsoft to trace it back to its buyer, which aided the investigation.
The fraud occurred in several English-speaking countries. Joining the FTC in the enforcement action were the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency. David Vladeck, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said it was working with law enforcement officials in India to catch the alleged perpetrators. The commission has also referred the cases to the US justice department for possible criminal prosecution.

$7530 on one credit card
$100 on my other credit card (which will be paid off this month, but about another $1500 or more will be added before the wedding in October)


As of my monthly bills:


* $1690 Rent

* $87 Cell phone

* $200 Gas

* $300 Groceries

* $120 AAA

* $50 Dog food

* $50 Internet

* $85 Cable

* $50 Electric

* $70 Storage

* $8 Netflix

* $100 ""Dates"" and misc

* $400 my savings account (apart from my credit union savings)

* $400 into the larger balance credit card

* $300 into the smaller balance credit card




Total: $3910 (I will be screwed with this budget in a month)



 
What I'm saving for:
 

* $4950 DJ / Photographer for wedding ($4200 saved)

* $550 Limo Service   (100% saved)

* $1000 Honeymoon   ($450 saved) I would like to take out $1000 or $2000 from my credit union account 
(thoughts??)

* $1000 Bachelor Party in June ($750 saved) I would like to take out $1000 from my credit union account 
(thoughts??)

* Wedding gifts for my groomsmen ($300 saved)

* TWO cars   ($300 saved) (If I'm able to get two I can move from this $1700 apt rent to somewhere a lot 
cheaper)

(I know I will have to add car payments to my bills)                                     


What I'm trying to get across to all of you is, what am I doing wrong? What should I be focusing on? What can I cut from my budget without getting rid of my social life?

personalfinance,"$12,000 in student loans, but my family's financial situation has changed dramatically since graduation. What can I do?","Hey folks,

Thanks to this great community's response on my first post, I finally learned the ins and outs of basic tax law. Sadly, I am still about as ignorant as they come when it comes to budgeting and saving skills, managing my income, settling my debt, etc., so my apologies for that in advance.

**Here's the background:** 

I got a few semesters' worth of student loans while attending a public university, and by the time I graduated in 2011 my total debt amounted to about $12,000. Because of my parents' income while I was in school, I could only get non-subsidized federal loans at an interest rate of 6.8%.
Post-graduation, my story is unfortunately a common one. I've had no luck finding a career or professional-level work, so I'm working for $9/hour at a throwaway full-time job. My payments each month just to keep the interest down are around $150, and with my current income and expenses I feel like I'm never going to put a dent in this beast. 

**Current circumstances:**

Last March my dad passed away from brain cancer, taking his income with him (not huge since he was a teacher). Then my mom got laid off last November (the real devastator, since she was making &gt;$80k a year). Now I'm living with my mom making more money than her, and she can't seem to find another job despite 20+ years in her industry laden with accolades and achievements. She's already had to put our family cottage on the market and will probably have to move into a smaller home if she doesn't find work soon. Oh, and we're going to have to buy health insurance soon because we don't have it anymore.

**The question:**

Is there any way to get my interest rate adjusted or part of my loan forgiven considering the changes in my family's financial stability? I called DirectLoans, the company handling my loan repayment, with the same question, and the best they could do was defer my payments for a couple months, which is not helpful in the long run. Do you guys know any other options I might have?

Some people are making questionable financial decisions like not paying off loans with high interest rates in order to maintain ""good credit"". Or they're considering applying for a loan and paying it off immediately to have a ""credit history"". Others are worrying about applying for cards because of ""hard pulls"" of their credit report.

When I asked in one thread, someone told me that it's possible for Americans to get denied rental apartments, mortgages, or even jobs based on bad or non-existent credit. Is this actually true? Can you be turned down for a job because you don't have any debt?

A couple days ago i defaulted on $35,000 to sallie mae. 

This situation has a context which I'll try to condense- graduated from my expensive liberal arts 'dream college' five years ago, had to take private loans out because of some reason didn't qualify for federal (i don't remember why). I left college with obscene debt, found out I couldn't consolidate. we always assumed you could consolidate anything, no one told us we couldn't while i was in.

two years ago i defaulted and was sued for $60,000, paid $25,000 of hard earned cash to settle. I'm a paramedic whose father is a paramedic- that was a staggering amount that wiped us out. 

i still owe $75,000, most of it is to sallie mae, the rest is through a collection of other banks after wells fargo and wachovia collapsed/ merged/ who the hell knows what. 

$35,000 just defaulted.

i've defaulted before, but now in addition to calling me the customary five times day they're ALSO calling my aunts, cousins, even a parent i'm not on speaking terms with. one of my aunts cosigned and they're relentlessly calling to ask her if she has any money. yesterday THEY CALLED MY BOSSES AT WORK, and even had the balls to ask them to recall my ambulance to our base so they could ask me if i had any money. they called me into the office and asked why my personal affairs are coming up at work; they understood once i explained, but it was humiliating to do so and more importantly NONE of their damn business.

for the past two years i've had 15% of every paycheck garnished by court order for another amount that's in collections. if i paid the minimum monthly balances on top of that 15% cut, i'd exceed my monthly rent and STILL not come close to defraying any principals. it's all interest. i played the forbearance game for a couple years. wasted a lot of money. it's another scam. since they're private i can't defer even though i've been back in school for several years and delayed pursuing medical school because i can't afford to finish the prereqs.

FIRST how do you control these people? and HOW THE HELL do i stop them from calling everyone in my extended family and my work? this is OUT of control

SECOND, does anyone know any legal and financial resources to make some sense out of all this?

it's been difficult to find an attorney willing to represent me, every one i've spoken to doesn't 'do that kind of law.' i did find one willing to help, but she was candid in saying she has no experience in this and unsure to proceed. 

i know there are others like me because student debt exceeded credit card debt at over $1 trillion! how are they managing?

my apologies for the length. constructive comments only, please- i don't need more lectures on how 'i should've known better.' enough of those. i seek solutions.

gaming,We need to talk about Kotaku.,"It was just about a year ago. I felt a bit unsettled after reading a Kotaku article by Patricia Hernandez, an article that asked the question ""is it wrong to say 'I raped you' in a multiplayer game?"" I felt a bit unsettled because the article came across as manipulative. Why was Kotaku spending their time on such a topic? ""Oh,"" I thought to myself, brushing off my doubts ""It's written by a woman who was actually raped in her past, so I suppose they think it adds credibility"". 

But I haven't stopped feeling unsettled from that point on in regards to Kotaku.com. Increasingly, Kotaku has championed an agenda in their articles. Whether it's hunting for racial slurs in an innocent animal-based flash game, or making sure animated breasts aren't too big, or calling out developers for making what can vaguely be called a ""gay joke"", Kotaku is here to save the day! 

I'm feeling unsettled because I know I'm being manipulated. I knew it couldn't be a coincidence that Kotaku was ramping up their gender-equality witch hunt. There had to be something going on. There's nothing wrong with a news site posting opinion articles that differ from my own. That's just a normal part of life. However, when I realized I was rolling my eyes in disbelief at virtually every single Kotaku article that was linked here on N4G, I stopped and wondered what the heck was going on. 

So, I did a little digging. I'm here to let you know, my fellow N4G browsers, that something is indeed going on with Kotaku. Please, feel free to yell at me, disagree with me, high-five me, or say whatever you like in the comment section. This topic should be talked about. 

First, let's establish that something is indeed going on. Starting about 18-24 months ago, the number of hot-button gender-related articles on Kotaku.com has skyrocketed. Topics that are years old (like crude remarks commonly made towards women on Xbox Live; nothing new) have suddenly found new light on Kotaku's article list. Setting aside the fact that Kotaku failed to report on these issues of harassment when they first cropped up years ago (in spite of their job titles being ""journalist""), Kotaku has also been hiring - and posting articles from - female-focused industry icons. Whether highlighting Anita Sarkeesian for the tenth time or picking up on the most recent anti-gay slur, Kotaku has been picking up a lot of click-through, whether from like-minded individuals or angry readers and everyone caught in between. We've gotten articles (two, actually) like how Sony is sexist because there were no women on stage at the Playstation 4 reveal (what?), how Far Cry 3 is homophobic because it has a vague gay joke (ignoring the fact that the game is based on rude, crude, politically-incorrect '80s action-movie cliches), and my personal favorite, the dedicated and malicious attack on Vanillaware president/artist/designer George Kamitani for being a 14-year-old boy (apparently) because he drew a female videogame character with massive tits for a game that was announced nearly two years ago. 

Remember how I mentioned that these sort of articles have been growing exponentially for about 18-24 months? Hmmm, what happened 18-24 months ago for Kotaku. Oh. That's right. About 27 months ago, Kotaku's parent company, Gawker, decided to revamp all of their site designs, which resulted in a MASSIVE decrease in site visits (and naturally, a massive decrease in ad revenue). Gawker fumbled and struggled to bring back readership by making a ""compromise"" in the site's design, and it was during this time that Kotaku also began to increase their number of tabloid-like, hit-seeking articles. All of this info is publicly available on Wikipedia, by the way. I'm not claiming to be some sort of insider. 

""Okay, dude,"" you might be thinking. ""So what? Gawker (and therefore Kotaku) hit a rough patch two years ago. It doesn't mean they have an agenda."" You know what? You're absolutely right. If that one coincidence was the only thing I had, then it would be a bit tinfoil-hat of me to imply that Kotaku was engaging in some sort of targeted manipulation. 

But that isn't all. 

Surrounding the hubbub of Patricia Hernandez's two (yes, two) articles about ""no women @ PS4 announcement!"", Stephen Totilo gets on his high horse and says to his readers (you know, the people who put food on his table through their click-through) ""if you don't like Patricia, then I don't want you to be a part of the Kotaku community"". What? I'm sorry. It is one thing to ban lewd comments or discourage immature talk on a website, but to say such a thing to readers (who were understandably miffed at Patricia's incredibly one-sided and poorly-researched articles) stinks of an agenda. 

And it gets deeper. 

In a document regarding Gawker's future plans (found in about 20 seconds using Google here: http://paidcontent.org/2013... it is detailed that Gawker planned on hiring several new ""commerce specialists"" for Kotaku and sister-site Jezebel (a female-focused website where a lot of Kotaku's gender-issue articles are cross-linked for additional ad revenue). This was just a few months ago at the end of January 2013. What is a ""commerce specialst""? 

QUOTE 
""The job listings describe the position as “a new type of service journalism” that includes “everything from posts about the cheapest deal on something our readers need to introducing them to new things they’ve never seen,” and notes that Gawker will be deriving revenue from those posts"" 

The phrases that really caught my eye were ""introducing them [readers] to new things they [readers] have never seen"" and ""Gawker will be deriving revenue from those posts"". Is Kotaku's recent explosion (or should I say exploitation) of gender-driven articles something new, something the gaming industry has not seen? Yes, yes indeed. Is the s***-storm stirred up by these articles generating ad revenue for Kotaku and their parent company, Gawker? You bet. 

In another article (here: http://adage.com/article/di... that addressed the same announcement by Gawker this past January, we see another side of the same story: 

QUOTE 
""The company [Gawker] is working on ways to show past posts that have generated high revenue through affiliate links to readers who haven't yet seen them, Mr. Denton said."" 

Interesting. So, Gawker (and by extension Kotaku) is trying to up ad revenue by cross linking posts. Even if you've only read a few Kotaku articles, you've probably noticed that they hyperlink the crap out of their own articles, giving you links to at least a dozen other articles they've written before you're done reading. You want to know an easy way to get ad revenue from these cross-links? Talk about the same topic over and over again. You want an even easier way to get ad revenue from these cross-links? Drum up an artificial controversy where the reader HAS to click back to other articles to get the full story. Oh. Gee. That's exactly what they've done with stories like ""no wimmenz @ PS4 announcement"" and ""Vanillaware is run by juveniles"", because those so-called stories have multiple pages on Kotaku, and of course they all link to one another, just to make sure you're getting the full story. 

Does Kotaku care about gender issues? I'm not sure. Their coverage of all these ""controversies"" comes across as Baby's First Feminism, and now they're hunting for the devil under every rock, or rather, they're hunting for the dominating phallic symbol in every box art, the male-privilege hate-speech in every line of dialog, and an oppressed female behind every pair of oversized cartoon breasts. 

But I think that's giving them too much credit. It seems to me as though this is intentional. Kotaku belongs to a company that has been down on its ad revenue for two years now. Kotaku belongs to a company that wants to aggressively expand its media holdings. Kotaku belongs to a company that paid a mole to steal footage from Fox News and got caught. Kotaku belongs to a company being sued by Dr. Phil for stealing portions of his exclusive interview and airing them before he could. Kotaku belongs to a company that violated Reddit's free speech and privacy policies (and was subsequently blocked) in order to get a ""scoop"" on users who were posting pornography on an adult-only sub forum. Again, these factoids aren't secrets. I found them by spending less than 10 minutes Googling Kotaku and their owners, Gawker. Kotaku already has a reputation for making sensationalist (and poorly-researched) articles about gaming for the purpose of stirring up artificial controversy and raking in the ad revenue when people come to watch the train wreck. 

It would be one thing if they were doing this with videogame-related news (which is something they've always done anyway and it is annoying but ultimately harmless). However, Kotaku is using a real-life issue - gender inequality - and abusing it so that they can make Gawker a few extra bucks. The videogame industry has an opportunity to grow and mature, and gender equality is one issue where we have been growing. However, now Kotaku is stepping in, calling the shots, and pointing the ""sexist"" finger at everyone who disagrees with their take on the topic. They are co-opting the discussion and cramming their own agenda down everyone else's throats. No, it isn't for the purpose of championing a noble cause or crusading for the rights of the oppressed (even then, they would be doing a poor job of it if that was their intention). Kotaku's actions are for the purpose of dredging up ad revenue by any means possible, and this behavior should come as no surprise based on the actions and attitudes of their parent company, Gawker.

personalfinance,"Estate for my mom is being settled (1.3m), have questions about options","My mom passed away in February, and I knew the process for settling the estate would take some time.  During the 9 months preceding her passing, I was pretty stressed at work because of this, and fell behind on our newest product.  Work understood and I had just been given a great review at the beginning of the year.  I am, however, overweight and will be first dealing primarily with my weight because I'm 50....and well, my mom's death scared the hell out of me.

I had about 20k saved up, but no huge savings built up because I've never really made serious bank...enough to get by and have some nice things.

In April, I was going to go on ""vacation"" from work to spend time with my mom in one of her favorite places.  Because of her passing, we instead were going to scatter her ashes there.  I decided to quit my job, just because I needed some time to mourn/cogitate/recover/settle my confusion over life/death.  I just couldn't handle the grind of work at that time.

Herein lies the problem.  My initial impression was that 2 REIT's I had would be sold pretty quickly and would provide me with 35,000 dollars which I could continue to live on until the 3811B Trust worth 1.3 million got settled.  I knew this one could take 6 months to a year.  

My mom's lawyer (not the executor) contacted me in early March and we were going to meet to sign the paperwork to transfer and sell the REIT's.  I let him know about my travel plans to the memorial, and he suggested we wait until after the trip to get the paperwork signed.  What he didn't tell me was that that REIT's could only be sold at the end of each quarter.  So basically, I found out that the process to sell the REIT's would start on 6/30.  By this time, because of the trip, I'd used up about half the savings to pay for the trip, expenses for the trip, etc.

My fault entirely for jumping the gun on quitting my job, however I'd say that my depression and numbness from losing my mom over-rode common sense.

So basically, with about 9k left in savings for now...and my expenses per month are slightly higher because I wanted to continue my medical insurance through COBRA.  I can maybe stretch things till June with my expenses (About 4000/month)

Once the sale of the REIT is given to whoever ""manages"" the REIT's on 6/30, how long does it normally take for them to get the process finished and send a check or transfer the funds to my bank/financial adviser I recently got in anticipation of the 3811B money.

I'm trying to decide whether I will need to sell my car (a 2012 Sonic) or something else to last out the paperwork shuffle that is happening now.  If I had just known that the REIT sales could only be executed quarterly and could have been done in March...I wouldn't have waited until after the trip.

I have no current plans to buy a house, but might need a car within two years and would definitely spring for one if that's what I need to do to keep a larger payment history on my report. It's possible I would want to buy a house within 7 years of paying off the next car.

tl;dr: Can you go too long between periods of paying off a sizable loan?",finance,1368504088
business,WORDPRESS: Reviews by Abney and Associates/GOOD.IS,"Internet Reviews Abney Associates Blog Articles
The US Federal Trade Commission has carried out a huge international crackdown on a number of ""tech support"" scams being run out of India which have conned people in the UK, US, Canada and elsewhere out of millions of pounds since 2008. As explained by the Guardian in 2010, the scams used ""boiler room"" tactics, dialling through phone books for English-speaking countries. People who answered the phone were told the call came from Microsoft or their internet service provider, and that the person's computer was ""reporting viruses"". The caller would then perform an unnecessary ""fix"" on the computer and charge the person for it – and sometimes sign them up to multi-year ""support"" contracts. The cost could run to hundreds of pounds.
People in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were targeted because they, like the people carrying out the scam, are English-speaking. The Guardian understands that the scam was worth millions of pounds a year to the organised gangs carrying it out. At the FTC's request in six cases, a federal district judge froze the US assets of 17 people and 14 companies that have been accused of taking part in the operations. The FTC has also shut down 80 internet domain names and 130 phone numbers used in the US to carry out the scams. The FTC is seeking an end to the scams, and repayments for people who were conned out of money. Though the FTC said it could not put a figure on how many people had been scammed, or how much they had lost, Microsoft – which has been working with the commission for the past two years to try to catch the criminals – provided data on more than a thousand people who had been scammed, whose losses averaged $875 each.
Microsoft has repeatedly pointed out that it would not call people about any problems with their computers. In some cases, the scammers would try to sell antivirus software from reputable companies, and in some cases would install new copies of Windows on a machine. However the licence key used on the software allowed Microsoft to trace it back to its buyer, which aided the investigation. The fraud occurred in several English-speaking countries. Joining the FTC in the enforcement action were the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency. David Vladeck, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said it was working with law enforcement officials in India to catch the alleged perpetrators. The commission has also referred the cases to the US justicedepartment for possible criminal prosecution.

Since I had a good amount of equity I took an extra $60K out and invested it in the S&amp;P500 index.  Today it is worth $100K, around what I owe on my house.  I have no debt other than my mortgage.

I was thinking of using the investment to help fund my kids’ (ages 16,15 and 12) education.  I currently have $40K in 529 plans but I know that will not be enough.  My goal is to be able to pay for %75 of their college so they are not straddled with an ungodly amount of debt.

My question is, should I:

Option 1: Cash out the S&amp;P index fund and pay off the house.

Option 2: Leave the balance in the S&amp;P investment.

Option 3: Transfer the investment to 529 plans over the next three years.

Bitcoin,"Mt. Gox, like e-gold, is foiled in U.S. operations by failing to register as a ""money transmitter""","I have a brief article on the Mt. Gox/Dwolla seizure that I'll try to continue updating with any developments. 

http://www.bitcoinlaw.net/developing-dwolla-ordered-to-freeze-mt-gox-account-in-seizure-warrant-by-department-of-homeland-security/

Money transmitters -- like Dwolla and Paypal and Western Union -- have to register with the federal government, as some protection against money laundering.  

Mt. Gox, with some apparent hubris in believing that registration requirements did not apply abroad, or that Bitcoins were somehow exempt, did not register.  This is pretty much the same fate that brought down e-gold.  E-gold, of course, was much more centralized and subject to government interference with the single point of failure.  But, of course Mt. Gox had become a dominant Bitcoin exchange -- whose ability to process and make payments will now certainly be impacted.  

Mt. Gox's Dwolla account is now frozen for the foreseeable future.  While this is not an attack on Bitcoin itself, it does reinforce the FinCEN guidance. 

As if Mt. Gox's technical/DDOS woes hadn't already caused some volatility in the Bitcoin marketplace, the failure to register as a money-transmitter after the FinCEN guidance could now end up with a significant amount of customer funds frozen.",cryptocurrency,1368641095

personalfinance,Question about my student loan consolidation options,"Hello all:

I am 22 y/o, making ~50k a year and in my first year of full time employment.  In my time at school, I was very under-educated in regards to how much money I was borrowing in order to pay for it and sort of dug myself a hole (this is entirely different discussion).  That being said, I have my ducks in a row and I am prepared to start filling said hole right away!  My question for you is:  What are my loan consolidation options at this point?  I know that there are better interest rates out there than what I'm currently getting screwed with on some of these bad boys. 

First things first,  this is my current loan disbursement: 

**PRIVATE LOANS**

Great Lakes Holding:

* Discover Loan (~8%) = $28,000
* Discover Loan (~9.5%) = $15,000
* USBANK Loan (~6%) = $47,000

Wells Fargo Holding:

* Wells Fargo Loan (~10%) = $27,000

**FEDERAL LOANS**

Sallie Mae Holding:

* Sallie Mae Cumulative (~6.8%) = $34,000


**Other potentially relevant info:**

personalfinance,Target Date Break Even ROI for Graduate Degree,"I've been thinking about pursuing a graduate degree and am trying to evaluate the effect of such on my personal financial situation.  Please note that the following is gross of tax.

My current income is $80k base with a variable bonus component.  For the sake of the analysis, I've estimated the bonus at $5k, which is somewhat low (received a $15k bonus last year), but I'd expect to receive at least that each year.  My career is in a bit of a weird place, so I've modeled salary growth a few different ways.  I've shown flat 2% growth indefinitely (that's probably low in the short term and high in the long term) and two stage growth with 5% growth in the short term tapering off to 2% growth long term (current career has a salary ceiling).  It's highly likely that I will switch out of my current area in the next 1-2 years taking a potential pay cut (MBA notwithstanding), which I haven't modeled.

The program I am looking into is a two year, full time program with a paid internship over the summer bridging the two years; standard full-time MBA program.  I've estimated the all-in costs to be $75k per year.  Tuition runs between $55k and $65k with housing and living expenses being a variable; I came up with $75k as a somewhat conservative estimate; every school I am looking at except Boston schools will probably be below this.

Internship expected salary is $15k.  Post-graduation, the median salary of the weakest school I am applying to is ~$115k with a median $20k signing bonus; this is the baseline for all my salary projections, but there is a big upside, if I get into H/S/W it would be more like $160k base + $30k bonus.  I'm assuming no other bonuses in the out years, but post-MBA the bonus potential is much higher than my current career.  Also looked at two different scenarios, a 5% flat post-MBA salary growth and a 5% growth for 5 years declining to 2.5% after that.

For discount rate, I'm assuming 4% (7% interest rate for student loans less 3% inflation).

Based on the above outlined terms, I am looking at between 8 and 9 years to achieve break-even ROI between getting an MBA and staying in my current career.  To me, that seems like a long time to get to break even, but I'm not sure what a ""normal"" break even period is for graduate degrees.  

I feel like there is something I am missing here because basically it doesn't seem to make much sense to get my MBA from a financial perspective.  I'm hopeful there is just something I am missing here.

TL;DR What is an acceptable break even time for professional graduate degrees?",finance,1368627968

personalfinance,From the bank's point of view...,"About 1 year ago I moved from one coast to the other. I did not have a stable job before this one.

To help me with the move, I took out an unsecured personal loan with Wells Fargo at 15% (I was desperate, and knew I'd have it paid off within one year) @ $120/mo with a 5 year term.

A few months after I've paid down a massive chunk of credit card debt and hacked away other debts, my credit score improved from 580 to 690. I approached Wells Fargo and asked for a refinance. They refinanced the debt to be 12.5% @ $160/mo for 3 years.

So, here's my question. From the point of the view of the bank, why on earth would they want to refinance the loan? They're already getting an extremely high interest rate on it. Refinancing takes more manpower for them to do and they lose money on it. Why would the bank take advantage of an offer that loses them money?

personalfinance,More questions about saving for future kid's college fund,"You guys were SUPER helpful in terms of us figuring out the 529 vs EFC options so I figured I'd try my hand at our next set of questions!

When we were younger both our grandparents would purchase US saving bonds at 50% discount that would mature + interest in 17-30 years. Now though it appears that due to a weak US economy and instability of the US dollar's value, the interest rates are as low as 0.6 for EE bonds. 

So my question is, would it be worth it to invest in EE or I bonds at this point? (if I understand correctly I bonds yield slightly more ~3%) Or would a smarter option be to invest in CDs or T-bonds that are still earning around 1 &amp; 3%? We'd still be putting a monthly investment into the 529 but were curious to know if the other options would yield more over the long run for special occasions like if we had extra cash to set aside for holidays. Whether we buy II/EE/CDs/T-Bonds or just add our extra earnings into the 529 when we have them, the money would not be touched for 18 years/bonds would not be cashed in.

personalfinance,My student loan debt fiasco,"So when I was 17, I was very stupid and immature (go figure right?). After high school I attended an exceedingly expensive private university. During that time, my mother handled all of my finances (FAFSA, loans, scholarships, everything). To make a long story short, when I went to register for classes for the spring semester of sophomore year I found out that I owed the university about $20,000 before I could register. My mother hadn’t taken out any loans or taken care of anything at all. After a mad dash of trying to cover that debt, I was able to take out a few loans but still fell short and ultimately had to drop out.

That all transpired back in 2009. Since then, I have been living on my own and working full time in retail. I earn less than $15,000 per year and consequently have not even made an attempt to pay any of the loans back. By this point, they are all in default/collections and my wages are being garnished. Additionally, my transcripts are being held by my former university preventing me from attending another. 

Up until recently, I haven’t even tried to get my finances straight, however, I am getting older and I need to take care of this situation. Furthermore, my grandmother passed away and my parents, who don’t have very much money themselves, are setting aside some money from the proceeds of selling her house in order to pay down some of my debt.

So here is the problem, I have no idea what I am doing. My loans are so delinquent that they have been passed from collection agency to collection agency. Resultantly, I have no clue where they are now, where they originated, and how much they total. I really have been trying hard to figure it all out but it is so very complicated. I have been cross referencing data that I have attained from the National Student Loan Data System, my credit reports, financial statements from my former university, and random letters I have gotten from collection agencies and I there is no continuity. The amounts and institutions are different on every single document. It looks like I have about nine loans altogether (this includes one private loan as well as several Perkins, and Stafford loans). Also, I owe approximately $10,000 (the amount that I couldn’t get loans to cover sophomore year) directly to the university which they have subsequently sold to a collection agency.

At this point, I am just so overwhelmed and I really don’t think that I can do this by myself. These are my ultimate goals and I don’t have the fuzziest idea of how to accomplish them:

    A.	Pay off whatever needs paid so that my transcripts can be released and I can go back to school

    B.	Have the loans deferred while I am in school so that I am eligible to receive federal funding in the form of a Pell Grant

    C.	Settle with the collection agencies in order to reduce the total amount of debt

    D.	Consolidate as much as possible for the sake of simplicity

Moreover, I would have no problem and would actually prefer to pay a professional a good sum of money to cure me of this nightmare. Someone who would be able to track down all of these loans, bargain with the agencies to reduce the amounts (maybe even enough to pay the smaller ones off with a lump sum) and eventually get them consolidated and deferred. I just don’t know who to go to. An accountant? A Lawyer? A bank? Who would be able to take care of all that?

Now, I am not entirely certain how much money will be available from my parents but I am guessing in the $10-15,000 range. And as it stands now, I figure that I have somewhere between $20-30,000 in debt.  I really want this whole ordeal to be over with because it has been ruining my life for too many years now. If anyone out there has any advice for me, it would be so very greatly appreciated. Please and thank you.

tl;dr I have crazy amounts of student debt that I have defaulted on and now I have a bit of money to start taking care of them. How do I track all of these loans down, settle with the agencies, consolidate them, and defer them while I go back to school? Who would be able to help me do this?",finance,1368744233
personalfinance,I just got my first paycheck and had a few questions on federal/state taxes and withholdings.,"So I'm just about 19 years old and got my first job (yeah, I know). Anyway, when I was filling out my W4 while being hired, I was rushed through and claimed 0 allowances so the full amount is being withheld from my paycheck.

I work full time and go to school full time. And I'd like to try to limit the amount that is withheld from my paycheck so I can afford to save up and move out.

I live with my parents but they charge me $300 in rent + utilities/food and don't contribute anything to college but yet they can still claim me as a dependent. My question for this is how can I claim myself instead of them claiming me or how would it work if I were to claim myself? Who would take precedence?

And my last question is are there any other allowances I can claim? I'm a full time college student and thought I might be able to claim something with that.

And if anyone could ELI5 the whole withholdings/allowances thing because I think I understand some of it but it just seems pretty confusing. I know the less that gets withheld means the higher the probability I might oh the IRS, but I'd rather owe the IRS than have them hold my money without interest and pay it back whenever they feel.

As the banker was processing the change, he said he could upgrade the rewards on my credit card because I had old rewards benefits. I'm very careful with my credit and don't open up new cards if I don't have to. The rewards program with the card he was suggesting sounded great so I asked if this was an upgrade to my current account or a completely new account. He confirmed it was an upgrade.

A couple weeks later I called the main 1-800 number to find out what actually happened. Not only did he sign me up for a completely new account but he closed down my old account and forfeited my previous rewards! I was floored. He blatantly lied to me, twice. The customer service person apologized up and down for the mistake and credited the rewards to my new account. I asked if we could reverse the new account and go back to the old and was told the obvious that it's too late now.

personalfinance,Need Advice for Keeping on Track with Medium-Term Savings Goal,"**tl;dr: How to stay on track with aggressive savings when goal is 6 years out and you worry you don't have quite that much self-control?** 


I recently refinanced my condo mortgage to a new 30-yr term and dropped my monthly minimum payment by quite a bit. If I continued to pay the same amount as I did previously, I could pay off the loan in 10 years without feeling any hit on my budget. Awesome, right?


However, I've been considering upgrading to a house in a few years (preferably not much more than 6 years). My strategy was to plan for a very conservative scenario in which I needed to save for a $60,000 downpayment from scratch (i.e., not factor in current savings and not consider equity from the condo to help me toward that goal) and to plow the savings from the refi plus whatever else I can scrounge up into savings for the house downpayment. This way I'm saving aggressively and if some amazing opportunity comes up or I just get fed up with waiting, I could tap into other funds if necessary and I could reach my goal faster.


The challenge for me is that it's only been a few months since I refi'd and I'm already having a hard time thinking of that ""extra"" money as untouchable. I suspect it's going to be hard to be hyper-aggressive and focused on saving month in/month out for five to six years without breaking resolve at some point.   I've set up an automatic deposit into a separate savings account, but I'll be very tempted to reduce the amount down the road to ""treat"" myself here and there.  And if I'm not serious about hitting my target in 6 years, then I might as well invest in something better than a savings account.

personalfinance,"My partner has the cash to buy a 35-45k car outright after his got totaled. What about financing it at a low interest rate and putting the ""Saved"" money into the market instead? Is this a stupid idea?","Just what the title says: My partner has to buy a car and he has the cash to buy it outright: A lump sum from the payment of his totaled car (28k), pus some more he will put down at purchase time.   He will be getting a nice, expensive used car as that is what he loves.   A friend mentioned that the money might do better in the market over time vs paying cash.  I know that puts the money at market risk, but doesn't putting it all on a car at once as well?  I mean, he just totaled his last car in an accident (not his fault) but because he got the car used and for a good deal 3 years ago, he was paid handsomely for it.  (Bought it used 3 years ago for 31 and got 28 out of it from insurance.)  I don't know if he had a loan on what he would have been paid...I don't know how that works. 

Anyway, so with this much cash I'm not sure whether a low interest loan is best while putting the rest to work long-term in a target date fund (we are both 36), or whether it is better to buy it all in cash up front.

What do you think?  
  
**NOTE:** A car that expensive is a not an investment, and I know all the smart arguments against them, but he can afford it and still meet savings goals.  I'm not interested in the ""get a 10k car instead"" discussions.  I know that senario is the wisest financially when it comes to cars, but that is *not* what will be happening here so I don't even want to go into it. He gets expensive cars a few years old, does his research, only looks at gems with low mileage, gets good prices for them etc.  So, even though he pays a lot for his cars, he could be doing it a LOT worse.  I drive a 2001 Mazda I hope to drive into the ground so we are different in that regard, but cars are his hobby and love, and about the only thing he spends money on other than savings so whatever...

personalfinance,Order of loan repayment - by highest interest rate or most interest accrued?,"Soon I'll be making a **very** large payment to deduct from the principal amounts of several of my student loans.  I've read on here that I should be paying off loans starting with the highest interest rate.
   
My question is simple.  Why not pay off the loan that will accrue the most interest rather than that with the highest interest rate?
  
For example:  
**Loan A** is for **$5,000** at a **10%** interest rate
**Loan B** is for **$10,000** at a **7%** interest rate
That means (I think) that Loan A will accrue $500 over a year, and Loan B will accrue $700.  Wouldn't I want to pay off the principal on Loan B first, even though it has a lower interest rate than Loan A?

gaming,"My thoughts about Sanctum 2 and the negative feedback that exploded out. (Some spoilers, read at your own risk.)","UPDATE: Coffee Stain Studios patched the game so that the resources automatically appear in your inventory now rather than having to sprint back to grab them at the Core. I tip my hat to them. Way to listen to the community, guys!

Okay, I was a huge fan of Sanctum. Scratch the ""was"" off, I still *am* a huge fan of Sanctum, and the sequel is still pretty fun. I do, however, have some issues with some of the gameplay. However, I feel that some of the players who have been complaining exaggerated on some of the issues.

The first issue, which is by far the biggest one that I really felt during the game, is the tower cap. I understand for balancing purposes that they wanted to put a cap on turrets for this game, but ten is a VERY low number, especially with the scale of some of the maps, and the nodes (bases) you can place highly outnumber the amount of turrets you can place. The map felt barren when I had probably nearly 60 nodes on the map, but only 10 turrets. For those of you who can do basic math, thats a 6:1 ratio, which is highly ridiculous in a game about turret defense. This is my biggest complaint. From here on in, most of the other issues just bother me some but I'll either just learn to play with them or I can deal with them until a patch/mod comes out to fix the issue.

My next issue is how the resources are used. First of all, there are far too few resources for the turrets. The turrets themselves are expensive to place, let alone upgrade (and on a side tangent, the upgrades' prices aren't listed in the UI, so I had to memorize prices, which annoyed me to an extent.) ~~Also, instead of giving the player the resources immediately, they drop them at the Core, so you have to sprint back and pick them up. This part isn't too bad, but it's tedious, and in multiplayer (as many have mentioned) people will just hide by the Core and then take all of the resources, robbing the fun from the other players.~~ Lastly, why didn't they keep nodes/bases as a resource? Why did they make them separate? I feel like that just overcomplicates things. I feel that they should have just left the bases as items that cost like 2 resources to build.

Another issue is the somewhat random timer between rounds. I've noticed while playing singleplayer that most of the time, I have unlimited time to build just like in the original, but once I reach a certain wave, suddenly I only have 1 minute and 15 seconds to build and decide. I'm sure there's a pattern that I just haven't seen yet, but I don't really understand why that's there in the first place. Sure, I may have understood that they wanted to rush it if it was in EVERY wave, but having it in there sporadically doesn't make much sense.

Turrets and guns seem to be incredibly nerfed in this game. Don't get me wrong, I still do fine in the game, but I feel almost powerless when fighting them, even when I'm fighting alongside turrets. Even my upgraded turrets feel weak to me, like I'm just shooting air.

Lack of weapon upgrades is a bit of a disappointment to me. Even if it were only like three levels, similar to the turrets, I think it would be nice, but not overly needed.

My only quarrel with the new HP system is that there is no bar indicating your HP. I think it was a decent idea to make players respawn so that you couldn't just get beaten and not die, but I'd like to know how close I am to dying, thank you very much.

I'd also prefer if the Core health was a little more accessible, rather than having to aim at the Core to know. Just a tiny bar in the corner, or maybe if it appeared while you held the ""Enlarge Map"" key.

No more air enemies(?): I haven't encountered any anti-air turrets or air Looms in the game yet, but I did notice that the character Sweet Autumn has a Rex which was mentioned to be good for ""air control"" so maybe I just have to play farther.

Having said all of that, here are some things that I think are improvements...

The new appearance of items, specifically the textures, but also the way they built upon the block placement. The falling can be annoying sometimes, but I think it gives a good ""solid"" feel to placing items. Also, I like that when blocks are placed together, they mechanically connect, even diagonally. It's a much cleaner look rather than placing giant cubes everywhere.

The character classes: It seems almost TF2-esque to make this system, but I think it's good for balancing purposes. I know that in the original Sanctum I felt that my weapon layout was amazing and that it couldn't be beat. Restricting players to one primary and one secondary like a run-of-the-mill FPS may seem a little cliche, but I believe it's better for keeping players from being too overpowered.

The new Core damage mechanic: I think I like the way they did it this time better. The enemies used to jump into the Core and die, but do tons of damage to the Core, where you could only have like ten guys ever reach the Core and then you lose. Now, they remain alive at the Core, and attack in timed patterns. This is a bit more traditional to defense games, and it makes a little more sense. Also, it gives you more of a chance to defend the Core. (There's a perk in the game as well called ""Unstable Core"" that deals damage to Looms attacking the Core...pretty nifty.)

The removal of the televators: I used the hell out of 'em in Sanctum, but mostly because the blocks were too tall to jump onto. By lowering the block height, they really eliminated the need for televators besides teleporting all over the map, but even in the originial Sanctum I felt like that was a bit tipped in favor of the player. I used them, but I don't miss them.

The new secondary weapons: I haven't gotten very far in the campaign yet, but I unlocked the Battle Rifle, and that weapon just makes me happy. I think this weapon system, although nerfed and kind of weak, is a little better in variety.

Perks and Feats of Strength: The Feats of Strength remind me of Skulls from Halo. They add a difficult feature to the game to up the difficulty and change how to play it. I appreciate the idea, especially since rather than upgrading the enemy in its entirety, you can just make them faster, or more aggresive. The Perks are for the players, and are pretty interesting. As I said before, there are some for the Core itself, and there are some for the player. There's one called Hollow Point that makes every third bullet do +100% weapon damage. There's also a perk that makes your bullets cause chain lightning. It's a nice addition, and once you've unlocked them it seems to cover the nerfing of the weapons for the most part.

New enemies: They still brought back most of the old ones, but I'm liking some of the new ones. I'm assuming they used the Warrior Walkers to replace the Giant Walkers, and I approve. In Sanctum 2, the Giant Walkers would've killed you while fucking your dog. The Warrior Walkers are only slightly larger than regular Walkers, just more heavily armored and have different attacks, such as a giant swipe and a jumping ground slam. The Armored Heavy is a major pain in the ass in my opinion, but in terms of game design was a good thing to add in order to make players think more strategically. You'll still see where it's being released from, and knowing that turrets can't really affect it for the most part really makes you rethink your layout. Usually in the end you have to shoot it a bunch to kill it. The Boss character, the Walker Patriarch, is another pain in the ass but definitely a cool game changer. Basically, once this bastard walks onto the field, you're going to drop everything to kill him. He's got a massive health bar, he's physically massive, and he can DESTROY YOUR STRUCTURES. He can seriously ruin your game if you don't end him quickly. But like I said, definitely a cool new twist on the enemy line-up.

SiMo: He's a sniping robot. That is all.

The helping characters: You remember those guys in orange suits that always cowered in the corner? They still do that sometimes, but they also help you out in this game. They have rifles and shoot the enemies. However, they can only take about two hits from the average Walker before they're dead, but they're a nice beginning defense for when you only have like two turrets.

Story: There's actually a story now, and it's interesting enough to keep me playing to find out what's going to happen. I'm not going to elaborate much so that I don't spoil it.

The new minimap: I really liked the old 3-D overview of the map from the original Sanctum, which was basically just a camera placed above the map. It was cool and you got to see stuff play out in live action. However, it got kind of dodgy visually because stuff was happening and colors blended together. The new minimap is simple and easy to read, and I think it's a little better to navigate.

Easter Eggs: There are new ones! And they're cool! I approve.

That's about all I can think of for now. I may edit this later to add more as I think of it, but for now, that's my review. Personally, I'd probably give it about a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. It may not be the old Sanctum, but it definitely is still entertaining and I'll play it. Hell, it's only $15. I kind of felt this way when I first played Bioshock Infinite because it was vastly different from the first two Bioshocks, but I decided to stop judging it as a Bioshock game and just look at it as a video game. Sure, it may not be super similar to its predecessors, but if someone who hadn't played Sanctum were to play Sanctum 2, they would probably like it. In terms of a game, it's complete and functions just fine, bar a few bugs and issues here and there. None of it is particularly game-breaking, because I can still complete levels just fine. I'm waiting to see if Coffee Stain Studios may patch some of the issues, but if not, I'm either going to learn how to use UDK or I'm going to wait until someone comes up with their own patch or mod to fix the issues that they feel they need to fix. And I may download it. Or I may not. Either way, give the guys some credit, because the game is still good.

personalfinance,"25, male, ~$40k. What should I do with my money? (S.

Now I'm working as a technical researcher in a private company (you can substitute this as the military service in SK if you have an advanced degree in engineering) and I make about 40k a year after tax, which is not so bad comparing to what I would've made in US, considering the costs. (first of all, you don't really need a car in Seoul)

So, at least financially, I'm 2 years (duration of SK military service) ahead of about 90% of males in SK, and I'd like to maximize that advantage instead of blowing it away doing/buying stupid shit. My (tentative) plan is to save about 150k til I turn 30, so that I can finance myself whatever I do; going back to the states for phd after military service, buying a property and settling down here, or whatever it may be. 

During my 22 months of service, I saved:

~$35k cash in savings account

~$8k in mutual funds, index funds, gold, etc. (I started taking interest in those funds rather recently)

My monthly expense is about $800~900, and I have 14 months left to serve (after which I can stay, working the same job, possibly with a raise, if I want to). After expense, I have about $2500 for my disposal, and I invest about $1500 to various index funds (korea, japan, china, global reit). And I dump the rest into the savings account. (~$1000)
Since I'm young and able to invest in a longer term, I think I can err more to a riskier portfolio, and I'm even considering moving some of the cash, since the interest rate here is shit (3.8%? 3.9%? I can't remember) Also, I'm pretty sure that my investment strategy is equally shitty because it is entirely based on the things I learned reading a random walk down wall street.

investing,Stock Pitch: WhiteWave Foods,"Background

WhiteWave Foods (WWAV) is a diversified food company that engages in the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of plant-based foods and beverages, coffee creamers, and dairy products. These products range from soy and almond-based milks to organic milk, yogurt and cheese under various brand names. Some of the more prominent ones include Silk, Alpro (Europe), International Delight, and Horizon Organic. They sell their products to grocery stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores and health food stores, with Walmart being the largest customer.

The company was recently spun-off from Dean Foods (DF) as a way for DF to raise additional cash to pay down their debt and maximize the value of its fastest growing segment. Not only does DF continue to hold about 85% of the outstanding stock in WWAV, but after the final distribution to shareholders in late May, plans to retain about 19.9%.

Summarized Thesis

WhiteWave Foods is a good investment at these levels:

WWAV is drastically undervalued from both a DCF and relative value standpoint. Even using conservative assumptions results in about a 30-35% undervaluation (above).
Dean Foods holds (and will continue to hold) a large stake in the company, so it is in their best interest to support WWAV's stock price and growth efforts.
The company has a strong economic moat, based on a globally recognized brand name, experienced management, and a well-established distribution network, enabling them to be first to market with new products. Their four major brands have at least a 30% market share in their respective subcategories, and continued innovation leads to limited market share erosion.
The markets that WWAV serves, specifically natural and organic dairy products, continue to grow at a rapid pace, exceeding traditional industry averages and leading to robust top line growth. WWAV's product categories are seeing growth rates ranging from 7-12% over the last three years, compared to the 1% overall grocery market growth rate. With a dominant market position in these key segments, they should benefit disproportionately from these consumer trends. Growth comes both organically (60%) and from new product developments (40%), thereby reducing the reliance on potentially overpriced acquisitions to fuel growth. WWAV's organic growth is much higher than competitors such as HAIN.
Many value investors will see the debt and immediately dismiss the company, without doing further research. This debt is in the form of revolving credit lines and bears a blended interest rate of about 2.2% (LIBOR +2-2.5%), with maturities due primarily in 2017 and beyond. WWAV has devoted its excess cash to paying these off as soon as possible, but the debt's effect on the company's short-term liquidity is minimal.
Impending success of new product initiatives and brand extensions will drive growth. The company has launched Silk non-dairy yogurt and ready-to-serve iced coffee, both of which have been well-received by customers. As a first-mover in these segments, WWAV will benefit from brand loyalty and favorable product placement. Management has learned from past successful launches and should be able to continue to implement these strategies in the future.
Valuation

Price Target: $23.11 (+31% upside)

Relative Value/Break-Up Analysis

In performing this analysis, I used a wide range of comparable companies that are similar in size, products and customer base, and then categorized them as either a traditional packaged food company or an organic food company. There were several multiples used: Forward P/E, EV/EBIDTA, and EV/Sales, etc. What I found is that WWAV was trading in the bottom of the group based on sales (1.6x EV/Sales vs. 1.9x average) as well as PEG (1.46 vs. 2.08), and that EV/EBITDA (14.5x), while in the middle, was significantly below the organic food companies (22.9x).

This brings me to my point: not only is the company valued significantly below its peers based on sales, but many view WWAV as a traditional food company when the company derives 64% of its sales from what it considers to be ""good-for-you"", health-conscious foods. The problem is that since WWAV was spun off from DF, many see it as a company related to DF in its products, when in fact it is not. HAIN, BNNY, and BDBD are the three closest organic food product companies, and the multiples for these organic companies are much higher than the traditional food industry because they offer better growth prospects, in line with those of WWAV. As mentioned above, two of WWAV's businesses, plant-based beverages and premium dairy, are considered natural, healthy alternatives. They comprise 64% of total revenues and were valued using the organic industry's multiples. The remaining 36%, coffee creamers and beverages, was valued using the traditional packaged foods industry multiples listed below.

So, for the base case, I applied the organic industry EV/EBITDA multiple (22.9) to 64% of the company's EBITDA and the traditional packed food industry multiple (11.3) to the remaining 36%, resulting in an 18.7x average multiple. Then applying this 18.7x multiple to WWAV's EBITDA of 254.6m = 4,760m - 762m in present value net debt, divided by 173m outstanding shares to arrive at a price of $23.11 (+31% upside).

Base case: 18.7x EV/EBITDA = $23.11 (31% upside)

The downside scenario is if the entire company is valued as a large traditional food company; applying the 11.3x multiple gives us a price of $12.17 (-30%).

The upside scenario values the entire company at the organic multiple of 22.9x, resulting in a price of $29.26 (+65%).

Applying the same methodology to EV/Sales gives a base case target price of $27.23 (+54%).

DCF: Management has been traditionally very conservative in their guidance, and believes they will see ""high single digit"" sales growth, which analysts estimate to be around 9.5%. Being even more conservative, I used 9% in 2013 estimates and then lowered it to 8.5% for the remaining stub periods. The operating margin used was 8.0%, based on management's belief that operating income will grow in the mid-teens this year and margins will expand as excess capacity is built out. Management also guided capex to an unusually high number due to its ongoing investment in capacity growth. A WACC was calculated using the company's target capital structure (20/80), the equity market risk premium (6.7%) was estimated using the mean unlevered beta of comparable companies and a market risk premium of 7%, and Hain Celestial's cost of debt (5.98%) was used, which is the closest competitor of WWAV that has outstanding debt. After discounting back all of the cash flows by the WACC, including the terminal value which calculates 2.5% perpetuity growth, I subtracted the net debt and off-balance sheet commitments and determined the fair value of the company to be approximately $19.87 (+12%).

Multiples		DCF

EV/EBITDA	12.17	23.11	29.26		16.07	19.87	23.72

Catalysts

Recent spin-off with a 47% short float. Many investors put on a pair trade believing DF to be undervalued with its 85% interest in WWAV, and as a result went long DF and short WWAV. They believe that at the current levels, DF is trading at the lowest multiple in its history and is therefore undervalued. However, they are severely overlooking the fact that WWAV (and recently sold Morningstar) were the major growth drivers and the reason for the high multiple. Without those businesses, DF is simply a slow-growing company worthy of a lower multiple. The pair trade is wrong in its assumptions and shorts will eventually cover when DF distributes the additional 60% of the outstanding stock (bringing its ownership under 20%) at the end of May. A major short squeeze will result, and many funds will begin building positions via this distribution. This is the biggest catalyst. From reports I read, investors are shorting not because they doubt WWAV's growth prospects, but because they want to own the DF stub based on the belief that it is undervalued, and the only way to do this is to short out the company's WWAV ownership.
Expansion into additional channels, such as away-from-home, convenience stores, drug and dollar stores, and the food service channel. Traditionally, WWAV has primarily served grocery stores and mass merchandisers. Also, expansion into Eastern Europe as a potential first-mover seems promising. The soy-based alternative to both milk and yogurt is significantly lower as a percentage of sales in this region, as it compares to Western Europe. They also recently introduced almond and hazelnut milk to the European markets as an alternative to soy.
Increased household penetration. WWAV's brands, namely the ones in the plant based beverages and premium dairy, have incredibly low penetration rates compared to traditional milk, mainly because these products were previously seen as ""needs"" for those who are lactose intolerant. However, recent introduction of almond and coconut-based milks has pushed these products in the direction of ""wants"", as healthier, natural, and good tasting alternatives to traditional milk. Growing household acceptance will lead to increased demand. With market leading brands, the company is positioned to capture a disproportionately large share of this industry growth.
Margin expansion. Current capacity bottleneck affecting bottom line. WWAV is investing in manufacturing facility expansion over the next year since it is operating at maximum capacity, and as a result, suffers from unusually high storage costs with co-packers. This problem should be resolved as the bottleneck is fixed towards the second half of the year, allowing for potentially greater top-line growth and lower costs. In other words, the company is experiencing such high demand that they lack the internal warehousing to store their finished goods. The completion of this facility will result in additional cost synergies and margin expansion. WWAV is operating at one of the lowest EBIT margins (8%) in its peer group (11% average) and it should be able to achieve operating improvements as it leverages its growing asset base to achieve economies of scale.
Industry

As far as the industry goes, WWAV has been positioning themselves as the leading brand in some of the fastest growing product categories in the world.

Sales breakdown:

North America plant-based food and beverage (24%) -&gt; Silk
Europe plant-based food and beverage (16%) -&gt; Alpro
Coffee and creamers (36%) -&gt; International Delight
Premium dairy (24%) -&gt; Horizon Organic
The plant-based food and beverage industry has an 8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) with growing household penetration (16% in 2009 to 25% in 2012) and an increased customer focus on the nutritional benefits of their purchases. Within this industry, almond beverages (16% CAGR) represent one of the fastest growing segments in the US, providing WWAV's North American plant-based segment with 20% growth. Silk controls a 57% market share of the $1.1B industry in the US, while Alpro maintains a 38% share in Europe.

The coffee creamers and beverages industry has a 9% CAGR, with flavored creamers and ready-to-drink beverages growing at 14%, which are the segments WWAV targets under the name International Delight. A recent study shows that while 64% of all adults (18+) in the country drink coffee, only 22% prefer to drink it black, with no additives. WWAV's International Delight holds a 30% market share in coffee creamers, a $1.7 billion subcategory, and has seen sales growth in the high teens for the full year as a result of its ready-to-drink iced coffee launch.

The premium dairy industry is growing at a 7% rate, but within this is organic milk which has seen 10% yearly growth. WWAV notes a growing interest in organic milk because it is produced without pesticides or growth hormones, and therefore resonates with health-conscious consumers. Organic milk represented 6.9% of all milk sales in 2009 and now has 8.2% as of 2012. Here it is worth noting that WWAV's brand, Horizon Organic, has a 43% market share in organic milk, a $1.3 billion industry.

Competitive Advantages

I believe the company holds a competitive advantage based on brand name, its established distribution and supplier network, and product innovation expertise.

The four aforementioned products, Silk, Alpro, Horizon Organic and International Delight, are the company's four biggest sales drivers and all maintain a dominant position in their industry. The first three have a market share that is at least four times bigger than the next competing product, and International Delight ranks second overall, behind Nestle's Coffee Mate. This in itself is a major competitive advantage due to the associated brand recognition with the products, which stems from product innovation with respect to brand extensions and from being a first-mover. Based on reviews, customers favor WWAV's products over its competitors because of their stable shelf lives, product consistency, taste, and variety of offerings. Many also purchase their products because of the health benefits. For example, Silk is preferred by those who are lactose intolerant, dislike the taste of regular milk, or are simply looking for a nutrition boost since the product has more calcium and fewer calories than regular milk.

In addition, WhiteWave is able to leverage its extensive supply chain network to both market and distribute its products in a timely fashion, leading to high product-turnover rates and vast economies of scale. They currently operate five manufacturing plants, two distribution centers and three strategic co-packers in the United States, and source their materials from farmers throughout the country.

The company's downstream operations rely on a sales force and long-running relationships with independent brokers. Having its own sales force enables them to establish collaborative partnerships and facilitate favorable terms and shelf placement. So from a value chain perspective, it appears they are well-established within the industry, and a new entrant would have a difficult time coming in and securing these relationships.

WWAV continues to invest money into marketing and product development and has been extremely successful in gaining traction. They conduct focus group studies and consumer taste tests, gaining valuable direct consumer input in order to develop marketing strategies and single out the products most likely to be successful. Two prime examples of this are Silk PureAlmond, which was launched in 2010, and International Delight CoffeeHouse Inspirations in 2009, both of which ranked in the top 3% of all consumer packaged food and beverage launches in the United States, which is measured in terms of the first twelve months of the product's sales. Along with this organic growth is a series of brand acquisitions over the last decade whose products the company was able to more efficiently produce and distribute across different geographic markets.

Management

Fueling these growth efforts is a management team with decades of experience in the consumer packaged food and beverage industry. The CEO, Gregg Engles, has 24 years of experience building the Dean Foods product portfolio and turning it into a multi-billion dollar company. In addition, several other executive officers were founding members of the team that built WhiteWave through brand acquisition, or were early employees who have led it to its subsequent growth.

Conclusion

Obvious risks are present with the DCF analysis, so I tried to shy away from it except to show that even using the most modest growth projections, the company is significantly undervalued. The bigger argument lies in both WWAV's industry classification from a relative value standpoint, and its domination of fast-growing markets where it holds a strong competitive advantage in both the United States and Europe. There are many short-term catalysts, listed above, that should help propel WWAV to its target price of $23.11 within the next 12 months.

Risks

Company continues to experience capacity issues and as a result, suffers from higher storage costs and lower margins.
There may be a lack of fund accumulation when DF shareholders begin selling their distribution, shorts do not cover, and price remains depressed.

My salary entering school will be $67,500.  I am feeling very overwhelmed by all of the information out there on financial aid. I could really use Personal Finance’s help! 

Here is some general info:
I will be living with my boyfriend and he is planning to cover our housing costs.  Based on our current budget, we are thinking that I can put away about $67,000 between now and when I graduate in 2016. My total tuition should be $101,441, which factors in a 3.6% escalation between year 1 and 2 and 2 and 3.

Here are a few questions that have come up so far:

 - My school has my FAFSA but has not made my official award yet. What can I expect to get awarded in Federal loans?  From what I have read, it seem like $20,500 is pretty standard per year for a graduate student and I believe they are unsubsidized loans? Is there a reason I would be awarded less than that?

 - My understanding is that interest starts as soon as the loan is disbursed?  Is there any kind of grace period with that?

 - Based on what I can save, it seems that I won’t have to take out loans beyond the Stafford loans and based on my calculations, I should start to have extra money on hand (beyond what i need for tuition after loans) after my 4th semester of 8 to start paying down my loans.  Does that sound like the right approach? Are there private loans with lower interest that have better terms or interest rates that the Stafford?

Abenomics is fighting an uphill battle - an aging and shrinking population combined with a culture of stingy spending has led to a 10 year lull in Japanese markets and gradual deflation. In case you are unfamiliar, Shinzō Abe elected fall 2012, the prime minister, has made inflation his **economic policy**. Broadly, this aims to spur growth for exports while simultaneously providing incentive to the Japanese people to spend sooner than later. The real trick is whether the japanese people will actually change their spending habits - Abe has vowed inflation by any means necessary, so they may have no choice. 



Its more complex than that, and nobody really knows what to expect, but the party is just getting started. Take a gander at some of these tasty stock charts which track the Japanese markets, the USD/Yen ratio, Japanese conglomerates or Japanese banking industry.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin: Mt. Gox, World's Largest Bitcoin Exchange, Seized By Federal Government",,cryptocurrency,1368666432
Bitcoin,Why the Feds' seizure of Mt. Gox funds is a Good Thing,"A lot of people are upset with the government for shutting down the Dwolla/Mt. Gox account. But let's stop and consider what their agenda really is, and what this means for Bitcoin.

1) The Feds shut down the Mt. Gox account because Mark Karpeles is incompetent (which, after Mt. Gox's history, shouldn't really shock anyone). He apparently answered ""No"" to the following questions while opening his account^1:

&gt; ""Do you deal in or exchange currency for your customer?""

&gt; ""Does your business accept funds from customers and send the funds based on customers' instructions (Money Transmitter)?""

Obviously these are outright lies. Mark didn't follow the rules, so at least we understand *why* the government is seizing money. From that perspective, this is probably NOT the beginning of a federal war on Bitcoin, just on Mt. Gox.

2) Mt. Gox is the biggest weakness in the Bitcoin ecosystem. People have been saying this for over a year, and it's still true. If Bitcoin has a single, central exchange, we're defeating the purpose of a decentralized currency. Hopefully the federal inquisition into Mt. Gox will spur the growth of competing exchanges, or even a long-overdue peer-to-peer exchange system.

3) Your money is safe. That's one of the advantages of Bitcoin. As long as you're securing your Bitcoins yourself, the Feds can't touch you.

4) Powerful people own Bitcoin. If the Feds step on some toes, it actually might lead to positive regulatory change. The Winklevoss twins almost certainly have lots of lobbyist friends.

All told, I can't see anything but a stronger Bitcoin on the other side of this. We weren't willing to move away from MtGox on our own, so maybe the Feds are going to give us a little push.

JPM seems to be fairly cheap on P/E as well as tangible book value, at least historically. And the business trends seem to be favorable. Rising confidence and a stock market will probably lead to higher investment banking revenue. Recovery in housing should lead to more mortgage origination. NIM should increase once rates start to rise and the yield curve gets better, and Jamie Dimon's letter said that JPM is positioned to do well in a rising rates environment at the expense of current earnings. 

Regulation is somewhat opaque to me so if anyone can give me some insight on how that will affect the business/earnings I'd appreciate it.

for $205,000 which I still owe about 202,000 on (gotta love paying that interest).  My neighbors put their house on the market last week for 289k and it went under contract in 4 days.

My girlfriend ran into some health issues her final year of university that caused her to not attend class as often as she should have for part of her final fall semester and spring semester. She did not sit for finals and recieved F's, but note that they do actually show up on her transcripts, or the limited access she has to them.

She currently has nine credit hours before earning her degree, but, her university won't let her due to a financial disagreement. They are claiming she withdrew from the university in Fall 2011 and returned her federal loan money, leaving her on the hook for the tuition.
As I understand it, withdrawing from the universtiy requires paperwork, which she did not fill out. She did not recieve any notifications about academic probation or anything like that until May 2012. This letter was regarding her supposed withdrawal in the Fall, even though she continued to attend a few classes and recieved grades for the following spring semester.

With her health issues resolved, she would like to finish her degree but is unable to pay the 15,000 she owes. I feel that the university sent her loan money back in error. When she tried last summer to resolve the issue, she was told that even if she didn't withdraw, it was too late and she needs to pay the 15k before being allowed back in anyway.

Firstly, I feel that this is the university's mistake. Is there anything we can do about it now, such as legal recourse?

Secondly, what options do we have available to pay this 15k...obviously save but the only payment plan they will allow is one that pays it over one year, which is too much per month to pay.

My wife and I sold the NYC apartment and are going to net around $400K after paying off the rest of the mortgage and whatever fees and credit card debt we had.

Originally, we sold in order to try and take advantage of the lower mortgage interest rates as well as upgrade to a bigger place in the city .  During the whole selling process, though, we decided to move to LA (we've been planning on doing it for within 10 years anyway) after I discussed this with my employer and confirmed that I will still work with the company, albeit remotely, doing sysadmin stuff.

I gross about $110k/year, but will definitely be less once I move--probably closer to $70k.  The wife has just finished school and is striving to be a television comedy writer but has no income as of this moment.
She has some connections in LA for writing for the entertainment industry but am uncertain how that's going to pan out--because you know, ""boulevard of broken dreams"" and stuff.

Aside from the sale money, I have about $90k in a SEP IRA with some large cap and SPY, and she has about $30k in savings and $15k in an IRA.

Since we're planning on renting over there, I'd like to know what I can do with approximately $350k that I want to set aside as I want the money to be generating some sort of income instead of sitting in low yielding savings and/or CDs.

personalfinance,25 year old making small changes and big goals needs your insight.,"Apologies for the Text wall...

Hey guys, I've just recently been getting more aware of my finances thanks to PF, /r/frugal, and my boss at work talking money with me (he's a bogle head). As I've just been getting into this over the past few months or so, this is going to be one of those, ""here's my life, whatcha think?"" deals.

So I'm 25, and I work for the federal govt and my gross salary is $65,000. In two months it'll be $67,000. We get overtime offered on and off, which I try to take advantage of when I can since it pays time and a half. For an example of how much it affects gross pay, my 2012 gross income was $64,526, and for the first half of the year, my salary was  $53,500 prior to a raise in July. I feel that I have pretty solid job security.

Take home is approx $3000/month when there's no overtime.

My employer matches 5% into the TSP, which is essentially the Feds version of a 401k. I am contributing 10% into the Roth TSP, and the 5% match goes into the pretax TSP. Current balance is $22,000. Allocation is 5% Govt securities, 5% fixed income index, 50% common stocks, 20% small cap, and 20% international stocks. Does the 10% Roth option make sense for me, tax wise? More than say - 5% in each? I just recently switched from 5 and 5 to 10 Roth.

In addition to the TSP, they offer s pension that pays 1.1% of average of highest 3 years of salary multiplied by years of service. It's 1% if younger than 62 when you take it/leave the org. For example, 70,000 avg salary, after working  40 years = 30,800 pension. At this point, I expect to stay with the org for life, barring a major unforeseen change (typing that just scared me). I have been there for just under 3 years now. I also expect to be promoted and rise well above that 70,000 point. Even without any promotions, step increases will take me over 70k in just 2 years from now.

I have about $8,500 in an Ally account split up into a savings/checking as my emergency ($7,100)/bills ($1,400) account. I also have a taxable vanguard account that I kind of haphazardly got into a few months back. I have $5,460 in VOO (a low e/r S&amp;P 500 ETF). I was just kind of messing around, but luckily, that's what got me on this track of reading up on finances.

My fixed-ish expenses (this is the bad part):

* Rent: 522.50 (will be about 555.00 starting next month)
* Car: 411 ($12,367 left on the loan @2.6%. Like an idiot, I bought a new car way out of my price range when I picked up the new job. The current dealer trade in value according to KBB is somewhere a little over 20k I believe)
* Utilities: 70
* Jiu Jitsu: 200
* Car insurance: 147.50
* Gas: 140
* Cable/Internet: 68.08 (I am getting rid of cable tv next month.)
* Cell: 98 (AT&amp;T, grandfathered into unlimited data. Have been reading into switching to Straight Talk or Ting.)
* Groceries: 220
* Gym: 20
* Amazon Prime: 8
* Laundry: 15 (free starting next month, minus electricity usage)
* Discretionary (unforseen expenses, going out, alcohol, random purchases, etc. this figure used to be higher): 300

Total: 2220.08

I have credit cards but always pay them off, and have never held a balance over and been charged interest. No other loans outside of that car. Credit karma has me at 775. 

Right now is definitely a transition period for me, as I am changing my discretionary spending habits to save where I can. For example, I have stopped going out for lunch at work 1-2 times per week and cut it down to maybe once every other week or less, spending about $12 when I do go out. Ive just started shopping specifically looking for deals and coupons at the grocery store. I am going out and drinking far less. Before, I would go out every weekend, maybe more than once, and eat food, hit the bars, and just let loose, money be damned. I still go out, but I am trying to slow it down, and I am not getting wrecked every weekend anymore. Cancelled netflix and stuck with amazon prime. Just started using Mint.

However, I have had a lot of expenses come up recently - a visit to my alma mater out of state and a vacation in Mexico next month (booked a while back) for my girlfriend's graduation from Med School. At the same time, I had to put down a bunch of money towards next month's move into a new apartment. I expect my grocery bill to fall, and my gas expense to increase after the move. I'll be splitting food for the apartment with the lady, but my new commute is about 30 minutes rather than the 20 minute one I have now.

So, in the recent months, I haven't been putting much away, and it's difficult to gauge future figures very accurately.

Here's the deal: I am thinking that I want to get into a house in maybe 5 years. By this time, my girlfriend will be done with residency. If she specializes, she will be done with that period as well, and will be just starting to make real doctor money. However, I'd like to be able to afford a place without taking any of her possible future earnings into account for obvious reasons. The locations I'll be by have nice spots for about $220,000-$300,000 right now, but those will probably go up soon. Also, I hear FHA loans are falling out of favor due to new PMI rules. So, I'll probably have to try and get a traditional loan. 

So guys, what do you think? Am I being an idiot over here? Im making baby steps, but I definitely need more steam. Should I ramp up my TSP contributions and just clamp down on my spending in order to save up for a down payment on a house, or should I allow myself some more take-home? Is it worth trying to downgrade my car? (car insurance and gas expenses would drop if I had a less sporty car). What should I do with that vanguard account? It's been doing pretty well so far, but I will likely need to liquidate the account before my house down payment in around 5 years.

Any other suggestions?

Grønn teknologi forbedre ytelsen og redusere kostnadene i føderale bygninger

WASHINGTON, DC-mai 16, 2013-(RealEstateRama)-I dag, den amerikanske General Services Administration (GSA) utgitt tre nye rapporter som del av sin grønne Proving Ground program, hvilke tester bygge teknologier i reelle situasjoner for å evaluere sitt potensial til å spare energi, vann, og redusere energikostnader. Gjennom Green Proving Ground, GSA er å finne nye måter føderale bygninger over hele landet kan lagre skattebetaler dollar, mens du også finner det beste bruken av disse teknologiene.

GSA har eiendomsmegling porteføljen måtte bredt teste og installere disse teknologiene og bidra til å deployere dem til det bredere markedet. GSA arbeidet med Department of Energy's National Laboratories og New Mexico State University for å teste energi effektiv teknologier som kan installeres i føderale bygninger over hele landet. Tre studier utgitt i dag inkluderer kondenserende kjeler, variabel kuldemedium flyt og photovoltaic system gjennomførelse.

Kondenserende kjeler er svært effektiv vann varmeovner som resirkulere avfall varme å forvarme kalde vannet inn kjelen. Oppvarming kontoer for 35 prosent av energi bruk i kommersielle bygninger i USA, og kjeler er den vanligste kilden til oppvarming. GSA testet kondenserende kjeler i Peachtree toppmøtet Federal Building i Atlanta, Georgia, og fant en 14 prosent reduksjon i bygningens naturgass forbruket. 

Anvendelsen av denne teknologien over GSA bygninger kunne hjelpe oss med å lagre omtrent 1 prosent av våre totale årlig energiforbruk. På grunn av lave drifts- og vedlikeholdskostnadene kostnader og en relativt kort payback periode, kan denne teknologien lett distribueres som eldre kjeler er erstattet.

Variabel kuldemedium Flow er en HVAC-teknologi som samtidig kan varme og kjøle ulike mellomrom i et anlegg og la for greater temperaturkontroll mens bevaring av energi. Forskerteamet GSA vurdert denne teknologien på Moakley Federal Courthouse i Boston, Massachusetts. I tillegg GSA så på publisert forskning og engasjert bransjeeksperter som en del av denne studien. Denne teknologien har potensial til å oppnå 34 prosent energisparing i forhold til eldre systemer. GSA vil være å ta en nærmere titt på variabel kuldemedium flyt og dets potensial for videre installasjoner i føderale bygninger.

Solenergianlegg bruke photovoltaic celler til å konvertere direkte sollys til elektrisitet. Dette ble testet på en kommersiell skala og fire mindre laboratorium systemer på bønne Federal Center i Indianapolis, Indiana. Alle solcellepaneler arbeidet like bra i skyet, Midwestern klima som de gjør i andre deler av landet. Kommersiell skala photovoltaic system generert nesten 8 prosent av den totale anlegget energi behov. Studien fant også at avkastningen var innenfor levetiden av teknologien.

GSA studerer for tiden 22 teknologier som en del av programmet. Resultatene fra disse evalueringene vil fortsette å øke ytelsen til GSA bygninger ved å redusere driftskostnadene og bistå industrien i distribusjon av nye teknologier og praksiser i det bredere markedet. Som et resultat av tidligere Green Proving Ground studier arbeider GSA nå for å installere kostnadsbesparende avanserte grenuttak og trådløse sensorer for datasentre fasilitetene.

I usually keep about $1000 in my savings account + whatever money that's sitting in my account for bills due in a couple weeks. So tonight I was thinking, why not ""pay off"" my credit card with this money? I'd see a 8.5% savings on interest, instead of the measly couple cents that I get from my savings account.

In terms of liquidity, I can either pull cash right out of an ATM with my credit card, or transfer it directly to my checking online. So I don't really see a downside to this. Can anyone think of something that might burst my bubble?",finance,1368775644

Bitcoin,"4 reasons why the ""Bitcoin Foundation"" destroys the core principle of Bitcoin","Bitcoin does need some kind of advocate, but the ""Bitcoin Foundation"" is NOT it.
If the ""Bitcoin Foundation"" develops clout with the community, it will destroy the core principle of Bitcoin that has made it desirable: That it is controlled by the people and developed by the community.  That it is NOT controlled by a small elite seeking to manipulate it for power and money for themselves.  In other words, the ""Bitcoin Foundation"" will give Bitcoin all the problems of current money, and give control over Bitcoin to the same people that control the current money system.

Bitcoin development and advocacy does require money, but it should come from internal community donations or a ""tax"" coded in to the codebase, similar to what miners get.  When money comes from the outside and from a small handful of big donors, then there are obligations to repay them with favorable considerations of their interests.

Here are 4 reasons why the ""Bitcoin Foundation"" will destroy bitcoin as we know it and why the community should eschew it.


**#1 The ""Bitcoin Foundation"" was self created by an entrepreneur trying to make money off of bitcoin, NOT by Bitcoin programmers or some benevolent neutral party.**

*Bitcoin was created by people that wanted to make a difference and solve a problem, not get rich.

...which brings us to...

**#2 That creator has a conflict of interest**

*He is the CEO of Coinlab, an exchange like Mt. Gox.
*This is the same as having the CEO of Wall Street / The New York Stock Exchange write monetary policy for the Government.
*Coinlab recently sued Mt.Gox for $75,000,000.  Imagine the position Mt. Gox would be in if Coinlab controlled the Bitcoin codebase.  That's what would happen if the ""Bitcoin Foundation"" achieves its goals.

**#3
Power over the ""Bitcoin Foundation"" is bought.**

*You have to pay, as much as $100,000, to be able to vote for seats on the Board of Directors.

Of the 5 seats on the board of directors:
*1 the founder has given to himself and there is no mention of if or how anyone else could be voted into that seat
*The remaining 4 you have to pay to be able to vote for:
*1 seat only voted on by those paying $100,000 (at current Bitcoin prices)
*1 seat only voted on by those paying between $25,000 and $1,000
*2 seat only voted on by those paying $250
*Bitcoin policy should be decided on by the community, as it is now, with no cost to join.

source: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/about/governance



**#4 They will be paying Gavin Andresen's and other core developers' salary**

*Gavin is the lead programmer of Bitcoin. 
*When you control someone's income you control them.
*In other words the ""Bitcoin Foundation"" and those that bought seats on its Board control the codebase and the rules of Bitcoin.

source: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/about/letter  (near bottom, ""Goals of 2013)


If the ""Bitcoin Foundation"" acquires legitimacy from the community and power over the Bitcoin developers, the Bitcoin codebase will be controlled by the same players that control the dollar, and Bitcoin will lose the core of what made it attractive.

news,"Round the Clock Surveillance: Is This the Price of Living in a ‘Free, Safe’ Society?","by John W. Whitehead, Faith Issues

“If you’re not a terrorist, if you’re not a threat, prove it. This is the price you pay to live in free society right now. It’s just the way it is.” — Sergeant Ed Mullins of the New York Police Department  

Immediately following the devastating 9/11 attacks, which destroyed the illusion of invulnerability which had defined American society since the end of the Cold War, many Americans willingly ceded their rights and liberties to government officials who promised them that the feeling of absolute safety could be restored.

In the 12 years since, we have been subjected to a series of deceptions, subterfuges and scare tactics by the government, all largely aimed at amassing more power for the federal agencies and extending their control over the populace. Starting with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, continuing with the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, and coming to a head with the assassination of American citizens abroad, the importing of drones and other weapons of compliance, and the rise in domestic surveillance, we have witnessed the onslaught of a full-blown crisis in government.

Still Americans have gone along with these assaults on their freedoms unquestioningly.

Even with our freedoms in shambles, our country in debt, our so-called “justice” system weighted in favor of corporations and the police state, our government officials dancing to the tune of corporate oligarchs, and a growing intolerance on the part of the government for anyone who challenges the status quo, Americans have yet to say “enough is enough.”

Now, in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing, we are once again being assured that if we only give up a few more liberties and what little remains of our privacy, we will achieve that elusive sense of security we’ve yet to attain. This is the same song and dance that comes after every tragedy, and it’s that same song and dance which has left us buying into the illusion that we are a free, safe society.

The reality of life in America tells a different tale, however. For example, in a May 2013 interview with CNN, former FBI counterterrorism agent Tim Clemente disclosed that the federal government is keeping track of all digital communications that occur within the United States, whether or not those communicating are American citizens, and whether or not they have a warrant to do so.

As revelatory as the disclosure was, it caused barely a ripple of dismay among Americans, easily distracted by the torrent of what passes for entertainment news today. Yet it confirms what has become increasingly apparent in the years after 9/11: the federal government is literally tracking any and all communications occurring within the United States, without concern for the legal limitations of such activity, and without informing the American people that they are doing so.

Clemente dropped his bombshell during a CNN interview about authorities’ attempts to determine the nature of communications between deceased Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his widow Katherine Russell. In the course of that conversation, Clemente revealed that federal officials will not only be able to access any voicemails that may have been left by either party, but that the entirety of the phone conversations they had will be at federal agents’ finger tips.

“We certainly have ways in national security investigations to find out exactly what was said in that conversation,” stated Clemente. “All of that stuff [meaning phone conversations occurring in America] is being captured as we speak whether we know it or like it or not.” A few days later, Clemente was asked to clarify his comments, at which point he said, “There is a way to look at all digital communications in the past. No digital communication is secure.”

In other words, there is no form of digital communication that the government cannot and does not monitor — phone calls, emails, text messages, tweets, Facebook posts, internet video chats, etc., are all accessible, trackable and downloadable by federal agents.

At one time, such actions by the government would not only have been viewed as unacceptable, they would also have been considered illegal. However, government officials have been engaged in an ongoing attempt to legitimize these actions by passing laws that make the lives of all Americans an open book for government agents. For example, while the nation was caught up in the drama of the Boston bombing and the ensuing military-style occupation of the city by local and federal police, Congress passed a little-noticed piece of legislation known as the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). The legislation, which the House of Representatives approved by an overwhelming margin of 288 — 127, will allow internet companies to share their users’ private data with the federal government and other private companies in order to combat so-called “cyber threats.”

In short, the law dismantles any notion of privacy on the internet, opening every action one undertakes online, whether emailing, shopping, banking, or just browsing, to scrutiny by government agents. While CISPA has yet to clear the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the spirit of it is alive and well. In fact, officials in the Obama administration have for some time now been authorizing corporate information sharing and spying in secret through the use of executive orders and other tactics.

The Justice Department, for instance, has been issuing so-called “2511 letters” to various internet service providers like AT&amp;T, which immunize them from being prosecuted under federal wiretapping laws for providing the federal government with private information. Despite federal court rulings to the contrary, the Department of Justice continues to assert that it does not require a warrant to access Americans’ emails, Facebook chats, and other forms of digital communication.

While it may be tempting to lay the full blame for these erosions of our privacy on the Obama administration, they are simply continuing a system of mass surveillance, the seeds of which were planted in the weeks after 9/11, when the National Security Agency (NSA) began illegally tracking the communications of American citizens. According to a ""Washington Post"" article published in 2010, the NSA continues to collect 1.7 billion communications, whether telephone, email or otherwise, every single day.

The NSA and Department of Justice are just two pieces of a vast surveillance network which encompasses and implicates most of the federal government, as well as the majority of technology and telecommunications companies in the United States. For the past two years, the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has approved literally every single request by the federal government to spy on people within the United States. There have been some 4,000 applications rubberstamped by the court in the past two years, applications which allow federal officials to monitor the communications of any person in the United States, including American citizens, if they are believed to be in contact with someone overseas.

These government-initiated spying programs depend in large part on the willingness of corporations to hand over personal information about their customers to government officials. Sometimes the government purchases the information outright. At other times, the government issues National Security Letters, which allow the government to force companies to hand over personal information without a warrant or probable cause.

Some web companies, such as Skype, have already altered their products to allow government access to personal information. In fact, government agents can now determine the credit card information and addresses of Skype users under suspicion of criminal activity. Aside from allowing government agents backdoor access to American communications, corporations are also working on technologies to allow government agents even easier access to Americans’ communications.

For example, Google has filed a patent for a “Policy Violation Checker,” software which would monitor an individual’s communications as they type them out, whether in an email, an Excel spreadsheet or some other digital document, then alert the individual, and potentially their employer or a government agent, if they type any “problematic phrases” which “present policy violations, have legal implications, or are otherwise troublesome to a company, business, or individual.” The software would work by comparing the text being typed to a pre-defined database of “problematic phrases,” which would presumably be defined on a company-by-company basis.

The emergence of this technology fits in well with Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s view on privacy, which is that “If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.” Unfortunately, this is not just the attitude of corporate benefactors who stand to profit from creating spy technology and software but government officials as well.

Additionally, police officials throughout the country have become increasingly keen on monitoring social media websites in real time. Rob D’Ovido, a criminal justice professor at Drexel University, has noted that, “The danger of this in light of the tragedy in Boston is that law enforcement is being so risk-averse they are in danger of crossing that line and going after what courts would ultimately deem as free speech.”

For example, Cameron Dambrosio, a teenager and self-styled rap artist living in Metheun, Massachusetts, posted a video of one of his original songs on the internet which included references to the White House and the Boston bombing. While the song’s lyrics may well have been crude and ill-advised in the wake of the Boston bombing, police officers exacerbated the situation by arresting Dambrosio and charging him with communicating terrorist threats, a felony charge which could land him in prison for twenty years.

Unfortunately, cases like Dambrosio’s may soon become the norm, as the FBI’s Next Generation Cyber Initiative has announced that its “top legislative priority” this year is to get social media giants like Facebook and Google to comply with requests for access to real-time updates of social media websites. The proposed method of encouraging compliance is legal inquiries and hefty fines leveled at these companies. The Obama administration is expected to support the proposal.

The reality is this:  we no longer live in a free society. Having traded our freedoms for a phantom promise of security, we now find ourselves imprisoned in a virtual cage of cameras, wiretaps and watchful government eyes. All the while, the world around us is no safer than when we started on this journey more than a decade ago. Indeed, it well may be that we are living in a far more dangerous world, not so much because the terrorist threat is any greater but because the government itself has become the greater threat to our freedoms.

It's Earth Day, an annual event that encourages us to remember the environment and our place in it. Good news: By cutting back on your energy and water use, you don't just help conserve resources, you put money back in your pocket — where it belongs. Save Energy Mary Morris was wary when she had to pay for an energy audit of her single-family home in the North Park Hill to qualify for an Xcel rebate. Twelve months later, she's a convert. Since contractor Casey Staley from REenergizeCO completed an energy audit on her home, which was built in 1948, and performed subsequent improvements last spring, Morris has saved $438 on her energy bill. That's in addition to Staley finding $1,100 in rebates for a $3,800 project. ""For $2,700, we got the audit, our duct work in the attic sealed with flexible mastic, and I could sense an improvement in the air quality within 24 hours,"" she says. With that money Morris also insulated the attic as well as a 1,700-square-foot main floor that included a large sun room, and weatherized a nearly 1,500-square-foot ""bomb bunker"" basement, where Staley added a threshold to her energy-sucking boiler room. The money also went toward purchasing an energy-efficient dishwasher. Staley, who's a vetted contractor through Xcel and Denver Energy Challenge, works to make sure his clients receive all rebates possible. He says residents are often unaware of how much money they can save on up-front costs. He added that residents who performed home improvements saw additional savings in their tax returns this year through a federal credit. ""That tax credit is 10 percent,"" he said. ""If the work is $4,000, you're getting $400 back from the (feds)."" Morris, who received around $300 back from the tax credit this year, looks forward to a summer where her air conditioner will keep her home at a comfortable 71 degrees. ""My husband says the sign of a civilized life is when you're warm in the winter and cool in the summer,"" she says. ""And I agree."" Energy-efficiency resources

personalfinance,What type of credit card for my situation/ personal advice,"Hey everybody, I am looking to get my first credit card to build my credit up so it is there when I need it. I plan to just put monthly bills and payments on it, and pay the bill in full every month. Also, any other advice would be much appreciated. I really enjoy reading this subreddit. 

Here is some info for context:

My credit score is 681, I'm surprised I even have one. Any credit I have is likely from paying off utilities or rent? Not sure how it really works. 

I graduated with a B.S. in December, and I had a job for Feb in a lab I worked at for undergrad while looking for a permanent one. They ran out of work for me so I depleted most of my savings which weren't much. It was just leftover money from loans for my last semester. 

Anyway I have a job now and I make $20.47/hour as a contract worker. The contract goes through November, but I am hopeful to get a full time job at this company once the contract is up or before that. I may have some 60 hour weeks in the summer which will get me time and a half which will be very nice. 

I just got my first full time pay check, and my first student loan payment is June 15. My expenses are basically: $300 rent, $40 utilities, no car payment, maybe $50 for car insurance, and then food is basically how much I choose to spend. I have cable and netflix as well, which might add up to $20 total. 

I have about 46k in student loans and I plan to consolidate the loans with similar interest rates in order to pay off the higher interest private loans first, and the move to my older government loans. 

Anyway, is there anything wrong with this plan, and what credit cards are best? Thanks in advance and if there is a thread that has explained any of this already I would love to see it!",finance,1368995501

We have been looking at homes for a couple years and while it wasn't an issue finding a lender while I was a  w2 employee, now that I'm self employed everyone is telling us sorry we need 2 years of tax records to show income.  We are seeing home prices go up and interest rates won't stay this low forever.  So we really want to get into the market now while we can maximize what we can get with our money.

The best central heating controls
Buying an efficient new boiler is only the first step in saving money on your heating costs.
Outdated heating controls waste your money
Upgrading from an old-fashioned thermostat to a programmable room thermostat gives you more options for controlling your heating
Out-of-date central heating system components and controls can lead to wasting energy and potential problems in several areas.
Hot water cylinder supplied by gravity-fed water - stored water is slow to reheat.
No cylinder thermostat - excessive stored water temperature and risk of scalding.
No cylinder insulation - heat is wasted through the surface of the cylinder.
No room thermostat - rooms are too hot.
Lack of thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) - excessive room temperatures and poor heating system balancing.
Absence of boiler interlock - the boiler stays hot and cycles unnecessarily during programmed heating periods.
As a householder, you might not notice these issues, but they'll be wasting your money in the long run.
Also, take a look at our page on boiler energy efficiency to find out more about how much an inefficient one could be costing you, and to work out if you need a new one.
Get the best heating controls
The type of heating controls you need will depend on the type of heating system you have and whether your hot water comes direct from your boiler or via a hot water cylinder.
You should discuss which controls you need for your home with your heating engineer when you have a new boiler or heating component installed. 
Talk to your boiler installer about the type of controls you need and how to set them
There are four main types of heating control:
timer – turns your boiler on or off at set times
room thermostat – measures how warm your room is and adjusts the boiler operation accordingly
programmer – lets you set different times and temperatures for different days of the week
thermostatic radiator valves (TVRs) – allow you to adjust the temperature of individual radiators and turn them off completely
To find out more about how each type controls your heating see our guide to boiler and heating controls.
Controls to use with heat-only boilers
Your system should include:
programmable room thermostat 
separate timing capability for hot water
hot water cylinder thermostat
thermostatic radiator valves on all rooms except the one with the room thermostat
motorised valves - to control the flow of water from the boiler to heating and hot water circuits
automatic bypass valve - used to maintain a minimum water flow rate through the boiler when TVRs are operating
boiler interlock - a wiring arrangement to prevent the boiler firing when there is no demand for heat
Find out more about heat-only boilers.

Controls to use with combi boilers 
Your system should include:

programmable room thermostat 
thermostatic radiator valves on all rooms except the one with the room thermostat
automatic bypass valve - used to maintain a minimum water flow rate through the boiler when TVRs are operating
boiler interlock - a wiring arrangement to prevent the boiler firing when there is no demand for heat
Using heating controls effectively
Effective heating controls let you take charge of when, where and at which temperature your heating is operating. 
Simple changes that will make efficient use of your heating controls can make a big difference:
Turning down your thermostat by just 1°C can save you £55, according to the Energy Saving Trust.
Zone your heating to the rooms you use the most.
Programme your heating to only work when the house is occupied.
Set your thermostatic radiator valves (TVRs) to a low temperature.",finance,1368950433

personalfinance,Are my priorities correct? Am I putting away too much?,"Hello, Reddit. My life is going to change in a couple of months and I need some input on my current financial situation.

I’m a 25M with steady job that pays $50k. Come August, I will be quitting my job to get my grad degree full time from Imperial College London (one year intensive in Strategic Marketing), and I’m looking to pay off and save as much as I can (currently banking on Federal loans so I can consolidate with my outstanding undergrad loans). However, I can’t tell if what I’m doing currently is the right thing/fiscally wise. My current monthly liabilities are as follows:

Fed Loan: $187
Rent + Utilities/Groceries: ~$900
Sallie Mae: $77
Private Loan: $50
Barclays Visa: ~$300* (total outstanding: $2700.)
Kickboxing/Unlimited Gym Membership: $150
Citi Visa: ~$300* (Total outstanding: $5000)

*Floating targets, but payments are usually around this amount.

I am currently stashing away ~$700/month in a very low-interest bearing/non-existent interest bearing account. I had saved roughly $1000 before putting it all into common stock equity (yes, I know, risky), which has made a couple of hundred dollars recently. I own shares in Sirius, Overstock, Disney, and currently I’m looking into buying stock in Salesforce.com and Coke.  I give myself $320-$400 monthly for discretionary spending. 

I have applied for both Federal and Private loans to cover the cost of college (one year program) and board, roughly $78k. Of this $78k, $8k makes up my current credit card debt. However, I’m looking into paying off my Barclays card (higher interest), and have recently cut down my savings allocation in half to help pay it off. I don’t know if this is wise, since I am already applying for a larger loan to pay off my credit card debit so I’m not in the hook while I am in school. Moreover, my gym membership is necessary for health reasons that I won’t disclose, but suffice it to say, it’s paying off on a qualitative/personal level. 

I’m applying to scholarships and all so I could possibly ease the student loan burden (curse the lack of post-grad sponsorship). 
After grad school, obviously the plan is to get a (much) higher paying job. Possible investments post-graduation include an engagement ring, more equity, and a car (only if needed…I live in NYC, so only if I move someplace for work that requires private transportation). However, I don’t know if I’m setting myself up prior to school well enough to survive. 

I realize having all my savings in common stock is incredibly risky, but I’m looking at these investments as short-term. I looking to allocate my monthly savings into short-term equity as well (would love your opinions on that as well). Should I be paying off my Barclays high interest card first in advance of adding more equity to my portfolio, or should I focus on building up a cash reserve first?

Seven top cyber safety measures for business
One in five Australian businesses suffered an electronic breach or cyber attack in 2012. Most report an average of two attacks a year. Companies put their own ability to effectively secure their organisation at 4.5 out of 10. Australia is now 21st in the most attacked nations list, up from 24th.
Statistics on the lack of business cyber security and increase in cyber attacks abound. It's no wonder experts continue to warn that poor security practices can compromise company finances and put commercial and customer information in the wrong hands.
According to Australia's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey Report in February, 20 per cent of Australian businesses were the subject of hacking or other cyber-attacks last year.
The most serious involved the use of malicious software including ransomware and scareware, which extort payments for the return of data; trojan or rootkit malware, which lodge in the company's systems to steal information; theft or breach of confidential information; and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

In Operation Lino, Australia's biggest investigation into compromised credit cards, it was found that a Romanian criminal syndicate gained access to 500,000 Australian credit cards, and about 30,000 credit cards were used for fraudulent transactions amounting to more than $30 million.
""Businesses were compromised, where full control of their computers gave full access to point-of-sale terminals, which gave access to details of all credit cards,"" says Brad Marden, Australian Federal Police acting manager for cyber crime operations.
According to the Symantec Internet Security Threat Report released Tuesday, AUstralia experienced an increase inthe level of cybercrime in 2012 and is now ranked 21st in the most targeted nations by cyber criminals. 
Peter Sparkes, Symantec's director for managed security services, said Australia's enthusiasm for technology was partly the reason.
""As a nation of early adopters with a strong economy which uses technology to remain competitive, Australia is turning out to be an attractive target for cybercriminals,"" Sparkes said in a statement.
A study of 485 Australian technology and security professionals by the Ponemon Institute for Juniper Networks released this week as part of a global survey, found respondents rated their own organisation's security effectiveness as 4.5 out of 10. They rated their organisation's ability to quickly detect and prevent cyber attacks also as poor at 4.4 and 4.6, respectively.
The report said the issues that keep most IT and IT security practitioners up at night are ""the theft of their organisation's intellectual property, including research and development, business strategies and industrial processes""; and the theft of ""confidential information used to obtain authentication credentials to infiltrate networks and enterprise systems"".
But Marden says 85 per cent of cyber intrusions can be prevented, and recommends adopting some of the Australian government's Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) strategies. Security vendors also offer similar advice.
Here are some of the basic tips:

Open Source Business - Practical Application

A retrospective summary on postal service.



DEFINITION

OPEN SOURCE BUSINESS - A business who's design is free to people and to which anyone may contribute.



PROBLEM

ON SHIPPING SERVICES

The shipping industry is inconvenient. One must be in a certain location around a certain time with an address in order to receive packages. There is no need for this complication. 




SOLUTION

AN AUTOMATIC VENDING MAIL MACHINE.



DESIGN


BUILDING

The building will be as a recieving and sending location with a postal address. It must be of sufficient size to support the mail it recieves. It should be professional and secure. 



MACHINE


FRONT-END

The front-end will provide a computerized menu screen and a package recieval area. In order to recieve the package, one must enter a fee and a unique address number that is communicated by either the seller or the shipping location. This 

screen is private, as is any ATM machine. This will prevent theft of packages if more than one package was sent to the same address, in a staggered time.


BACK-END

Enclosed inside a secure chamber, a collection of conveyor belts, pistons, and shelves will handle boxes and larger packages. This will consist of an arrangement, possibility similar to the following, unless an improved arrangement is 

found. There will be a number of shelves lined up in parallel. Three conveyor belts sit near the front, two are perpendicular and one is parralel, to delivery the package to the terminal. In between each two shelves is another conveyor 

belt than can move vertically, supported by mechanial structures extended from the floor. Also, both in between and to the far sides of the shelves is a piston system. In between the shelves, they will hang from the cieling. On the 

sides, they will extend from the wall. This will alow the manipulation of packages in order to facilitate the movement of the package to the delivery terminal. 

In addition, also enclosed inside a secure chamber, in another location that is convenient to the corresponding delivery terminal, is an automatic sorting machine for approved-sized packages. This, after having categorierized all of the 

packages/envelops that follow the regulation size, can deliver a chosen package to the corresponding terminal, using a simple add and remove type methology to locate the package.

The drop-off locations measure size, and either scan for the information on a sticker, or provide a sticker, with the option to print and/or e-mail the code to the designated e-mail address. Simple measures are taken to improve 

reliability, such as returning packages than can not be read, do not follow size regulation, or are positioned incorrectly. 

The need to access secure areas is limited to maintenance. The warehouse (listed in STORAGE AND REGULATION) will require a responsible and dependable manager. 


SHIPPING COMPUTATION

UPost will function using a tracking number system, similar to UPS, DHL, USPS, or Fedex.


STORAGE AND REGULATION

The items will be stored in the store for a limited period of time. Afterwards, they will be shipped to a warehouse where they will be stored for a limited amount of time until the receiver has contacted them, letting them know to send 

it to a pickup location. If enough time has passed (this quantitity is dependent on the amount of storage capacity), the object is returned to the sender, using a return address that is required to send. 


EMPLOYEES

The business is designed to be as automated as possible. This reduces costs, allowing a lower financial risk. In the first implementation, the warehouses are the only places that need to be stocked as machinery for an entire warehouse 

will be expensive. In the final implementation, the entire business is automated, saving for avoidable repairs, custodial work, and maintenence. The warehouse will function simply as a warehouse, with recieving, sending, and storage done 

by employees.


MARKETING

It will be necessary to undertake appropriate marketing in order for this businesses services to be known. This business is ideal for people who are traveling frequently and would like a convenient way to send and recieve items. This 

specifically applies to travelers who want a definite address to pickup mail when they move or while they are traveling.


CONSIDERATIONS

Security is essential in every person's life. This business must be regulated to provide a comfortable and secure environment. This means placing it near other 24-hour stores, in high-value locations, and providing security with cameras. 

Hiring an armed attendent should not be necessary as there should be no danger in the first place. It is a consideration, however, but it should not be necessary. If it is necessary, it is endangering both people (due to the reason for 

the necessity) and the armed attendent as well.

Tracking numbers (provided by UPost, UPS, DHL, USPS, or any other shipping service) are necessary to properly allocate space and calculate waiting times on packages, in the event that there are more packages then there is space to store 

them inside the pick-up and send location.


NEEDED STEPS

-In depth market analysis, measuring target market (travelers) and predicted interest-Develop machinery
-Develop software 


-Create business model (Business model must be adjustable to specific implementations and can calculate realist projected cost with estimated error)



SECONDARY NEEDED STEPS

-Find locations
-Find volunteers
-Develop machinery


POSSIBLE HELPING STEPS

-Start a fund to pay for market analysts and engineering if none are available for volunteer



ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL MAIL SYSTEM

LOWER COSTS

-Drastically reducing storage space needed allows more customers at a lower price
-An automated system reduces need for labor. Hiring three full-time employees costs over $5000/month, draining revenue

CONVENIENCE

-Allowing flexible shipping to anywhere in the world give travelers the flexibility they need, reducing the need for repeated registration and planning, thus reducing work and increasing comfort, no longer is needing to plan every detail 

of the trip necessary, many people don't book hotels far in advance, having a shipping method that does not depend on the hotel or room number is convenient.

TRUST

-Flying to third world countries increases risk of stolen packages. A more centralized delivery system (as opposed to hotels) decreases probability of theft.


SUMMARY

This system is simple in concept and the design uses existing technology. It is a much more efficient way than private mailboxes as there is more space available (there is no need for long-standing empty space, lowering costs), the need 

to rent mailboxes during a time of non-use is eliminated. Because of automation, costs are further lowered as the need to hire people is reduced. Total running costs amount to warehouse workers wage, electricity, custodial work, repairs, 

and maintenance. 




REASON FOR POSTING

personalfinance,Expat wanting to convert IRA to Roth,"I'm an expat and will have all of my income excluded under the FEIE this year. It is my understanding now is a good time to convert my traditional IRA to a Roth. The IRA is 100% deductible contributions. The converted amount will be my only 'income' for 2013. I have funds in savings to cover the taxes, if there will be any due. I used the bankrate.com 1040 calculator to see what taxes would be due. With only the $28k from IRA-&gt;Roth Conversion as income, MFJ, standard deduction, child tax credit and three exemptions my taxable income drops to $4700 and it shows no tax due. I will have ~$1100 in federal tax paid which will get refunded. I won't need to touch this money at all, so the five year rule has no affect.

Bitcoin,"Some facts about Bitcoin, and the world you should ponder","-Bitcoin’s market capitalization (the total worth of coins in USD) is about 1.34 billion—that’s about the size of Belize economy.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize

-ALL forms of currency and assets can be seized from you if the U.S. if the government wants to. In 1933 Executive Order 6102 by FDR made holding gold illegal, and the U.S. government seized people's gold under the threat of prison time if they did not. Bitcoin, unlike gold, cannot be seized. 

-The median age of currencies in circulation today is about 39 years, and about 20% of the 755 currencies that have come into existence in the last 300 years died from hyperinflation.  (lots of good info here): http://dollardaze.org/blog/?post_id=00405

-The federal government adds about $40 billion dollars to the economy each month. That’s brand new money that makes your money worth just a little bit less. http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/26/the-fed-keeps-on-printing-money/

-Corporate profits and the stock market are at an all-time high, and wage earning are at an all-time low. http://www.businessinsider.com/profits-at-high-wages-at-low-2013-4.

-Banks operating in the U.S. get to commit fraud and not be punished. http://www.alternet.org/newsandviews/article/590186/federal_audits_find_4_biggest_banks_guilty_of_fraud. 

-E-commerce sales topped 1 trillion this year. http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Ecommerce-Sales-Topped-1-Trillion-First-Time-2012/1009649

-The average cost of an e-commerce transaction is about 2%--https://feefighters.com/blog/2009/10/02/average-e-commerce-merchant-account-rate/

-Bitcoin make the same transaction fees about 0.1%--a 2,000% savings over using traditional e-commerce methods.

-Sending a wire internationally can take weeks, can get lost, will be subject to substantial fees, and you will face at least a 1% conversation fee. Also, if the amount is in excess of $50,000 you will have to jump through quite a bit of paperwork. With Bitcoin it takes about 10 minutes. You can also transfer as much money as you would like and there are no hoop to jump through. 

-The shadow economy is one of the largest economies in the world ($10 Trillion) and none of it is done through banking. It’s all cash and unofficial—to bitcoin and other digital currencies, this is a new market that can be empowered IF bitcoin can get to them. http://www.forbes.com/sites/benzingainsights/2011/11/07/rise-of-the-shadow-economy-second-largest-economy-in-the-world/

-M-PSEA in Kenya has empowered millions to do mobile banking. http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21574520-safaricom-widens-its-banking-services-payments-savings-and-loans-it
 
The reason that I bring up all of these facts is that I think they all must be taken into consideration when we talk about the potential future of bitcoin. It’s not as much about how great bitcoin is, as much as it about how terrible this monetary system is.  And even worse than the poor design of this monetary system is the clear corruption that has been enabled by this system. 

Furthermore, I see the real potential for bitcoin in the global south. Why would someone in Zimbabwe use their currency when they can use bitcoin (inflation is about 25,000% per month there)? Or Argentina where inflation is about 10.5% per year? Or how about Burma where the government has unilaterally declared their currency worthless twice?

What I see with bitcoin is freedom. Freedom from governments that have again, and again, and again destroyed the wealth of private citizens with their own petty political squabbles.  Freedom from the prying eyes of banks and governments that believe they need to know what you are spending money on. But for me, most importantly, it gives me freedom from funding the American Empire--I don't have to use their blood-tainted money anymore. 

When a long train of abuses and usurpations reduce the people to absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security—and I think that security is Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency,1369174825

investing,Some quick ramblings on the economy,"https://www.facebook.com/RedfieldBlonsky/posts/529835063719173

I think the economy is in a stable growth mode. At some point, I expect the Fed will start raising short term rates from near zero. I also expect that the economy will still move along in a typical historical manner for an extended period. During that period, I would expect occasional recessionary periods. 

 I also expect moderate inflation at some point. Moderate inflation should have positive impacts on businesses and workers. Inflation is difficult for retirees. We have not had real inflation in over 30 years. Former retirees were a beneficiary of such. 

I think the USA should strive to lengthen their debts to as far as possible to take advantage of low rates. I also think the government should earmark required future projects (not frivolous projects, but required infrastructure projects) and include full scale modernization of USA infrastructure. 

 Manufacturing in the USA is currently 12% of GDP. I think manufacturing is starting to come back to the states. USA labor rates have been stagnant for a decade or so, traditional outsourcing nations had and have wage inflation, making USA more attractive. One should also include costs of manufacturing outsourcing, modern factories in the USA, which are not as employee centric.

 When we design portfolios, the above has been a common thought process in our implementation and research of specific investments.

Basically I have this friend who has been involved in what I think is a scam for some time now. He and four business partners have been waiting for years to receive a large sum of money with which to make a film. It's been this waiting game forever and absolutely no one in their respective social circles believe it's ever going to happen and have utterly given up on them. They believe it still because apparently their investor has fed them line after line about how it's all because the banks are slow to process it, and that he (the investor) keeps adding funds which are supposed to go to other business ventures, and that slows it down further. Also, supposedly the banks can only do these ""transactions"" on Tues/Wed/Thurs, which is another reason it's slow.  This investor is supposedly an expat in China, and that is where the funds are coming from and why it's taking so long to transfer from China.    It's all apparently going through Bank of America and some of the partners have talked to a high ranking ""lawyer"" in BOA assuring them it's all legit.  Crazy right? Not my friend though, he allows one of his partners to be the main point of contact for the investor.  Also, the partners seem to have ""invested"" some of their own cash (maybe $100K to $200K). Why would they need to send their own money to anyone?  They truly believe they're receiving appx 23 mil and anyone who says they're not gets asked: ""What do you know about the movement of large investments?""

personalfinance,Consolidated my student loans......Government outsourced to SallieMae. Questions?,"I consolidated my federal subsidized and unsubsidized student loans. I already had some Sallie Mae student loans and I logged in to see if my consolidation payments had been made yet and noticed that my consolidation is going to be handled by Sallie Mae. Payments were made to my lenders yesterday (according the the consolidation website), so I'm expecting my payment packet in the mail within the next 60 days to actually begin repayment. They consolidated my subsidized loans and unsubsidized loans separately, which was surprising since I thought they would be all bundled together considering they are all federal loans. Whatever, no big deal. But I do have a couple of questions that deal with consolidation or Sallie Mae.

1) In the consolidation application, I requested automatic debit so that I could knock off .25% from my interest rate. Sallie Mae has my interest rate as the rate before the discount. This morning, I tried going through and applying for the automatic debit, but it says my loans aren't eligible. Do I need to wait and try again later since my consolidation was just finalized yesterday? Or will it be done automatically after I receive my payment packet in the mail? I only ask because my consolidated loans are accruing interest daily based on the pre-discounted interest rate.

2) Since the sub and unsub loans are consolidated separately, does anyone know how my IBR payment amount will be split among the two? Will it be an even split or prorated based on the balances? 

3) I went through the search function for this subreddit and noticed about 8 months ago there was an issue with designating additional payments to Sallie Mae's loans. As of right now, I'll just be making the IBR payment, but within the next 6-9 months, I'll be making close to triple payments and I don't want any nasty surprises when the time comes. 

4) Every year, my IBR payment must be re-evaluated based on my income (as well as my husband's income). Is this done through Sallie Mae or the government?",finance,1369145355

personalfinance,Student loans and unemployment options,"I graduated in 2012 with my PharmD and 115K in student loans. After graduation I started a year of residency with a salary of 42K to get more training and put myself down the career path I want.  During residency I deferred the majority of my federal loans as the payments would have been incredibly difficult to make at my current salary.  The minimum combined monthly payment on my student loans all together is $1310/month.

My residency will be complete on June 21st, as will my deferrment.  My federal loans will enter repayment in July.  I've been searching for a job for almost two months.  I recently expanded my search from just what I'd like to do, to any pharmacist's position in our area.  Moving is not really an option as my SO is in school and we have a lease.

My question is this: what options are available for my student loans if I'm unable to find work by June 21st?  As I understand it income-based repayment is dependent on your previous year's income (during which time I was employed).  My emergency fund will cover about 3 months of other expenses but I was unable to save enough during this year to cover my students loans as well.

I admit, I was unprepared for this.  It never occurred to me that I'd have difficult finding a job as a pharmacist in a large metro area.  But I'd rather search for options now and begin putting the parts in motion than end up against a wall on the 21st.",finance,1369140062

World markets have been in chaos since Dollar went into a nosedive at the end of last year -

In 2013 The USA deficit was at its highest with interest rates flat, they had found themselves within the hockey stick effect. That is, the government could print as much currency as it liked but there was not enough anual growth to support the pyramid scheme and government spending was out of hand – Since the US and other countries went off the gold standard, global currencies have not been fixed to anything of ‘real’ value - which has lead to reckless government spending and currency speculation.

In early 2013 the Major Banks of Greece, Cyprus, Spain and Ireland had been bailed out by their countries’ taxpayers but where literally bankrupt by mid 2013. These same banks, had until then been supported by the continued (unregulated) printing of government money. Some governments began raiding the savings accounts of their citizens, as this was the only economic resource left.
In mid-December China announced that they could no longer afford to give the US credit.

Only a few weeks later the value of the dollar slid to oblivion due to a huge default that was recoded on the 29th December 2013 related to an IMF interest payment that was not made. -- On that day there was unprecedented public disinvestment from the banks as everyone attempted to convert their dollars into cryptocurencies or gold and oil. As the value of the dollar continued to fall, the US defaulted on their long term bonds with other countries like Japan. These countries, dependent on US payments could no longer pay their national debts and a domino effect ensued, sending global markets on a downward spiral into chaos. Mayhem broke out worldwide as people from countries around the world lost all confidence in their governments and the current financial systems.

* I'm 35 years old.

* I'm a smoker who can't seem to quit, but I'm not addicted to anything else.

I got a new job and my family is locating to a new city for the position. We currently own our house. When we sell it we expect to walk away with $80-100k in cash. Because we don't know the new city very well, we plan to rent for a year or so before purchasing a new house. We'd like to roll the cash from the old house sale into the down payment for the new house. 

A house purchase isn't easy to time so we want the money to be readily available when we do decide we want it. That might be six months (probably not sooner), and could be as long as a couple of years. We'd also like to see some growth in the money. At a minimum, we'd like to not lose money to inflation.

Savings accounts don't pay anything. CD's are paying a lot less than inflation, but something, and they aren't as liquid as I'd like. Stock is risky, and we could lose some money to investment costs without enough time for growth to outstrip the costs. So does that leave me with bonds? What else should I consider for this chunk of cash so that we can maintain some growth with minimal risk and costs? What tax implications should I consider?

Some other, potentially relevant information: We have a small amount of relatively low-interest student loan debt, and a car payment at a reasonable interest rate, neither of which are worth spending down payment money on. No credit card debt to speak of. Retirement funds are at a good place for our age and consist of a 401(k), a 403(b), and Roth and traditional IRAs. We have a small cash emergency fund.

business,Engineering a Distorted Supply and Demand Curve,"Distorted Supply and Demand Curve

Record High Demand = Plunge in Prices. How? In April this year, gold prices fell to their lowest level in three decades. This, despite World Gold Council (WGC) reports of a record demand for gold from numerous central banks during 2012 and 2013 so far. Why then did gold fall? Most importantly, what systemic factors influence this inconsistency between market forces and prices?

Market Forces

Like other commodities, prices of gold and silver are based on the market forces of demand and supply. Demands for commodities can be investment demand, industrial demand, and speculative demand. Speculative demand rises and falls respectively with increase and decrease of the other two demands. Supply comes mainly from new mine production, recycle of scrap metal, and sale by governments.

What makes gold and silver precious is their rarity and their resistance to corrosion. According to the WGC, the estimated total amount of gold mined till end-2011 was 171,300 tons1. Corresponding figure for silver is 1,411,475 tons2. Again, silver is 17.5 times as abundant as gold is in earth’s crust3.

Silver is the junior cousin of gold when these metals are used as a store of value especially in times of economic turmoil. Any entity used as money has to be acceptable to the people at large and should store value. The price of silver is somewhat related to gold as it is the second best store of value and second most acceptable after gold.

Unlike gold, industrial demand for silver is great. Demand for gold is mainly for investment and the investment demand for silver and its prices usually pick up after the supply of investment gold dwindles due to heavy demand.

Role of Speculation

Markets operate largely on sentiment because the future performance and, therefore, the value of a commodity, a company, an asset class, or the entire economy is largely uncertain and cannot be predicted with precision although the general direction / trend can be guess-estimated.

Uncertainty promotes speculation based on the expectation or sentiment or perception of buyers and sellers and plays a major role in the determination of market prices. Often, the mere possibility of occurrence of an event can wreck havoc regardless of whether such an event actually occurs. Quite naturally, perception manipulation is an integral part of market operations.

What are the Forms of Market Forces?

In the context of this discussion, major forms of gold and silver that can be invested into include:

Bullion or Physical Form such as bars and coins
Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) trace the price of a market index such as S&amp;P 500 instead of following the price of a single company / asset class. Gold and silver ETFs trace the price of gold and silver respectively
These are respectively known as paper gold and paper silver and are the simplest way to invest into precious metals, although not the safest

Derivatives are securities based on other securities or other assets. Common types of derivatives include forward contracts, swaps, futures, and options. The value of derivatives is heavily based on speculation. Furthermore, the rules under which they are traded are subject to change without notice
ETFs and derivatives provide leverage i.e. their value appreciates more than the increase in price of the asset class they are based on. However, the same is true when the price is headed downwards. These forms of gold are more open to speculation and, therefore, fraud.

How to Engineer the Distorted Supply and Demand curve.

Presently, the world stands on the brink of economic disaster due to bubbles in asset classes across the global economy. In a globalised world, these bubbles are connected and the bust of one will pop the others and the connected global financial system will explode.

Central banks have to maintain these bubbles through monetary expansion via excessive money printing and lowering of lending rates, and (mis)direction of credit and investment funds are (mis)directed into these bubbling asset classes.

With every round of monetary expansion or bond buying programs, the value i.e. purchasing power of major currencies declines. People then seek those assets that can store value. Gold and, later, silver are expected to rise to stupendous level because they will not only store value but appreciate as people lose confidence in paper money.

Gold prices declined in April potentially because the Federal Reserve hinted at an early exit from its present $85 billion dollars a month bond purchasing program or money printing scheme and because Cyprus was expected to offload some of its gold reserves to raise funds to fight a dire economic slowdown.

Speculation, as rightly pointed out by the WGC, is another important reason for this inconsistent drop. This is also the cause that often turns logic on its head in markets. Derivatives and ETFs are the chief culprits in this regard. Gold and silver is also similarly hated by the official financial giants and controllers.

Large investment banks purchase massive amounts of gold and silver through futures contracts i.e. those contracts wherein the transaction is completed at a later date. Then, they sell the precious metals that they do not yet possess through separate futures contracts
Sale of such huge amounts causes the prices to drop and these banks then pick up the metals at lower rates. Smart investors need to see through this game and not fall in the perception manipulation trap

Privately, these financial giants know of the great wealth transfer into gold and silver. As prudent and of course scheming businessmen, they are trying to maximize profits by buying low through deliberate dampening of prices

Often, derivative contracts are renewed before expiry. The buyers and sellers may change and this forms an infinite buyer-seller chain wherein the final buyer is not known. Such chain are created by trader groups who purchase derivatives from one another to create an impression of the derivative being in demand
Naturally, the price of the derivative rises and when sufficient number of outsiders is lured in and the group has made considerable returns, they sell their positions quickly causing a drop in prices

Again, large investment banks can legally import the principle of fractional reserves in ETFs for gold and silver i.e. they can issue ETFs for, say, 250 tons of gold / silver when they possess only 100 tons of gold / silver. This means, an ETF holder will receive lesser amount of gold / silver than the one he paid for if he insists on taking physical possession
False impressions of surplus availability of gold can be created by issuing ETFs that represent greater amount of gold for the same amount of reserves – say with reserves of 100 tons, ETFs for 400 tons of gold are issued as compared to 250 tons earlier. Prices of gold and silver will most likely fall because of the ‘perceived’ surplus

Although gold ETFs made up only 4% and 6.4% of the total gold demand in 2011 and 2012 respectively1 and the investment demand for silver was 17.2% and 15.76% of the total demand in 2010 and 2011 respectively2, the perceptions created by such trades is significant

Because gold and dollar move in the opposite directions, the official and financial establishment in U.S. hate it. If gold rises, dollar falls and foreign investors lose their attraction of the U.S. economy. Availability of such overseas investment is the reason why we continue to operate despite a debt of over $16 trillion
Despite its decline, the dollar is still the reserve currency of most of the world at the moment. Central banks that hold their reserves in dollars, therefore, have a vested interest in a strong dollar. Covert sales of gold reserves by such central banks are not unheard of.

The scope for such sales is limited due to limited availability if gold stocks and due to the Central Bank Gold Agreement (CBGA)-3 restricting the annual sale of gold by central banks to 400 tons for the 2009-14 period. The CBGA has nineteen signatories

Finally-  What Free Market?

The London spot prices of Gold and Silver is not exactly the true supply and demand curve that we assume a free market to have. Due to the representation of prices via paper gold and silver, a free market assumption of these prices are not aligned with free market. Complexities of the present financial system using paper gold and silver are a deliberate creation to ensure non-participation in physicals by the general public and to enable control by a few. On the contrary, financial mechanisms with gold and silver as reserves can limit or even eliminate the possibility of foul play. Smart and proactive investors need to call the bluff broadcast by the vested interests – with global macroeconomics fundamentals breaking down at rates we haven’t seen before, now is the time to buy real physical gold and silver, because after all, how much is paper is really worth?

personalfinance,[Q] 401k loan to pay off CC debt,"Without getting too much involved with my history, I have about $11k in CC debt with various interest rates.

* CC1: $4500 - 0% APR til around Mar/Apr 2014
* CC2: $1600 - 17.99% APR
* CC3: $400 ~ 10% APR
* BillMeLater - $1130 0% APR til Sept, then 20%
* CC4 in DMP $2900 - with fees, APR comes to about 30%. I've seen upped to pay it off in 4 months

I have $26k in my 401k and contribute 10% (with a 5% match from my employer).  I've gotten a huge pay increase last November and have been steadily paying off my debt, but I'd like to think about using the loan to lower my interest rates.  Right now, my goal is to pay off CC4, CC2, BillMeLater and then tackle CC1.  

The 401k loan would have a 5.25% interest rate.  I'm thinking of taking a $10k loan and pay it off in 10 months.  According to their calculator, I would have a bi-weekly payment of $510.67 meaning I would pay about $220 in interest (I did the math in a spreadsheet and got about $280).  There's also a $150 loan fee

Interest rate wise - I think this makes sense.  I can manage the bi-weekly payment (it would be much easier for me from a budget standpoint).  But if you disagree otherwise, I'd love to hear a counter argument for this.  A rough calculation showed that with $1200 in monthly payments with my current credit cards, I'd have paid about $900 in interest (and that's not calculating the cards that will no longer have the 0% promotion)

Also - does taking a loan from a 401k negatively effect my credit score?  It's taken a hit recently, but I'm building that back up.

personalfinance,Is it better to pay down my mortgage (3% interest rate) or to invest in a mutual fund (or other stocks)?,"I know I could calculate returns based on predicted performance of certain stocks/funds and realize more than 3%, but I have also lost in the market and am a bit weary.  I was hoping to take the cash and make another real estate or similar type investment, but nothing has seen like a great oppy recently.  mostly, I'm concerned that I have cash sitting around and not doing work for me.  

without a better investment option on the horizon, should I pay down my mortgage or invest?  or just tie it up in a short term CD until I see a good investment?  I am otherwise decently invested, solid 401k, etc.  I play around a bit with selling covered options, which can be good.  not sure what other info would be helpful.

If in the likelihood that the USD does devalue (which seems like a reasonable assumption over the next 5 years) that would be a welcome additional saving.

Bitcoin,Prediction: Coinbase will be shut-down...Do not keep coins or funds in Coinbase (or any other exchange or startup) .,"I predict that at some point unless something changes, Coinbase (And many, many other Bitcoin related businesses) will eventually be shut down/investigated just like Mutum Sigillum LLC currently is.  

The reason is simple: Almost all of the current wave of bitcoin -related startups (even well-funded ones) seem to be simply ignoring the plain-english wording in the FinCEN and State guidelines for the regulatory environment.

For example: From [Coinbase's FAQ](https://coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement): 

&gt;Coinbase is not a money transmitter. Coinbase assists its users in Bitcoin transactions.

Then, from [FinCEN regulations and guidelines](http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html): 

&gt;By contrast, a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter. In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency.

What does coinbase DO if not *accept virtual currency from one person (itself or sellers) and transmit it to others in exchange for USD?

Even if there was no USD involved, EVER, (which it clearly is), then we have

&gt;The definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies. Accepting and transmitting anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter under the regulations implementing the BSA.

&gt;The term ""money transmission services"" means ""the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means.

This strongly implies that even if you simply assist users to transfer BTC, or hold BTC, or manage online wallets (like blockchain.info), then you are operating as a money transmitter under the law.

So what do money transmitters have to do to comply?

1) they have to be licenced, in EVERY state which they do business in.  

2) They have to register with FinCEN and are subject to FinCEN regulations.

3) In particular, among other things, they [must](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=6de839c216cb596d771b3b1e27afb342;rgn=div5;view=text;node=31%3A3.1.6.1.2;idno=31;cc=ecfr#31:3.1.6.1.2.3.3.5): 

&gt; Before concluding any transaction with respect to which a report is required under § 1010.311, § 1010.313, § 1020.315, § 1021.311 or § 1021.313 of this chapter, a financial institution shall verify and record the name and address of the individual presenting a transaction, as well as record the identity, account number, and the social security or taxpayer identification number, if any, of any person or entity on whose behalf such transaction is to be effected. Verification of the identity of an individual who indicates that he or she is an alien or is not a resident of the United States must be made by passport, alien identification card, or other official document evidencing nationality or residence ( e.g., a Provincial driver's license with indication of home address). Verification of identity in any other case shall be made by examination of a document, other than a bank signature card, that is normally acceptable within the banking community as a means of identification when cashing checks for nondepositors ( e.g., a driver's license or credit card). 


When was the last time you supplied a drivers licence and Photo ID to buy bitcoin?  Hell coinbase even [says EXPLICITLY](https://coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement) that they don't intend on obeying this regulation:

&gt;We do not guarantee the identity of any user or other party or ensure that a buyer will complete a transaction.

And this doesn't even cover the dozens of different STATE laws, all of which are significantly more complex and onerous, including minimum-asset requirements and surety bond requirements.

Of course, all of this is absolutely asinine.  Its totally useless and causes extreme regulation that stifles innovation.  

HOWEVER, unless the bitcoin community and bitcoin startups start lobbying to get some of these rules changed, then you have two options if you want to operate a bitcoin-related business in the US:

1) comply with the (idiotic) regulatory environment of legitimate businesses in the united states.

2) Run a black-market business until you get caught and your  assets are seized and your customers get shafted by the Fed.

Since all of the current Bitcoin-related enterprises seem to be aiming for option 2), I strongly recommend that anyone in the community avoid storing or holding any kind of long-term value in these systems until a startup shows up that has an interest in actual regulatory compliance or the asinine laws are changed.",cryptocurrency,1369328014

I've heard it mentioned in the past but never really been able to find out much about it.

This concerns me a bit, as my rates are already at/near 7% and with around 50k outstanding in various student loans, this would not be a good thing for me.  I make a decent wage, and am able to afford the ~600/month in payments, but if my rates went up too dramatically, I can see it putting a pinch on the household finances.

Here's a [LINK](http://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=186195963&amp;m=186195950) to the audio from NPR

So, can anyone shed a little light for me?  Thanks!!

EDIT#2: Appears I don't really have anything to worry about...Thanks folks!

EDIT: Reason (I believe) my interest rates are already so high is because there were some issues when it came time to being repaying them...long story short, I had moved out of state for the job I got out of school, didn't get the correspondence from the loan institutions, and went about 3 months behind in payments.  Brought them current as soon as I was able to get in touch with the loan companies, but the damage was already done...credit score went to sh*t, and I'm still feeling that hurt bad.  They have been current for over a year now, and I'm hoping that my score will recover sooner rather than later, as my wife and I are now looking to purchase a home around this time next year...",finance,1369325655
Bitcoin,Bitfloor Update from AudenX,"Hi Bitfloor users,

No new official updates since 5/13.

On 5/20, I emailed Roman to follow up on our brief conversation at the Bitcoin conference. I suggested that the virtual currency specialists at Graham &amp; Dunn might be able to make an intro for Bitfloor to Silicon Valley Bank. Roman responded that evening and said he would contact the lawyer at Graham &amp; Dunn. Roman said he was aware that SVB was serving some other Bitcoin companies but said that they are ""very picky"" about the clients they accept.

A second bank lead came to me today from another redditor, who forwarded a piece from IEEE Spectrum. The article says Jordan Modell and Brewster Kahle (who worked together to charter the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union) would like to provide banking services to Bitcoin exchanges, ""assuming they get approval from their lawyers and regulators"". I forwarded that info to Roman, as well. Here's the article, if you're interested:

http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/credit-union-bitcoins-new-best-friends

Both SVB and the Internet Archive team are based here in the Bay Area, so I hope Roman will make use of his time in the area to make some meetings.

I will continue following up with Roman and his lawyer to ask what progress they're making opening a new account.

-AudenX

I live in the Bay Area, and throughout the day I get the occasional urge to hunt Roman down and confront him about this. He's dallying around Google, Stanford, and other areas rather than focusing on getting us our money back. 

He hasn't told anyone anything about the process of getting our money back, and it's becoming increasingly infuriating. Who else is with me on this?

""very picky""? Are you shitting me? That sounds like a schoolboy excuse for ""it's too hard."" Sack up, Roman.

For years, we've gotten sneak peaks at games at these sorts of events. At Microsoft's event, we get a set-top box that can play games. What happened to gaming? What happened to Microsoft's game-centric approach? For the past few years, Microsoft had the lead on Sony BECAUSE it was game-centric. We had achievements, indie games, exclusive dlc and virgin gaming. At this conference, they just threw all that away and said ""My fans said I could be anything.. So I became a glorified TV remote!"" If you think this is the ONLY reason to Hate the new Xbox One, you're in for a treat. Without further ado, here's my 10 unforgivable sins of the Xbox One.

  *  ""It's not Always-online. You just need to be online once every 24 hours and every time you operate a game."" Do they think that there's a difference? Last time I checked; There's only 24 hours in a day. If it needs to be on, 24 hours a day, doesn't that technically make it always online? Of course it does. However, the schmucks down at Microsoft thought if they 'worded' it a bit different, us fans would come flocking over to buy the new system.

  *  If you're like me, you've probably got a lot of shit on your Xbox. Games, movies, DLC, etc. Guess what? With the new Xbox One, you won't even be able to play these games anymore unless you still have your 360. That's not just talking about the games, either. It's the entire Xbox Live marketplace. None of your purchases will sync over.. I mean it's not like we've spent our hard-earned money on these things, right?

  *  Microsoft Is 86'ing used games. That's right. As soon as you buy your game and put it into your system, your game becomes registered and cannot be used by any third party. Guess what that means? For starters, it'll ruin game stop and red box's business, and if you want to lend a game to a friend; They'll have to pay a goddamned fee. That's right. They'll have to PAY to use a game that you paid for. That's bad business tactics right there.

 *   Mandatory Kinect. Remember that shitty device that hardly ever worked for the Xbox 360? Remember Sonic: Free Riders, Starwars: Kinect and all the other shitty games out there? Guess what? We're going to have EVEN MORE of this gimmick-ware in the Xbox One. Oh and to top that all off, you HAVE to have one in order to make your Xbox work, because it was SUCH a success in the last gen, right?

 *   Microsoft thinks the fans are idiots. You thought that the most unforgivable thing they've done was made it online? Heh.. You're not even close. When I was reading articles about the Xbox ONE on a few sites, I noticed that there would always be one person that'd say that the Xbox ONE will be amazing. A specific instance of this can be seen here at http://n4g.com/news/1263242/xbox-one-a-middle-finger-to-the-gamer To save time, his post read ""If you really have anger toward Microsoft for producing a video game console with features that go beyond your precious hardcore gaming, you truly are a sad loser! An epic fu**ing loser!!!"" I love how he says 'Beyond' here. That's a word Microsoft threw around during the announcement conference. If you scroll down to the bottom of this page, you'll see an account named ""Truth Speaker"" (cute, right?) Well, calling the guy on his bullshit, I clicked on the account to see any other instances where he posted. Guess what? His account was made on May 22nd (a day after the press conference), and every single post he made was in direct relation to the Xbox One. Coincidence? I think not. Remember that crappy Star Trek game that came out a while ago? Well, according to reviewers like Angry Joe, there were multiple cases where accounts were made within seconds of launch, praising the title. When these accounts were clicked on, they were found out to be developers. If they did it, why wouldn't the most monopolistic, greedy companies do it?

 *  No exclusives at a game console announcement conference. Remember the Ps4's announcement? Remember all the games that were showcased there? Remember all the EXCLUSIVES that were showcased there? Xbox One had none of these. In fact, the only games that were showcased at the conference were Quantum Theory (which I recall was multi-console. Forgive me if i'm wrong), a perpetuation of the long-winded Forza Motorsport series, pre-rendered EA-sports title trailers and a fucking Call of Duty game. If you think this is bad now, just look at this. Ubisoft said that the ""next-gen graphics of the Xbox ONE will blow you away."" .. Did anyone see any 'mind-blowing' graphics at that announcement? Maybe I missed something. The only thing relatively interesting that I saw at the conference was Call of Duty (And I hate Call of Duty) and the 'next-gen graphics' they brought to the table was interactive fish and fog. On top of that, Microsoft had the AUDACITY to tell us that we'd see the games at E3. With E3 being mere weeks away, couldn't they have just waited? They were clearly unprepared and yet, they go out there on the stage like a bunch of idiots, preaching about a TV. If I was uninformed on the Xbox ONE until E3 but saw a bunch of exclusives when I did, I wouldn't have complained. I'm sure plenty will agree with me.

 * ""Top-set box"". In a desperate attempt to reach out to the mainstream audience, Microsoft rules out the gamer. We watched the conference anxiously in hopes of seeing a new game and instead, we get a DirectTV commercial. I understand that they're broadening they're audiences but when you take out the very reason you had the audience in the first place, who are you catering to? I've yet to hear families out on the street talking about the 'wonderous Xbox ONE's channel-flipping abilities. A majority of Americans can watch TV, use Skype and FaceBook in the palm of our hand. Hell, even the 6 year old Psp could use skype and FaceBook. If you're going to boast entertainment, bring something new to the table. Don't perpetuate cliche after cliche in order to reel in an audience that never paid attention to you in the first place.

 *  Xbox ONE is a dumb name. I understand that it stands for ""the one entertainment system"" but when you fail at entertainment, what does the 'one' stand for? The one bankruptcy file Microsoft will deal with after failing with the system? The 'one' person who actually bought an Xbox ONE in lieu of a Wii U, Ps4 of PC? Maybe it's the 'one' line of cocaine that the executive snorted when the Xbox ONE was in development.

 * Microsoft dodging the questions we want to know and the shitty reporters too scared to ask them. We first heard about this next generation, 2 years ago. We've been in complete darkness since. We knew little about the system in the first place and the little that we did, we tried to repress.

http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/credit-union-bitcoins-new-best-friends

Both SVB and the Internet Archive team are based here in the Bay Area, so I hope Roman will make use of his time in the area to make some meetings.

I will continue following up with Roman and his lawyer to ask what progress they're making opening a new account.


Best,

Bitcoin,I'm sick of hearing that Bitcoin has no inherent value...,"Critics of Bitcoin say that they have ""no inherent value” and that Bitcoins are merely “monopoly money.”

Well, let’s think about the dollar for a quick moment.  The dollar, in recent history, has been the world’s de-facto currency.  That labeling is valuable in and of itself; but it is not inherent value--that can be changed either through bad policy, or a better alternative. So what inherent value does the dollar possess? Well, it is made of highly durable paper, so that gives it a clear benefit over most other things of similar weight. It is insured; although, only as deposits in financial institutions. Is this unique to the dollar? No. Then what made it the world’s standard?  Gold. It was up until fairly recently that the dollar was backed by that soft, shiny, and malleable metal. When we abandoned the gold standard things changed, and the fiscal policy of the new day exploded with economic irresponsibility.

Inherent Value #1)

Bitcoins on the other hand are decentralized, meaning no one government or people own the currency. This is very important.  Our forefathers tried as best they could to do the diminish the government’s power over currency with the dollar by separating the Fed and making it in an independent branch of government. The problem they encountered was replacing that intangible human element. They did not have the technology to correct this, and they were forced to put a man in charge of the money supply.  This allowed for rash (and often bad) decisions resulting in a financial landscape vastly different than what was intended by the original architects of our monetary system. Bitcoins have that human element removed. 

Inherent Value #2)

No matter what happens, it will not print more of itself because some event has pulled on heartstrings. It is governed by logic.  It cannot be counterfeited.  With technology improving at an ever increasing pace, paper currencies are becoming easier and cheaper to recreate. Bitcoins cannot be copied. As long as 51% of the hashing power delivered by miners remains diverse (and not owned by a single element), double spending cannot occur.  This is very different from the dollar, where it seems to be certain countries' missions (not excluding the United States) to print as much as they want.  

Inherent Value #3)

Bitcoin has the ability to be more anonymous than other electronic dollars (credit cards, etc...).  With diligence, this can be true and is a reason for value.  With upwards of 10,000 laws being passed every year across the States and all the regulation for businesses and freedom, Bitcoin has a HUGE support system from people believing in free markets.  It has become a true necessity in many transactions for those who disagree with government's interference with respect to laws targeting personal habits. 

Unlike the dollar (or any other country's currency for that matter), it is denominated out to eight decimal places which gives it great flexibility at these (or much higher) prices.  

While some people may think that anything having to do with computers is inconvenient, hopefully for most of us, we would rather turn on a computer than head to a bank. So, I will argue that it is a more convenient currency. I realize this is a relative term, and therefore more of an opinion, however I think it deserves mention. You have control of your money. There are no store or bank hours to abide by, or hold times to carry out a transaction. You have the money sent when you want it sent. Not only can it save time, it is financially convenient as well. The transaction fees are MUCH less than those of the modern day banks--at the time of this writing it cost $50 to send international wires less exchange fees.

So get yourself a savings wallet(s) and a checking wallet(s) and use Bitcoin instead of the dollar we you can!",cryptocurrency,1369309260

First off, let me break down income and savings, since it is the easiest.  
-$2000/month take home pay

-0 savings  
-0 investments/stocks

-Car Loan - $17,215.83 - $420 being paid monthly - 0.9%   
-Chase Credit Card - $1,597.84 - $43 being paid monthly - 22.24%  
-Barclay Credit Card - $3,900.43 - $72 being paid monthly - 22.99%

-Rent - $730 Monthly (moving and will be $975 starting August)  
-Renters Insurance - $10.00 monthly, paid through November though  
-Internet (No Cable) - $40.00 Monthly  
  
I am looking for advice on how to clear up my debt within a year or so.  As it stands right now, between groceries, gas and all of my debt and bills I am barely washing even every month.  Unfortunately, I must move shortly so the even wash is about to end unless I do something soon.  


The options that I have seen thus far are:  
-Take out a $11,000 personal loan and clear all debt into this loan at an interest rate of 9.99% from the local credit union. This would yield a minimum payment of $220 a month, which I would pay as much as possible on to clear the loan as soon as possible with no penalty.  
-Borrow against my 401k, which to me is an absolute last resort.  
  
Does anyone have any other ideas, or recommendations one way or another?  Co-workers seem to think that borrowing against my 401k would be better as then any interest that I would pay back would go into my 401k.  I truly do not understand 401k or investments enough to understand how this works.

Bitcoin,The fate of Bitcoin: government controlled?,"Let's begin by imagining a world in which Bitcoin has become wildly successful. It's 20 years from now, and fiat has fallen away in favor of Bitcoin. It is used virtually everywhere there is a connection to the Internet. The initial mining gold rush is over, since the block reward (and the inflation rate) have settled down.

One of the most significant control mechanisms of modern government is the dictation of monetary policy. Bitcoin threatens to take that control away. If it does, as in this scenario, governments will want it back.

(PS: It is unreasonable to expect governments will collapse because of Bitcoin. They might perhaps be reduced, but they are still able to collect property and sales taxes just fine)

That means governments will mine at a loss in an attempt to control 50%+ of the network. It will be a new kind of Cold War, a bizarre digital-world equivalent to the nuclear arms race.

China will win. China has an enormous amount of electronics manufacturing capability, and a government that would not be afraid to lean on the companies that control that capability. They would be willing to build huge ASIC farms, at a steep loss, to control global monetary policy. People motivated by mining for profit could never keep up.

And then your Bitcoins would be at China's whim.

So, if Bitcoin really does go the way we want it to... what stops China from taking over as soon as we hit critical mass?",cryptocurrency,1369275947
personalfinance,College student looking for any advice at all,"I’m entering my junior year of college and have completely fucked up.  I have no one else to ask, so I’m hoping you guys can help me. 

When I entered college, I had enough scholarships to pay for all my school, but sophomore year I completely ruined everything by failing two courses.  Calculus and physics.  This dropped my GPA to around a 2.2 from just above a 3.0.  I had one semester to fix this or I lost everything, so I repeated the two courses along with two others.  I managed to do well in the two others, and made a D in physics, but still failed calculus again.  At this point, since I’ve lost the scholarships I no longer need to take calculus (switched majors.)  

But the bad news is I can no longer afford school.  As of now, I have a 2.38 GPA so I am only receiving $2,000 in student assistant awards for the year.  I’m eligible for $4500 from the federal subsidized loan and $2,000 from the unsubsidized loan.  

My school’s tuition is $4546 a semester.

I’m paying ~$400 dollars a month for rent including utilities.  
 

So for a year I’m looking at $13,892 before considering food, books, and other expenses.  I don’t have any insurance bills (car or health,) and I’m fortunate enough to have my cell phone bill paid by my parents.  

I need to be able to pay for around $5,400 dollars a year not including other expenses mentioned above.  

A friend told me that the federal loans via the Fasfa would increase but that doesn’t seem to be the case.  So I think my only option is an outside loan just so I can pay for my tuition.  I’ll be working and can pay back the loan throughout the year.  I mainly just need to be able to pay up front.  

After this semester, I should be eligible for the pell grant again, which will help tremendously.  It’s an additional 5,500 a year.  The requirement is to maintain above a 2.0 GPA and good standing.  I have the GPA requirement, but I had below a 2.0 semester GPA so I am no longer on good academic standing.  As long as I receive above a 2.0 next semester I’ll be placed back on good standing.",finance,1369274166
personalfinance,Paying off my car early... Is it worth it?,"I'm an avid saver but recently purchased a new car (first car under 100k miles in my life). Initially I was against buying something brand new and was looking and used cars but in my area (So. Cal) most of them had an insane amount of miles despite only being a few years old. 

Anyway I settled on a new car with 2.9% interest rate for 72 months (yes long loan period I know, but I wanted to keep the payments down). I currently owe $17k on the principal. My payments are just over $300 a month. 

I save about $500 per month just to have on hand and have another $1000 going into my 401k each month. 

I have 0 CC debt and paid my student loans off last year.

Keeping the above in mind is there a real benefit to paying the car off sooner given that 2.9% is a relatively low interest rate? Any suggestions on the best way to pay it off earlier in a way that doesn't gobble up too much cash?

The device comes with an integrated kinect and microphone. Which, so as to be ready to be queued up at a moment's notice, means they will also always be running and monitoring. Think about it. At the height of governmental attacks on our internet privacy, we're receiving similar and more overt attempts from one of the largest corporations in America. No matter how invested someone is in Microsoft or loves its products, I cannot think of a single logical reason why someone would want their living room or bedroom to literally be monitored 24/7 by them. This is unprecedented and concerning. Millions of people will be connected to servers where, in all likelihood, some of their most intimate of moments may or may not be stored by a device purchased of their own choosing.

Again, this is not an attack on the big bad corporation putting itself into our households. It is the ramifications that can come from such an overt violation of individual privacy. Well-intentioned or not, when the opportunity to abuse the system is presented on a silver platter like this, someone will always find a way in; and it is there that concern lies. 

Since Bill Gates has recently regained his title as richest man in the world he has recently pledged large sums of money to the highly controversial high school curriculum rewrite ""Common Core Standards"".

Employing similar ""always on"" technology to be implemented in classrooms while equally ignoring well-established pedagogy in certain fields of science and humanities, it has received enormous backlash from tens of thousands of educators nationwide.

Bitcoin,Hayak's promise is Bitcoin,"In his final treatise on economics, titled ""The Denationalization of Money[1],"" Fredrick Von Hayek wrote about his idea of what a world with 'Free Money' would look like. He believe that money that was independent of nation-states (like BTC) could fundementally change the world for the better, and liberate people from the oppression and tyranny of the monopoly on money. He based these ideas off of some of the principals of Silvio Gesell[2] --radical economist and anarchist. His principals were the bases of the ‘Worgl Miracle[3]’ which essentially reversed the depression in the town of Worgl, Austia in the 1930s. One of the concepts that Hayak wrote of based on these theories was the 'swiss ducet' theory of how to operate a free-money bank in a fiat currency system. This post is about the possible function of how a bank like this could work in the bitcoin economy.

This is not a bank for bitcoin, but a competitive economic mode that facilitates the purchasing power of different currencies and leverages them against one another using free-market principals. Essentially, it forces free-market function on to the economy by allowing for one to hedge against fiat currencies using the deflationary properties in bitcoin to draw equity from the increasing value of Bitcoin.

How?

As the bank what I do is I sell shares, or 'bits' as I like to call them, at their current market value. So today, you come in and buy a share for $120--the market price of what bitcoin is trading at today. In exchange I offer you an IOU for 1 BTC, and you will pay this loan back over the course of however long you choose--here is the kicker--you pay back the loan in dollars at the amount that you paid for the IOU with 1% in USD.

What this does it it offers the same possibility as buying a home back in the 1980s. For example, my mother paid $67,000 for our family home in 1982--today it is worth $425,000. That is because the value of the property is somewhat deflationary because of the limited, finite supply of property causes for it's value to generally be drove up. It could also be said that this is an effect of the loss of purchasing power of the dollar.  
BTC is a more extreme case of this because unlike property, we can know the exact number of BTC in circulation, and how many more bitcoins will be added to the economy and when. We can use these facts to leverage Bitcoin’s future purchasing power against its purchasing power today.

The reason this can work is because of BTC deflationary effect [4].  When we look at the value over time for bitcoin, one can see that the long time span one looks at the more likely it is that bitcoins value will gain against fiat currencies. This is because of the fundamental functions of both Bitcoin and fiat currencies. Bitcoin has a fixed 21 million coins EVER. Fiat currencies can guarantee that over time, they will expand the money supply, mean that there will be MORE dollars at a later date no matter what.  Currently the Fed has announced their plans to devalue the dollar by 33% over the next 20 years [5].  Due to these facts, the longer of a time span that we look across, the more likely we are to see bitcoin gaining value against all fiat currencies.

Bitcoin’s value is always going to go up as long as there is growth in the BTC economy that outpaces the supply--and that supply is fix. We know that only 25 new coins can enter into circulation every 10 minutes. We also know what the approximate market value of those new coins will be.  Yes, this is a huge sticking point and every single person that was effected in the 2008 crash can say, ""But it CAN go down!"" and that is true, but so can anything. And when you consider there is 3x more money in the US economy today than in 2008, and the systematic levels of dysfunction in the financial system, I would say it is much more foolish to trust that system, than one that is based on math.

This is all a moot point though, as this is the purpose of the bank--to assume the risk for holding the assets that are Bitcoins. Furthermore, through watching the blockchain, the volume of transaction, and the velocity of transaction over time, and historic gains and losses over time, along with the knowledge of how many coins are in circulation, how many coins will be added in the future, means that we can have pretty good projections about whether the value of BTC is going to go up or down based on its real economic value, and not just speculation.

So how does it work?

You come in and we sell you an IOU for one bitcoin. This 'bit' is $120--the market value of bitcoin today. Over time, you repay that loan to me. For the sake of this, let us say $10 a month. So when May 2014 rolls around, you have paid off your IOU for the Bit, I give you your bitcoin in return. The difference is now that bitcoin is worth $500--which you paid $120 for one year ago. And the way that the bank profits is through assuming the risk of holding BTC in case the price ever does go down, and for whatever gains are taken, the bank will take 1%. So we get 0.01 of your bitcoin for holding it (our profit), and you win for taking out the IOU because your $120 IOU is now worth $495.

Furthermore, if upon the completion of the payment, or hell, even partial payment, one could 'refinance' their loan with The Bank. So because the bank is holding the BTC, we can refinance at the market value at the time of refinancing. So if you have paid 50% off of your IOU (so 6 months have passed--it's DEC 2013) and now the value of BTC is say, $240. One could refi, and now as the bank I give you $240, and the 12 month cycle starts all over again. One is using the equity in their bitcoin and its deflationary nature to hedge against fiat inflation, and the lost of purchasing power of the dollar.

More importantly, is that we can build applications that create these financial instruments for automated, program-oriented banking. Similar to Bitcoin’s protocols, that means that no one can cheat at banking! If you lock yourself into a 12-month CD, the program application is what locks you in—not a person. The program can also have you pay a penalty to exit the deal, if you choose to do so, or other functions. And this is just one of many examples; there is a whole world of financial instruments that we can build that function off of programs that both yield profit and ensures security, safety, and most importantly, no one can cheat at it!
This works because it functions on the same trust as bitcoin--trust in the programming and protocols that ensure no one is cheating at, or rigging the system for their gains and others losses through corruption.

These are simply my own thoughts and ideas, and I could be wrong about some of this. But please, tell me your thoughts on this and if my logic is correct. Because if I’m right, we are in for a radical new way of doing finance and commerce.

After calling the DoE, they are saying she had two outstanding federal student loans, that had been sent to a collections agency. However, her grandmother paid off all of her federal and private student loans 3 years ago, and her credit report reflects this.

After calling the DoE a second time, this operator named a different collections agency that was servicing the loans. This operator was also able to tell us more information about where the loan was dispersed, and it was the same university that my wife went to.

The whole thing seems very confusing. My first instinct was to proceed very carefully in case it is a scam. I'm also wondering if there is some kind of identity theft going on?

What does PF recommend as the next steps? I think this goes beyond the realm of a tax attorney, but not sure where to begin to get answers.

**EDIT:** The other thing very strange to me is that her wages were never garnished. Wouldn't wages be garnished before they went after the tax refund??",finance,1369399490

På bare to år har doblet antall vellykkede [cyberattacks](http://chirpstory.com/li/77901), sier Michael Callahan, direktør for produkt og markedsføring for Foretakssikkerhet for HP-løsning. ""Du kan forvente antall angrep å øke med spredning av botnet, men det er utrolig at så mange er vellykket, gitt hvor mye oppmerksomhet som blir betalt til sikkerhet.""
Nettkriminalitet kostnader fortsatte å klatre i 2012, ifølge en rapport utgitt mandag av Ponemon Institute. Studiet av 56 store organisasjoner viste at den gjennomsnittlige annualiserte prisen for nettkriminalitet for bedriftene var US$ 8,9 millioner i året i forhold til $8,4 millioner år siden. Tap for firmaer som varierte fra ett $1,4 millioner til $46 millioner. Cyberattacks har blitt vanlige hendelser, heter det i studien. På en ukentlig basis, ble bedrifter i studien utsatt for 102 vellykkede angrep per uke, eller 1,8 vellykkede angrep per firma per uke.

Dobbel frekvens
""På bare to år har doblet antall vellykkede angrep, som er ganske utrolig når du tenker på det,"" sa Michael Callahan, direktør for produkt og løsning markedsføring for HP Foretakssikkerhet, som sponset studien, TechNewsWorld. ""Du kan forvente antall angrep å øke med spredning av botnet, men det er utrolig at så mange er vellykket, gitt hvor mye oppmerksomhet som blir betalt til sikkerhet,"" sa han. En grunn for økningen i vellykkede angrep kan være raffinementet av angriperne, ifølge Larry Ponemon, grunnlegger og leder eller Ponemon Institute. ""Noen av angrepene har blitt mye mer komplisert å identifisere, mye mer stealthy,"" fortalte han TechNewsWorld. I tillegg oppstår skadelig insider angrep oftere, la han til. ""Ondsinnet innsidere, arbeider med eksterne parter, kan forårsake enorme mengder skade og når de er oppdaget, de er vanskelig å inneholde og avhjelpe.""

""Disse typer angrep er ikke sjeldne og vi har avbøtende tiltak på plass,"" en ikke navngitt offisiell hvite hus ble sitert som sier. ""I dette tilfellet angrepet ble identifisert, systemet ble isolert, og det er ingen indikasjon overhodet at noen exfiltration data fant sted,"" offisielt fortsatte. ""Videre, det var aldri noen innvirkning eller forsøkte brudd på noen klassifisert systemet."" Nyheten om angrepet brøt på Sep. 30 når Washington FreeBeacon, en konservativ online nyheter stikkontakt, rapporterte at hackere som er knyttet til den kinesiske regjeringen brøt seg inn i et datanettverk brukes av det hvite hus militære office for kjernefysisk kommandoer. Siterer en offisiell kjent med hendelsen, FreeBeacon hevdet at brudd var en av Kinas ""mest frekk cyberattacks mot USA og fremhever en svikt i Obama-administrasjonen å presse Kina på sin vedvarende cyberattacks."" En sikkerhetsanalytiker, men finne ikke spear phishing-angrep på det hvite hus som fet alle. ""Jeg ikke tror det er et tegn de får fetere,"" fortalte Ira Victor, en digital forensics analytiker med Data klone Labs TechNewsWorld. ""De har vært dette fet før."" Det kommer til å bli verre, hevdet han. ""Det er hundretusener av fledgling tastatur hawks nå tilværelse groomed av den kinesiske regjeringen til å bryte inn i systemer,"" sa han.

Scareware Crackdown
En større internasjonale skjerping scareware svindlere ble lansert forrige uke av US Federal Trade Commission. Byrået mål seks selskaper i India som selger falske tekniske support-tjenester til engelsktalende land, inkludert USA, Canada, Australia, Irland, New Zealand og Storbritannia. Ifølge FTC, noen av svindlere kalde-kalt forbrukerne posing som representanter fra legitime selskaper, som Dell, Microsoft, McAfee og Symantec. De fortalte forbrukerne det malware blitt registrert på datamaskinene sine og deretter tilbudt å fjerne den for gebyrer varierer fra $49-$ 450. I tillegg til ""kjelerommet"" taktikk brukt av fem av bedriftene, brukes en sjette annonser plassert på Googles søkesider for å selge sine falske tjenester. For å unnvike svindel jagerfly, brukt den falske malware fjerning 80 forskjellige domenenavn og 130 forskjellige telefonnumre, FTC sa. ""FTC har vært aggressive-- og vellykket--i sin forfølgelse av tech-support svindel, sier sa FTC formann Jon Leibowitz i en uttalelse. ""Og tech-støtte svindlere vi snakker om i dag har tatt scareware til et helt annet nivå av virtuelle kaos.""

Investors seem to be happy with their investments so far this year as the stock market is doing well, but there seems to be a lot of concern over the Federal Reserve either ending or slowing down their quantitative easing program. Anytime that the Federal Reserve even hints at ending it the stock market falls. 

Hypothetically speaking if they were to end the program today then I would bet on the stock market taking a dive down, but how far down is the question? I don't know if it would be only a temporary fall or a more prolonged one? Perhaps it would be a good thing especially because prices seem high right now so maybe it would bring them down to a more reasonable level. Either way, it just seems to me like the rally is artificial created in large part by the Fed. What do you think?",finance,1369362968

There is a growing sense of unease and confusion as the FOMC work out how to contain an experiment that is in danger of spinning out of control.  Ben “The Cook” Bernanke is the one in charge, while President of the New York Fed William Dudley is cheering him on.  Others, such as James Bullard (St Louis Fed), are starting to wonder if it’s such a great idea while Esther George (Kansas City Fed) wants to get out now before it blows!

The minutes of the FOMC meeting held on April 30 – May 1 were indicative of a committee at odds over how to implement the “exit strategy”

According to the minutes “A number of participants” expressed willingness to adjust the pace of purchases downward as early as the June meeting if the economic data was showing signs of “strong and sustained growth”. (Likely to include centrists such as James Bullard)

One participant preferred to begin decreasing the rate of purchases immediately (Esther George), while another participant preferred to “add more monetary accommodation”.  Out of the 12 voting members, Esther George was the lone voice dissenting against the decision to continue purchases at the current rate of $85bn per month.

personalfinance,Pay off a student loan or leave a small balance for highest credit score?,"Hi all,

Looking to get your perspective on a dilemma I have in regards to paying off a student loan.


Current status:

* A total of $57,000 worth of student debt, across 7 direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans with interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 7.9%, opened during the 2009-2011 period

* Current FICO of 735 with with following negative factors:
   * You have too many credit accounts with balances (9 total: 7 student loans and 2 credit cards, balances on credit cards are negligibe)
   * You have a short credit history (oldest account is 7 years, average is 3 years)

Question:

Assuming that I would like to maximize my credit score and assuming the ability to pay the student loans off completely, what is the most efficient course of action?

(a) Paying loans off in full will reduce my debt ratios and will decrease the number of open accounts, but will also limit the growth of my average account age (I think?)

OR 

(b) Paying loans off ALMOST in full (leaving a total of $1,000 across the seven accounts will cost me around $69 a year in interest to carry) will reduce my debt ratios and will support the gradual increase in average account age, but will keep my number of open accounts high

Thanks, looking forward to hearing what you think

What should I do? Should I leave the money with MassMutual or get it taken out and pay the tax penalties? I don't have any other taxable income in 2013 in the US and no green card/citizenship that would make me have to pay tax in the US for income earned outside. 

One of the cons of leaving it in the US would be that its subject to the lower interest rates and losing value thanks to the volatile market.

Outdated heating controls waste your money

No cylinder thermostat - excessive stored water temperature and risk of scalding.
No cylinder insulation - heat is wasted through the surface of the cylinder.
No room thermostat - rooms are too hot.
Lack of thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) - excessive room temperatures and poor heating system balancing.
Absence of boiler interlock - the boiler stays hot and cycles unnecessarily during programmed heating periods.

Forex,Let's Talk Fundamentals (because they might be important this week),"This is more of a brain dump to encourage discussion, so I'd love to hear your thoughts.

**Something strange happened this week.** 

Stocks fell off - mostly Japanese stocks, but equity markets everywhere suffered nasty losses. The S&amp;P 500 shat a nasty reversal candle on Thursday, and the Nikkei posted one of its largest falls in history on Friday. 

At the same time bonds fell (yields rose). The US Dollar also fell.

That's not how it's supposed to work.

When stocks fall, bond yields fall (bond prices rise) because more people buy them. Where the hell was the money going? 

Into the Yen and the Swiss Franc, mostly. The Yen because most of the action was in Japan. The USD/JPY and Nikkei 225 are HEAVILY correlated. I can't tell if the fall in stocks preceded the fall in USD/JPY (and AUD/JPY, which many say led the way), or if it was the other way around, but either way we had classic risk aversion kicking in.

USD/JPY posted its largest weekly decline since 2011.

There was some jawboning, and data from Japan to suggest that the new QE measures are working. 

**But wait a second:** they've only just started. That money hasn't really filtered down to anywhere where it's actually being used to power the economy. The only real effect so far has been a massive uplift in stocks. This is because a lot of the Nikkei 225 is made up of exporters and multi-nationals, and a falling Yen boosts their *expected* profits - nobody's actually made any money yet.

The technicals still only say ""retracement"", not ""reversal"", but we're hanging in by a thread - **especially USD/JPY**. If we break Friday's low, 100 is in sight. If this break is for real, this psychological barrier will mean absolutely nothing.

After this 97.00 is next, then 95.00/94.50, then 92. I don't think any fall would get down to 92, or even 94, but 97 is highly possible by the end of this week - and if we get there, it could be in a matter of minutes.

**Before I go on, COT data**

*(For newbie traders, COT means Commitment of Traders, and it's a series of complicated charts showing net speculative futures positioning. When you overly it onto price data, you will find that extremes of short positioning tend to precede massive rallies. This is because a LOT of people get increasingly short as price starts to fall, which reaches an extreme as it continues to fall. Price starts to come back up, and the extreme extends a little bit more, before you get a short squeeze and everyone buys furiously to get out of unprofitable short positions)*

Aussie COT showed a massive extreme in short positioning: http://stocktwits.com/message/13774559

So did the Japanese Yen: http://stocktwits.com/message/13774580

The most telling is the S&amp;P500: http://stocktwits.com/message/13774599

The light blue line says that the big money is getting more and more out of stocks (or since it's futures positioning, they're starting to bet it will fall)

All other things being equal, this means these two are probably due a large correction. All other things might not be equal, however. Extremes in quiet times can become the norm in unusual circumstances - bear this in mind.

**This is the scenario if Asian stocks lead the fall.** Longs are clearly nervous, but the docket is light this week. This alone could be enough - with minor bad news sparking panic selling. The US Dollar could see some initial selling purely on USD/JPY, pushing the majors higher. This will happen during the Asian session. If it happens in the morning, you will see European markets open lower, and we might get early USD weakness as USD/JPY sells off. 

But it won't last. The risk aversion will spill into European and US stocks as these markets open, and they may gap significantly lower. In this case the Swiss Franc will strengthen first, followed by the US Dollar. So I don't like USD/CHF so much here. The US Dollar will almost certainly surge once US markets open.

If this is the real deal, (**and that is the biggest fucking ""IF"" ever** because many have called this reversal lots of times and have given up after being wrong repeatedly) this dollar surge will be enormous. The world will be waking up from its dream of a fragile recovery that has been overblown by surging stock markets.

**Stock markets have been rallying for mixed reasons.**  Some of it is investor confidence, but most of it is simply the search for yield, which most cash investments can't provide at the moment. Dividend yields in stocks are good, and fund managers have been buying them because they need to beat indices, which are rising more quickly than the values of their portfolios. This cycle has fed itself, and stocks have risen, even though demand for those companies' products and services has remained tepid.

If this happens, the Yen crosses will be blown to bits, as will the majors. But don't just go short everything if you see it falling. It will be difficult to know whether it's the real thing, and you'll have to be in front of your trading screen at the time (unless you want to set breakout orders)


**We are seeing all the signs of a minor bubble bursting.** 

The headlines have been all about markets hitting new highs, and everybody buying stocks. That is usually a sign that the smart money has started selling their large holdings to incoming retail investors, and that a lot of the profit from the bull run has been made. If stocks start to look wobbly up here, the last ones in will be the first ones out.

Look at USD/JPY or the other Yen crosses zoomed out to 2005. The rise is absurd. I showed it to my girlfriend, who doesn't know the first thing about Forex, and she said it looked unnatural and if she had to guess, the next move would be ""down a bit"". This kind of woke me up a little - it was so obvious because the move up seems to be against the laws of nature, even if backed by fundamentals. Humans are good at pattern recognition, and even she could look at previous price action and recognize that a sharp rise like this almost never happens without a bit of falling. 

It all depends on where you bought.

For example, if you had held USD/JPY since 92.00, and you planned to hold it for the rest of the year, you wouldn't worry so much about a drop to 97 (though it would be annoying).  If you were long on a break of 100.00, you would be getting the fuck out. Your stop might be at 100, or maybe you'd locked in 50 pips. The point is that longs are now nervous, and bids will be hard to find below 100. Most people are probably prepared to take a chance buying a dip into around 100 (I know I am), but not below there. 

**Below there are stop losses. Hundreds of millions of them.** 

So that's my take on things. I'm not saying the world will end this week, but we all know that what goes up very quickly when there isn't a good reason to do so, usually comes down pretty quickly as well.

Others would argue with my fundamentals. I've seen articles saying that the rise in stocks can be attributed to companies holding on to cash reserves and paying high dividends, because they are worried that the recovery might not come. When they finally do see it coming, they will start spending that cash on growing and employing people - so maybe stocks are leading the global economy in this recovery.

**I say horse shit.** Demand has to precede supply, and right now the powerhouses of the global economy have more supply capacity than there is demand for. We have got into this situation because corporate profits have stayed very good during the last few years, but household incomes have fallen in real terms, and the average consumer is no better off, even though central bank governors are starting to say otherwise.

You and I are still earning far less money than we should be, and spending proportionally more and more of it every year as wage growth struggles to keep up with inflation, which is already low in most developed countries. Corporate profits continue to do well, but this money is not being spent in the real economy and used to create jobs.

I'm not going to go all marxist here for my last thoughts, but it is important to realise that there is a continuing and growing concentration of wealth in the hands of the few. They might say that they are the job creators, and many of them are. But for the most part they are the wealth hoarders. That money goes into things that *cause the economy to appear to be growing*, but do not actually grow the real economy - company stock, large assets, investments.

They also buy things from companies that are seeing their profits grow faster than the wages they pay. Where a dozen board executives get huge bonuses and a hundred thousand shareholders see their balance sheets grow, the people who are actually spending their portion of that company's profits (the employees) don't have any more money to inject into the economy than they did last year.

These market forces are going to collide sooner or later. Either:

* Wage growth and unemployment suddenly improves, and the middle and working classes will actually be able to provide the demand that the supply side needs to see to continue growing, or
* the middle classes will start to spend money they don't have as a result of stimulus programs, which will kick in as central banks realise that they are failing to restart economies through austerity. This will sustain the recovery and it might work, but sovereign balance sheets are already stretched ridiculously far, or 
* stocks will crash before that happens, causing a resurgence of widespread unemployment. 

I'm not saying it will happen this week, or at all. All I'm saying is that stocks are rising very quickly on not much at all. There are precedents for this throughout history, and it never ends well. When you hear hoof beats, don't think zebras.

14) Easier to use than Credit Card or Western Union, or Money Gram, etc.

15) End of Inflation.

16) It is up to THE PEOPLE (you, me, everyone) as to whether Bitcoin succeeds and brings about the changes noted above (and possibly others I’ve missed). Upon business adoption, inspires people adoption, means growth for businesses that have adopted, means jobs, means eventually governments will have to adopt for tax reasons, means transparency.

--------------------------------------------------------
Notes;

2a) Freezing accounts, messing around with funds, stealing money, lots of extra charges.

4a) Inflation is a poison and only designed to steal from the poor - re: minimum wage does not scale with inflation, production control does. The fed are already enacting plans to devalue the USD by at least 33% within 20 years (19 years now), your $1,500 is slowly losing value and will eventually be worth a lot less.

5a) What happened in Cyprus, won't happen to you, and there is no central body for the powers that be to attack and shut down.

6a) Your 'money' (Bitcoins) will be worth more in the future. Prices and quality, natural order is to go down in price and quality to go up. Enforced monopolies fight against the natural order of economy to keep prices high and stifle quality.

7a) Everyone can see how it works and what’s actually going on, and if you can’t read code, you can ask someone you trust. Anyone can contribute. If you don’t know how to code and you desperately want to, you can learn, most everything is online these days. Such ‘open arms’ do not exist in the fiat world. If your contribution is good, then it will be adopted by communal consensus (meaning that you can’t just make a change and force everyone to use it, people need to accept/download/use your contributed version. There is no ‘choice’ in the fiat world, ask Cyprus.

8a) Banks can destroy a currency if they so choose (hyperinflation), Bitcoin is immune.

9a) If politicians &amp; political parties were paid via Bitcoin, then everyone would see if they were getting bribed or abusing their position, they would be held fully accountable. A massive cut down on bank ‘fiddling’ and screwing up the global economy.

10a) This is one of the most important points. Imagine the horse &gt; car &gt; plane. Now imagine gold &gt; fiat &gt; bitcoin. It is far more transportable than gold or fiat, which means massive cost reduction.

11a) You can send your money (Bitcoins) to someone and you know they’ll get it, you can even check their wallet to know they received it, and there’s nothing no authority can do to stop you.

13a) Potentially, because of the profit from no fraud and the deflationary nature of Bitcoin. Vendors will realise they can lower their prices for Btc purchases. And when inflation ends, due to no fraud, they will still be able to have lower prices than competitors.

14a) Anyone who’s used Bitcoin to send Bitcoin to another person will agree with this point. The only people that disagree are the ones that have not used Bitcoin to send Bitcoin to someone else.

15a) In an ideal world, where sometime in the future Bitcoin gets adopted as the world primary economic 

The people do not have a choice in the fiat world, Bitcoin gives you a choice and promises many things, well, you can see for yourself with a little research that the ‘promises’ are simply fact, maths based fact.

Inflation would end. This means that prices would stop going up, energy, oil, water, etc. Prices would spiral downwards and quality would improve substantially, as these would be the only ways to retain customers. As holding an illegal monopoly would be much harder to keep going when everyone can see which politicians you’re bribing. Also, minimum wages would go up, or rather decline of prices would mean you’d slowly get more for your minimum wage (a deflationary world).

I’ll be honest and say Bitcoin is not for EVERYONE (yet). If you’re reading this thinking “But what your computer dies and you lose all your life savings! Haha.”

Then you clearly do not understand Bitcoin. And either you should go and learn more, OR, you should STAY AWAY, as your mentality along those lines indicate that you would withdraw all your fiat bank money and stick it all in your wallet, always. Which is a rather silly thing to do, and if you don’t do that, why would you ever do that with Bitcoin? Best you let the banks continue to take and look after your money.

Don’t get me wrong, moving your entire wealth into Bitcoin is a fine idea, so some say. But I definitely recommend caution, and only converting small amounts until you understand what is happening comfortably. 

And if you convert a substantial amount of money to Bitcoins - NEVER EVER store all your Bitcoins on 1 wallet, and always backup all (which is extremely easy to do).

I've probably missed some points out that should've been mentioned, feel free to add or ask questions.

-----------------------------------------------
Edit: The points and very brief additional notes are just that, points and brief notes. I hope to inspire valid questions and also to inspire you, the reader, to curiosity. Hopefully to look into why inflation would end, why the transfer ability is a massive pro, etc. It would probably take a good few pages (probably more) to go into detail on each point. This post is meant to answer some questions, inspire you to others, and encourage you to seek answers yourself.

gaming,Suggestions for Bastet to be viable,"This will suggest my ideas about how to put bastet back on the map and make her more viable and useful 

Lets start with her 1
Her 1 is Pounce which does: Bastet pounces to her target location, damaging enemies within 20 feet for 80/145/210/275/340 (+100% of your physical power) physical damage. For 4 seconds after pouncing, you can press the button again to pounce back to your initial location.
Basically this is just perfect for her at the moment . The strange thing with it is her most damaging ability 
So my thought is exchange the damage  of  her 1 with her 3 .


Her 3 is Bastet lashes her weapon, unleashing a projectile that does 70/120/170/220/270 (+100% of your physical power) physical damage and slows the enemy by 30% for 2s in an 8 foot radius.

Cost: 70/75/80/85/90 mana.
 
Also her 3 is kinda unique also because it basically works like AO 1 which hits on AOE and slows(Aoe is area on effect ) 
the problem i have with it is that it does not help on clearing lanes well  and it affects only 1 god it is very difficult to 2 targets with it almost impossible .

My suggestion to it is to make it an ability that hits all the gods/minions in it is way like Anhur 2(impale) or apollo 1
(so beatifull)
But with a major difference  it will slow 35% only the first target and 10%  slow for next target(s) 
This will help her a lot in team fights and generally in a lot of occasions 
For example in a team fight in mid she will help because she can gank then slow most of the gods retreat back and let her team clean up .

Her 2 is Bastet swipes at her enemies, causing them to bleed for 30/50/70/90/110 (+25% of your physical power) physical damage every second for 4s.

Cost: 60/65/70/75/80 mana.

Cooldown: 15/14/13/12/11 s.


The problem i have with this ability is that it is a cone 
Why? because it is not Like the cone of Kali Anubis Sun Wukong 
No it is like He-Bo Water Cannon  cone 
That leads to missing it a  lot if enemy is in front of you 
This either is a glitch or the hitbox of the cone  is so small when someone i front of you that you almost never hit it
The solution to this is simple make it a line not a huge line like her 3. 
But more like the line of Guan 2  Warrior’s Will which will help her becaue it has lager hit box which means less skill be lost compared to cone .

Her ultimate 4 is Bastet summons 3 cats that attack nearby targets for 10s, slowing them by 20% and doing 25/35/45/55/65 (+20% of your physical power) physical damage per hit. Sensing the smell of blood, the cats will attack bleeding enemies first. The summoned cats gain more health per rank 650/700/750/800/850.

Cost: 90/95/100/105/110 mana.

This unique ult has a lot of controversy about it and how it must be dealt with
many emphasize that must be a connection between  her ult and her passive (which we will get to it after this ) 
and personally i disagree.
In my opinion her ult should do this .
When she summons the cats  the cats gain a protective buff of 50% damage and Bastet gains CC Immune for the whole duration of her ult  and receive speed attack and movement speed buff .For as long as her cats are up her cc immune will be maintained for whole duration of her ult even if her cats die .
Other thoughts are  upon her ult reaches level 4 her cats become immune from all damage for 3 sec after summoned note that bastet will be able to damaged at those 3 seconds
Also her ult be more useful when she dies for example when bastet dies whle her ult is out her cats replenish all their health and get a buffed  health , damage and speed and hunt down the person who killed bastet
Other suggest such as PonPon when her cats die to gain a Cooldown reset and replenish all her mana + a speed attack and speed buff.


Last but not least her passive. Her passive is Bastet has a 25% reduced respawn time for 9 respawns
Which many say it is the worst possible passive in game . I dont really agree on that because 
it is very good at late game  and helps if you make mistakes . Nevertheless it is useful DmBrandon said that 
the passive won a tournament when a deicide was committed enemy went to Fire Giant to claim bastet re spawn quicker and was able to steal Fire Giant for team which eventually won the game 
Also many say that her passive should relate at some point with her ult i do not agree on that for reason it restrains her because she is pretty weak to begin with if you remove her  passive she would be even weaker
So i thought what cats have common and that is stealth .
A stealth passive (as i call it ) will be :Bastet is undetectable from enemy structures such as towers and phoenixs but also  from minions .Another thing is that wont be announced when your  tower or phoenix is under attack only when destroyed  it will call it 
Another thing that passive gives you is be undetectable in front of Fire Giant and Gold furry   even under ward .
But not all wards let me explain let say we have 3 wards around Fire Giant 1 left right and 1 inside Fire Giant left and right would detect her but the one that is placed inside wont detect her . That passive would be very useful to take objectives and give her the carry role that deserves .

Thank you for your time i would really like to see your answer so start typing :D 

Also this is my greatest bastet game (that still lost) 26 4  with 60 K damage

business,"Reviews by Abney and Associates, Code 85258081704 - blog.fc2","http://beatrizlopez970.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-1.html

The US Federal Trade Commission has carried out a huge international crackdown on a number of [""tech support""](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1319924-abney-associates-internet-security-news-hartford-steam-boiler-launches) scams being run out of India which have conned people in the UK, US, Canada and elsewhere out of millions of pounds since 2008.

As explained by the Guardian in 2010, the scams used [""boiler room""](http://www.good.is/posts/wordpress-reviews-by-abney-and-associates-code-85258081704) tactics, dialling through phone books for English-speaking countries. People who answered the phone were told the call came from Microsoft or their internet service provider, and that the person's computer was [""reporting viruses""](http://chirpstory.com/li/77901). The caller would then perform an unnecessary ""fix"" on the computer and charge the person for it – and sometimes sign them up to multi-year ""support"" contracts. The cost could run to hundreds of pounds.

People in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were targeted because they, like the people carrying out the scam, are English-speaking. The Guardian understands that the scam was worth millions of pounds a year to the organised gangs carrying it out.
At the FTC's request in six cases, a federal district judge froze the US assets of 17 people and 14 companies that have been accused of taking part in the operations. The FTC has also shut down 80 internet domain names and 130 phone numbers used in the US to carry out the scams.The FTC is seeking an end to the scams, and repayments for people who were conned out of money.

Though the FTC said it could not put a figure on how many people had been scammed, or how much they had lost, [Microsoft](http://nicoleturpin2012.wordpress.com/) – which has been working with the commission for the past two years to try to catch the criminals – provided data on more than a thousand people who had been scammed, whose losses averaged $875 each.

Microsoft has repeatedly pointed out that it would not call people about any problems with their computers. In some cases, the scammers would try to sell antivirus software from reputable companies, and in some cases would install new copies of Windows on a machine. However the licence key used on the software allowed Microsoft to trace it back to its buyer, which aided the investigation.
The fraud occurred in several English-speaking countries. Joining the FTC in the enforcement action were the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency. David Vladeck, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said it was working with law enforcement officials in India to catch the alleged perpetrators. The commission has also referred the cases to the US justice department for possible criminal prosecution.

Lien balance on the property is $100k, interest rate is fixed at about 7%.

Pull out some cash, ($10k-$20k) since the property comes with equity built in, and use that for whatever I please, which will probably be reinvesting into another property while in college.

personalfinance,"Help me Reddit, I can't help feeling like I'm just spinning my tires dealing with my credit rating after a consumer proposal - any advice?","I'll try to make this as concise as possible, but please let me know if I need to clarify anything. If anyone has any thoughts or advice on what to do, it would be tremendously appreciated! I live in Alberta, Canada. 

In May 2008, I was a student with unsecured credit card debt totalling $12,000. I approached a debt restructuring agency/company, and after evaluating bankruptcy vs. a consumer proposal, the agency left me with the impression that a consumer proposal was my best course of action in order to minimize my credit rating hit and have the fastest way to rebuild it. 

I agreed to repay a portion of the debt owed (I think 25 cents on the dollar) and over the course of three years, I sucessfully paid it off and was discharged in May 2011. I didn't miss a single payment, nor did I even attempt to get credit during that period. 

So here's where the fun begins! 

In May 2011, began the process of rebuilding my credit. I had a Telus phone bill at that point, and I made sure to make my payments every month in the full amount. I applied for a TD credit card that summer, and after I was declined, I applied for a $300 secure credit card from Capitol One in September 2011. 

From that point until now, I have made a significant number of financial improvements. I now have $800 secure credit on my Capital One card, and I have $500 unsecured credit as a reward for being a good customer. Imake over $80,000/yr, I have a retirement savings plan (over 15gs right now), I have over $9,000 in savings and $2,000 in mutual funds in the bank, and I have ZERO debt and practically no expenses. 

Last week, I applied for a $1,500 credit card with my same bank and I was declined. I'm not disappointed that I can't have an unsecured card, but I am disappointed that I STILL am considered a credit risk. The bank rep told me that in the explanation of declination, the lender had wrote that policy prohibits the bank from lending to clients who have been discharged from bankruptcy within the past 7 years. 

So as it stands, my credit rating as it appears on Equifax is 624 and I am not being approved for anything. 

I'm just so frustrated because I was left with the impression when I chose a consumer proposal over bankruptcy that I would be able to have rebuilt my credit within two years after being discharged (5 years after starting it), and I'm still in the exact same position as I was five years ago! 

I want to get a mortgage soon and this is not letting me! Even if I do, I will have to pay much higher interest rates than if I had never done this. 

All I want is to be financially responsible and to be able to rebuild my credit rating. The bank is now telling me it will be another 5 years before I can be considered for an unsecured credit card - how the hell am I ever supposed to move on with my life? How long will I be punished for the mistakes I made years and years ago?

Thanks for reading. Any advice, thoughts or suggestions are greatly appreciated!",finance,1369784787
personalfinance,Help and Suggestions on Auto Loans,"Intro
---
Good evening /r/personalfinance. Sorry for the throwaway account, I would rather keep this sort of information semi-private. I hope you will all be able to chime in on this topic. I know that there are a number of opinions about auto loans.

Background
---
First of all, a little bit of (potentially) useful background information. I am married, mid-20s. My wife and I do not have any outstanding debt (besides our home mortgage). We bought our first home a couple months ago. Both of our cars are paid in full. We both have very stable jobs and have money set aside in an emergency fund. I contribute 10% of my annual salary to my company 401k (company matches 7% in full) and max out a Roth IRA.

We would like to get a vehicle that has more cargo space and would be suitable for a family. We both currently have small 4-door, 4-cylinder Toyotas. Great gas mileage but not so great in the winter, taking trips, or hauling things.

I have never purchased a car from a dealership and have only purchased 2 cars throughout my life (my father purchased one car when I was 16 and I paid him back, I purchased another car from my father when I was about 19 and am still driving that car).

I would like to purchase a 2012 or newer Ford Explorer. I am looking to buy *""certified used""* and have found a low-mileage, great condition vehicle that has the features we would like. I plan to trade in my car (KBB value of $9500 retail). I think I will realistically get about $7k-8k from trade-in to the dealership. I would be comfortable putting another $8-10k down on the purchase. 

---

Questions
---
Now that the background is out of the way, here are my questions. 

1. I have asked for auto loan rates at a local credit union, Chase, and First Federal. All of these places have similar rates:
  * **Credit Union**: 2.50%
  * **Chase**: 2.85% (-0.75% for ACH, Checking w/ Chase, and current balances) = **2.10%**

1. What other costs should I expect as a part of the auto purchase?
1. How does the loan process work? Should I get approved for the loan prior to test driving the vehicle so I am prepared to make a deal and walk off the lot with the car on the same day? I feel like this would give me a bit more leverage.
1. If the car dealership can match (or possibly beat) the rate of Chase or the credit union would it be worthwhile to finance through the dealership?

I have an excellent credit rating and do not think I would have issues qualifying for the best rates available. Does anyone know of better auto loan rates available?

Does anyone have experience with Auto Loans through Chase?! I have never experienced issues in my 2 years with Chase (Checking, Savings, Chase Freedom card).


Thanks for your tips. I am really looking forward to hearing back advice on the auto purchase. I feel like financing the car would help spread the burden of the cost over 5 years instead of fronting all of the money right now. I think that this is reasonable with interest rates so low.

Everything was covered by financial aid so I was able to save up. I transferred to a four-year school this year and got enough in financial aid and scholarships to pay for tuition, rent, gas - everything without having to use my own money. Unfortunately, a couple of the big scholarships I got cannot be renewed next year.

My current situation: I have two years left at my school. I am not working right now, as I made the decision to work while at community college but to completely focus on school once I transferred. I have about $6000 saved up. No debt. Federal/state grants should cover my tuition for the next two years with a little bit left over which I plan to use for books/supplies. The problem is paying for rent. Should I dip into my savings to pay for rent or should I take out a student loan and keep my savings for emergencies, gas, groceries, phone bill, a little bit of spending money, etc.? Basically, I don't know if it's best to take out a loan now or avoid it until it is absolutely necessary. I am still applying for scholarships, but I want to have a backup plan in case that doesn't work out.",finance,1369769584
personalfinance,"Should I ""redo"" my car loan for a different interest rate?","This is basically a math question.  Here are the facts:

* I took out a car loan for ~22k three months ago.
* My current loan (with VW's finance company) is at 4.74% APR with interest compounded daily.
* My bank offered my 7.xx% (I don't remember exactly) APR with interest compounded monthly.
* The term of the loan is 60 months to keep the required payments low, but I'm making more than the minimum payments and I pay when I get paid (twice a month) rather than when the payment is due.

I'd like to find out what the difference will be, in interest paid, between these two loans, so that I can decide if I should refinance (is that the right word?) my loan with my bank.  How can I calculate it?",finance,1369768220

gaming,What I think Nintendo should do (unrealistic expectations),"Hello, I just love Nintendo, but I feel like I know what nintendo should do to become the top of the game again. Also, there is about a 0% chance that any of these would happen
1.  First off, one of my all time favorite franchises is Metroid. I just hated Other M for the fact that Samus was being too over dramatic. Also, I missed the days when there was skill in metroid. I feel like Nintendo should make a new prime style metroid game. They should also make a DLC where you play as a galactic federation soldier, in a campaign that is somewhat like a combination of Metroid and Halo.
2. The second franchise that I am going towards is Mario Kart. There are only some small improvements they should make. First off, they should add in other nintendo charactors. I would love to see Navi, Samus, Pikachu, Mr Game and Watch, and Mario race eachother. Also, there should be a track editor, and there should be free or cheap DLC levels coming out frequently, in addition to the regular game. Also, It would be cool if there was a multiplayer mode, where the gamepad player can activate hazards on the map, like moving the cars on Coconut Mall.
3. Now, I am going at Legend Of Zelda. Even though Zelda is often considered gaming perfection, I feel like there is one collaboration that should be made for the franchise. For some reason, I would want to see Bethasda, Creators of the Elder Scrolls Franchise, work with Nintendo for a Free Roam Zelda Game. To me, It would be fun if you can take an evil approch as link, and it would be cool to do something like that, going to the dark roots of Twilight Princess.
4. Kirby. Just Make Kirby Shaped Marsh mellows.
5.Wii Sports. Throw in Dream Events, and make it so certain games can be played with or without Wii Motion Plus.
6. Everyone says that Nintendo needs a ""Mature Franchise."" Everyone wants a TimeSplitters 4. I feel like Nintendo should buy the Timesplitters lisence, and start making Timesplitters 4
7. Nintendo Crossovers. For some reason, after seeing Mario and Sonic battle it out in the Olympic games. I want to see a 2D platformer that combines the universes of Mario and Sonic.
8. Finally, the one that I was waiting for, Pokemon. First off, make a game involving every pokemon region, so you can actually catch em all in one game. I also think that they should do a WII U version of the game. Also, re release all of the older Pokemon games, and if possible, make a Pokemon HD collection. Finally, it would be cool if they can make an ONLINE BASED Pokemon TCG for Wii U and 3DS.
9. Game and Watch. It would be awesome if we bring back your favorite ""Stick Figure Thingy"" in a 2D platformer, with Game and Watch style bonus levels. I also want Octopus to be the final boss.
10. Rareware. As you all know, Microsoft bought RARE, and they are creating Kinect Titles. I feel like Ninendo should buy back Rare, and get them to create system sellers, like another 3D donkey kong, another Banjo Kazooie, and finally, another perfect dark.
11. Mach Rider and Exite Bike. I want to see new Mach Rider and Exite Bike games, but with a twist. A LBP2 style level sharing community. Also, I would want to see local, lan and online multiplayer on the levels. I would love to play other people's Exite Bike levels.
12. Wario Ware. I just love wario ware, but I want to see MORE FUN GAMES, MORE OBSERDITY, an actually Usable level editor, and most of all, It would be awesome if the game feeled like a combination of Wario Ware and Incredible Crisis.
13. Nintendo Land, well, thats obvious, DLC Star Fox Game, DLC Pokemon Game, DLC Kid Icarus Game. Although this is not that obvious, this is an interesting idea. A gamepad player plays as Balloon Man, and flies within a Dart Board. The wiimote players have to try to pop his balloons. As time goes by, the darts become larger.
14. Smash Bros. Just, throw in more characters, and maps. I have always wanted to see Game and Watch battle Ezio, who is battling Batman, who is battling Simon Belmont.
15. Finally, I want to see a smash bros style game, but you can fight as any pokemon in the game. I personally feel offended that some of my favorite pokemon, like munchlax, piplup, and metapod were not playable in Smash Bros. Even though this is even more unlikely than anything else on the list, I want to see playable charactors in smash bros roster in their equivalent of assist trophies. I would want to use a samus assist trophy help me defeat Pikachu when I am playing as medapod
These suggestions are extremely out there, and it is like telling RockStar Games to create a Sesame street game, but lets be honest. Even though these are unlikely, and unrealistic exceptions, there are many gamers who would rather place a a bag of poisoned kidney stones on their head than play a nintendo game, and this would be enough to convert them over to NINTENDO. If Nintendo does at least one of these suggestion, Nintendo will be on the top again, like they are supposed to be.",technology,1369751355

personalfinance,Studying abroad for a third semester -- worth an extra few thousand dollars in loans?,"I'm 20, currently going to be studying abroad twice. I go to a rather expensive private school, but scholarships, grants, and my generous mother take off most of the load. In my first year, I took out $5,500 in federal loans and in my second year I took out $6,000. A little less than half is subsidized, a little over half is unsubsidized. I haven't gotten the new financial aid package yet, but I was told that since I won't be able to do work study, I'll probably be granted an extra $2,000 in loans (not sure if subsidized or unsubsidized). 

Doing the math, it look like I'll have about $26,000 in student loans when I graduate. My major is modern languages (French and Japanese, with a smidge of Chinese). I don't know what I plan on doing as a career. The next two semesters, I'll be studying abroad in Martinique and Senegal, but I'd like to go to Japan as well because my Japanese is at a much lower level, and I'm afraid if that I won't continue if I'm not so good when I finish school.

I've discussed it with my mom, and she's against it because of the additional costs that go along with study abroad (plane tickets, insurance, miscellaneous expenditures that come from not being close to home, etc). I'm potentially willing to take out a few thousand dollars ($3-4k) in private loans, but I realize it's not the smartest decision financially speaking. In addition to the added costs of the trip, it would also mean I'd definitely stay in school for the full eight semesters. I actually have senior standing and could graduate a semester early if I didn't go to Japan (probably a year early if I cut out Senegal). But... I don't really want to leave school. I'm not sure I would graduate early even if I didn't go because I really love my school (even if the amount of time I want to spend abroad makes it look like the opposite!), and I'd like to graduate with my friends. But admittedly, it would save me $7,000 in loans and ~~$10,000~~ $5,000 of my mom's money.

So, /r/personalfinance, do you think the experience is worth the additional costs? Or should I put Japan on hold?

Edit: Oh, and I guess I should add that I have no other debts. I also don't have a car, though, so that's probably a purchase I'll need to make when I graduate. I do have a credit card that I've been using very regularly for two years and never had a late payment on, so (so far at least!) I've been pretty good at controlling my spending. I have about $1000 right now, and will be doing a paid internship from mid-June to the end of August.",finance,1369738299

THE London [market](http://communities.ptc.com/thread/42934) continued to defy gravity yesterday as the FTSE 100 Index  closed at its fourth-highest ever level.
The blue-chip index added another 48.2  points to close at 6803.9, gaining 0.7% to  reach a level not seen since December 1999,  when the dotcom boom drove the FTSE to a  record close of 6930.2.
A recovery in mining stocks added to  central bank-induced euphoria, as investors  move out of government debt and into  riskier assets such as equities.

Source:  [Blog Artcode 34935207158 NIG](http://www.dailypost.co.uk/incoming/marks--spencer-among-ftse-4002310)

The FTSE 100 surged past landmark levels  set in 2007 and 2000, as [comments](http://syosset.patch.com/groups/announcements/p/newport-international-group-article-reviews--instagram-mode) from the  US Federal Reserve suggested the world’s  biggest economy may yet see more quantitative easing (QE).


The London market was also given a  boost by strong US retail sales figures pointing to more signs of optimism in the country’s vast consumer sector.
Alex Young, senior sales trader at CMC  Markets, said investors are showing an “impressive appetite for risk assets”, despite the  FTSE’s meteoric rise.
But the pound fell to a seven-week low  against the dollar and struggled against the  euro after weaker-than-expected UK inflation raised the [prospect](http://communities.ptc.com/groups/newport-international-group-nig) of more quantitative easing by the Bank of England.
Lower prices at the petrol pumps pushed  inflation down to 2.4% in April from 2.8% in  March, which economists said gives the  Bank more scope to expand QE. The pound  was worth 1.52 dollars and 1.17 euros.
Retailer Marks &amp; Spencer was among  the risers, gaining about 6%, even though  annual profits fell to their lowest level in  four years due to a slump in clothing sales.  Underlying pre-tax profits for 2012/13 were  £665.2 million, a fall of 6% on a year earlier  but in line with market expectations.
Analysts were also comfortable with forecasts  after chief executive Marc Bolland  reported a steady start to the new period.  Shares were 27.4p higher at 467.9p.


Outsourcing giant Capita made strong  gains after striking a 10-year deal with  mobile phone group O2, worth about £1.2  billion over its lifetime. The deal builds on  an existing long-term tie-up with O2 and  will see Capita run and manage its call  centres. The revenue upgrade sent Capita’s  shares surging 6% or 56p to 1005p.
Home emergency business Homeserve  was the biggest winner on the FTSE 250,  despite setting aside £6 million to cover a  potential mis-selling fine from regulators.


Shares gained 10% or 23.2p to 250.2p on  investor relief that the boiler repair firm  does not expect a bigger penalty from the  Financial Conduct Authority for a  mis-selling scandal. The Walsall-based company also cheered investors with strong  international expansion and heavy cost cuts  in the UK, including about 700 job losses.
P&amp;O cruise company Carnival was the  biggest faller on the FTSE 100, slumping 6%  or 143p to 2267p, following a profits warning. The US-based firm slashed its full-year  guidance due to weaker-than-expected revenues yields and higher costs.


The biggest risers on the FTSE 100 were  Polymetal International 52p ahead to  669p, Marks &amp; Spencer up 27.4p at 467.9p,  Capita 56p ahead to 1005p and Burberry  gaining 78p to 1541p. The biggest fallers  were  Carnival, off 143p to 2267p, Arm Holdings  down 31p to 1065p, Royal Bank of Scotland down 9.7p to 342.2p and British Land  down 15p to 643p.",finance,1369707934

personalfinance,Buying a used car from a dealership vs buying from a private seller.,"I got hit by another driver who was determined to be at fault, and her insurance company declared my car a total loss, and will give me cash value for it. I plan to apply this to the purchase of a newer car than I had (it was on 03 corolla)

Assumptions:

-I'm a good negotiator. With a private seller, I would be requiring that they have their car inspected by a mechanic of my choosing. I would try to get them to agree to a price in between the private party value and the dealership trade in value, but would settle for the private party value. With the dealership, I would offer 200 over the wholesale price, and accept about 500 over, including the doc fee and any other bs they want to tack on. And if they try and start talking about what monthly payment I want, I will not fall for it.

-I have a good credit score, and would qualify for 1.5% used car financing from PenFed CU. My reason for financing instead of paying cash is opportunity cost. My money should be earning more than 1.5% invested in an index fund. However, this will probably mean I have to take out collision and comprehensive on my insurance, which will cost more.

Is there any reason it would be worth it going to the dealer? Variety and convenience are the only reasons I can think of, but I'm not sure at what premium that will come.",finance,1369859957

I'm not saying it's THE low, but it looks to be a short term low, maybe good for another bounce.  Recent comments on the wires from some Fed guy seem to have helped things along.

**UPDATE** Before I even finished this post, the dollar stopped looking healthy again. I'm still in these trades, and I still believe these supports will hold, but use your discretion. Note that these are all small positions (risking around 0.25% of my account each) as I realise they are all USD exposed.

Here are the trades I've been looking at today, and the ones I just got into. There is still time if you like the look of them, but wait for a bit of a dip.

**USDJPY 2hr chart:**

This one's a bit of a gamble as we've had a hard time cracking resistance and there are sell orders stacked above it. Target is only 102 - not shooting for the moon here. Stop at around 100.55. To confuse the new people, I trade on two platforms and on two accounts sometimes. So where the trade isn't obviously shown I have marked it with dashed lines.

(Green is entry, red is stop, blue is target)

I bought here yesterday and it worked out well. Don't ask about the -13.8 pips.

http://i.imgur.com/sjvB2hE.png

**USD/CAD** 4hr chart

This one's a bit overcooked, but I'm willing to take a punt on another 80 pips or so. I do quite like the break of the major resistance, and now we're coming back to test it.

Not liking my trade right now so I don't know about this one.  1.300 is probably a better entry if we get there.

http://i.imgur.com/JrEk1Mh.png

The purple line just above my target is a fibonacci expansion. I don't use them often except when a trend is in uncharted territory. It helped me trade EUR/JPY from 120.80 to 130, so I quite like them now

**GOOOOOLD** (XAU/USD 15m)

At resistance again. Worth a short down to $1376 maybe.

http://i.imgur.com/akgSjVC.png

UPDATE: Check out this wedge, 2hr chart: http://i.imgur.com/8qVoC7z.png. 

I quite regret being in a short that is underwater right now, because it's looking like taking another serious run at $1400 and I will be stopped out. That's what you get for spending too much time staring at short term charts. There probably isn't the momentum to crack $1400 right now, but you never know. My stop is at $1405


**USD/CHF 2hr:**

Loving this pair right now. Fallen out of bed a little bit, but we're at support and my strategy is to buy in an uptrend when we're at support, so this is an exercise in sticking to the rules really.  Hoping for a repeat of yesterday's performance.

http://i.imgur.com/UZhhsG5.png

**GBP/USD** 4hr chart

Chart's a bit of a mess, but the pink fib is the recent downtrend and the grey fib is the big down move earlier this year.

0.23 fib level of the recent down move, the day's high more or less, also lines up with the 0.23 fib of the larger countertrend rally (not shown on chart)

personalfinance,HDHP &amp; HSA - Too good to be true? (Possibly significant savings for young &amp; single professionals),"I'm 25/M, extremely healthy and fit.  I've been on my mother's incredible health insurance, but since I'm turning 26, I will need to enroll in my own.  I'm starting a new job (on the day I turn 26 no less), and have been looking at my options.

Originally, I was just looking at the traditional low deductibles, co-pay, PPO health insurance plans.  Someone suggested looking at HDHP, so I've begun doing some research.  

* My Agency will pay 85% of premiums for my health plan.  As an example, the total monthly premium for the Aetna HDHP is $415 and $4,980 annually.  I would have $747 deducted from my paychecks annually.

* Now if I understand this correctly, on some (maybe all) a portion of the premiums paid are passed through to a tax-deferred vehicle called a HSA.  The Aetna plan I've cited says $62.50 will pass through monthly to the HSA.  $750 of my premiums will pass through to the HSA annually. 

* So before Medical expenses, I'm actually netting $3 in profit?  If I was using a traditional health insurance plan with the same premium amounts, I would simply be paying and losing the $747.  

* Under this Aetna plan, preventative care like physicals are 100% covered before meeting the deductible.  Prescription drugs have only co-pays, and I dont need to meet the deductible for those wither.  

* So if I'm healthy and never need to go to doctor for illness, I'm saving $740 a year plus interest?  On top of that I can save more money by avoiding federal tax on amounts I can contribute to the HSA up to the limit?

* Am I missing something?",finance,1369850736

William K. Black, author of THE BEST WAY TO ROB A BANK IS TO OWN ONE, teaches economics and law at the University of Missouri Kansas City (UMKC). He was the Executive Director of the Institute for Fraud Prevention from 2005-2007. He has taught previously at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin and at Santa Clara University, where he was also the distinguished scholar in residence for insurance law and a visiting scholar at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. Black was litigation director of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, deputy director of the FSLIC, SVP and general counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, and senior deputy chief counsel, Office of Thrift Supervision. He was deputy director of the National Commission on Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement. Black developed the concept of ""control fraud"" frauds in which the CEO or head of state uses the entity as a ""weapon."" Control frauds cause greater financial losses than all other forms of property crime combined. He recently helped the World Bank develop anti-corruption initiatives and served as an expert for OFHEO in its enforcement action against Fannie Mae's former senior management.

PAUL JAY, SENIOR EDITOR, TRNN: Welcome to The Real News Network. I'm Paul Jay in Baltimore. And welcome to this week's edition of The Black Financial and Fraud Report with Bill Black, who now joins us from Kansas City, Missouri.

Bill is an associate professor of economics  and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. And he's the author of the book The Best Way to Rob a Bank Is to Own One.
Thanks for joining us, Bill.

BILL BLACK, ASSOC. PROF. ECONOMICS AND LAW, UMKC: Thank you.

JAY: So I guess you've been following the Apple tax cases or issue.

BLACK: Yeah. So Senator Levin continues to do virtually the only real investigation being done in the United States of the elite entities. And he has summarized this as Apple achieving the holy grail of tax evasion, which is that Apple has succeeded in creating the stateless corporation that makes literally tens of billions of dollars and pays taxes to absolutely no one. And at the hearing that was just conducted, it turned into a love fest for Apple instead of a crackdown on this behavior, with even Levin holding up his iPhone and giving them a free advertisement about what a great product it was and how he loved them. And then Ron Paul attacked the Senate for how dare you criticize Apple for evading taxes.

JAY: Ron Paul or Rand Paul?

BLACK: I'm sorry. Rand Paul.

JAY: Right. And so what was it that Apple said that won them over? I mean, why bother to have them come testify if it's going to turn into this love fest?

BLACK: Well, what they said was it's all your fault and we had nothing to do with it. And, of course, that's completely untrue, because it is the corporate lobbyists that have created this tax. And so they ended up with this really wonderful example of chutzpah, which is if you get criticized for paying virtually no taxes, your proposal is: let's reduce U.S. tax rates so that they're virtually nonexistent. And this is called repatriation, when you bring these profits home.

Now, these profits are really home, but they're not home in the United States in a taxable fashion. So they would bring them home in a taxable fashion, but only if, they said, the tax rate for this kind of corporate income tax was reduced to single digits. And we did this before at the behest of the largest U.S. corporations, and there was a study done, and it found that when they brought these sums back for taxable purposes under a special repatriation legislation, 92 percent of the money went to corporate buy-backs of stock. Now, that's designed to increase the stock value so that it will increase the value of the senior officers' bonuses that are largely paid in stocks and to dividends and to direct executive compensation. And the same study found that there was no increase in jobs from all of this.

personalfinance,Economic refugee (US to Asia) looking for advice,"US citizen here.  Post college I seemed to really have it together. From 2001 to 2008, I worked in various HRIS administration and consulting roles and climbed the corporate ladder, saved aggressively for retirement and invested savings in stocks, bonds and real estate.  I held a few positions and also did some contracting work in the field of Human Resources doing system administration.


In 2008 I lost my job and then was unable to find work.  I looked for two years but somehow could not seem to find ANYTHING.  Perhaps I made job search mistakes but I couldn't find work of any kind in the U.S.  After two years I gave up.   I moved to Asia where I found a job teaching English.  I did this a while to make ends meet but then returned to the US to try give my career another shot.  I searched for several months but could not get an interview. No luck.


I'm back in Asia now teaching English part time and again just making ends meet.  This isn't a sustainable life plan long term for me.  I'm only making enough money to just pay rent and keep myself fed so I'm really looking for some solutions how to rejoin society.


It seems my long term unemployment has made me untouchable for positions of my previous caliber.  And I've tried ""lower"" positions including waiting tables, fast food, retail, and it seems these companies weren't interested in hiring someone that's previous position was a  high paid consulting gig.   I really need to find some way to re-enter the game and am looking for suggestions.


For now I'm still in Asia so I'm looking to either find some ways to generate a bit of income on the side and fund my retirement or a reasonable plan to return to the US (or any country for that matter) and start over.  I'm pretty flexible but I just need some ideas or plan.   I still have savings left that are probably enough to survive one year without working but then I'll be near bankruptcy level.


tl/dr stuck in Asia and need a plan to find a career or way to make money.  Somehow I can't solve this problem so I need some advice on figuring out my life.

Financials:  My annual salary is approximately $12,000 US working part time.  It's not a lot but you can survive on that(barely) here in Asia (Taiwan).  I'm working only 14 hours a week so I have significant free time.   I could potentially invest $20,000 to $30,000 for the right opportunity.",finance,1369811516

Great Lakes - 1 loan @ 4.5%, 2 @ 6.8%

Mohela - 2 loans @ 2.39%, 1 @ 6.8%

investing,Idea's to play the imminent rise in rates,"we've heard it all - equities are on crack. cheap money (low risk free rate) has sent equity values sky rocketing. Yet, all economic indicators remain flat. we're going through a jobless recovery... and companies have a record amount of cash they are afraid of re-investing into their firms.

it's only a matter of time before the fed slows the pace of bond buying. next they will stop the pace of bond buying. and eventually they may sell all their bonds. this may take a long time, but when it happens, many expect all asset prices to drop.

if you're a long only investor, how do you play this? here are some of my ideas... and problems with my ideas:

1) buy mortgage IO strips. they have negative duration. except i have no idea how you would go about buying them. and i dont think a fund like this exists

2) buy china - MCHI - there is a slight negative correlation with us interest rates. our rates go up, the dollar strengthens, we buy more chinese goods. except i think china is in for a hard landing.

3) buy inverse ETF's. but the longer rates dont rise, the more money you lose.

I've been doing a lot of research online, and I have some offers for lending, but I'm struggling with a few questions and hoping you can help me:

(1) Any thoughts on the suitability of the offers I'm being extended?

Almost all of my stats are extremely positive (stellar credit, consistently high salary, no debt aside from student loans). The only down side is that my downpayment - $60,000 - is between 10% and 13% of the expected value of the house, since houses in the area where I'm planning to live typically go for $450k-$600k. I know about mortgage insurance, 80/10/10 mortgages, etc., and I expect to have the second 10% paid off in less than a year.

Given that background - I'm getting offers in the range of 3.9%. That's higher than I'd expected, given the current low rates and my status as a very low credit risk.

Am I right to think that I might be able to do better? Or should I take the 3.9%?

(2) Some lenders have offered a 0.1-0.2% bump in the interest rate in exchange for vastly reducing closing costs. That seems appealing for my circumstances: I'm planning on spending about five years in this house, throwing tons of cash into the principal, and then possibly moving elsewhere. Thoughts?

(3) Any tips on picking a lender? If I decide to settle for 3.9, I'll likely have several choices of lenders in that range. Should I be applying any particular process to choose among them? Does it matter that much?

(4) Any other tips for reducing closing costs, etc.?

12 grand in student loans to the provincial and federal government (which I don't have to start paying back yet)

3 grand in the bank account (mostly left over from student loans, scholarships, money saved up before went to university + money from current job)

1997 4-Runner that was given to me as my grad gift. Looking to sell it since its bad on gas and I'd rather just buy a car for around maybe 3 grand that doesn't have any problems and is better on gas. Have been offered by one of my parents 7 grand for it since they said they can use it.

Finished first year of University back in March, lived in residence which as you can imagine cost a lot. Failed out of basically all my classes because I didn't focus or buckle down before important tests. Haven't even bothered with reapplying to that University because I know they won't let me back in. Or probably any university for that matter now.

My mother had me apply to a post secondary polytechnic institute for this fall that a couple of my friends are going to. And I am in the waiting line for a few courses (no chance of getting in this fall though..) but they were all courses that I will never get into because of my GPA from my first year of university and she just seems to be ignoring that fact. If it was just based off my highschool marks I might have a chance. 

Basically its a tug a war between her and my dad because the courses she's trying to put me in will end up with me getting a job up north in the Oil-sands where she works which is what she wants. Big money, shitty working conditions, shitty people. My dad on the other hand absolutely despises the oil sands because he spent time working up there and basically disagrees with everything she is trying to do.

Currently living at home with one of my parents, plan on moving out soon and staying with 2 friends for $400 a month. Have a job at a local sports bar where I make $9.75-11 hour plus tips which varies (sometimes up to $150 a week).


So basically I have just a few questions (if you need more info please post and I'll try to help out as best as I can)

Should I sell the 4-runner and use the money to buy a new car and start paying back my student loans?

Should I choose to move out with my friends? Really hate living at home right now and would rather live in the city where my work is, then living just south of the city

* I make $180k per year salary. No bonuses. I do have some equity in the company but lets assume that isn't a factor.

* I am 30

* I am not married but live with my girlfriend. She makes much less than me so I only ask her to contribute to utilities/food. 

* I own a home. I owe about $160k, pay about $2k per month (with taxes) and will have it paid off in 12 years at the $2k payment. I just refinanced to an interest rate under 3% so I don't feel a large urgency to pay it off quicker. I like my house so probably won't look to move until I have a couple kids.

* I have about $20k in student loans. My rate is 2% so again I don't feel an urgency to pay it off. 

* I have an older car that works fine and is paid off. I've been considering buying a new car for about 6 months now mostly because I can but haven't yet because I'm not particularly excited about cars.

* I have ~$100k in a 401k from a previous job.

* I have ~$120k in the bank (with fairly low interest rate). They are separated like this: ~$50k emergency cash fund, ~$40k new car fund, $20k retirement fund, $10k checking, $7k vacation fund

* My current company does not offer a 401k. I've been putting $1.5k into the retirement savings account per month in place of a 401k until I figure out what to do with it. I don't know if there is any appropriate retirement options for me or if I should just invest this and not touch it.

* Based on my spending the last couple of years, I figure I'll have an extra $50k per year at my current salary to put towards either retirement, investments, savings or a large purchase such as a car

Only other factor is that since it is a start-up, it is hard to guarantee that I will continually be able to make this salary so that biases me to be more conservative and save more. 

I know it is time to start figuring out what to do with the retirement savings and also start investing excess cash more wisely but am not sure what exact moves to make.

personalfinance,Insuranced. FML.,"So here's my situation. I have a job as an office administrator, $14 an hour in south Alabama. I'm the only full-time employee at my office so as opposed to offering group benefits, they reimburse me for an individual policy because they can't get a group plan for one employee. 

My wife was laid off at a bank in November, where we had insurance previously, so I had to apply for a private family plan, and it's coverage began on Jan. 1, 2013. 

We weren't trying, but my wife is pregnant and due on Dec. 21. 

As it turns out, our insurance policy doesn't offer maternity coverage for 12 months. Also, our income level is at about 150% of poverty level, so we can't qualify for Medicare in the state of Alabama. We qualify in every other state around us, because most states have a poverty threshold in the range of 185-200%. But Alabama is set at 135%. Alabama hates poor people, btw. 

Obamacare is going to prevent these maternity waivers (as I understand it) but that doesn't kick in until 2014. Also, we would have qualified under the PCIP high risk plans, but they ran out of funding in March and Republican's are blocking any attempts at renewing funding through the end of the year. We've fallen through a crack. 

As I see it, there are very few options that will provide maternity insurance:

1) Quit my job and go on Medicare until after the birth of my child. I have a very low cost of living $550 mortgage, low utilities, cars paid for, but only about $3k in savings account. My wife gets $200 a week in unemployment. I won't be eligible for unemployment because I work for a church (wtf?) We have about $30k in a 401k that I could take from if it was the difference in being homeless and making it. I would also be looking for under the table cash work everywhere I could to stretch our money. 

2) Find a job with a group insurance policy as those usually offer immediate Maternity Coverage. However, the job market is not going that great and there's no guarantee I can find anything. I've already started attempting to find a second job that offers part-time employees full benefits, but there just aren't many of those. I know UPS does this, but they're not hiring. 

3) I've thought about seeing if my job would cut my pay to a level that would qualify us for Medicare, but I really don't think they would go for that because they're afraid it would look suspicious. 

I've looked at the pay ahead options at the hospital, but that's going to be $6-7k up front and will not cover any other incidental fees that will be billed at the full pre-insurance marked up rate. If it is a complicated pregnancy / c-section / premature we could end up owing over $100k easily. Midwife is also not an option as they are illegal in Alabama. 

I'm trying to think through this, and I'm frustrated because I'm generally very responsible and take good care of our finances. Our savings are usually much higher, but my wife has been out of work for 6 months. 

Does anyone have any advice or analysis of my options to help me make a better decision? Anything I'm not seeing here that could help us out? Other federal programs or foundations that help with this? 

TL;DR I need a way to get maternity insurance for my wife but Alabama hates poor people.",finance,1369935930
personalfinance,Advice getting back on track,"Back in 2005, I was a consultant working freelance via an S Corp.  The freelancing ultimately failed a couple of years later, and I ended up in dire straits with a condo that went into foreclosure, two credit cards that went to collections and a huge tax debt that ended with a federal tax lien.  Since then, I brought my house out of foreclosure, and have had a clean, on-time record for about 15 months now.  That tax debt is about to be totally paid off (in about 5 months) and it's going to be a huge boost to my take-home pay (an increase of $1500 a month).  My goal is to purchase a new home next year around this time (12 months from now), and rent my current condo.
 
Since last year, I have been working hard on getting everything ready for that goal.  Making all my monthly payments on time, building credit with a secured credit card, and putting a little each month away into savings.   My question is, what else can I do to achieve my goal?  I check my credit report every once in a while and I still see the adverse information, but I think that will be there the required 7 years.  Another thing is that I applied for an AMEX SkyMiles cards to see what they would say, and it returned saying that I had something similar to bankruptcy (which I interpret as the lien).

personalfinance,Need advice on recovering after shit hit the fan and what to do with small inheritance.,"**Us**: I'm 26 with my MA in psychology and several years experience as a research assistant at a top institution. My partner of eight years is 26 with a bachelor's in psych and is back in school at a local community college for computer science; he's a very talented programmer. Once he has his associate's he plans to transfer to the local state school for comp sci. I have about $30k in federal student loan debt and he has $9k in the same, plus $3.5k credit card debt. Neither of us have savings (excpet my small inheritance described below).

**Backstory**: He lost his job as a web developer when the startup he worked for collapsed in the summer of 2012, leaving me to take over paying for nearly everything until he found a job at another startup in December of 2012. This completely wiped out my meager savings. Startup #2 abruptly imploded a month after he started working there. We held on as long as we could, since I still had a low-paying but secure job, but we were forced to move back in with his family in another state in March 2013. 

**Current situation**: He started work three weeks ago at a large corporation, making about $47k. I was hired yesterday by a chain restaurant at $8.50/hr (will find out number of hours/week soon) in the kitchen and recently came into a $12k inheritance. We are living with his parents rent-free but would obviously like to get our own place ASAP. Rent here would run us $700-1000/month. Nearly all of our shit is in storage and is costing us $150 a month.

I could easily get a better-paying job but I want to give my passion for culinary arts a chance; I can't see myself staying in research and feel like I've wasted enough time there. I have this to fall back on, if needed.

I have a Vanguard 403b with a few thousand in it and empty Vanguard money market and mutual fund accounts. 

Now that you know our circumstances,  here are our questions:

What should be done with the inheritance money? We want to use some for first and last months' rent and the security deposit on an apartment. I also want to keep a little on hand for emergencies. Should I dump the rest into my student loans and his credit card debt?

Would it be smarter to use this money differently? Maybe allocate it all to his credit card and my student debt?

My wife and I have both been out of college for about 3 years now, and we're starting to get a little bit of extra money in our checking account.  Our only debt is our student loans and our mortgage.  Our credit cards get paid off every month.  

I have a student loan of about $4400 with a 6.5% interest rate that I put about $200 on a month ($100 required, $100 extra), and my wife has a student loan of about $9000 that's deferred for 2 more years because she's going to grad school while she works.  Our house loan has about $60000 left on it at a 4.99% interest rate.  I pay about $700-$800 a month on it ($500 required, $300 extra).

My question is this: should I work on paying off that debt first by using our discretionary funds every month and paying extra like I do now, or should I start taking that extra money and putting it into a general investment account or a CD or some other form of savings?  I know sometimes people prefer to think of low-interest loans as a way to make more money, but I don't know if the rates on these are low enough to consider that or not.

- Job 2 (Work Study @ a call center): 24hrs a week @$8.00 an hour. Pays every other Friday. I will have this job until December, when I graduate.



**My problem:**


I have an associates in History from a community college, was going to transfer to a larger 4 year institution (Bowling Green State University if it matters) to get a BA in History, then go to a second 4 year institution for my Masters in History. I wanted to Teach at a Post-Secondary level.


However, when it came time to make the jump to the first 4 year institution I had a massive panic attack and bailed out on my plan. Between the cost, my girlfriend leaving me, living alone...and being alone in a large house, having debt because of my wisdom tooth extraction and then sinking into a deep state of depression - I decided to stay at the Community college and get an Associates in Networking and Information Systems Support.


After getting slung on meds that didn't work, I moved home and stopped taking the pills. Fast forward 7 months and I'm doing great, much better than before.


Now, I want to go back to my desire to teach. 


I was going to go to the 4 year institution and get either a degree in History (and follow the original plan) OR get a BA in Education and teach Social Studies at a High School level. Either way, I would be happy with what I would be doing. A positive to teaching high school is that the Federal Government has loan forgiveness if you teach in a low income district for a certain period of years.


I believe I am reaching the limit for my federal student loans as an undergraduate, and would have to take a loan from a third party (like Discover Student Loans) to pay for the education.


I have also considered joining the Peace Corps after graduation from a 4 year institution, to give back to the world.


Any advice is welcome, please help!



**TL:DR**: $31,500 in debt, have two associates, want to teach, need to get a BA, might have to get student loans through third party.

I remember putting the game in a class of its own. ""It's hard! I really have to work for this."" I thought. This was something I hadn't experienced before in my gaming. Since then, I've bought and played every Western release of the title, and (up until now) I have had very few words of complaint.
Fire Emblem: Awakening What happened? Why? How could you do this? First let me say that despite everything I still have enjoyed the game thus far but at only a fraction of the potential. I was okay with having the option to turn off permadeath. It made sense for selling to a larger audience; I could keep playing unaffected. I paused when I saw that gone was the option to rescue units, but I thought it was a reasonable trade-off for trying this new pairing up mechanic. I was a little miffed when I realized that mounted units couldn't finish their move after attacking, but ultimately the feel of Fire Emblem remained the same.
But what I cannot abide is the pay to play DLC that allows you to mindlessly farm gold and experience. Yes, farm. Replay able maps where the enemies don't attack you and have either tons of gold or give a whole level's worth of experience. It sickens me. It takes all the meaning out of finishing the game. Fire Emblem is not a grinder. The random events on the world map are different. You can only ""farm"" them as much as you can ""farm"" a story mission. They're a challenge and there are only so many.

personalfinance,Excessive Student Loan Forbearance [Advice Needed] (x/p from r/studentloans),"I need some advice from someone who is well versed in the policies/laws regarding excessive student loan debt forbearance.  Here's my situation.

I have $~55k in federal student loan debt (and another $~15k in private loans, but that's another frustrating story/rant).  My federal loans are currently held by two different servicers: Mohela and Nelnet. My loans are about to come out of unemployment deferment and I have been trying to apply for forbearance.

My loan payments would currently total about 30% of my current income. So, that's well over the 20% required for [Student Loan Debt Burden Forbearance.](http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1214SLDB.pdf) I submitted all of my paperwork showing my monthly income and my Nelnet loans to Mohela, but they have denied my request for forbearance.  They said that they only look at loans that they service when determining eligibility (like any of us can help who is our loan servicer, they keep getting sold all over the place!).  Even though the form explicitly states:

&gt;To qualify for forbearance on your loan(s):
(1) The monthly payments due on **all your Title IV loans** must be equal to or greater than 20% of your total monthly income. (2) You must provide your loan holder with:
(a) Documentation of the most recent monthly payments due on all your Title IV loans (e.g., copies of monthly statement or repayment schedules); and (b) Documentation of your most recent total monthly income from all sources (e.g., copies of current tax return, pay stubs, W-2 forms, dividend statements), unless you do not have income.

The link that I have provided is from the Dept. of Education's website, but Mohela hosts the same form on their website with the same verbiage.  I have spoken to them twice this week about this matter and have been trying to stay polite/level headed through all of this, but they don't seem to know/understand what their paperwork states.

I recently started working for the state, my pay isn't great (especially for having a MFA) but the benefits exceed the monitory income.  My plan is to forbear the loans for a year while I finish paying off my car, consolidate them and apply for IBR and PSLF.  I know to qualify for PSLF, I can't default on my loans.

So, I guess my question is what do I do about Mohela not wanting to honor the Student Loan Debt Burden Forbearance?

Unemployed for a year and I'm racking up more and more debt.,"About a year ago, I was laid off at the company I worked for due to the department not making enough money. I was the newest addition to the company, so they let me go first. This was literally a week after I had bought my first car, because I was getting somewhat good money from the job. So, after I was laid off... I claimed unemployment for 8 months, which helped me pay minimum payment for all my bills. I finally got another job but I quit after 2 months, due to the company paying me minimum and treating me horribly. Everyone would tell me that stress is a normal part of the working life, but I would come home aching in chest pain, have vertigo sometimes, and wouldn't be able to walk from the anxiety of it all. Since I quit, I cannot claim unemployment now and I have been using my credit cards to pay for everything.

Here is my problem. My credit cards are almost full and I literally don't have the money to pay for any of them. I have no job (I apply to 5-10 jobs a day), even after applying to McDonalds, Costco, Macy's... shitty jobs are my only option since the only experience I have is 6 years of retail customer service and 1 year of administrative. My girlfriend wants to help with the payments but she's already taken too much care of me and I feel too guilty to let her. My parents can help but since they barely make a living, having bought a new house, it really takes a toll on them. I'm trying to find whatever job I can, but right now my only option is to keep trying to sell what I own for money.

I've tried going to my federal credit union bank to ask for a consolidation loan, but since I have no job and my credit score has gone down, they will not approve me. My credit card debt is up to $8,000. I just need to put it all together and have a steady payment for the next few years. I think I can manage that.

I will have $26-28k  in savings after our down payment, closing and furnishing the new place. I make $50k a year, and my only debt is to my dad for school-- $14,000 with no interest. She makes $38k and only has 1 piece of debt-- about $9,000 left for her car.

My monthly net income is about $2,800, which leaves me about $1,200 a month after giving 5% to a company-matched 401(k), paying $250 to my school loan, and covering off all of my expenses (mortgage, health insurance, gas...everything.) My one other major expense in the next 12-18 months will be a car (I plan to spend $10-12k.)

Should I take some savings and throw it at the mortgage? Should I keep all of my savings and accelerate paying on my half of the mortgage payments to save on interest? (Yes, we are contributing equally) I'd like to keep $20k in the bank so I can keep a $10k emergency fund AND pay off my eventual car purchase ($10-12) in cash when the time comes.

I do not have a Roth, but I have a matched 401(k) at 5% that has a current RoR of 12% (I know this return won't last forever.) I am pretty debt averse so I am leaning towards paying the new condo off ASAP since I have decent savings and a reasonable 401(k) contribution.

Liberty Reserve, et selskap som opererte en av verdens mest utbredte brukt digital valuta tjenester, angivelig behandlet minst 55 millioner ulovlig transaksjoner for minst én million brukere over hele verden tilrettelegge globale kriminell atferd. Nå, en [undersøkelse](http://struddlejeash.deviantart.com/journal/voting-six-times-Hendren-Global-Group-News-Revie-367141251) og takedown antas å være av største internasjonal hvitvasking påtale i historien, som involverer loven håndhevelse handlinger i 17 land.

En tiltale har belastet Liberty Reserve og syv av sin principals og ansatte med penger hvitvasking av penger og opererer en ulisensiert pengene overfører virksomheten. Liberty Reserve påstås å ha hatt mer enn en million brukere over hele verden, inkludert mer enn 200 000 brukere i USA, som har utført ca 55 millioner transaksjoner – praktisk talt alle var ulovlig- og hvitvaskede mer enn 6 milliarder dollar i mistenkt utbyttet av forbrytelser inkludert kredittkortsvindel, identitetstyveri, investering svindel, computer hacking, barnepornografi og narkotikahandel.

Fem tiltalte ble arrestert på 24 mai 2013, inkludert Arthur Budovsky, den viktigste grunnleggeren av Liberty Reserve, som ble arrestert i Spania; Vladmir Kats, medgrunnlegger av Liberty Reserve, som ble arrestert i Brooklyn, New York; Azzeddine El-Amin, leder av Liberty Reserve finansielle kontoer som ble arrestert i Spania; og Mark Marmilev og Maxim Chukharev, som hjalp tegning og vedlikeholde Liberty Reserve teknologisk infrastruktur, som ble arrestert i Brooklyn og Costa Rica, henholdsvis. To andre tiltalte, Ahmed Yassine Abdelghani (Yassine) og Allan Esteban Hidalgo Jimenez (Hidalgo), er på frifot i Costa Rica.
 
I tillegg til de kriminelle kostnadene brakt i tiltalen, fem domene navn ble beslaglagt, nemlig domenenavnet til Liberty Reserve og domenenavn til fire exchanger nettsteder som var kontrollert av ett eller flere av tiltalte; 45 bankkontoer ble behersket eller beslaglagt; og søksmål ble arkivert mot 35 exchanger nettsteder søker beslag av vekslere domenenavn fordi nettsteder angivelig ble brukt til å lette Liberty Reserve penger hvitvasking konspirasjon og utgjør egenskapen involvert i hvitvasking av penger. Fire pengevekslerne som har domenenavn ble beslaglagt, i tillegg til 35 pengevekslerne som har domenenavn er undersåtter av handlingen sivile tap, var alle vekslere som utførte [business](http://videoixir.com/izle/8374587/latest-hendren-global-group-fact-reviews.html) med Liberty Reserve, og ble notert på Liberty Reserve nettsted som ""forhåndsgodkjente vekslere,"" Ifølge påtalemyndigheten.
Etterforskningen og slå ut involvert rettshåndhevelse handling i 17 land, inkludert Costa Rica, Nederland, Spania, Marokko, Sverige, Sveits, Kypros, Australia, Kina, Norge, Latvia, Luxembourg, Storbritannia, Russland, Canada og USA

I en koordinert aksjon annonsert US Department of Treasury og dens økonomiske forbrytelser håndhevelse nettverk at Liberty Reserve har vært nevnt som en finansiell institusjon av primær hvitvasking bekymring under § 311 i USA PATRIOT Act. Denne handlingen inneholder et varsel til Federal Register foreslår å forby dekket amerikanske finansinstitusjoner fra åpning eller opprettholde korrespondent eller betales-gjennom kontoer for utenlandske banker som brukes til å behandle transaksjoner som involverer Liberty Reserve.

I henhold til påstandene i siktelsen, sivile tap klagen og andre dokumenter som er arkivert i føderal domstol:
 
Liberty Reserve ble innlemmet i Costa Rica i 2006 og opererte digital valuta ofte referert til som ""LR."" Mens selskapet fakturert seg som Internetts ""største betaling prosessor og penger overføring systemet"" serverer ""millioner"" av mennesker rundt om i verden, inkludert USA, ikke på noe tidspunkt har selskapet registrert med US Department of Treasury som en pengene overfører virksomheten, som kreves av loven.

Budovsky, den viktigste grunnleggeren av Liberty Reserve, regissert og overvåket dens operasjoner, økonomi og corporate strategy. Kats, en av grunnleggerne, hjalp drive selskapet frem til 2009. Den daglige driften av Liberty Reserve var administrert, til forskjellige tider, av Hidalgo og Yassine. El-Amin administrerte ulike finansielle kontoer som er kontrollert av Liberty Reserve, mens Marmilev og Chukharev var først og fremst ansvarlig for å utforme og vedlikeholde selskapets teknologisk infrastruktur.

Tiltalte opprettet, strukturert og operert Liberty Reserve som en kriminell bankbetaling-prosessor som er designet for å hjelpe brukere med å gjennomføre ulovlig transaksjoner anonymt og hvitvasking av utbyttet av sine forbrytelser. Det dukket opp som en av viktigste overførings ombud brukes av cyber-kriminelle rundt om i verden til å distribuere, lagre og hvitvasking av utbyttet av ulovlig aktivitet. Selskapet vokste til et økonomisk knutepunkt av nettkriminalitet verden, tilrettelegge et bredt spekter av online kriminell aktivitet, inkludert kredittkortsvindel, identitetstyveri, investering svindel, computer hacking, barnepornografi og narkotikahandel. Liberty Reserve ble brukt mye til ulovlige formål, fungerer som banken valgfrihet for den kriminelle underverdenen fordi det ga en infrastruktur som aktivert cyber kriminelle rundt om i verden til å gjennomføre anonym og untraceable finansielle transaksjoner.
 
Tiltalte også beskyttet kriminelle infrastrukturen til Liberty Reserve av, blant annet, å lyve for anti-hvitvasking myndigheter i Costa Rica, og later til å stenge ned Liberty Reserve etter å lære selskapet var blir etterforsket av amerikanske politi. De fortsatte å drive virksomhet gjennom et sett av skall-selskaper, og flyttet titalls millioner av dollar gjennom selskapet skallkontoer vedlikeholdes i Kypros, Russland, Kina, Hong Kong, Marokko, Spania, Australia og andre steder.

For å bruke LR valuta, hadde en bruker først å åpne en konto via Liberty Reserve nettsiden og gi grunnleggende identifikasjonsinformasjon. I motsetning til tradisjonelle banker eller legitime online-prosessorer, Liberty Reserve ikke forlange brukernes å validere sine identiteter. Brukere etablert rutinemessig kontoene under falske navn, inkludert åpenlyst kriminelle navn som ""Russland hackere"" og ""Hacker konto."" Som en del av undersøkelsen, en rettshåndhevelse agent åpnet og henrettet transaksjoner via en undercover konto på Liberty Reserve i navnet til ""Joe Bogus"" og adressen ""123 falske Main Street"" i ""Helt gjort opp City, New York.""

Når en konto ble opprettet, kan brukeren utføre transaksjoner med andre Liberty Reserve-brukere. I disse transaksjonene, kan brukeren motta overføringer av LR fra andre brukeres kontoer og overføre LR fra hans eller hennes egen konto til andre brukere, inkludert enhver ""selger"" at akseptert LR som betaling. Liberty Reserve betale en én-prosent avgift opp til maksimalt $2.99, hver gang en bruker overført LR til en annen bruker via Liberty Reserve systemet. For en ekstra ""personvern fee"" på 75 cent per transaksjon, en bruker kunne skjule sin egen Liberty Reserve kontonummer ved overføring av midler, effektivt gjør overføringen helt untraceable, selv innenfor Liberty Reserve allerede ugjennomsiktig systemet.

Hvis du vil legge til et ekstra lag av anonymitet, gjorde Liberty Reserve ikke tillate brukere å finansiere sine kontoer ved å overføre penger til selskapet direkte gjennom en kredittkort-overføring eller på andre måter. Brukere kan også ikke overføre midler fra sine kontoer direkte. I stedet, Liberty Reserve brukere ble pålagt å gjøre noen innskudd eller uttak gjennom bruk av tredjeparts ""vekslere,"" som aktivert selskapet å unngå å samle inn informasjon om sine brukere gjennom banktjenester transaksjoner eller annen aktivitet som ville forlate en sentralisert økonomiske papiret stien. Budovsky, Kats og El-Amin eies og drives av visse Liberty Reserve exchanger tjenester.
 
Liberty Reserve nettstedet anbefalt en rekke ""forhåndsgodkjente"" vekslere, som tendens til å være en ulisensiert penger overføring bedrifter som opererer i land uten betydelige statlige penger hvitvasking forglemmelse eller forskrift, som i Malaysia, Russland, Nigeria og Vietnam. Pengevekslerne belastet transaksjonsgebyrer for sine tjenester som var mye høyere enn avgiftene belastet av mainstream banker eller betaling prosessorer for sammenlignbare pengeoverføringer.

Hvis du vil aktivere videre bruk av Liberty Reserve for kriminell aktivitet, tilbudt dens nettstedet en ""shopping cart grensesnitt"" at ""selger"" nettsteder kan bruke til å godta LR valuta som betalingsmiddel. ""Handelsmenn"" som aksepterte LR valuta var overveldende kriminelle i naturen. De inkluderte smuglere av stjålne kredittkortdata og personlig identitetsinformasjon, peddlers av ulike typer online Ponzi og bli-rik-fort ordninger, datamaskin hackere for leie, uregulert gambling bedrifter og underjordiske narkotikahandlende nettsteder.

I tillegg til som brukes til å behandle betalinger for ulovlige varer og tjenester på nettet, ble Liberty Reserve også brukt av cyber-kriminelle å hvitvaske kriminelle inntektene og overføre midler blant kriminelle associates. For eksempel Liberty Reserve ble brukt av kredittkort tyveri og computer-hacking ringer opererer i land over hele verden, inkludert Vietnam, Nigeria, Hong Kong, Kina, og USA, til å distribuere utbyttet av disse konspirasjoner blant medlemmer som er involvert.

Tiltalte var godt klar over at Liberty Reserve fungerte som en ulovlig organisasjon for hvitvasking. I en chat på Internett mellom Kats og Yassine som ble tatt til fange av politi, Kats eksplisitt beskrevet Liberty Reserve aktiviteter som ""ulovlig"" og bemerket at ""alle i USA"" som ""DOJ"" vet ""LR er [a] hvitvasking operasjon som hackere bruker.""

Liberty Reserve; Budovsky, en borger av Costa Rica som bor i Nederland; Kats, i Brooklyn, New York; Yassine, Costa Rica; Hidalgo, Costa Rica; El-Amin, Costa Rica; Marmilev, i Brooklyn, New York; og Chukharev, Costa Rica, belastes hver med ett tilfelle av konspirasjon for å begå hvitvasking av penger, som bærer en maksimal periode på 20 år i fengsel, ett tilfelle av konspirasjon for å drive en ulisensiert penger overføring business, som bærer en maksimal periode på fem år i fengsel, og drift av en ulisensiert penger overføring business, som bærer en maksimal periode på fem år i fengsel. Vilkårene i fengsling gjelder de personlige tiltalte.

Bitcoin,Bitcoins Are Just the Worst Idea Ever,"Unless you are a Winklevoss twin or are still trying to hide your Internet credit card purchases from your wife, chances are you have already decided that Bitcoins are largely irrelevant to your life and aren't much use except as a talking point for a nerdy, 20-something's tumblr. The Web-based currency has littered mainstream news throughout 2013 -- from ""what exactly is a Bitcoin?"" to ""Largest Bitcoin exchange already proving to be a giant failure."" But it may be this most recent event that has the largest implications for the anonymous, government-defying Super Mario coins.

""You just don't get it""
If your first thoughts upon reading my opening paragraph are that I am naive and probably had to have this article transcribed by someone literate, then I suppose time will tell. But for those who are also skeptical -- i.e., nearly everyone who isn't directly involved in funding the Bitcoin revolution -- let's examine the latest reason that this is a giant pile of e-nonsense.

As fellow Fool Dan Newman pointed out in his piece on the virtual currency, Bitcoins have had a decent run this year -- to the tune of 1,200%. As of this writing, the currency is worth a little less than $130. What that buys you, other than carefree adult entertainment, I'm not sure. Perhaps there will soon be a Bitcoin Redemption Center, where for 1,000 Bitcoins you have the choice of a Styrofoam helicopter, a stuffed Pikachu doll, or a sharing-size box of Everlasting Gobstoppers.

But seriously, don't be enticed by the undeniably awesome run-up of Bitcoin valuations. Because, as with Magic: The Gathering cards, when some vague entity in a cellar or Bitcoin exchange releases the latest guidebook on values, your virtual currency could be worth, well, what it's worth in the real world -- absolutely nothing.

Think I'm being hyperbolic? Here are plenty of reasons.

Plenty of reasons
As most know by now, the largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, is in the government's crosshairs to the degree that regulators have frozen many of the firm's financial accounts. It's not because there was a big expose or because Mt. Gox did something with criminal implications; Mt. Gox simply didn't file the right paperwork. Mt. Gox claimed that it had set up an account with Wells Fargo in May 2011 as a money service business. And when asked on the questionnaire whether it dealt or exchanged in money for its customers, the firm answered, ""No.""

Now, I hate paperwork as much as the next disorganized person, but if you are creating the currency of the future, you should probably let someone know (via paperwork) that you are, in fact, creating the currency of the future.

This week, Costa Rica-based online currency transfer business Liberty Reserve was busted by the feds, who alleged that the firm was responsible for a $6 billion money-laundering scheme. Federal prosecutors said the firm had become ""a financial hub of the cyber-crime world, facilitating a broad range of criminal activity. ... Liberty Reserve does not require users to validate their identity information.""

Similar to Liberty Reserve, Bitcoin allows users to spend real money on these untraceable, unidentifiable units. Even if we do find out that Bitcoin is more trouble than it's worth, there's no one from whom to seek restitution. Bitcoin was fathered by an invisible man who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. No one really knows who he is or what his real name is.

Do you ever get that message from John St. Crucible, the missionary from Nigeria who uses far too many articles in his requests for $70,000 sent via Western Union to the Church where he works? Check your spam -- I guarantee you he thinks your investment will pay off in the millions within two weeks. This is the same league.

The truth is, we know nothing of what goes on at Bitcoin headquarters. We know that people like Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss -- two man-children who, had they invented Facebook, would have actually invented Facebook -- are major backers of the currency. We also know that if you lose a life while playing Mortal Kombat, your $129 Bitcoin can probably buy you another.

Please, Fool reader, do not be intrigued by the Pig Latin of currencies. There are vast amounts of publicly traded companies that make stuff and earn cash by selling it. It may be traceable, but that's because it's real.

“iClickPoint is a sophisticated presentation builder and slide library management system for PowerPoint®  content” says Roj Prasad, creator of iClickPointTM and CEO of Web Epoch, the parent company to iClickPointTM.  “Our product makes the building, storage and sharing of presentation slides literally as easy as the click of a button,” Prasad adds.  

“There are more than 500 million Power Point users across the globe using Power Point to create powerful presentations for their sales forces,” says Prasad.  “In one particular company, you can find hundreds of individuals creating presentations across many different locations.  iClickPointTM stores those slides in the Cloud so that others may have immediate, direct access to already produced and already approved slides.”  According to Prasad, iClickPointTM users save a tremendous amount of time otherwise wasted creating slides that were already developed by someone else first.  

The advantages to using iClickPointTM for slide library management are many.  First, an entire deck of slides can be uploaded in seconds and available instantly to everyone in your company. Second, individuals can view all slides in the library and then drag and drop the slides they choose to build a specific presentation in mere minutes.  “Before iClickPointTM, people would have to email slides or presentations one at a time because the files were so large, or FedEx the files,” said Prasad.  “But when you use iClickPointTM, anyone who has been given access can access the library with one click and start building their presentations immediately.  iClickPoint has the easiest user interface of any slide presentation product currently available,” added Prasad.",technology,1369990636

business,Hass and Associates Internet Security Information: Cybersecurity's best bet,"http://garcianic001.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/hass-and-associates-internet-security-information-cybersecuritys-best-bet/

During the first 40 years of the Internet, security has been about patching mistakes that have been made in its architecture and software and defending these vulnerabilities against attacks from the outside. The future will be about creating an environment that is secure by design and has the ability to anticipate rather than merely respond to threats, government and industry experts say.

This will not be a single secure infrastructure, but an ecosystem of technologies designed to better handle the basic chores of systems development; identity management and access control; and monitoring, analysis and response.

The Internet was not designed to be secure. When originally launched by the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, it was not intended for public use. As it grew, development has always been more about what could be done with it rather than what should or should not be done. 
Today the Internet has become integral to the economy and security, while cybersecurity has become a front-page issue and observers see the need for fundamental shifts in the way we secure it.

 “This does not mean perfect security, but instead a model that evolves and learns from change, whether process, technology or threat related,” said Art Coviello, executive chairman of RSA.

“We have a tendency to talk about the threat, and there’s not a lot we can do about that,” said Ron Ross of the National Institute of Standards Technology, who heads the implementation program for the Federal Information Security Management Act.

Good cybersecurity hygiene is important, Ross said. That means covering the basics of knowing your systems, understanding and managing their configurations, and ensuring that the proper defenses are in place. “But we need to go beyond that and make a difference in architecture and engineering,” he said.

personalfinance,Paying off student loans advice.,"Here is what my student loans look like. 

Loan A - 
Interest Rate: 5.6%
Outstanding Balance: $5,285.29    


Loan B - 
Interest Rate: 6.8%
Outstanding Balance: $2,289.77


Loan C - 
Interest Rate: 4.5%
Outstanding Balance: $5,265.74


Loan D - 
Interest Rate: 6.8%
Outstanding Balance: $2,158.94


Loan F - 
Interest Rate: 6%
Outstanding Balance: $4,329.97


How should I be paying these off? Do I work on paying off the ones with the highest interest first even though they are of a smaller amount?

Also, I've been thinking about going back to school and get my masters. Could I still apply for FAFSA even though I still have these loans to pay off? or will I have to go straight to a bank and get loans that way? Is getting a master given my financial situation a good idea or should I just focus on work and get the loan payed first?

Thanks.",finance,1369971307
personalfinance,small step -- just paid down $743.83 in cc debt,"Its a drop in the bucket but I just paid off two small credit cards that I had... Leaving only one.  Negotiated the interest rate down a bit but it is still HIGH at 17.4 percent... $3000 dollars to go then I'll have all my CC debt paid off... Then it's time to pay off $56,000 in student loan debt.  Small step but I feel really good after making those payments.",finance,1369967559
personalfinance,Advice needed: Engineer facing a mountain of debt,"In 2010, I graduated with an MS in engineering and have been working in my field ever since. For a single man in his 20's, I earn a decent salary (~70k, depending on bonuses), but I have several high-interest loans where less than half my payments are going towards the principal. Here are the specifics - I have:

-40k in Stafford/Grad PLUS loans (~6% interest). Minimum monthly payment is $560.
-36.5k in private loans (7.5-12% interest). Minimum payment is $441. Recently, I applied to refinance this loan, but even with my parents co-signing, I did not qualify for a lower rate.
-50k in private loans with another lender (~5.6% interest). Minimum payment is $333.
-22k in a car loan (2.1% interest). Minimum payment is $390.
-Total loans: 148k at various rates
-15k in my 401k
-5k in the bank

My monthly finances are pretty straightforward. I earn $3,850 per month. After fixed expenses, I only have about $600 left to save or spend (note: this is before any ""fun"" spending). When I bought my car, I was amazed I qualified for such a low rate. I have flawless credit, but as you can tell, my debt-to-income ratio is not very strong.

My question is: what are my options? I've consolidated the loans that I can, but I'm not convinced that 12% is the best rate someone in my position can get. Is my best bet to go with conventional wisdom and pay as much as possible into my highest interest rate while making minimum payments on my other loans, or can I do better? Frankly, I'd be willing to pull from my 401k if such a move could be financially justified.


As a side note: I'm single and renting now, but someday my dream is to get married and raise a family in a house I own. I am extremely ambitious and may soon qualify for promotions/raises at my current company, but please gear any advice towards my current state.

Thank you in advance!",finance,1369966412
personalfinance,Question about refinancing my mortgage,"Wife and I purchased our home 14 months ago. We did 10% down on an FHA. We both have Tier 1 credit and locked in a 30 year FRM at 3.75%. Because of the FHA insured loan, we pay $308 a month in Private Mortgage Insurance which we can't eliminate in less than five years, even after we hit 20% equity. Since we bought the house, it has appreciated approximately 6% (according to Zillow) which, in conjunction with 14 months of payments has brought our equity up to 17.5%. 

We are looking into refinancing into a private loan with no additional cash being put in. The advantage would be that our PMI would drop to ~$100 a month until we hit 20% and then we can eliminate it entirely. The loan that seems to make the most sense for us is a 10/1 ARM. The interest rate for the initial 10 years would be ~3% so we immediately lower our interest rate 3/4 of a point. We lower our PMI by $200 a month and should be able to knock it off entirely in a year or so with appreciation and another year's worth of payments. Obviously the key is whether we plan to still be in the house in 10 years and I think it is about 90% that we would not be. It seems to me that the only situation in which this will backfire is if we stay here for more than 10 years without selling, and are unable to refinance for less than 6% in the 9th or 10th year AND the rates are high enough to max out the variable portion at 8%. 

Am I missing anything? Are there any considerations I'm not thinking of? I know the closing costs are a factor, but they are about $4400 and we would save more than that with the re-fi within the first year. I welcome any and all perspective.

Thanks.",finance,1369965443

Bitcoin,Why libertarians are such huge fans of bitcoin,"I'm a long time libertarian and it is a daily occurrence for me to be misunderstood.  

I found this video to be absolutely profound, and I honestly don't believe I've ever used that word to describe anything before.  Even though for me it was preaching to the choir so to speak, I found myself captivated as I took in a very articulate and well thought out explanation of libertarianism. 

He explains what libertarianism is, Austrian economics, and monetary policy.  It was specifically the monetary policy that inspired me to make this post.

investing,The next big short,"we've heard it all - equities are on crack. cheap money (low risk free rate) has sent equity values sky rocketing. Yet, all economic indicators remain flat. we're going through a jobless recovery... and companies have a record amount of cash they are afraid of re-investing into their firms.

it's only a matter of time before the fed slows the pace of bond buying. next they will stop the pace of bond buying. and eventually they may sell all their bonds. this may take a long time, but when it happens, many expect all asset prices to drop.

if you're a long only investor, how do you play this? here are some of my ideas... and problems with my ideas:

1) buy mortgage IO strips. they have negative duration. except i have no idea how you would go about buying them. and i dont think a fund like this exists

2) buy china - MCHI - there is a slight negative correlation with us interest rates. our rates go up, the dollar strengthens, we buy more chinese goods. except i think china is in for a hard landing.

3) buy inverse ETF's. but the longer rates dont rise, the more money you lose.

any good ideas out there??",finance,1369959859
