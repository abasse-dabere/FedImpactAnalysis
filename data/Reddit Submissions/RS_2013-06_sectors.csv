personalfinance,"Married, 2 Income exemption questions","So my wife has recently started working again after being unemployed since February of 2012, and we had our second child in June 2012.

I'm wondering what the best way to split up (or combine) our tax exemptions will be to maximize our paycheck and minimize owed taxes at the end of the year.

Last year my wife claimed unemployment for 9 months ($14,500, no taxes deducted) and I made $47,772.  With 9 federal exemptions and 4 state exemptions our combined total taxes owed were ~$600 federal and ~$400 state.

This year I will be making $60,000 and my wife will be making $36,000 base with expected commission BOE of an additional $19,000 for $55,000 total income.

This is the first time that I've dealt with two incomes and two dependents so...I guess just looking for some general tax advice.

personalfinance,"Young, but want to keep track of spending habits/finances somehow. How to do this? Details inside.","Hi there,

I've been here a couple of times before, but if you don't know any of my previous posts that's cool. Basically, I'm 18 years old, headed off to college in exactly 90 days from now, taking out minimal loans...life is pretty good. 

I haven't got much money, but I want to be responsible about my finances. At this point in my life, investing is kinda a bad idea because I need to have access to my money (much of it is going to textbooks and other school/life expenses), so there isn't much to do. One part of that, though, involves keeping track of where my money goes. These spreadsheets that folks have made (that can be found on the sidebar) are really amazing, but the problem is almost none of it applies to me. I have no monthly bills besides my credit card bill, no financial responsibilities (besides paying for anything I want outside of basic needs), no regular salary (hourly part-time job, hours are steady soon but can vary wildly), and irregular (but responsible!) spending. In other words, it's pointless to draft a monthly budget or use a fancy spreadsheet. I also am sitting on a decently sized nest egg of checks/cash that I got for graduation, and since I don't plan on depositing all of it I'll also want to account for that as well.

I don't really have a good system to keep track of how I spend, but I want to start one now. All I do is balance my checkbook once every month or two, and only get receipts when I pay in cash (which isn't often). I've been whipping out my debt card very often lately for small purchases, but the frequency at which I do it leads me to believe that I'm spending my way into oblivion (I'm not). So basically, bad habit-forming.

So what do y'all suggest I do? I was thinking a very simple spreadsheet that just lists how much money I make per paycheck, and where I spend it/how much I spend, plus listing my balance. I'm not very savvy with spreadsheets so that's about all I know how to do (but I want to learn how to do more!). Also, any other financial advice about accounts (what is this I hear about high-interest savings accounts?) and other personal finance jazz would be greatly appreciated. I know that at this point in my life, I should focus more on enjoying life and getting the most out of what little I have, but it's still smart to start good habits early on, right?

Anyways, here's what I've got:

* 18 years old
* $2000 in bank account ($1300 checking/$700 savings - $25 transfer to savings a month to avoid fees/to save in general)
* Bank is Citizens, interest rate on savings is .03% (...unspeakably atrocious.)
* Debit card, AU on dad's credit card (ironically denied for the exact same card when I applied on my 18th birthday...bad move)
* $2500 in graduation money
* ~$100/wk at job (going up to $150-200 this summer), taxes automatically withheld
* Will have max work study ($1250/semester) in college


tl;dr: 18 years old, unsteady finances, unsteady/irregular income, but wants to keep track of habits. How do?

I'm making $6000 a month, and I need help filling my W4.

With the IRS W4 Calculator I got this....

&gt;Based on the information you previously entered, your anticipated income tax for 2013 is $802. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $0 withheld for 2013 leaving $802 due when you file your return. You should adjust your withholding on a new Form W-4 as follows:
For the only job you entered (which has a projected salary of $18,000): 

&gt;8 allowances.


&gt;

&gt;Check the “Single” box on your Form W-4
Assuming this recommendation is in effect for the rest of 2013 your expected refund should be about $125. Following this recommendation will ensure that the amount withheld from your wages will cover all of your projected tax liability while minimizing your refund. 

Is this correct? Am I only really going to be taxed $802 out of my salary? I thought the income tax at my income bracket was 15%. I know as a Canadian Citizen I am except from certain taxes, but not federal income tax. Am I supposed to withhold any money from my pay cheque?

As what we have observed, identity theft is on the top where individuals get so interested. In fact, identity theft is the fastest growing crime in America, affecting on the average of 500,000 new victims each year, for the past decade. And so, we are glad to discuss this for you to be well- informed and have preventive measures, such as reducing and reporting scams and prosecuting scammers. These topics are followed by:

-online security and hardware concerns;
-earning money from legitimate work-at-home programs and work-at-home scams;
-credit cards and consumer issues;
-Nigerian and lottery scams;
-viruses and spyware;
-phishing scams;
-investment scams; and
-urban legends.


Obviously, many subscribers are interested in knowing out about new scams in these areas. This seems quite related to what we have been writing about. With all your exciting and terrific questions, Scam Busters will become even better. Today, we’ll answer five of your biggest questions about identity theft:

Answers to Our Subscribers’ 5 Biggest Identity Theft Protection Questions

1) How big of a problem is identity theft and how long does it typically take to recover it?
With victims’ losses amounting to about $1.1 billion a year, identity theft reached the top of FCS’s yearly list of consumer complaints for seven years in a row. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) estimates more than the average victims that devote 170 to 300 hours trying to recover his or her identity and to resolve theft-relates issues.

More than 110 million people in the US reported since January 2007 that have been packed letters from the different government branches, universities, corporations, banks, medical professionals, credit unions, no non-profit organizations and others notifying them that their personal information had either been stolen or lost. (Check out more statistics at our Identity Theft Information Centre where you can protect and recover your identity from violators.)


2) Is it necessary to have identity-theft protection? 
Based from the survey we have conducted, 98% of respondents do not currently place fraud alert on their accounts like clockwork every ninety days and are not yet subscribed to LifeLock or one of their competitors) and that they should instead spend the money and have it done for them.

We found out that 19% of our respondents said that they used a company such as LifeLock to do these services for them. And, 83% of the remaining respondents said they NEVER place a fraud alert or security freeze on their accounts, although most recognize how important it is. Only about 2% actually place alerts regularly! The rest do it occasionally or rarely.

So, why does almost no one actually place these alerts for themselves? The reasons mentioned included that it was very difficult, they were too busy or things came up.

So, to answer many reader requests for more information about the two most popular identity-theft protection firms — LifeLock and TrustedID – we will focus on whether this protection is right for you. We will also look at which services you will receive from each firm, and for how much.

finance,Sales of New Homes Boost 1.5%-magcloud,"http://www.magcloud.com/browse/issue/576171

hendren global group news blog, Hendren Global Group: Top Facts
Sales of new homes accelerated up to 1.5 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted yearly rate of 417,000, another verification of a sustained housing upturn at the launch of the spring buying season.
Sales of new homes exceeded February’s pace of 411,000, though they were below January’s 445,000 — the fastest rate since July 2008, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
The 700,000 pace is considered healthy by most economists but new-home sales are still below the said pace yet the rate has increased 18.5 percent from 352,000 a year ago
Majority of the economists spot more boost ahead, as housing is probably to remain a constant driver of economic growth this year.
Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said, “With increasing signs of a softer U.S. economy springing up in the spring, we can take comfort in the resilience of the housing recovery.”
More Americans are encouraged to buy new houses due to stable job formation and near-record low mortgage rates. The increase in demand is helping to elevate sales and prices in most markets. Lavish prices are more likely to make homeowners feel richer and spur them in spending more.
Another reason why sales lift prices is due to a limited supply of both new and previously occupied homes.
The inventory of new homes for sale amplified 2 percent in March, to 153,000, the second successive gain. Still, that’s the equivalent of a 4.4-month supply at the current sales pace and historically lean, according to Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
The median price of a new home is 3 percent higher than a year ago, it rose to $247,000 in March.
The March sales gain came from a 20.6 percent increase in the Northeast and a 19.4 percent rise in the South. Sales fell 20.9 percent in the West, where problems of supply have hampered home buying. Sales were down 12.1 percent in the Midwest.
According to the National Association of Realtors, sales of previously occupied homes dipped in March from February. Still, sales were 10.3 percent higher than a year earlier.
The association mentioned low supply as a ground sales fell in March. Nevertheless in a positive sign, the inventory of formerly occupied homes augmented for the second straight month. That proposes more sellers are positive that the revival will carry on and they can sell at a good price. While low inventories have helped drive more construction of new homes.
In March, home builders began work on more than one million new houses and apartments at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. This is the first time the number had crossed that threshold in nearly five years. That reflected a surge in volatile apartment building.
After reaching the fastest rate in nearly five years, single-family home construction fell in March.
Yet, one of several constraints is a low supply of homes for sale, it could limit sales. More than six years ago the housing bubble burst and since then banks have forced tighter credit conditions and mandate larger down payments. As a consequence, it became harder to first-time homebuyers to qualify for the low mortgage rates that made the Federal Reserve’s efforts to ease credit.

the avanti group article prcode81345782170 TAG
ALBANY, Ga. — Beverly King on Briercliff Lane received a phone call from a stranger recently. She said the man, who spoke with a heavy Indian accent, informed her of a virus infection in her computer but he was ready to fix the problem.
 “He told me his name was John Anderson and that he worked for Microsoft,” King said. “I didn’t believe that for a minute, but he was very insistent and almost demanded that I turn on my computer so I could see what he was saying. He got upset when I wouldn’t do it.” 

King said it obvious to her the whole thing was a scam. She knew already that Microsoft “never makes cold calls about computers.” She was right. Microsoft states repeatedly and in many separate sources that they never call people about their computers.
Other Albany residents have reported receiving similar calls.
Almost certainly, King was the intended victim of an international “boiler room” scam originating in India. According to consumer information issued by the Federal Trade Commission, tens of thousands of people have been convinced to pay for needless “fixes” for malware or virus infections.

This is how it works, says the FTC: Organized scammers scan English-speaking phone books for likely victims. After getting their prospects to the phone, the scammers first claim they’ve detected malware on the prospects’ computers.
Then, according to an October 2012 article in “theguardian,” victims are directed to a program in their computer called “Event Viewer,” a standard part of the Windows operating system. That program displays logs of events occurring on the computer, sometimes with the label of “Warning” or “Error” which in fact have no significance to infection or the smooth running of the computer. the avanti group article prcode81345782170 TAG.

personalfinance,Question about buying a first home,"Hi /pf,

I thought I would ask this here (let me know if there is somewhere more appropriate, /r/RealEstate seems more focused on investment and this is mostly about the financials).

Thanks to this sub I am nearing the end of being in cc debt (about another month to go) and I am beginning to wonder about buying a home. Currently my fiance and I rent (total rent is 1315 + utilities and insurance) and I have used a few rent vs buy calculators and it seems like buying would be a good idea (especially since prices in my area (Portland, OR) are beginning to rise).

My question is about down payments, FHA, and interest rates. Currently I dont have a down payment (all of my money has been going to debt) so that seems to severely limit my options/make it impossible to get a loan.

I know there are some loans out there that are insured (I guess the term is FHA) that require a lower downpayment (3.5% is the lowest I have seen) but I have also found at least one that does not require a downpayment. 

Long story short I want to know what the best course it. Should I:

A) Look at a loan that will cover 100% of the cost of the house and not cover insurance but has a higher interest rate (5.505% APR). This would result in a payment of around 1400/month (less than 1/4 of our income) and we can make it pretty easily. We would probably refinance down the road to lower the rate.

B) Work on getting a small down payment for a lower interest rate loan that may require insurance.

C) Keep renting until we have a full 20% dp so we have a lower interest rate and no required insurance. 

I dont have any idea how much insurance costs (I'm fairly new to all of this so I apologize if this is something simple I should know) so I dont know if having a interest rate that is higher would be offset by the need for insurance. 

Thanks for the advise on this (and if you have any good (and easy to understand) resources on buying a home I would appreciate any help!).",finance,1370301768

personalfinance,"24 years old, Law school student with poor credit","Got my 1st and only credit card when I was 18.  Maxed out in a couple of months, went to collections, no credit card after that.  I probably have very poor credit.

I currently take out loans for school.  My loan disbursement is on June 24th.  However, my rent (about 1100) is due June 10th.  I cannot figure out how to get this money.

Options not on the table or already exhausted:
1--no relationship with parents or any other relatives to speak of.  I most likely cannot get this amount of loan from friends.
2--Most likely cannot open a credit card or get a personal loan due to my poor credit and because I was not employed for the past year (ABA rules prohibit 1st year law students from working)
3--I have contacted the school to ask if they could help me figure out a solution but they can't do anything since federal law prevents them from disbursing GradPLUS loans before the start of the summer session.  I could apply for a private loan and reject the GradPLUS loan but that process will still result in a disbursement date of June 24th.
4--I currently have no credit cards so I can't charge the rent to anything and pay it off later.

I have a Federal Stafford Loan at 6.8% interest.

My plan is to fully invest in the ESPP, sell off completely the day I receive the shares. Take that full amount and put it toward the loan. The way I see it, the ESPP is a guaranteed minimum of a 15% ROI, leaving me 8.2% ROI after the student loan is factored. And the interest on the student loan is tax deductible.


Am I missing anything? Looking for validation that the plan is sound, or any suggestions as to things I may be missing.

personalfinance,What should I pay off next?,"See the following Excel spreadsheet for my debt. You can download it and play around with the payments and formulas if you want, I have some pretty nifty financial formulas in there that calculate interest and payoff times.

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1WwKWbUNdzJNTdBOEpieEVQWGM/edit?usp=sharing

I just paid off a ~$7,000 high interest student loan that was a no-brainer to pay off first. I can throw an extra $800-$1000 at my debt per month most months. Having trouble deciding what to hit next.

The ""MOHELA"" loans are federal stafford loans serviced by the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority. *I typically think of it as one loan*, although it is actually four individual loans as seen on this spreadsheet.

I am having trouble deciding what to pay off next. I can see an argument for any of the loans.

-Federal Loans - highest interest rate, but they also come with more protections and are more likely to work with you if you're in trouble. Plus deferment for grad school. Grad school may be on my radar, but maybe not, and honestly I'd probably rather pay off the loans first anyways. It's just something to think about.

-Car Loan - lowest balance, secured debt. I could pay off the car and then they can't take it if I ran into trouble.

-Citi Loan - although it has a low interest rate it is VARIABLE which concerns me a little. (**Side question: should I be worried about it increasing? I think it is Prime or LIBOR + XX%, so I suppose it wouldn't randomly jump up to double digits or anything, but I'm not sure.**) And of course it is huge, and a private student loan, which don't have the best reputation. This loan scares me frankly, and I dislike it more than the other two.

I was thinking of doing the car next, because it's the lowest balance (from Dave Ramsey), but I can see all sides of this. Wanted to get reddit's opinion.",finance,1370274628

personalfinance,Pay off car or credit card?,"Been debating what should be more important. 

I have had my car for almost 3 years now. Interest rate is 2.9% and I have ~$13,500 left to pay on it. Minimum payments are $450/mo. 

I've had some money issues with my house over the past year and was living on my own. Needed new appliances because the house didn't have any, replaced my AC system, ect. I've racked up $24,500 on my credit card at 8.9% interest. I'm paying about $130.00/mo in interest alone. 

I had a motorcycle at 0.0% interest with $7,400 left to go, but with the credit card in that kind of shape I sold it last month, which was tough for me. 

My fiancé moved in last month and we are splitting house expenses now, which really helps out. I had my credit card over $15,000 years ago and payed it back to zero, so I get sick to my stomach that my credit card is where it is. Her dad is helping big with the wedding so our wedding costs will be low, not too worried about that. 

Question is should I focus of paying my car off over the next year and then focus the extra money on my credit card, or should I split it up? I am basically thinking I have an extra $600/mo to focus on one or the other. Refinancing or selling my car are both not an option for me.",finance,1370265727

Bitcoin,No inflation in spite of QE explained.,"OK, in the bitcoin econ forum there is currently a post again bemoaning the delayed fulfillment of the inflation prophecy based on the fact that so much money has been printed in the US.

First of all let me say that the prophesy is even more delayed in Japan. There the government has been printing money for a very long time and they actually have active deflation. 

This post is for ""Austrians"" who want to understand the phenomenon and defend sound money practices. 

So what gives?

Here is the basic truism of money supply =&gt; price inflation dynamics: If the total amount of money in circulation increases by some percentage, given that the goods and services have remained static, then inflation will occur proportionately to the increase. 
In other words: 

Inflation = Increase in total money - Market Deflation. 

Market deflation is the result of improvements in all areas of the economy that are caused by competition and result in price decreases.  

So why don't we see it in the US or in Japan? Simple, the total amount of money has not yet increased significantly.
Let's compare Japan's M3 and their inflation experience to South Africa's M3 and their inflation experience. 

The only period I have data for comparison is April 1998 to March 2009. There is probably more, but given I don't understand Japanese its a bit hard for me to locate. 

So if we compare how much total money was in circulation in Japan in Jan 1999? 

597,529,200,000,000  Yen 

How much was in circulation in Dec 2008?

741,710,100,000,000 Yen

How much did M3 increase? 

About 24% over 10 years or only 2,17% per year...

What was inflation during this period?

Just under 0%, mild deflation. 

Let's look at South Africa

How much was in circulation in Jan 1999?

434,000,000,000 Rands

How much was in circualtion in Dec 2008?

1,888,856,000,000 Rands

How much did M3 increase?

About 335% over 10 years or 15,8% per year...

What was inflation during this period?

Just under 6% for the whole period. 

Dealing with questions:

1) But didn't the Japanese government print trillions of Yen?

Yes they did. But due to the nature of debt backed money what they were actually just doing was loaning money into existance as they population was paying off debts or ""destroying money"" by canceling the backing loans. M1 went up 94% during this same period. In spite of M1 increasing, M3 was getting swopped out from private debt to public debt or the backing loans were geting paid off. 

2) Why was there mild deflation and not inflation of 2.4% or in South Africa's case inflation of 15%?

Market deflation is the natural tendency of the economy to make things cheaper as actors compete for customers. The Japanese haven't been sitting on their hands for the past decade, they've been working, learning, innovating, etc. South Africa has even more pronounced deflation most likely due to the fact that over the past decade much of its population has been uplifted from close, or under the breadline to well above it. They also benefit by simply implementing market solutions that may have been developed elsewhere long ago, but that their developing economy only recently had the opportunity to implement. 

3) Why didn't M3 grow more in Japan?

Because money is backed by debt contracts, paying off the contract can destroy the money. This is an over simplification but is effectively true. The Japanese have been paying off MASSIVE amounts of debts since their real estate bubble in the late 80s. Also there is a ceiling to debt in a society above which no one is interested in getting in more debt, even in the interest rate is 0%. 

4) Why did M3 grow in South Africa?

South Africa is used to inflation, their reserve bank thinks its a good thing. So they make loaning money easy, which makes it worth less and makes it easier to pay off past debts. So they don't reach saturation of the debt burden as quickly, nor have they reached it yet. 

Dealing with objections:

1) See printing money doesn't matter:

No it does. Printing money makes the money in circulation worth less than it would have been. The fact that it would have actually increased in value, while the government has now kept it at the same value, does not make it a good thing that someone who produced and earned money, should have an increase in purchasing power taken away from them. 

2) So governments can print money without causing inflation or damaging the economy:

No they can't. In addition to removing purchasing power from people they miss-apply that money on projects that draw productive individuals to en devours that society would not have voluntarily paid for (IE they did not want.)

Final note on the US.

By estimates M3 has gone down and not up for a while after the 2008 crises. The Fed no longer measures M3, they said spending the few million a year in measuring it is too expensive. So we can only guess that is has mildly swelled or stayed the same. Americans have not been idle either so we can assume that healthy market deflation is happening. Until M3 does not grow substantially, there will not be inflation. If lending does kick off en masse again however, M3 could explode. 


PS A note on South Africa, the central banking, fractional reserve monopoly on the issuance of money, while not employed for the benefit of government directly, is employed against one group in favor of another. All poor South Africans have their purchasing power stripped yearly in favor of handing out loans to richer, more ""credit worthy"" citizens. The surrealism of the situation is compounded by the fact that 80% of tax incomes is then extracted from the beneficiaries of the banking system (2.5% of the population) to ""hand back to the poor"". More proof that if governments leave people alone on all fronts, people would be able to take care of themselves.

I noticed that they reduced my interest rate this month from 1% to 0.9% without telling me.

personalfinance,Student Loan has a minimum payment lower than the accruing interest?,"I have a US Federal Department of Education loan that I used to consolidate my student loans.  The principle is currently $26,000 with an interest rate of 6.375%.  

I've been making the minimum payments of $50 while paying off a smaller, higher interest loan.  However, I just realized that I'm accruing about $150 of interest every month so my balance is increasing by $100 every month.

This seems odd.  Is there some trick to federal student loans?  Should I make my own ""minimum payment"" be larger ($150-200) such that the loan isn't compounding on itself?

personalfinance,Just Need Some Breathing Room - Debt Consolidation ('Merica),"I'm working full-time, making good money, but my bank account is suffering under a small mountain of debt - car, student loans, and about $14k worth of credit card debt.


Everything is being paid, on time, but I am feeling very constricted by the various payments I have going out each month. The car payment and the student loan payments are what they are, but I would really like to knock down - and eventually knock out - my unsecured credit card debt. The majority of that debt is about $9500 on a Mastercard with a 14.49% interest rate. The next highest amount is about $2200 of Visa debt for the shiny new Macbook and Thunderbolt display I am typing this on. That account currently has No Interest, and will have no interest for about the next year.  The remainder of the debt is a few hundred dollars here on one card, a few hundred on another...you get the idea.


I have looked into consolidation through two of the financial institutions I do business with. Their rates weren't great, and I'd be paying about as much each month for the loan payment as I am now. I am, however very attracted to the idea of having ONE payment, and a clear timeline of when I will be debt free.

My questions are: Does anyone have any better ideas/sources for consolidation loans? Any helpful words of wisdom?

TL;DR: Good job, good pay - too much unsecured debt. Would like to consolidate with a better interest rate than I have so far been quoted.

I don't have that kind of money right now, but the terms of the voluntary disclosures say i have 90 days to pay if I want to be forgiven for the late fines.

I'm trying actively to rebuild my credit, and it occurred to me that perhaps a personal loan from my bank (or otherwise) might be a good way to pay these tax debts off in one stroke, and in the process add another account in good standing, even if it costs me a bit more money in the process.

Is this possible and / or advisable? I've never gotten a personal loan before, outside of my student loans, so I'm not sure how this works, if I'm even eligible, or if this would be a good idea for my credit or not.

personalfinance,Paying off debt or increasing retirement contributions?,"Hi all,

So I currently have about $60k in student loan debt from my University. Half of the loan is private, half is public. The interest rate is hovering around 11% for the private loan. Because I'm still going to school, I am not paying the interest on my public loan yet, and my graduate school is paid for by my employer so no more money is being added to the debt. I pay about $300 a month interest on the private loan and make $47k a year.

Currently my roth IRA contributions are at 6% (my employer matches up to 5%). I am having trouble deciding whether I should pull back these contributions to 5% and use the extra money I make from now on to pay all my loans off first, or to steadily increase my retirement and make lower payments to my loans. My gut is telling me to pay the debts off first, but the missed compound interest would hurt too I guess (in potential incomes). What should I do?",finance,1370360826

The car is a 2005 that I got an 11k loan on and had the engine blow out so that is where the 4k to my parents is going.

EDIT:  I currently make $21.00/hr and usually get about 1-2 hours overtime a check.

Monthly break down:
 
* Rent: $785 
* Car: $310 (includes the $50 to my parents)

personalfinance,Is refinancing your auto loan worth it and is there any detriment to your credit score?,"Last summer I took out an auto loan for a family member at a relative high interest rate (7%). I know this is where all the naysayers jump on me, but I expect them to continue to make the payments to me and yes I am fully prepared to pay it off myself if they cannot. They have been making the payment plus 15%-20% extra every month for the past year. With that said, I just signed up for CreditKarma.com and they have a bunch of competitive refinance offers available. My plan would be to apply and try to get one at a 1.4%-4% rate while maintaining the original monthly payments relatively increasing the principle payment every month.

I have never considered re-financing an auto loan before and am not sure if it makes financial sense to. I am also not sure of the affect this will have on my credit score as I intend on purchasing a house in 4 years around the same time I intend to have this paid off by. Any advice is appreciated.

personalfinance,I don't even know where to begin.,"I'm posting under an alt account because I'm so embarrassed; my girlfriend knows my financial trouble and my usual account but I don't want to worry her. That doesn't even make sense. :/ I feel like such a fuck up.

I'm mid-twenties. Currently I'm subleasing my girlfriend's apartment while she's away. She's back and forth if she wants to move, I think it's a good idea as we aren't sure if her landlord would grant me a lease, too.  I've been looking at places with a friend, we found a couple in the 600-800 range. They're all two bedroom as his lease is ending in August, too and he needs a new place to live.

I have problems though. I have about 13k in debt -- half of that is my car and half of that is credit card. My rating is in the dumps (about 575 the last time I checked). The card debt is split over four accounts: one with 5100$, one with 1000$, one with 400$ (only one that isn't maxed out, limit is 1000$ and is strictly with a garage) and one with ~600$ that is in collections. I have another account in collections that I contested and it hasn't been acted on (it's for 600$ but only 300$ of the debt is valid*, I offered to settle with the phone company if they'd adjust it to what it should have been, but they wouldn't and sent me to collections). I don't have interest rates on hand right now, but I should be able to get them fairly easily. I know my car and biggest card have the highest interest.

My bills break down this way:
Car -- 240$
Phone -- 116$ (I know I should probably cancel my smart phone plan, but I don't have 300$ to do that)
Insurance -- 103$ (down from the 170$ I was paying like a dipshit)
CC1 - 150$
CC2 - 40$ (minimum is 30$)
CC3 - 20$ 
CC4 - 25$ (autodrafts from my account)
Rent for me is about 200$ (total rent is 400$, she's paying half of it)
Utilities are usually about 50$ for me.
________________________________
944$

Gas for me is about 20-30$ a week depending on how much I drive. Work is about 4 miles from where I live, if I only go to work and home (typical) I can stretch 30$ over about a week and a half. I recently fixed some issues with my car so hopefully this improves.
Food -- I spent 50$ yesterday and I'm hoping to stretch that a week and a half, maybe two. I don't eat much myself -- usually the equal of two meals a day.


I work about 38 hours a week (retail, so no set schedule). Currently, I make about 12.5$ an hour but I know I'm getting a pay cut (probably at the beginning of July) -- best case scenario is 10%, putting me at 11.25$ I can remain solvent in that case. Worst case? If I dip below 10.50$ I don't think I can. :/

I'm not going to make excuses, I've made plenty of mistakes and now I owe a lot of money. My choices were ultimately my own.

I love my girlfriend and I want to live with her. I realize that it may not be possible, however. Regardless of if we move, stay here or I have to move, I need to do two things: save some money (my savings is at 2.15$ right now) and come up with a plan to get rid of my debt. I realize neither will be easy.

Basically, I need advice. I don't have any assets to sell (I have books, but nothing worth of value). I have an old tower I use as a personal server that may be worth 50$, a laptop that is basically my life, a monitor and speaker set that might fetch 100$ together, 200$ if I'm lucky. I'd hate to see them go, but I could live with it.

I'm thinking of getting a second job overnight to earn extra money. The prospect of being even more exhausted all the time isn't enticing but I'd rather be tired than homeless. :/

This has turned into a dumping ground of all my insecurities. I'm sorry, I just really need advice on what I should be doing because I have no fucking idea.

*: I canceled my account when my contract ended. I gave proper noticed and checked several times. They continued to bill me for service and when I called they said that they had no record of it. Of course, I don't have it either. They sent me to collections when I refused to pay twice what I owed. This may have been hard headed of me and I know it's hurt my credit and will probably bite me in the ass, but I refuse to be taken advantage of and lied to in such an obvious fashion.",finance,1370353479

personalfinance,Some quick tax advice - at least which publications to look in.,"Hi all, 

I was hoping you could give me some help on tax stuff. I just started a new job which has me nominally as a 1099, so I'll be paying taxes as self-employed. 

Basics - I work either at the company office or a remote site. I don't have a home office so I'm not going to bother with risking an audit on that. 

I get paid $225 a day. If I travel, I get paid an extra $50 (100 miles at $0.40/mile and $10 for meals). I've been keeping a travel log since I started. 

What all is taxable? Obviously the $225 is (plus the SE Tax, I believe). And I think I can actually deduct another $0.14 for at least the 100 miles to the remote site (that's 50 each way between the office and the remote site). Can I deduct the federal rate to the office? I generally drive directly to the remote site, which is 74 miles - Do I deduct $0.54 for 48 of those miles and then $0.14 for 100? 

Is car insurance worth deducting? 

I have some other questions but these are the biggest ones for now.

Thanks guys",finance,1370342508
personalfinance,Question on Mortgage loan transfer from parent to child lowering interest %,"Hey Reddit!

   I just recently stumbled upon PF and LOVE IT. Have learned a lot and wanted to pose a question of my own (Also my first post ever on Reddit):

   My current situation is in regards to my parents' house. Currently, they owe $170,000 on the house we currently live in at 5.375% interest- about 20 years left on the loan in Southern California.

   It was suggested to sign the house over into my name (and taking theirs off), and theoretically get offered an interest rate of about ~3.8%. We had a discussion about how it would play out, and seemed to have two different outcomes as to whether it was worth it:


* **EXHIBIT A: signing the loan over:**

I calculated that the first year interest would be about $6,500 at 3.9%, and the rest could pay down the principal. Subsequently, the next year's interest would fall to roughly $6,000 for the year and so on. This payment is only for the principal/interest, and doesn't include Escrow costs/taxes. I calculated this this saves roughly $50,000 in interest over the life of the loan. 


* **EXHIBIT B: signing the loan over:** 

However they mentioned that the name transfer wouldn't work like that and the loan restructuring would be front-loaded such that you're forced to pay a set upfront interest amount for the first 5 years that eats up about 90% of your monthly loan payment no matter how much of the principal you pay off in the first, second, third, fourth or fifth year. 

   Exhibit B sounded really strange to me, and I have concerns who my parents spoke to at [INSERT NATIONALLY WELL KNOWN US BANK]. I was also hoping to help pay down the principal in the first year the loan transferred over as I HATE the idea of paying interest on anything. 

   So my question is, what really happens if the house gets signed over at a lower interest rate? Did my parents just happen to speak to banks that offered bad terms for a loan? Or is this just industry standard in an incident where a parent signs a loan over to a child that I'm not aware of? If not, where would be a reputable place to go to look for better loan terms? 

   I did research on my own, but honestly- my head is spinning reading about compound vs simple interest, discount points, pre-payment penalties, ""no cost"" options and what-not on home loans. My parents have worked really hard to get to where we are on the house, and never imagined they'd ever be able to afford one back in the day and I just want to help as much as I can.  

Also as an FYI, I'm very close with my family and don't have an issue putting my name on the house/being responsible for it legally as well.

About a month ago I made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1dg0xf/buying_the_10_day_low_a_back_test/) detailing a trading strategy that bought on lows and sold on highs, I did some more analysis involving a ‘base case’ and ended up with some interesting results. I really just wanted to see what everyone thinks of my analysis.

**Signals**

Strategy: Buy when a stock has reached a new 10 day low and is trading above its 50 and 200 day moving average.  Sell when the price reaches a new 10 day high, drops below the 50 day moving average, or has been open for 10 days. 

Base case: Buy a random stock at its close and hold for a random period between 1 and 10 days.

**Methodology**

The program begins by back testing a predefined set of tickers (SP500 in this case) using the buy and sell signals listed above. In order to reduce biased results I ‘walk’ through the time period, that is I fed the program a single day at a time. Each day I calculated buy signals and if the conditions were met I'd purchase the security, hold it, and continue to cycle through each proceeding day and calculated sell signals.
Once the security was bought and sold I'd write down the trade and move onto the next day. The end result was a list of every single trade that could have potentially occurred in the predefined date range with the predefined list of tickers.

I'd sort these entries by purchase date in ascending order (oldest first) and every trade that fell on the same day was put into a list and archived in a dictionary with key-word purchaseDate. The result was a data structure I could query and pull a list of all trades that could have occurred on a specified date.

I then had all the information I needed to begin the actual back test. I began with the first possible purchase date, searched the dictionary to obtain a list of all possible trades that could have occurred on that day, chose one at random, wrote down the trade's information, and moved onto the next available purchase date.

Once all dates were exhausted I calculated an annual return by finding the product of all the year's trades. I did this 10,000 times in order to obtain the average and standard deviation of annual returns. Since my data didn't tell me which trade occurred when it was impossible for me to define the exact sequence of trades. My idea was if I got enough random trade sequences I could create a universe of possible scenarios with the most likely being the most prevalent -- it was a way for me to calculate a return and cover all my bases at the same time.",finance,1370469794
investing,Need Help Understanding mREITs,"I understand that companies like NLY and AGNC borrow money at low rates and buy MBS that pay higher rates and make money off the spread. When the Fed announced its giant MBS buying program, everyone freaked out about mREITs because they would make MBS more expensive (and interest rates lower), thus limiting the spread. Everyone claimed this would be very damaging to mREITs and some of the stocks declined because everyone was anticipating dividend cuts.

However, now that there is talk about the Fed tapering the MBS buying, everyone is freaking out again and most mREITS declined even more. The bears are claiming the rising interest rates decreases the book value of these companies because the securities they hold decrease in value due to rising interest rates.

So... which is it? Is Fed activity good or bad for mREITs? Because it seems like they lose either way, which is quite strange. From looking deeper into the situation, it seems like the issue isn't black or white. The issue might be regarding the speed of interest rate increases. If interest rates rise too quickly, like they did in the past month, these companies can't take advantage of it because they don't have enough capital.

Reading through them though, I realized I was being kind of unclear about a few things. A couple of them also opened up more questions for me, so rather than respond to each individual one, I decided to just make a more thorough post.

So my girlfriend and I are living in Korea. We're not getting married anytime soon- i.e. looking to combine finances. I had ***zero*** budgeting skills in college, whereas she is actually the budgeter in the relationship and was able to save 2k on an 18k salary last year while paying down loans.

I created my last post mainly as a quick response to my her when she was feeling down about turning down a $40 trip invitation after we've both already blown our budgets for the month. She just wanted a reminder about why we save.

This is a better layout of my salary:

* We earn 2 million Korean Won each month after taxes. That's $1,783.
* Of that, I immediately deposit 1,500,000, or $1,338.
* Our contract ends Nov 20th, so we have 6 more pay days.
* We get paid the last day of work, so that's 5 months of Korean living expenses.
* $1,338 x 5= $6,690. Plus $1,783 (Nov 20 paycheck)= $8,473
* Plus $1,783 (we get a contract completion bonus equal to one paycheck)
* Plus $2,519 (current savings)= **$12,775 Gross Savings**

__________________________

-Now, we get a 9 day vacation next month, for which we've already bought $300 tickets for. We plan to spend ~700,000W or $624 more on hostels and food.

-In September, we have a 5 day vacation, so we're planning on spending ~500,000W or $445 total on a trip to Jeju island (the Hawaii of Korea)

-We decided today that our after Korea budget will be 2 mill won ($1,783). Thailand, where we'll spend ~a month, will just be around $500 (we're staying with her old host family a good portion of the time) and then we wanted to blow the rest on whatever travel we could fit in for the month after.

* 12,775- 2,852 (Japan/Jeju/Post-Korea)= **$9,923 Post Travel Savings**

__________________

Now, here's where I want a little more advice. In loans I have:

* A $14,690 Federal Subsidized loan @ 4.441%
* A $14,425 Fed Un-Subsidized loan @ 6.8%
* A $7,141 School loan @ 5%
* **$36,256 total student debt**

It's my understanding that I can't pay more on my un-subbed loan, as it's grouped together with the other loans. My minimum payment for my fed loans has been ~$270, and my minimum on my school has been $78. I've been paying $300/mo toward the fed and $100/mo toward the school.
_________________

Continuing that trend, in order to pay off my loans until Jan 2014 (I haven't paid this month yet) I need to make 8 more payments of $400.

* $9,923 - $3,200 ($400 x 8)= **$6,723 Net Savings**

To clarify, I'm **not** going to be in NYC next year, I was just using the city as a frame of reference for salaries. I don't know where I will be, whether my partner and I will be able to move to the same city, or what I will do for a job. I want grad school experience, which means a very low paying non-profit related job, or a menial part time job with volunteer hours on the side. 

I was hoping to use the savings to subsidize my income so that I could continue to pay off my loans for as long as possible before turning to an income-based repayment plan- which I will most likely have to do eventually as grad school is in the 2 year plan. Also keep in mind that my field (social/counseling psych) pays you to go to grad school, so saving for that is not a priority.

Another consideration is that I want to have the option to move to a new city and start fresh- i.e. down payment on an apt, a month rent before I have a steady job, furniture, etc.

How much should I set aside for an emergency fund? Should I pay a huge amount of my net savings down on the loans or should I keep it as padding as I had planned? And do you think my Korea budget is still outrageously lavish? I can post a more thorough layout of where the $450 goes.",finance,1370412184
gaming,Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the Second warns players about being scammed but scams players themselves.,"http://img46.imageshack.us/img46/9207/ro2lolfoundertitleconcl.png

When playing an MMORPG, there are many different kinds of currency. There is currency used in-game which has many forms and currency outside of the game. One of those kinds of currency is time spent in-game.

Also, a new trend in MMORPG's is a feature that gives you a title before or after your character's name. These are usually obtained from achievements or what you've accomplished in-game at a certain time of the MMORPG. Sometimes these are exclusive to a certain time-frame of the MMORPG where only a select few can receive the title if a certain quest or achievement is fulfilled. Others are titles you can receive by completely a quest from the story line which everyone will have access to. These titles may have benefits such as giving stats to your character or certain buffs, abilities, or permissions.

The image above is a post from WarpPortal's official Ragnarok Online 2 forum. In the screenshot you can see a multi-quote post of the conclusion of an in-game event for a title. The name of the title is ""Founder.""

http://oi40.tinypic.com/ehbtdi.jpg

These are the benefits that the ""Founder"" title give (eventually that will be ""gave"" instead of ""give"") in-game. The ""Founder"" title has been viewable by any player in-game since the launch of Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the Second (RO2 LOTS) in North American and Europe. In the scheme of things, these benefits are quite game changing in the early levels (which currently Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the Second has 50). But up near the highest level, which is level 50, they give slightly better stats than the best title every player has access to given they can defeat a certain raid monster. The keyword here is slightly.

Basically what happened is that the game, Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the Second (an MMORPG), had a time event. You would receive the ""Founder"" title for having a level 30 character by June 1st (later changed to June 3rd). In addition to that, depending on how long you stayed logged in playing the game, you would receive additional ""Founder"" titles to be able to use on your other characters regardless of their individual levels. The time spent in-game was based off of the account logged in, no the individual characters. The more time you spent logged in playing, the more ""Founder"" titles you would receive to be able to use on other characters.

And, as you can see in the image at the top, WarpPortal changed the benefits of the ""Founder"" title from the original stats to +5 to all stats.

This was after the event had ended. I.E. A scam. The irony here is that they warn players about being scammed but WarpPortal themselves scammed the players. It should be noted that they intentionally withheld information, a lie of omission, about the ""Founder"" title change until only after the event had ended. If you take that into account, it can be said that a reason for withholding the fact that the ""Founder"" title would be nerfed (benefits would be taken away or removed entirely) is that if the benefits are not significant enough, there is no reason for many players to actively participate in the event.

So as a metaphor that most of everyone can relate to: Apple is having a sale on their highest trim iPad with WiFi and 3G. The iPads cost, because of the sale, $49 which is a fraction of the original cost that is, let's say, $449.

After the sale is over, Apple makes an announcement. That announcement is ""iPads bought from the sale require a $400 Apple activation fee in order to use WiFi and 3G.""

In addition to this debacle, one of WarpPortal's community managers is attempting to do damage control by redirecting or misdirecting the discussions and outrage by asking players to prove, yes prove, where WarpPortal stated the ""Founder"" title would give the original benefits in-game.

This is standard practice from WarpPortal. I just thought I'd let the gaming portion of the Internet know so you wouldn't get scammed. ;D

Bitcoin,Financial Services,"This is a 2 parter, but bear with me.

1) I was thinking today about how a Bitcoin bank might work, and wonder if you all might check my logic (I am no economist):  Basically, a Bitcoin bank could work if depositors would simply transfer their deposits to the ""Vault Wallet"" of a bank.  That bank would then keep a ledger of whose Bitcoin they have and how much, and then they could start lending out that pooled coin in the form of loans as long as they kept enough coin on-hand to repay a sufficient percentage of the original depositors should they want their money back.  Those who took out loans would repay them with interest, and the bank could take some of that interest as a profit and use the rest to pay the depositors interest.  There would be no centralized bank like the Federal Reserve that could insure depositors, but before the Fed, banks would band together to insure each other.  This could probably be done with Bitcoin as well.  Does all this sound reasonable?  At its foundation, it's really no different than banking with fiat currency.

2) Given the distrust most Bitcoin users have of traditional financial institutions, would there be enough support of this kind of bank to be profitable?  Would it be good enough that the banks would not have such close ties with government that Bitcoin users would want to invest?

I am, however, confuzzled at which debt I should focus on first.

I currently have three loans:

My car loan, currently at $1800 @ 12.5%. While on this loan, I am required to have full coverage insurance totaling $88/month. I have $1000 in positive equity in this vehicle.

My motorcycle loan, currently at $3500 @ 20%. While on this loan, I am required to have full coverage insurance totaling $66/month. I have $1000 in negative equity in this vehicle.

My student loans, currently deferred, the amount being $5k @ 3.4%.

My first thoughts are to pay the car first, drop insurance to minimum, use additional savings to pay down motorcycle, drop insurance to lower, use additional savings to pay down student loans. Use extra money after that to keep saving.

While I've got you, should I be spending every extra penny towards paying down debt, or should I also be making a buffer of 1-2k? I understand that a savings account is essentially losing money when taking into account interest rates, but in the event of an emergency that extra money would be good to have. But then I wonder, if I save $1k, and get a loan down to $1k, would it be a bad thing to just pay off the loan instantly and then rebuild the buffer?

I kind of wish I could keep my pension deductions and save them on my own. I believe there's penalties for retiring early. I also might be interested in cashing it out at some point so I at least know I have the money (if I retired early), but you take a huge tax hit for that which kind of sucks because I kind of consider it deferred income.

How do I factor this pension into how much money is technically being ""saved"" and how does it impact my retirement date? And forgive me because I'm new at all of this, do not understand financial stuff and cannot do proper math for the life of me. But I find this one of the most helpful subs so thank you in advance!

edit: some additional background-- I worked for the federal government for 2 years, switched to the provincial government and transferred my pension. There was a surplus so I was cashed out a bit. I was there for a year and now I am back at federal so I am faced with another pension transfer. I expect there will be a shortfall transferring back if I wanted to do a service buyback. I have been back 6 months and it's still early in the process because these things take *forever,* right? I don't think I'm interested in the service buyback because the surplus funds from the first transfer are sitting quite happily in my RRSP. I don't think a buyback is useful from a FI point of view.

personalfinance,Mortgage advice from our British redditors please? 2 year vs 5 year fixed rate considering the Bank of England base rate?,"I am a first-time buyer about to embark on purchasing a flat with my other half. The flat costs £250k, we have a £50k deposit and £10k set aside for fees/expenses etc. We have budgeted enough money for both mortgage payments and overpayments towards the equity of the property in order to spend a combined total of £1250/month between us. This represents a third of our net income with the rest divided between savings, other expenses and spending money.

In order to be able to plan our finances more carefully we have decided on a fixed rate mortgage product but I find myself wavering between the 2 year and 5 year fixed rate products:

5 year fixed rate - The best mortgage on the market at present is with Leeds BS at a fixed rate of 3.19% with 5.69% thereafter. This would lead to initial monthly payment of ~£960/month +£300/month overpayment, thus allowing us to remortgage at the end of 5 years with a better LTV (assuming house prices stay the same - I understand you cannot depend on this, but for the sake of argument). By the end of the 5 year fix we would own ~£95,500 in capital which would be 38% (which we could then bring up to 40% with an additional £5k).  

2 year fixed rate - The cheapest one available (also with Leeds BS) is on at 2.69% which leads to a monthly payment of £918 thus allowing an extra £332/month overpayment. This would bring our capital at the end of the 2 year period to ~ £70k with a presumed equity of 28%. I'm sure we could find the extra £5k to bring it up to a 30% equity as we also have an extensive savings plan.

Which is the more optimal plan?

The 5 year product has the disadvantage of expiring at a time where most of the sources I have found agree that our historically low BoE interest rates will probably cease to be artificially suppressed, thus raising the typical mortgage rates available on the market. 

In this train of thought, perhaps the 2 year product would have the advantage if, when it expires in 2015, the BoE interest rate (and thus mortgage rates) are still low, thus allowing us to fix for a 5 year product at that point in order to take advantage of the cheap cost of borrowing for as long as possible. It does have the disadvantage of incurring an earlier cost of remortgaging though. However, if the cost of the mortgage is £~40/month cheaper to begin with, would I not save most of the ~£1500 cost of arranging another mortgage?

By my reckoning, it comes down to what you think the Bank of England interest rate will be doing in 2015 - if it's still low, it favours taking out the 2 year product. However, if it rises and I am pushed relatively prematurely into a more expensive mortgage then a 5 year fixed mortgage would have been the more optimal plan.

I would very grateful for any thoughts, wisdom or experience anyone can offer on the matter. Thank you!",finance,1370558766

Daycare is quite expensive around here--many of the ones I have looked at in the area are $1300-1500/mo for infants. However, I may be able to get subsidized daycare (I work for the Dept of Defense) but there is a waitlist, so that's not guaranteed. That would decrease the cost to about $600/mo.

business,International BP Holdings news article: Should Australia’s manufacturing future be nuclear – deviantart,"http://liesbeth189.deviantart.com/art/International-BP-Holdings-news-article-376239747


It is not the first time in Australia’s economic history that a prevalent sector reaches its peak and gives way to a rapidly developing new one. However, while the mining and education sectors have apparently hit their peaks and manufacturing continues its decline (as seen by the planned withdrawal of Ford in 2016), there seems to be no replacement underway.

There is another possibility – albeit a controversial one. Could – and should – Australia embrace the manufacture of nuclear fuel?
More specifically, could the fabrication of nuclear fuel elements or fuel rods used in nuclear power generation plants, replace our current export of uranium oxide concentrate – so-called “yellowcake”?

Australia exports nuclear fuel anyway. It is just the matter of doing it smarter and safer, adding more value to Australia’s product before it leaves our shores, while creating more jobs for Australians and making the world more secure.

What is the reason Australia has not done this so far? Firstly, the countries capable of exporting fuel elements, such as France, historically started their fuel element fabrication industries intending to generate nuclear-based energy for themselves.

Having abundant and easy to mine coal deposits, Australia did not have to bother about the nuclear industry. Secondly and more importantly, the nuclear industry is strictly (and rightfully) regulated. Even mining uranium ore is a very controversial and politically charged matter.

To start producing fuel elements, a company must lobby federal and state governments; while for governments a huge task would be to face hostile anti-nuclear public opinion. Therefore, a vision and leadership is needed from the governments' side to support any commercial interest in this industry.

Potential market capacity

Most of the yellowcake used for power generation worldwide is produced by 17 nations. Australia is the third largest producer after Kazakhstan and Canada and meets about 20% of the world demand.
Of the producers – Canada, the United States, Germany and France – Australia is the only developed nation producing yellowcake that does not fabricate fuel rods. However, Germany and France produce only miniscule amounts of yellowcake and import considerable amounts of it for their domestic production of rods.

Among growing energy markets, the largest – in absolute terms – potential growth of nuclear energy sectors is expected in India and China.

personalfinance,Debt settlement fraud by Capital One?,"I had a household bank I card made mistakes with and charged up to the limit of $4,000. Finical crisis comes they decided to raise my rates. I closed the card and locked in the original rate. I continued to pay down more than the minimum and the finical industry did it's near collapse and consolidate. My account was bought by HSBC and then HSBC was bought by Capital One. By that time the balance was down to $1600. 

I payed on them for a while and then got into trouble with approximately $1200 left on the card. In an act of corporate courage they very quickly sold the account to a debt collector. 

Early January I received a call a believed was from Capital One and the person announced they were working for someone working for Capital One. I thought it was a department within Capital One. The person was nice, smart and straightforward. I had money after the holidays and was willing to spend $200 to rehabilitate the account and pay it down a little. The debt collector was very good at her job, she could hear I was being loose with money and offered to settle that account that day for $722. I knew it wouldn't be great for my credit but I jumped on it. It would be kinda hard to pull off but I accepted, paid, and settled that day.

I had never done that before. It was break I really needed and I have always wanted to honorably retire that debt. I didn't get a letter of settlement or ask for one. I didn't know about that. For anyone else doing this get it before hand.

A month rolls around and Capital One starts calling ""did you forget something?"" ""could you just pay the minimum of"" $10 or $15 or something. I explained I settled the account they see the payment of $722 but don't believe it's a settlement. They say the person I settled with was a ""third party vendor"" and they don't recognize this settlement. I talk to a Capital One manager who tells me to get a Letter of Settlement.

I call the outsourced debt collector, they say yep it was a settlement, the conditions were met and send me a letter of settlement. It shows the account number, my name and address, their name and address and ""Settled in Full"" plus some other boilerplate.

I call Capital One's customer service, they always treat me like a liar trying to pull something over on them or like a serf on their plantation begging for something completely unreasonable. I'm not a beggar I'm one angry man asking them to honor the agreement. I have talked to them again and again. I have written customer service, their Cease and Desist department, an HSBC customer service department. I have asked them to honor the agreement and sent them all copies of the Settled in Full letter. They have sent the most intransigent responses. One treated me like a fool and made a big show of how nice they were to close the account and make all these delinquent notification to the credit agencies. It had been closed years ago when it was with household bank.

I call them they always refuse to take my word for it and say they have to talk to the collection agency. They never seem to be able to do this. I can get through to the collection agency and they always agree that it's settled. I have shown Capital One the Letter of Settlement three times and if we were in court wouldn't this be game over?

It's been six months of dealing with this. I have been defrauded out of the settlement I agreed to and paid for. I want advice on making capital one abide by the agreement, or a good lawyer on virginia who could stop them. Looking up settlement fraud all I can find are bankruptcy lawyers.

I just recently (re)found them while digging through the attic. I'm now 29. So, I believe I have slightly more than $900 if interest does accrue. But I have no idea if I should cash these out, if so, how would I do that? Am i currently earning a higher interest rate than at my high yield savings account (.75%)?

I don't *need* the money. I do have some debt;

* Car Payment ~ $300/month, 2.5 years left 2.9%

* Mortgage ~ $1300/month, a lot of years left 4.25%

* Student Loans ~ $188/month, 6 years left. 4.6%

But I'm already overpaying a small amount on each of these (about $30/month on each). My girlfriend will soon be helping with mortgage (and hopefully monthly food expenses). 


Should I cash these out?

I would prefer to start beefing up the emergency fund (about 2.5k, not nearly enough in my mind) if I did cash them out, but am I going to get a better interest rate. I imagine Govt Bonds are pretty liquid.

Money I am receiving, roughly $14k.

**Debt:**

* CC - $3200 @ 6.25%
* BestBuy Loan - $1750 (due November this year, other parts of the loan interest free due late 2014)
* Auto Loan - $11k at 1.9% ($260/mo)
* Auto Loan - $14k at 2.9% ($300/mo, put $5k last year into credit union account which makes the $300/month payment for me, will run out in mid 2014 then I am on the hook for the $300/month payment)

**Investments**

* I have a ROTH IRA for both my wife and I. We maxed out the $5k each last year, this year we have it setup to basically contribute $600/year each...so there is room to contribute there of $4400 / each.
* I have term insurance. My financial advisor has recommended I consider converting $100k of my term insurance into permanent insurance. That would be roughly $1300 / year if my memory serves me correctly, at an interest rate I think at guaranteed 5% (it is set once at the beginning of every year). 

We don't have much of an emergency fund. I have a 2nd job that helps earn money for extra bills, savings, etc.. so its always nice to consider a nest egg..but there is also those bills above to consider. I have had medical bills for my family I have had to squash with my side earned money which kills the nest egg. When we maxed out our ROTH's last year, we doubled that as an emergency fund (if it came down to it) where we could extra the cash we had contributed. Each ROTH is about $7k each.

**Mortgage**

Have a 5/1 arm mortgage. Have till 2016 before arm kicks in, will loan modify / refinance before then. Currently pay $1k / month at 3.25%. Loan is about $145k.

**Plan**

My plan was to squash the CC, squash the BB Loan, contribute to the ROTHs, maybe convert the TERM to Permanent, and maybe leave a little just in the savings for quick emergency reasons. I also plan on purposely shoving side job earnings into the savings account and not touching it.

Again, would appreciate any advice.

I currently have $23,000 left in student loans at 3.3%.  They are a variable rate and tied to the Libor.  I can assume that this rate will go up over the next few years as the Libor does, but, I also see the interest rates for houses going up as well.


I figure that I can budget a minimum of $15,000 a year and use that to either pay down the loans then start building up a down payment or only pay the minimum on the loans and put the bulk of it into a savings account for a downpayment.  The reason that I am leaning towards the later option is because the interest rate on the loans is low and intrest rates on houses are already going back up.  It would also get me into a house about 2 years sooner.

Bitcoin,Bitfloor update from AudenX June 5,"Hi Bitfloor customers,

No official updates from Bitfloor since 5/13.

The lawyer from Gaming Counsel that I mentioned in my previous update email followed up with me today. He has made inquiries at a couple of Canadian banks to find one willing to deposit the Bitfloor check. He has been turned down by one bank so far but is still working a lead at another bank.

He is investigating whether, if the funds were deposited at a Canadian bank, Bitfloor customers could accomplish an administrative liquidation of the funds through the Canadian courts. (The reason he's focusing on this option, if I understand correctly, is that commercial insolvency laws in Canada may make it easier to accomplish creditor refunds than in the US.)

It is not yet clear if a Canadian court would assume jurisdiction over the parties involved, so we don't know yet if it this is possible. However, if Bitfloor were willing to consent to Ontario jurisdiction, it sounds like we might be able to appoint a Canadian lawyer as liquidator, then make an application to the Ontario Superior Court to distribute funds to Bitfloor depositors. The Canadian lawyer would probably need to work in concert with a US lawyer to process the refunds.

If the Gaming Counsel lawyer does find a bank in Canada that could make this work, I'll ask him to talk me through this option and provide a ballpark of the costs involved. One of the (US) lawyers I spoke to said we need to be attentive in the event of an administrative liquidation with the fees charged by the trustee appointed to execute the refunds; I imagine there are similar concerns if this is done in Canada. I'll keep you posted on what I learn.

I'm going to call John Snyder tomorrow to see if he's followed up on my leads at the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union and Silicon Valley Bank. If John hasn't started working those leads yet, I'm going to contact Brewster Kahle myself to chat more about the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union option.

Thanks to everyone who has been forwarding me the results of their detective work to identify bank leads, find background information on Bitfloor, and research legal options. This is all useful information for me to have on hand, since I can use it to respond to various lawyers' questions.

Best,

AudenX

We're moving and just sold our house but have yet to find one at the new location and each passing week makes buying look less appealing due to rising interest rates.

For someone with a credit score in the 800s, a 20% down payment sitting in cash, and another 30-40% of the home value sitting in stocks/mutual funds, are there any better places to look for cheap mortgage rates?    I have heard rumors that if you have exceptionally high savings (say 100% of the home value in stocks) that you can get a loan at 1 or 2% interest that is essentially backed by your savings/stocks.

transunion : 737

my total credit limit is $60,350. open CC debt is $27K, giving me a utilization of 45%. is this hurting me badly? none of the debt actually belongs to me, it's just me being on my parents credit card (my personal credit cards i pay off every month no problem). one of their CC's has a $26K max with $17K on it (66% utilization)

my parents (and myself) pay on time, every month. they've had the cards for awhile and have had me on the cards for awhile (average CC is 4 years, my three credit cards are only a year old). i have no negative payment information listed on my account.

my question is, should i get off the CC, or can i? is the length of time the cards have that raise my average from 1 year to 4 years worth the lousy utilization rate my parents have? with only my cards i would have...

personalfinance,Help me figure out the best way to reduce the cost of my car,"Hi everyone.


I'm paying a car loan with a 9% interest rate.  I'm very good with paying everything on time but, my credit history is poor.  I have about 2 years of late payments and a defaulted student loan on my record  This came about because, my father promised to begin repayment on some of my student loans before I graduated but, either didn't pay on time or, just didn't pay at all.  He is very irresponsible with his money and is a leach on his family's finances.



Anyway, I'm working hard to pay this loan back, ASAP.  I'm ahead on payments and, I'm making changes, so that I can put 150% of the minimum monthly payments into the loan.  However, I still want to find some way to reduce that interest rate.  Not so that I can reduce the monthly payments but, so that I can get it paid faster/pay less interest.



I already tried refinancing with my current loaner but, they denied my request.  I'm not quite sure what my next step should be.  I've been thinking of contacting companies with more lenient refinancing criteria and, maybe, asking my mother to cosign on the refinanced loan.  She has excellent credit so, her signature may help me out.  However, I""m not very familiar with available lenders and, I don't want to make a poor choice.  So, I'm not sure what I should do.



Could r/personalfinance give me their thoughts on the matter?  What do you think about my plan and, what could I do differently to reduce my interest rate?  Is there some thing I can do about the defaulted loan that would increase my credit score quickly?  My father has been talking about changing the way it's reported but, knowing him, it's likely some BS excuse to get me off his back.

China’s crackdown on fake export invoices used to disguise money flows is probably cutting the nation’s trade figures, revealing subdued global demand that will weigh on economic growth.

Outbound shipments may have grown 7.1 percent in May from a year earlier, less than half the previous month’s reported 14.7 percent, based on the median estimate of 34 economists ahead of data due June 8. Import growth probably slowed to 6.9 percent from April’s 16.8 percent, a Bloomberg News survey showed.

Successful deterrence of fraudulent data through regulatory scrutiny of companies and banks would help restore trust in trade figures, while more accurate numbers may also highlight the urgency for Premier Li Keqiang to shift growth toward domestic consumption. Weakness in exports could also test Li’s reluctance to add stimulus to support the expansion of the world’s second-biggest economy.

“The crackdown from China’s foreign-exchange authorities on fake invoicing will bring the inflated export growth down to the real trend, which is single digits,” said Zhang Zhiwei, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong, who projects export gains of 5 percent for May. More broadly, China’s economy “is weakening but is not collapsing,” said Zhang, who previously worked at the International Monetary Fund.

Then MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks was down 1.2 percent as of 4:19 p.m. in Tokyo today.


Inflation Figures

The trade data from the General Administration of Customs will be followed June 9 by National Bureau of Statistics releases on prices, industrial production, retail sales and investment that are forecast to show little change from April growth figures. New yuan loans may have increased to 850 billion yuan ($139 billion) from April’s 792.9 billion yuan in People’s Bank of China numbers due over the next week, based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index of stocks has declined for six days, the longest losing streak since June 2012, amid concern that economic growth is losing steam. The gauge lost 1.3 percent today, the most in six weeks.

Economists in a separate survey last month said January-April export growth was overstated by 4 to 13 percentage points. Shipments abroad probably rose 8.5 percent in the first four months of 2013 from a year earlier, based on the median estimate of 15 economists, less than half the official 17.4 percent number. Imports may have gained 8.25 percent, according to 14 analysts’ median estimate, compared with the government’s 10.6 percent figure.


PMI Gauge

The figures compare with South Korea’s reported 1 percent increase in exports in the first five months of 2013 and a 1.3 percent January-April gain reported by Taiwan. China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index (SHCOMP) for manufacturing has shown new export orders contracting for four of the past five months.

Slower growth in last month’s official trade data may reflect measures announced by China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAOFEZ) to crack down on speculative funds entering the country disguised as payments for trade.

The currency regulator said May 6 that it will send out warning notices to companies whose goods and capital flows don’t match as well as those bringing large amounts of cash into China. SAFE on May 22 told banks to improve checks of customer documents related to special trade zones amid speculation that the areas have been exploited to mask money inflows as exports.

Double-counting in the zones probably continued to inflate May’s figures, said Steve Wang, chief China economist in Hong Kong for Reorient Financial Markets Ltd., an investment bank backed by the Chinese government. While exports probably rose 9.3 percent in May, the true rate may be close to 4.6 percent excluding distortions from double-counting in the zones, Wang said.


Fraud Probe

The customs administration didn’t respond to faxed questions yesterday from Bloomberg News or to other inquiries on the issue since it held a press briefing on April 10. Zheng Yuesheng, an agency spokesman, said at the time that China is investigating possible fraud behind first-quarter export growth and that the practice of false trade declarations “does exist but is definitely not mainstream.”

Some Chinese exports face other issues. The European Union this week said tariffs of as much as 67.9 percent could be imposed on solar panels from China in the largest EU commercial dispute of its kind, affecting Chinese companies like Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., Wuxi Suntech Power Co. and Changzhou Trina Solar Energy Co.


Reserve Ratio

The slowdown may be too much for the government to stomach, said Hu Yifan, chief economist at Haitong International Securities Co. in Hong Kong, who previously worked at the World Bank. Authorities may start “active supportive policies,” including a cut this month in banks’ reserve-requirement ratio, said Hu, the only analyst surveyed to project a May decline in exports.

China’s gross domestic product expanded a less-than-estimated 7.7 percent in the first quarter and analysts last month trimmed forecasts for the April-June period to a median projection of 7.8 percent. The government in March set a goal of 7.5 percent for the year.

“The pressure on the Chinese leadership may grow to do more to boost domestic demand,” such as faster approvals of investment projects, said Sun Junwei, a Beijing-based economist at HSBC Holdings Plc. “The government doesn’t want another stimulus package, but it won’t like a deepening slowdown either.”

Around the world today, U.K. house prices rose for a fourth month in May as government measures to help the property market boosted demand, according to Halifax, the mortgage unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc. Other releases today include U.S. jobless claims and factory orders in Germany.

The Bank of England will probably decide to hold its target for bond purchases at 375 billion pounds ($577 billion), according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The European Central Bank will keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5 percent today, according to a survey of analysts.

personalfinance,[Canada] Help me understand my federal govt pension? Kind of x-post from /r/financialindependence,"Here's my x-post: http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1ftq5i/canadian_federal_government_pension/

I am a federal government employee. I don't think of my pension very often because they take the money from me automatically. But I'm trying to figure out potential retirement dates, etc, and its obviously a variable. If possible I would like to retire before I'm 65 or even 55, which is why I had originally posted to /r/financialindependence. I don't know how many people are in that sub who can help with my particular situation.

I kind of wish I could keep my pension deductions and save them on my own. I believe there's penalties for retiring early. I also might be interested in cashing it out at some point so I at least know I have the money (if I retired early), but you take a huge tax hit for that which kind of sucks because I kind of consider it deferred income.

How do I factor this pension into how much money I'm technically ""saving"" for retirement and how does it impact my retirement date? And forgive me because I'm new at all of this, do not understand financial stuff and cannot do proper math for the life of me. 

Some additional background and my current situation-- I worked for the federal government for 2 years, switched to the provincial government and transferred my pension. There was a surplus so I was cashed out a bit. I was there for a year and now I am back at federal so I am faced with another pension transfer. I expect there will be a shortfall transferring back if I wanted to do a service buyback. I have been back 6 months and it's still early in the process because these things take forever, right? I don't think I'm interested in the service buyback because the surplus funds from the first transfer are sitting quite happily in my RRSP. I don't think a buyback is useful for someone who wants to retire early anyway?

The mentality in the government is very much, you work until your retirement date. I'd rather not do this. I also don't know if I'll work for the feds or the govt in general until whatever date I retire. I've already resigned from the feds once for a better opportunity and I would not hesitate to do it again if it was the right thing.",finance,1370608685
personalfinance,How to handle $30k student loan?,"Hey guys and gals. 

I'm currently doing my undergrad and have managed to rack up ~$31k in student loans. I probably have two years left (due to switching uni/field) but won't be taking any further loans.

 I basically took the loans because I couldn't get a job for the first few months of living in this (new) country and everyone kept telling me that it was the best loan you could possibly get, so why not?

The interest rate is at 2.7% at the moment. I'll have to start paying back as soon as I get a job after graduation (something like $180/month). 

Thing is, I have around $15k sitting in my checking account. I kinda want to use this money for investing but doing so while still in debt seems a bit wonky to me when I could get out of debt a lot sooner with this money.

personalfinance,How can I fix this so that I'm not ruined by the time I'm finished with school?,"Stumbled on this sub and am hoping someone can give me some feedback. I've gotten myself into quite a predicament, and I only see it getting worse. Most of it's not frivolous debt, but it's debt none the less. Had a 750 beacon with no debt, and thanks to a couple years of unfortunate circumstances, I'm now staring at ~14k in debt outside of student/car loans. Had a really sweet sports car that was costing me a grand a month in gas alone + $300/month ins and was costing me in repairs out of warranty, traded it on a civic w/ warranty and 3x the gas milage. Owe 10k, 1.9%. Found out in August that I was accepted to nursing school, started in september, was still working 40 hrs a week and not making ends meet...gave up my place about 2 months ago and am staying with family hoping to get on top of some bills - and my company slashed hours to &lt;30 thanks to the affordable care act changes. The hour cuts literally cost me all the money I was saving by moving in with family.   

Here's (generally) how it breaks down:  
* Credit card (3) - ~6400  
* credit line       - ~3000  
* Hospital/Drs    - ~4000  

Monthly bills (minimum, no food, toiletries, etc):  
* car payment    - 232  
* ins                 - 190 (hit 11 times &amp; it's a no-fault state)  
* phone             - 90  
* gas                 ~400  
* min payment to credit card/credit line ~375  

I make between 1300-1500/month after taxes. I cannot work more unless I get a second job, which I can't do. In a week I work 20hrs clinical rotations, 30 hrs at my job, spend 15hrs in lecture, and commute 60 mi each way 5-6 days/wk during rush hour. My homework load is insane so I already don't sleep much - getting a second job isn't an option. It's an accelerated program so we run through the summer too; taking a term off is considered quitting the program, which would leave me with my newly acquired student loans and no education. I expect to finish my RN december 2014.

I have negative money and really don't know what to do. The medical bills are starting to hit collections point, and I'm going to be screwed by the time I am done with school! A lady from the bank called to offer me a consolidation plan...then told me I didn't make enough money to qualify. My interest rates keep rising, my min payments keep rising, and my income keeps dropping. Also, I had surgery that went awry about a month ago and I've not been allowed to work since - and I'm not getting paid. 

I don't know what to do! Let it be and deal with it later? Try to find someone to consolidate? Please, any advice!

401(k) Stable Value Fund – 90-Day Equity Wash Provision
A wrap contract issuer for the MidAmerican Energy Stable Value Fund, one of the core investment options available in the 401(k) plan, is requiring the implementation of a 90-day equity wash provision, effective July 1, 2013. If you participate in the Self-Direct Brokerage account in the 401(k) plan, this new provision restricts the transfer of assets directly from the MidAmerican Energy Stable Value Fund into your Self-Direct Brokerage account.
 
Equity wash provisions require that assets in a stable value fund upon liquidation must be transferred to a noncompeting investment option outside a self-direct brokerage account for 90 days before the money can be transferred to a competing fund. Money market and short-term bond funds, which are accessible through a self-direct brokerage account, are considered competing funds. The 90-day equity wash provision has become a standard practice within the stable value industry due to the risk that participants may transfer assets from a stable value fund to a competing fund during a period of rising interest rates.
 
In the HomeServices 401(k) plan, all core investment options are considered noncompeting funds. Effective July 1, if you want to transfer assets from the MidAmerican Energy Stable Value Fund to any investment option in the Self-Direct Brokerage account, you will need to transfer the proceeds from the sale of the MidAmerican Energy Stable Value Fund into other core investment options. After 90 days, you then will be able to transfer the proceeds from the sale of that core investment option into your Self-Direct Brokerage account if you wish to do so.
 
Only transfers from the MidAmerican Energy Stable Value Fund to the Self-Direct Brokerage account are subject to the 90-day equity wash provision.

Bitcoin,Battle Over Bitcoin: China Backs US Startup Coinbase And US Falls Behind In Virtual Currencies.,"Indeed, virtual currencies are nothing new to the Chinese. For example, more than 100 million people on the social platform QQ have used the Q coin for more than 10 years. And after China’s state-run China Central Television, or CCTV, ran a half-hour-long documentary on bitcoins, downloads of apps for processing and “mining” bitcoins soared in the world’s second largest economy.

Bitcoin, long the plaything of the Western ubernerd, now appears poised to grow substantially in China and other markets, like the euro zone, where government meddling in native currency valuations has left many distrustful of the money in their bank accounts.

Americans don’t have this problem -- yet. And that may be a problem in itself. According to bitcoin proponents, if the U.S. tries to ignore the nascent currency, writing it off as a financial fad with less value than the seemingly stable dollar, Americans risk ceding to the Chinese and others control of the future of what could be the most disruptive force in monetary exchanges since the credit card. In turn, the dollar and the ability of the U.S. to navigate global currency conflicts could be seriously weakened.

“Here’s the bottom line: Bitcoin has much higher popularity outside the U.S. and much higher potential outside the U.S.,” observed Andreas M. Antonopoulos of the Bitcoin Foundation. “If you go to an American and say, ‘Hey, there’s this new thing, bitcoin,’ they say, ‘Well, what’s wrong with the dollar?’ That question is different in other countries.”

Bitcoins are a finite, Web-based currency created in 2009 by a group of hackers working under the nom-de-Internet Satoshi Nakamoto. Exactly 10,952,975 bitcoins are in circulation, all of which have been purchased on exchange networks or mined. The currency is mined using software that processes transactions on the bitcoin network, adding groups of transactions, called blocks, to the chain. Miners are paid about 25 bitcoins per block. That digital money can then be used to purchase a variety of goods online, from legitimate software to heroin on the infamous virtual black-market Silk Road.

Bitcoin surged in value to $266 last month, thrusting the currency into the mainstream spotlight as investment poured in from sources as diverse as the hapless Brothers Winklevoss (of Facebook infamy) and Union Capital Ventures principal Fred Wilson (an early investor in Zynga, Twitter, and Kickstarter). Suddenly, everyone was talking about buying bitcoins. But the bubble burst in late April, and in the U.S. at least, bitcoin faded from the news. That was not the case in China, where Antonopoulos said downloads of bitcoin clients have eclipsed those in the U.S.

Bitcoins are mined in several steps. After downloading a bitcoin client, such as Coinbase (which serves as a wallet in which to store the bits of code that constitute the digital money), miners often join pools where they share computing power to decode algorithms in which bitcoins are hidden. The concept of bitcoins and bitcoin mining is cryptic for many people, even some otherwise forward-thinking American investors. The irony is that, for now, American startups are leading the bitcoin charge, and the U.S. government was the first to issue guidance on using the currency as payment -- a seemingly tacit recognition of bitcoin’s validity as legal tender.

**Why China Poses A Threat**

Feng Li, the IDG partner who chose to fund Coinbase, said the Chinese have yearned for access to a virtual currency since the central government cracked down on the use of Q coins.

Q coins were introduced in March 2002 by Tencent Holdings Ltd. (HKG:0700), the parent company of the country’s most popular instant-messaging service, QQ , and they currently average an annual transaction value of more than 1 billion yuan ($163 million). That value is growing at about 15 to 25 percent each year.

Q coins, purchased with yuan, are predominantly used to buy virtual products and services in QQ and its related online games and social media. Originally, Tencent regulations prevented Q coins from being traded between users or converted back to yuan, but allowed users to trade points and purchase Q coins with their game accounts, then use the black market to convert them into cash. That caused concerns at the People’s Bank of China, China’s central bank. In January 2007, converting game points to Q coins was banned, and Tencent reiterated that Q coins constitute a product, not a currency, which seemed to satisfy the concerns.

“There has already been proof with the Q coin,” Feng said of the Chinese likeliness to start using bitcoin. “It’s been very well circulated and very well adopted.”

Already, shops on Taobao -- the Chinese equivalent to eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), owned by Alibaba.com Ltd. (HKG:1688) -- accept bitcoins as payment for goods, as does the similar service, Tencent’s PaiPai.com.

The Chinese are embracing bitcoins in other ways. The first bitcoin fund began to raise money in June, with the goal of raising 20 million yuan. The fund’s investment threshold is 10,000 yuan, and it will mature in four years.

Q coin’s popularity isn’t the only reason bitcoin has appeal in China. As it turns out, China is the perfect place for bitcoin mining. While much of the developed world is well into the transition from personal computers to mobile devices, China’s PC market is still thriving, which provides the necessary computing power to run a successful business converting electricity into mined coins. Price caps on electricity already create wasteful use of energy in China, so running a code-crunching computer for hours on end isn’t as costly an investment as it would be in the U.S. And so-called “gold-mining” or “gold-farming” businesses already exist in China’s cybersphere. None of that will come as a surprise to any “World of Warcraft” player: Gamers in Chinese urban sweatshops are known to sit in front of glowing blue screens for hours, slaughtering players in the game for their spoils or mining gold deposits found in the sprawling milieu of Blizzard Entertainment’s international blockbuster. Those treasures are then sold to players in the game for real money.

China has a heavily controlled currency, which also makes bitcoin attractive.  

“The more controlled the currency is, the harder the transactions are, the more friction there is in the national currency, the more appealing the coin is,” Antonopoulos said, noted that the most appealing place to use bitcoin would be a country whose economy is a veritable train wreck -- like Zimbabwe, except that the southern African nation lacks the necessary technology. “I would say China is perfect,” he said. “It’s got the penetration, it’s got the smartphones, it’s got the Internet and the people are familiar with virtual currencies. And, it’s got the not-as-appealing national currency.”

**Regulation In The U.S.**

Guidance issued in March by the U.S. Treasury Department said that companies issuing or exchanging online cash, including bitcoin, would be subject to the same scrutiny as traditional firms such as the Western Union Co. (NYSE:WU) to prevent money laundering.

Less than two months later, the Department of Homeland Security proved that edict had teeth.

Federal officials obtained a warrant Tuesday to seize an account tied to Mt.Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange company that handles about 80 percent of all bitcoin trades. Authorities accused Mt.Gox’s U.S. subsidiary, Mutum Sigillum LLC, of failing to register as a money-services company with the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. An account held by the online-payments firm Dwolla was subsequently seized.

Many feared the warrant execution could cast a chill over the bitcoin industry as a sector centered on a borderless, decentralized money came under the scrutiny of the federal government.

That proved not to be the case, Coinbase’s Ehrsam said. “For bitcoin to go mainstream, or as it goes mainstream, it will be used in a higher and higher amount of transactions,” he said, adding that Coinbase is registered as a money-services firm. “There’s no way there will be all this money flowing through an unregulated system.”

Chris Larsen -- the CEO of OpenCoin, a fellow San Francisco-based payment platform that processes most national currencies as well as bitcoin and its own virtual cash, Ripple -- agreed. “They definitely are regulating them, [and] we actually think that’s a really good thing for the industry,” he told IBTimes. “I thought the guidance was a good idea. One of the things the guidelines seem to make clear for the first time is that a virtual currency could be used for goods and services.”

**The Price Of Regulation**

But such regulation is a slippery slope, said Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

Perhaps it begins with measures to prevent money-laundering, he said. But what measures would the government take to prevent the untraceable currency from being used for child pornography or human trafficking?

“Bitcoin has the potential to be a disruptive technology that would be beneficial to the economy, and we don’t want to kill off that potential to get at the other potential for bad stuff,” he observed. Brito, who plans to speak next month at a conference on virtual currencies organized by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, added: “We’re already the first country to enforce money-laundering laws against bitcoin. But the U.S. would be shooting itself in the foot if it went too far [with regulations] and either outlawed bitcoin or made the legal guidelines impossible to comply with.”

**Will China Step In?**

So far, Chinese bitcoin merchants have little to fear. For many, the CCTV segment on bitcoin seemed to be a signal from Beijing, which heavily controls the channel’s content, that the currency is worth exploring.

Some of those interviewed speculated that the Communist Party wants to see bitcoin stockpiled in China, allowing the government to invest in it if, or when, the dollar is shaken from its perch as the world’s reserve currency.

It remains to be seen whether -- or, more likely, when -- China will intervene in the trade of bitcoin in its own economy. But for the U.S. to experience widespread adoption of the currency, which is considered a necessary step for gaining a grasp on the bitcoin market, limited government control will have to allow the money, like the Internet that birthed it, to develop organically.

investing,Question for the options traders!,"Hey all,

I've been studying put options for a while (and am experienced with having executed some long put/call strategies in the past for hedging purposes - I fully understand the purpose/risks of options), but now I'm doing some heavy research into this strategy:

http://www.cboe.com/micro/buywrite/Pap-AssetConsultingGroup-CBOE-Feb2012.pdf
http://www.cboe.com/micro/put/PutWriteMethodology.pdf


tl;dr: sell cash secured puts on an index to slowly (but consistently) profit from the slight mispricing of volatility (see page five [here](http://www.cboe.com/micro/put/PUTIndexEnnisKnupp.pdf)) that occurs at the start of every month on put options. This strategy has yielded annualised gains of 10.8% over 25 years, compared to 9.1% on the S&amp;P 500. The returns are also far less volatile.

My returns will be about the same as the above, if not higher - the amount I lose from brokerage and spreads will be more than offset from the higher returns on my cash compared to the interest rate received on the PUT index in the documents above. (much higher interest rates in Australia - the cash used as collateral was invested into treasury bonds in the index above).

I have a few questions that I'm sure some of you options gurus can help me with.

I plan to execute this strategy on the ASX 200 (XJO), which as of now is at 4800~ - if I were to write puts now (pretend this is the start of a fresh options month) - I would do so at a strike of 4800 (just below), and I would write no more put options than the cash I have backing my account (i.e. if I had 100k, I'd only write puts that give me an exposure of no more than 100k to the index).

The premium received every month is on average, ~1.6% of the index price. It's a bit higher now due to the volatility.

My questions are thus, all input would be much appreciated.

1. What are the option spreads like on the US markets? Is the spread 75/77 ridiculous (index is ~4800)?

2. Instead of writing put options that expose me to not more than 100% of my cash, if I wrote options that expose me to say, 150% (slight leverage - i.e. write options that expose me to 150k of the market with a cash backing of 100k), would this increase my returns by approx. 1.5x, or is there a tricky logical fallacy that I'm making here involving compounding? (I realise the interest from my cash stays the same - but both the option premium AND any loss from getting assigned are both increased by 1.5x - given the premium collected every year is ~6.1% greater than the loss in the overwhelming majority of years, this slight leverage could play well in increasing this gap to 9%+, is my reasoning anyway). I realise some people write 500k options over 100k cash backing, but 1.5x is the most risk I'm willing to take.

3. Any other pointers? Reckon this could work over the long term? I've tried my best to consider all fees and possibilities where this could go wrong. If another GFC happened right now, I would live to tell the tale - I'd outperform the market every month by a huge margin (as the VIX goes up, so does the option premium).

Thanks guys, much appreciated!",finance,1370776292

personalfinance,The more I learn about PF...the more I wish I didn't live in Minnesota...,"Guys, throw me a bone here. The further I read into my preparations for retirement...the worse Minnesota looks. I love this state and its people, but holy crap...the amount of taxes I'll be facing is astronomical, and it will greatly kick my retirement potential's ass.

If I go for Roth accounts...I pay MN income tax on top of fed tax...then it can grow tax free, lucky me...

If I go the traditional route for an IRA...I can avoid MN tax now, and possibly avoid it when I retire too by moving to a tax-friendly state, right? Which means it basically throws out Roth options for me in long term financial sense as I don't plan on staying in -30 degree weather until I die...

If I happen to out save my tax advantaged accounts (a good thing, right?), then I come to find out my lovely state will give me long-term capital gains taxes any time I re-balance those funds...along with the feds...this will shred me like steak on a fresh taco in Mexico.

Seriously, they tax me when I make it, tax me when I spend it, and tax me when I invest it (at a proportion greater than the initial damn income tax!).

To make matters worse, my DB plan...no matter where I move...will have my state sucking its income tax out of it until the day I die (God forbid they could at least give pension incomes a break).

What state should I move to? Seriously...I have a year contract to fulfill, then I am gone. I don't want to vest any more in a state that will make a comfortable retirement hell to reach.

I wish I would have accepted an offer I had in Wyoming...that state is like my hero right now. Higher pay for my work, a low, low retirement age possibility, no income tax, no capital gains tax, no sales tax on necessities, and it's friggin' beautiful.

&gt;But under current conditions, if they spend that $40,000 a year, adjusted for inflation, there is a 72 percent probability that they will run through their bond portfolio before they die

How is this true based on what the article is saying?

I'm thinking that's around the time the account is about to hit 0 based on a conservative portfolio. I could do some FV analysis but it seems reasonable even with a fairly low real interest rate. So if we take that as given, and even if we assume that if either of them lives to 95 they will need the 40k a year, I can't see how you get to a 72% chance of running out.

9/10*9/10=81% chance of NOT running out? 

My only thought is something about the average years. 20 years is less than 25, but if we use that figure it says 50% live past 85, so about 75% would run out if we assume the account would run out in 20 years. 

Am I just completely missing something? Thank you for any help.",finance,1370760750

gaming,[EVE Online] Goonswarm Federation (Something Awful) has declared war on Test Alliance Please Ignore (Reddit) and Test needs YOU!,"Announced on Thursday during the State of the Goonion, The Mittani (head of the Goons) has claimed that the Cluster Fuck Coalition (conglomeration of alliances, the CFC numbers around 40 000) is broke (not even close, they claim poverty but they're going to be exclusively fielding hilariously expensive doctrines) and as such they 'have no choice' but to take Fountain (home region for Test) for the newly seeded money moons (passive income) that came with the recent expansion.

[Transcription here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1ft06j/state_of_the_goonion_there_will_be_war/cadl3t4)

Just prior to the announcement Test services (jabber, mumble, forums) had been periodically going down. While the mumble and forums quickly came back up, our jabber was consistently ddos'd for the majority of the day effectively preventing us from immediately retaliating. This is no coincidence and is beyond low, regardless of whether or not it's an officially endorsed attack.

Now while Test is in a precarious position this isn't necessarily just a two front war (previously we were fighting to hold our secondary region, that campaign is now on hold) that will lead to our ousting. There are rumblings of other alliances that saw this announcement and immediately began to ponder how to take advantage of the situation to attack the CFC (they are very unpopular). Even Northern Coalition who the CFC were previously working with earlier in the week are talking about refocusing their efforts. Additionally there have been announcements of other low sec corporations and alliances moving down, if not necessarily to help Test but to shoot our enemies.

This is the war to end all wars and it's been boiling for the better part of the year now only just kicking off, this is the one that will drag all the major null sec power blocs and more to participate as two of the more despised entities come to blows. 

**I won't mince words, Test Alliance needs YOU**

I am in my mid-twenties, and I have $24500 in debt: $8500 on a credit card (I've been a young idiot, I know), and $16000 in student loans (and I have already gone through a consolidation).  I have recently committed to paying $300 (just less than double the minimum payment) towards my credit card every month (and I no longer use it at all), and I pay $200 towards my student loans every month (which currently sits at a $0 balance, with no payment ""due"" until 2019 because I am so far paid ahead).  I am very committed to paying down all my debt over the next several years, and I am in a good position (with no account for additional income: raises, bonuses, etc.) to do so.

Based on creditkarma, my credit utilization is at ""D"" (the limit is $9000, and until recently I relied heavily upon the card as a ""back-up"", which I now realize will kill me in the long term if I can't pay off the balance in full each month, and I am determined to get rid of it), my payment history is ""A"" (I have never missed a payment on any debt), my age of credit history is ""F"" (only 1 year and 9 months, although I have had my credit card since 2009?), total accounts is ""B"" (19 total, 15 closed, 4 open - 1 credit card, 3 student loans), credit inquiries ""B"" (1 hard inquiry), and derogatory remarks ""A"" (none).  My overall grade is a ""C"".

Also, am I going about repayment in the right way?  At the end of the year, my intent is to spend my (anticipated) bonus paying down my smallest student loan in full, and putting the rest towards my credit card debt (as it has the higher interest rate).  Any additional income, I shoot towards my debt, and while I have a very small savings account, I know that saving is not beneficial while I still have these debts to pay off, with interest accumulating.

gaming,[GameTect] - Game Recommendation Engine,"Hello /r/Gaming!

**I need your help**



I, like many of you who frequent this board, got fed up with always seeing the same exact games pop up on websites when I’m trying to find a new game to enjoy. Just because the majority of the market bought a specific game, doesn’t mean that it’s the right game for me. I have my own tastes in games, and it’s foolish to think that websites can predict what I’d like based on nothing else than sales volumes.



Let’s take a hypothetical example – 10,000 people love playing futuristic FPS games with lasers and jet packs, but hate historical shooters. Similarly, 10,000 people love playing historical shooters with muskets and gunpowder, but hate the ‘fake’ feel of futuristic FPS games. Websites today would recommend these games to the other group, purely because they’re FPS games, and a large enough number of players rated them highly. This logic is flawed! All games to the right player are 10/10, and this puts all recommendation engines in a position where they can only recommend based on volume of votes, and the lowest common denominator – genre – as this is the only information they have to go on.



Well, this drove me to work on a website called [GameTect](http://gametect.com). The idea was simple, make a website which will provide recommendations based on other user preferences. That way, nobody’s trying to constantly shove the top 10 in genre X or Y down my throat, and I only see recommendations from players who’ve actually played the games that I have, and have rated them similarly to me. The focus is on taking the concept of recommendations, and putting it into the hands of the community.



For the tech savvy – the engines are run on Slope One and ARM based algorithms.

For the common user – the engine associates games based on user ratings. If someone rates game A 10/10 and game B 9/10, when you come along and give game A 9/10, the system predicts that you’ll give game B 8/10 and recommends it to you. 
Again, this entire system is based off of user generated rating actions, which brings me full circle to my first point: **I need your help!**



To get a solid base of recommendations built up, the system needs data to make predictions. Without this data, it doesn’t know which games to recommend to which people. There’s no associations built up, and the entire system collapses. I need your help to feed the engine this data.



Please visit [GameTect](http://gametect.com), and start rating games. As many as you can. Remember that old classic you played in 1995 and loved? Rate it. Hated that crappy shooter? Rate it. Loved that obscure game that never really got off its feet? Rate it! 
My hope is that as the community gets behind this website, it will grow into an invaluable resource for players all over the world. Looking for your next time sink? Just hop on, tell the engine what you like and dislike and get personalised recommendations. 
Maintain your games library actively on the website by signing up, and come back to it adjusting your previous ratings as your tastes and impressions change. Right now the engine is limited to PC games, and includes 7,559 titles, stretching all the way back to 1980! There's a bunch of boxart that's still missing which should be in within the next two days, so you may see quite a bit of placeholder boxart images.



 

**TL;DR** – I’ve developed a user driven game recommendation website. The engine needs data to generate recommendations, and I need your help to feed it this data. Visit [GameTect](http://gametect.com), sign up, start rating games, maintain your games library, and submit any issues you encounter.

I had to take out the Government loans as well as private loans. I have a question about my private loans. As you can see here, http://imgur.com/VqNoVJK, this shows my principal balances, interest rates, and current interest accumulated. 

 The 13.250% loan has a fixed interest rate, the others are variable. I would really like to pay off both my private and government loans as soon as possible, and I am trying to figure out the best way to do it.

 I am a little confused over the wording of the paperwork I have on them. For the loan I took out in 2009, the wording about prepayment is ""Prepayment will not result in a penalty. If you choose to pre-pay, you will not be entitled to a refund of any loan origination fees or any finance charges accrued through the date of repayment"" Does this mean, if I were to pay it off, I would only need to pay the current interest and the principal balance? The paperwork says that I would end up paying around $19,344 if I pay it over the 15 years, but if I pay it off sooner, I would pay less?

The other 3 loans have different wording. ""If you pay off your loan early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge"". To me, that seems like, even if you pay it off earlier, you would still need to pay all of the interest that would have accumulated over 15 years. Are my thoughts correct? 

Also, considering all this information, how should I go about paying back my loans? I have $27,000 in government loans, + interest, plus these private loans.

gaming,"Ensuring the Sustainability and Continued Growth of Esports, from the Perspective of an LoL Player","Hi y'all, I'm rahulthewaffle!  This post is a 3-part essay on what I believe are crucial steps that esports should take to ensure and significantly expand current growth rates.  Happy reading!

First, a bit of context about myself, feel free skip to below the line if you don't feel like patting my ego (jk).  Long wall of text, I know, but there's a mediocre (as all TL;DR's are, I believe) TL;DR at the end, never fear.

I'm a soon-to-be senior Civil and Environmental Engineering and Community, Environment, and Planning dual degree student at the University of Washington through the Early Entrance Program.  I've been playing games since I was 5, starting with Halo at an older friend's house (which my mom promptly disallowed me from doing when she watched some), Lego.com games, and at 6, Starcraft and BW (campaign mostly, cheat codes galore).  Since then I've pretty consistently played games on PC, dipping into the GCube at 9 and returning to PC when I built my first computer at 12.  When I started college after 8th grade, I got into Mass Effect 2/3, TF2, and eventually, LoL.  Oh, that was a fun freshman year, trying to not fail my classes from playing too much league.  So, yeah, I love video games, but I also love school.  Which leads to the next bit:

My background in writing this post.

I'm a founding (and current) officer as well as webmaster and event coordinator for the Union of Purple Caster Minions, a League of Legends student organization registered with the University of Washington.  (Shameless plug: feel free to join us, if you're from/in the area, at www.facebook.com/groups/uwupcm) We're 2 years old at this point, and have a little over 800 members.  Some of our successful routines: We organize regular triweekly to monthly online tournaments with prizing, host monthly social events for members to meet each other IRL (the horror, I know), and work closely with the Micrsoft Store in the UVillage neighbourhood to run biweekly LAN's.  My thoughts aren't necessarily representative of the group or its officers, but they are the product of my experience with the group as well as the sheer care and passion for LoL and esports I have built up over the last 2 years.

Esports is treated like a dream come true, but as  a result, confidence in the scene isn't actually that large.  Scandals, such as the emerging Azubu one that was posted on TL and korean web sites, don't help either.

Esports needs to stop treating itself like a dream, and instead like a reality whose existence is as concrete as any other sport.  Flashy lights and EDM are good, as are fancy stages, but if we hear tragic stories like that of MRN, I can't help but have my doubts about esports' future.  LCS (League of Legends Championship Series) cannot market itself as a battle to the death, as it did during Spring playoffs, but a battle for victory, with reasonable emphasis on solidarity and respect amongst players.  Likewise, the amateur scene needs to have some massive steroids.  Players need solid options for continuing their careers beyond the main pro circuits, as well as clear exit strategies for moving beyond esports participation.

One way to treat itself as a legitimate sport and a solid, successful commercial model, is to increase visibility to non-gaming audiences.  Esports needs to a phenomenon larger than those already in the community, it cannot happen in its own bubble.

---

Ironically, one of the largest obstacles to playing multiple esports titles or for a non-gamer to become a gamer, is the very difficulty curve necessary for an evolving and growing competitive scene.

A simple tutorial teaching you how to right click to move and attack and buy items, is far from enough.  Bots are great too, but ultimately don't train the same level of reactiveness, conscious decision-making, and self-awareness that fighting players does, since beating bots often relies on stale pattern-recognition (not to rule out the importance of pattern-recognition altogether from PvP).

There are two solutions (answering respective challenges) I can think of to fill the gap between introductory mechanics and self-sufficient/self-aware reasoning skills.

1) The Challenge: It seems to me that the danger posed by advanced tutorials, which Riot has been tremendously conscious of, is that it results in a stale meta.  You don't want to fully teach players how to think and play, or many won't do the thinking themselves, and the metagame won't grow or evolve at a rate that is sufficient for esports to thrive.

The Solution: Highlight community-created tutorial content, such as leagueoflegends.wikia.com, the blog A DIFFerent View, or Stonewall's recent ""Reading a Lane: A Ganker Necessity"" article.  It's important to be providing links to this content from the game's official channels (e.g., leagueoflegends.com or lolesports.com), preferably through a specific portal for instructional content.  The benefit of this is that new players can not only received staged content into advanced levels of play, but grasp the concept of a dynamic meta, the methods of reasoning that inform it and can in turn be used to successfully diverge from it.

I do not think it is smart to group these connections under a general community portal with other material, such as GD or fanart, for the sake of maintaining focus and reducing the difficulty of accessing relevant information.  It's probably a good idea to archive links with tags about media format, difficulty, date, and possibly more (again, making information directly accessible and digestible).

I feel like I'm getting to much into the micro-level decision making, where my reasoning isn't necessarily as sound (due to my lack of experience compared to another guy who's been in the industry and on the ground level of esports for several years), so I'll move on to the next Challenge/Solution pair.

2) The Challenge: Esports titles by and large require mechanical skill to play well (the requirements get ridiculous at pro levels), whether it's Street Fighter, Starcraft, Fifa, Counter Strike, or League of Legends.  We've seen notable exceptions to this rule, such as Civ IV or Total War, but those are pretty rare and usually still have some sort of minimum bar.  Of course, improving mechanics is the same everywhere, whether it's in music or gaming, and all it takes is practice.  The question, then, is how to get the amount of practice necessary for ""solid"" mechanics to an acceptable level that doesn't detract from the game('s more exciting features).

The Solution: Mechanics drills!  Starcraft 2: HotS had an amazing series of mechanics drills, I think their structuring, particularly the challenge system, is great.  Every game I've run into can be distilled into a series of core mechanics, and creating controlled environments with *optional and multiple* difficulties for the purpose of strengthening individual mechanics is one of the best ways to reduce the time it takes to learn them.

For example, compare (even if not the SC2 ones specifically, just conceptually what they represent) such drills' efficiency to learning mechanics in normal PvP games, where you're in a mad juggling contest of countless mechanics and various levels of decision-making.  I know countless LoL players that, even after 300 normals, still have not mastered the ability of getting at least 120 minion kills by 20 minutes as a non-support laner, let alone the 150-200 levels that pro players typically get.  I myself was one of these people!  I know people that love the concept behind an ad carry, but give up on the role, because they always fail for reasons they don't know, when the actual cause is a lack of knowledge of necessary mechanics, let alone having practiced them.

Here are some examples of potential LoL mechanics drills:

* Last hitting in a lane of choice, with (opt-out) indestructible towers, and a 5, 10, and a 20 minute target cs count
* Kiting an over fed melee bot as an ad carry, trying to score a set number of hits without dying (an orbwalking drill)
* Bots walking through a static player's ability range, trying to land a chosen skill on a chosen champion with the least delay (reaction training)

Note that none of these tools involved a simplification or alteration of game mechanics.  A balance of complexity and depth is important for a title's success, as numerous Riot Devs before, so the goal is to create accessibility without removing these aspects.

---

Crucial to the growth of gaming and esports is diversifying esports with multiple genres and titles, and creating unified esports platforms.  By a ""unified esports platform"", I mean an evolved venue WCG or Dreamhack, coupled with a persistent experience.  Even something as simple as a cross-esports news broadcast would be a good move towards this latter goal.  Some clear benefits are as follows:

1) increases cross-game interactions and shares user bases between titles

2) pools available capital and increases the visibility and benefits of sponsorships and advertisements for the corporations that supplied them

3) provides infrastructure and presentation values for smaller scenes to scale up

and 4) eliminates/reduces toxic conflicts between different game community, instead emphasizing solidarity and respect between gamers.

---

As promised in the intro, the mediocre TL;DR (Just sniping the core conclusions from my post, not the reasoning):

Esports needs to treat itself as a stable reality rather than a dream come true.

Esports needs to make conscious efforts towards increasing accessibility for new players and gamers, but only by providing tools external to the game, not through the integration of handicaps into gameplay.

Esports needs to have a diverse set of titles and genres, with prominent platform(s) and venue(s) for unified esports experiences.",technology,1370852225

It was the statement released by Microsoft about the whole used games, how you can let supposed friends use it and even about the Kinnect.. Well for those of you (like myself also) that used to love xbox and was telling ourselves that is PS4  doesnt mess up , that we will buy that instead.. well let me tell you this..
I BELIEVE Sony will pull the exact same CRAP!!

I made a post a few days ago that got totally ignored on here, about how we should be writing the publishers and standing outside retailers, instead of calling on the deaf ears of MS.

Well in the IGN article, MS keeps saying small comments about (based on their partners yada yada..) Meaning the game publishers.. 

My point is, IF the publisher are on board with this MS crap. (which they obviously are because they hate used games and want money on something they already sold the public once) Then SONY will HAVE to do the exact same thing MS is doing!!
They have to because they sell the games of these same publisher!

So be prepared for SONY to either hurt your feelings on E3 or to lie and avoid the whole subject!

personalfinance,Purchase a Geothermal system or invest?,"I will be moving in the next few years and in my next home I am playing with the idea of installing a Geothermal HVAC &amp; Water Heater. Typically such a system will cost around $20,000. After federal and local tax credits it would actually cost $11,000 (30% federal tax credit and $3,000 local tax credit).

I plan on saving to purchase most if not all of the system in cash rather than financing. Even so, $11,000 is quite a sum of money and I wonder if I would be better off taking that money and investing somehow. What would you do?

According to the website [energysage.com](http://www.energysage.com/why-clean-energy/its-a-great-investment) energy costs have consistently risen 5 to 10% per year and 
&gt;""The returns you receive from your clean energy system are savings, not income, so they are not subjected to federal or state income taxes. That means more money goes into your pocket and stays there. How much more money? Depending on your tax bracket, your clean energy system will deliver 20-35% more money in your pocket than would a taxable mutual fund investment earning a comparable rate of return. "" 

and that 
&gt;""...estimates that for every $1 saved in energy costs, the value of a home increases by $20.""

I know I would like to stay in my next home for at least 10 years. The sustainability aspect of the technology is very attractive to me, and the heat pump is very energy efficient. Further protecting myself from energy cost fluctuations and volatility with solar power is also a very attractive option, though I would take that one further down the line. 

**Summary:** I am wondering if the amount of money saved by installing a geothermal HVAC &amp; water heater would be greater than the amount of income the cost of the system could potentially generate in an investment of some type. What are your thoughts? 

I know there are many factors that contribute to a situation like this but I am trying to keep my post concise. Please feel free to be elaborate in your answer as to what would make you make your decision and why, even if I didn't touch on any of your points in my post. Thank you!",finance,1370836702
personalfinance,Debating income-based vs 10 year plan to pay off my loans. The numbers are pretty close and I could use some advice.,"Graduated from school last summer with $148,000 of student loans (135,000 at 6.8% and 13,000 at 4.5%, all federal loans)

Income: My degree is in optometry, I currently work for a practice through a W2 making 85k with benefits (4 10 hour days) and also filling in every Sat and every other Sun at a commercial location on a 1099 for around 32k per year, totaling about 117k. 

Over the last 12 months I've made around 80k because I was temporarily an hourly employee for a while and didnt have the second job. 

Payments: On a 10 year plan, my monthly payment is 1,667 or so, since the start of repayment 8 months ago I've averaged about 3,300 per month and the loan is now around 125,000. 

Living situation: Sharing a 1500 per month apartment in California with long term girlfriend. She is also an optometrist and makes around 90k per year. She has around 25k in loans left. She'll be saving for a house and starting a bit of a retirement fund for her parents (who paid for most of her optometry school). Living within our means, not really any time for vacations right now. 

My strategy has been keeping a 5k emergency fund and pretty much moving any amount of money over that towards the loan because my mentality is that my bank is giving me 0.1% and the loan is going against me at 6.8%. 

If i continued at this pace, I'd be done in around 3.5 years. That sounds great but what I'm doing is not sustainable. My full time job is already enough work and doing the weekend thing is just draining on top of that. I also want to get married and have kids and things. 

Many of my classmates are doing income based repayment. They are thinking that averaging around 100k per year of income for 20 years would be around 200k at 10%. Of course 200k over 20 years would be so much easier to start my live up than 165ish (including interest) over 5-6 years. The problem then of course becomes that at the end of 20 years they'd have to pay 50-80k in taxes on the amount forgiven. It's for this reason that I'm continuing my payment plan as of now.

What concerns me is all this talk of student loan reform. If I were to make all these sacrifices to pay off my loan in 5-6 years and then see that other people who had stretched it out of 20 years benefit from some future law would really make me angry. 

If I did income-based I'd be putting 30-40k per year extra towards a down payment for a house so we'd be able to move to our own home 3-4 years faster and I presume my general quality of life would be greatly improved. 

So do you guys think there will actually be any major changes to student loan repayment in the near future to make me consider switching over or would it be better to just get it over with?",finance,1370836154

personalfinance,Former employer's pension plan is offering lump sum payment. What should I do?,"I worked for a non-profit company based out of Scottsdale, AZ for 7.5 years from 1990-1997. They had a pension plan, in which I became fully vested after 7 years. Since then, I have received annual updates concerning the plan. I worked for a non-profit, so the money I was going to receive during retirement wasn't huge, but it was something. (I have lots of savings in my current 401(k) plan and a Roth IRA, so this is not my only retirement plan). 

I recently received a letter from Transamerica Retirement Solutions offering me ""a limited time opportunity to elect a lump sum payment representing the value of my vested accrued pension benefit under the Plan."" I have the option to:

* receive the money in cash

* transfer it into a 401(k) or eligible IRA

* take an immediate annuity which pays ~$65/mo. for the rest of my life and a smaller amount to my wife if she lives longer than me. (This seems like the weakest option to me and my wife).

*FYI: The lump sum value is $19,300.*

**I'm looking for a bit of advice and have a few questions.**

1. Why would my former company offer this lump sum payment option? Is there a benefit to them?

2. If I leave the money in the pension plan, what kind of rate of return will I earn? Is it lower than I could get by simply putting it into an Index fund in a 401(k) or IRA? 

3. Is there any risk to leaving the money in the existing Pension Plan? 

4. The paperwork I received states that if I take the lump sum payment in cash, the company will withhold 20% for federal taxes. I am assuming that this is not the full amount of tax that I will owe, since I am in a higher tax bracket normally. Correct?

**Here is what I am considering:**

A) Take the lump sum payment. Pay off my car (I owe about $14k). Buy a slightly used, new-to-us minivan for my wife. Our current minivan is 14 years old with 175,000 miles, so this is something we have been planning for. However, we don't want 2 car payments, so we have been holding off on this purchase. 

B) Transfer the money to an IRA or 401(k) for future retirement needs. This is kind of my preference.

So being the curious critter that I am, I decided, hell - it's my lunch break might as well log into my live account here at work to see if I can grab any more details. After some tedious account pw resetting (my live email is one I had set up around '07 that I'm not actively using)... I notice my inbox is stuffed with messages marked urgent from Microsoft. Upon further digging I realized that they have been trying to auto-renew my Gold subscription for about 20 days now on a credit card that FUCKING EXPIRED in 2012. First of all I think the fact that auto-renewal is turned on immediately after purchasing Gold is sketchy as hell, but I've actually been hit with that before so whatever -- shame on me. What really pisses me off is that I'm now on the hook for 59.99$ despite the fact that every time they've charged me since 5/21 (the day my live subscription ran dry) my card has declined the transaction BECAUSE ITS FUCKING EXPIRED. I'm not saying I wouldn't have bought at least another few months of live before the PS4 comes out, hell it's my dumbass fault for not checking that email and realizing my gold was nearly up. I know for a fact when I call those shitdicks tomorrow, someone is going to tell me ""Oh we're sorry, but since we've already charged it to you, you're still going to have to pay the 60$ for another year"". I'm so freaking tired of your bullshit microsoft. I switched away from playstation because of the reputable nature of live, and will now be leaving because your system fucks customers over.

gaming,"Some Perspective on the Whole, ""PS4 vs. XBOX"" thing.","Please note that this isn't an endorsement for either side, but rather some background information to give those of you who don't understand some perspective. 

In my opinion, Microsoft made a logical move with their new software for the XBOX. They were trying to be like Steam, but due to bad marketing and implementation it blew up in their faces in the worst way possible.

The ball has always been in Sony's court. ALWAYS. Since the Playstation was released, they have controlled every aspect of it's distribution and market. Sony, as you may or may not know, is not just a game-console company. They make TV's, DVD players, DVD's themselves, and about a hundred other little different bits of technology. People scoffed at the VHS, Sony made the VHS, and had contracts with movie studios to get their movies released on VHS only. They did the same thing with DVD. They control both sides of the production. Why is this important? 

Blue Ray. 

Blue ray was probably one of the dumbest concepts for a digital media storage device ever. It looked exactly like a DVD, required a special  player, and enhanced very little (in regards to scale from VHS to DVD) in the terms of the media itself. Why did Blue Ray succeed? 

Sony owns the production of both blue-ray players, the copyright on blue ray technology, and the actual blue-rays themselves. All they have to do is stop making DVD players, get companies to release their movies in blue-ray format, and boom. Now you have an entire market created from thin air. Sony makes money on both ends of the sale. 

Microsoft is a software company. Until recently they've tried developing hardware, but to limited success. Microsoft LOSES money to SONY in the console market because Sony ultimately makes the disks XBox games come on. In order to wrestle control away and retain more of the profits, cloud purchases were the next logical step. They just fucked it up. 

Here's what Microsoft could have done right to succeed. 

1. Make video game stores obsolete by offering the entire catalog online, as digital purchases. This way, retailers are near-completely cut out of the picture. Microsoft gets to keep more of the profits. 

2. Create a PC-based counterpart to the online service for PC releases, redundancy backups, and social features. 

3. Make the online service free. Use the money they are saving to make the online service free to use. 

4. Tie all games to user accounts, and only allow one account to be logged in per-box at a time. If you want to ""share"" a game with a friend, go over to their place and log into your account. Downloaded games will be saved to the HDD, but will be unable to be played if the logged-in account doesn't have the key. 

5. Make Games playable offline. I know you're thinking, but this will lead to people sharing accounts and having entire catalogs for free. Well yes, but they will only be able to play them on single player, something which doesn't really hurt the industry too bad anyway. You could technically do the same thing with Steam, but they don't have a widespread problem with it because they have made their distribution system easy, which is the ultimate counter to piracy. 

6. Get rid of the kinect and keep it as a peripheral. The kinect is not going to happen. Stop trying to make it happen. 

7. Instead of selling used games or some other bullshit. Established a trading platform for games. It's not the same, granted, but it does give games that ""re-useability"" factor. Besides, everyone complains they don't get enough for their games anyway.",technology,1370969676
business,The Hindenburg Omen,"Ominous Signs?

Humans are a superstitious race, probably a primitive hangover resulting from certain developments heralding other, larger events. The Hindenburg Omen that presages the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has just been sighted. Because global stock markets rise and fall together, these sightings do not bode well.

Hindenburg Omen

Designed by Jim Miekka in 1995, this phenomenon is a type of technical analysis premised on the belief that if a substantial number of stocks set new annual highs and other considerable number of stocks record new annual lows, something is wrong. Markets demonstrate uniformity – they either move upwards or downwards, not both ways simultaneously.

Named after the 1937 crash of the German Zeppilin Hindenburg, an event that permanently destroyed the then infant airship travel industry, the Hindenburg Omen is activated when two separate days that are within 36 trading days of one another report the occurrence of all the following four conditions:

Number of securities that set new 52-week highs and new 52-week lows on one trading day is greater than 2.8% of all the securities traded on that same day
Number of securities that form new 52-week highs on a trading day is not greater than twice the number of securities that form new 52-week lows on the same day. However, the reverse is a valid condition i.e. number of 52-week lows can be greater than twice the number of 52-week highs
The value of the NYSE index on that day is greater than what it was 50 trading days ago
Negative McClellan Oscillator on that very day. This oscillator is the difference between the number of rising stocks and the number of falling stocks
There is some difference of opinion on the difference of duration between such days. Some analysts suggest 30 days while some recommend 36 days. Be as it may, markets can crash within 40 days of this omen. Stock markets across the globe have been rising and falling together since 2003 and this trend has further strengthened since 2008.

This year, two such days were witnessed – April 15 and May 29. This suggests a global stock market crash is round the corner. Or is it? From 1987 and before 2008, the indicator accurately predicted major market declines. However, its success percentage is mere 25%.

In 2010, this omen failed miserably when stocks actually went up despite its occurrence. This was on account of exchange traded funds (ETF) creating new highs and lows. This omen-indicator was created when ETFs were not very significant. ETFs have severely restricted its applicability.

Other Alarm Bells

There are other factors that may send the global stock markets down the deflationary spiral such as a possible slowdown or discontinuation of the $85 billion per month quantitative easing (QE) or money printing exercise by the Fed. This boosts the American and by extension the global stock markets.

When central banks print new money and purchase treasury bonds money supply increases. Investors have cash but cannot purchase the already purchased and highly regarded treasury bonds. The money then flows to stock markets and boosts them. Compulsions of a global bubble economy will, however, prevent central banks from discontinuing such QE.

Finally

It is better to be prepared so long as the cost of preparation is a fraction of the losses due to inaction. Although the Hindenburg Omen is not very accurate, it does provide an indicator. After all, no one wants to be on the wrong side when global markets collapse somewhere in 2013-14. How ready are you?",finance,1370969558

I've been looking around a bit and love a lot of the advice I have been seeing. I have learned some new things, but I have also gotten more confused. 

My thought always was pay down all debt before I start investing, since I thought all debt interest rates would be higher than investment interest rates (my thought process was: if you could get more interest in investment than debt, then you would just borrow a bunch of money to use as investment and viola, infinite money, which is obviously not possible, therefore the ""get more interest in investment than debt"" assumption must always be false). But looking around, that seems to not ALWAYS be the case. 

Recently, I have seen a lot about Roth IRAs, which I know very little about, but I have heard get pretty good rate of return (8%?).

Car Loan: **11K** at **0%** if paid off in the next 6 months (a gift from my parents)

Student Loan A: **5432** at **3.4%**

Student Loan B: **17500** at **6.8%**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**My Goals:**

**&lt;5 yrs**

Pay off my loans to my parents

Establish credit (no really bad things here other than my student loan debt, but 0 good things on here yet either. I think I have a not too great credit score at the moment). 

Save 6-12 mo expenses for emergencies

Buy a condo/townhome (preferable) or very small (2B) house (unlikely).

**5-10 yrs**

Pay for a wedding

Start a family. 

Move into a house to accommodate that family

Potentially allow my wife flexibility with her job options (ie stay home with the kids if she wants to...I would like that to be financially possible). 

**25-30 yrs**

Pay for my kids' college education. I was very fortunate in getting substantial help from my parents (~50K) and I would like to be able to do that for all of my kids. 

**30-45 yrs** 

Retire. I would like have some flexibility when I get that old. I don't know that I would enjoy early retirement like so many people here talk about, but I might enjoy a career change or something like that. Semi-retirement (work 6-9 months out of the year) would actually be really appealing to the 21 y/o me, but this is a long way off. Point is, I would like to have options here. 

----------------------------------------------------

I'm already contributing to my 401K at the max my company will match (6%) and plan to take advantage of the ESPP to the max and sell the day I buy (10% discount). But as for everything else, my strategy was/is not very investment savy. 

**My (naive) strategy**

Save 1 mo emergency fund [~1mo]

Pay off car loans first [~3 mo] (nonnegotiable first step. its my way of saying thank you to my parents)

Pay student loans off (B, then A) [~1yr]

Save 6 mo emergency fun [~6 mo]

Get down payment for condo (Seattle area, 100K-120K, 24K down) [~9mo]

???????Invest????????????

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR**

**I guess my question is, emergency fund contributions aside, should I prolong my debt payments and invest the money I would use to pay towards that in something like a Roth IRA? Or overall what would be the best strategy to take? I'm kinda lost in the sea of options.**",finance,1370945165

I understand in an ideal situation this is not when most young couples should think they are ready to purchase a home, but I am wondering if buying now with a lower interest rate would offset the drawbacks in the long run of having to purchase a home with PMI since we do not have a down payment.

###+ $30 off w/ promo code EMCXPXN54, ends 6/13. Ends today. $79!!


So, in Febuary I picked up the case. The thing is nothing short of gorgeous when it comes to [aesthetics to the eye](http://legitreviews.com/images/reviews/2020/Define_R4_62.jpg). Inside and out, it is pure beauty. 

At [sub-$110](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811352020), you can't go wrong.

I'm going to quickly cover the case and why I think it's amazing, but I'd really like to touch on why I think the company is amazing.

**The Case**

* ***Build Quality***  -  I cannot say anything bad about the build quality here. The sound dampening material is the same stuff I have seen in studios, which is pretty amazing considering the price point on this. Solid construction I must say.

* ***Cooling Abilities*** - I have ran the 800D with my current build, everything the same. The difference here is this case is half the size of the monster Obsidian, and it is because of that that I switched to this mid tower. The cooling on these is very much close in comparison. I am running a 6gb 7970 OC GHZ edition, no Overclock except for how it came. I am running at roughly 39c at idle, and I max at 58c under load. In the Obsidian, I would be 1-2 degrees below that at load. Nothing much here.

* ***Cable Guiding*** - The read side of the case has amazing cabling options. Again comparable to the massive 800D.

* ***Quiet*** - Other than the blue LED on the front, which isn't so bright it lights up your room like a daft punk concert, you would never know this thing is running. I can put my ear literally next to it and not hear it.


* ***Overall Thoughts*** - Great case, perfect size for a mid tower in my opinion. Opening the door there is only 2 optical drive slots, and the rest is fine. That is the ONLY downside I have seen to this case. Now, I don't run an optical drive so that is not a problem for me. I install all my OS from USB obviously. This is 2013. Not 1999.

**The Company**

Okay, so here is where shit gets awesome. Fractal Design is what every company should strive for in customer service. Quick breakdown, the front of the case is removable, and it set in place by locking plastic columns. It works great, but Amazon fucked up their shipping and it came broken. Okay, fine. In fact it still held on amazingly well with only 2 of the 6 prongs, but I am one of these people who think if it isn't perfect I have to fix it.

So I call up FD. Someone answers the phone on the second ring. No machine, no bullshit. Dude is amazingly nice. I told him my situation, he asked which case, and said hold just oooone second. 20 seconds later he is on the line ""Yep, we got them available I'm gonna send you right now. What is your address?"". What? Seriously? Free? No fucking way!! Give dude my address, 30 minutes later I have an email with tracking info from fed ex. This was last Friday. 20 minutes before closing. It's Wednesday, and here it is.

[Proof](http://i.imgur.com/gMxvMqj.jpg).

So yeah, that is my spiel. Bitchin' case, bitchin' company.. Awesome fucking people. I seriously suggest you guys give anything these dudes make a try and if in the area stop by and ask them if you can touch their dicks. Just because that's how much you care.",technology,1371063264

My question is, would you guys recommend recommend paying off the student loans and being completely debt free? The rate on the loans are low, at 3.25%. Combined, the Mrs. and I, have 100k in our 401k, which isn't great for early 30s, but we've been better at it. Neither of us get a match, and the last two years we've been able to max it out after we paid off our consumer debts.

I'd like to pay off everything so I will never be beholden to a Bank again. My wife thinks we should squirrel the money away because, at least for the time being, I'm doing 3x better than the interest rate. To me that's a red herring with the whims of Washington policies.

personalfinance,Rolling over 403b to Roth IRA; and where to save a small amount of cash,"I'm in my first job, and have &lt;20K my 403b account. Employer does not match. I realize now I probably should have opened a Roth IRA instead, but I was just focused on starting the job and it was easy to open the 403b. In 3 years my income will markedly increase above the Roth contribution limit (and into a higher tax bracket).  Is it worth it now to try and roll the 403b to a Roth IRA (or traditional IRA), or should I continue to contribute to the 403b over the next 3 years? I guess I would have to pay taxes when I roll over? Should I stop contributing to the 430b, not roll over, but just open a new Roth IRA to use for the next 3 years? I definitely wouldn't be able to max out the IRA contribution limit. 

Another random question. My wife has some savings bonds that are beginning to mature, and she will be cashing them in for a final value of about $600 a year each year over the next 10 years (thanks Grandma!). I know its not a lot of money, but we have no need for it in our immediate expenses, so figure it should go into some sort of savings. Is it best to a) throw it at our ridiculous student loan balance b) put it in short term savings (0.8% interest rate), 3) put it in her 403b or my retirement account (403b/potential IRA).",finance,1371059164

gaming,WHY Xbox One's offline mode only lasts 24 hours. And no - it's not because they hate all the consumers and want to take your rights,"A lot of people are furious that Xbox One's offline mode only lasts 24 goes, as compared to PS4's and Wii U's lasting forever. But this decision isn't arbitrary - in fact, if they didn't have this, it would be awful for the industry.


The ability so install games is a huge part of Xbox One and is part of our society's movement away from discs: Pretty much no one uses discs for music anymore, and while buying movie discs is still fairly popular, people probably stream or download movies more often. The only market that hasn't moved there is games (except on Steam). Now, if Microsoft didn't include a disc port in their console, people would rage even harder than they already are. Thus, they chose the happy medium: game installs that store your games to the cloud. You can still buy discs, but once you install the game you don't need it anymore. So, if you're playing Halo and your friend wants you to play COD: Ghosts, you can just hit join, instead of saving, quitting, going to the dashboard, ejecting the disc, getting the Ghosts disc, putting it in, starting up the game, and then joining. It allows for a console that is much more future-proofed. However, that comes with a price: If people are able to play offline forever, then there is an easy way to get games for free. Let me give you an example. Dead Rising 3 comes out and one guy with 15 friends gets it on Xbox One. He gives it to his friend to install, who gives it to the next one, and so on. If all those people can play offline forever, then you have 15 people who just got Dead Rising 3 for free. When they want to go back online, they can just uninstall so they can beat the game without ever paying for it. By making the offline mode on Xbox One only lasts 24 hours, this prevents people from exploiting this feature of the console and to keep Microsoft and developers from losing ridiculous amounts of money.

**Tl;dr if Offline Mode lasted forever, then everybody could get games for free and both the devs and MS would lose tons of money.**",technology,1371054609

personalfinance,Advice on paying for medical school,"Hi all,

I currently have ~$35,000 in undergraduate loans that I still have to pay, but I can defer payment on these until I finish medical school. The problem is, medical school will cost $52,000/yr, of which only ~$40,000 can be paid for in federal stafford loans (~6% interest rate, unsubsidized). The other $12,000, as well as any living expenses, must be paid for alternatively. I am allowed to take any amount in GradPLUS loans, but those are also unsubsidized and have a 7.9% interest rate, so I was hoping to avoid this if possible. 

I know the way that people try to justify the cost of medical education is by saying that I will be making enough money afterwards to pay this off easily. However, for the three years I will spend as a medical resident, I will only be making ~50,000/yr, and it will be a total of 7 years from today until I will be making a high salary, and all the while I will be accumulating interest on my loans. 

I was wondering, how would r/personal finance handle my situation? Does anybody know of private lenders who finance education at better rates? I was also looking into doing something like purchasing a home and taking out homeowner's loans to apply towards my education if the interest rate is lower, but I'm not sure how that would work either.

I don't have an emergency fund (I know, this will have you hating me right away!) and I'm focusing on paying down debt. I feel that my employment is secure enough at the moment that I'd prefer to pay down debt and invest and save the emergency fund for later. Feel free to chime in on this, though.

I am 25 years old.

**Salary**

Annual salary = ~$29800

I'm moving to a new position soon which will make my annual salary $36000 with much more opportunity for professional growth.

**Personal Debt**

CC = ~$5500 (I'll have to check on this but most likely mid or upper teens interest rate)

Auto Loan = ~$17000 @ 3.14% (can possibly refinance through my credit union in the coming months - does anyone have experience with that?)

**Assets**

Checking = ~$300 (I usually put most of my after-expenses check towards my CC debt)

401k = ~$2175 (company matches to 3%, currently contributing 3% to get match)

Roth IRA = ~$550 (not invested, kind of dead weight right now because apparently index funds require a minimum of a few thousand. I realize that I could invest in them with a minimum monthly contribution, but want your input on whether this money would be better put towards my CC debt first - clearly this should outperform my auto loan)

So my questions are these:

* Am I attacking this correctly, aiming for my CC balance first?

* Should I withdraw what I have in my Roth IRA (however little) to help with that? Math says yes due to the difference in interest, right? (that is, prioritize paying down CC, then pay minimum monthly payment on auto loan while investing that extra money instead)

* As I said, I'd like to focus on going out less. Are there any other seemingly simple changes I can make to pay this off aggressively?

I realize how this looks, and I do admit that I have spent more than I should have in the past, but a good portion of that CC debt is due to my last car, which was a money pit. Not trying to make excuses, but I feel that besides my habit of going out to eat/get drinks, my spending elsewhere is moderately in check.

Please ask any questions you may have.

Haben Sie sich jemals gefragt, warum bei mehr als 40 Millionen Amerikaner von Lebensmittelmarken sind, Millionen von Häusern ausgeschlossen und Millionen mehr Arbeitslose, gibt es kaum sozialer Unruhen in den USA?

In der Europäischen Union die wirtschaftliche Lage ist ebenso düster, aber wieder gibt es kaum sozialer Unruhen. Sicher gab es Demonstrationen, aber es ist überdeutlich, dass die Menschen in diesen Ländern keine Ahnung, die eigentlichen Schuldigen, die ihnen solche Armut und Not leiden verursacht haben und warum gab es keine massiven Rettungsaktionen für sie.

Es wurden Hunderttausende von Presseartikeln auf der globalen Finanz-Tsunami und viele haben darauf hingewiesen, die Betrügereien von Banken und anderen Finanzinstituten geführt in Sätzen wie ""Occupy Wall Street"" verübt. Aber solche Proteste waren nicht tragbar und wurden auch weitgehend von genau den Leuten, die diese finanzielle Scams betroffen wurden nicht unterstützt.

Bitten Sie jeder Schuldner, warum hat er keine Maßnahmen ergriffen, und er würde wahrscheinlich sagen, dass er wirklich nicht klagen, wie er war verschuldet und konnte die Schulden nicht bezahlt, und so muss er die Folgen, sei es Konkurs oder Zwangsvollstreckungen. Das ist die Antwort eines typischen Gehirnwäsche Schuldners!

Justiz stellte sich bereitwillig einen Blind-Augen vor diesen kriminellen Aktivitäten.

personalfinance,Really screwed up my credit years ago. Almost in a position to work towards fixing it. What should I do?,"Pertinent content below the **bold** line. Backstory here. 

So a couple days ago, I made a post about [saving for a new car](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fx20h/want_to_buy_a_new_relative_to_current_car_dont/). 

Recently, I've thought about this and a better credit score would benefit me much more than a new car at my current point in life. 

I've never had much in the way of a ""good example"" for finances in my life. My parents always spent more than they had and if something (cable, electric, gas) got shut off they'd go to another company or use the other parent's name. With my allowance, basically if I didn't spend it as soon as I got it, my dad would tell me he needed it to buy food with and make me feel guilty, then turn around and buy alcohol. So as soon as I got it, basically, I had to spend it or risk losing it. There's a whole different mess of issues with that, but they aren't /r/PF matters. 

Obviously, this messed me up pretty good. When I was first out on my own, I got a few credit cards, student loans, and payday loans because ""Free money? How can this be a bad thing?"" Shortly after this, I lost my job and had no way to pay everything back. I just kinda gave up because, well, someone would fix it for me just like they had for my parents for years. 

Fast forward about 8 years

So now, my credit is Fucked, with a capital FUCKED. Last time it was pulled, it was about 450. My last car loan rate was 35.9%. Granted, it was only a 1yr loan on a $5500 car, but that was still a bloody lot. $1700 if it hadn't been for a fellow redditor helping me get the 0% for 10mo discount. My car before that was 26%, with a co-signer. My insurance is (I expect) higher than it should be. Can't get a co-signer, have to beg friends and family for throw-away furniture/electronics, things like that. 
*****
**PERTINENT INFORMATION FOLLOWS**

Starting in December, I'll have roughly $300 each month that won't be ""for"" anything. Which, unless I have a plan in place well before then, I'll end up spending on useless crap that I want but don't need like new graphics cards, replacing ""vanity"" car parts, etc. 

So my biggest questions: 

* First: Should I focus on killing debt first, or building a ""safety net"" of a few months? I'm living with family, so I'm sure they wouldn't kick me out at the first sign of trouble, but I also know from siblings experience they won't put up with a jobless bum for more than a few months. 

* My bank has a financial planner. He'll ""meet for free"", which I assume means a free consultation followed by fee or commission based assistance. Should I consult with him? 

* If not, is it more helpful to pay higher or lower balances first? I was a dumb kid and don't have any financial documents to tell what interest rates are on each. Is there a way I can get these? 

* I'm also defaulted on student loans. Pay those first, or unsecured? 

* Should I save and pay off the whole loan, or pay as much to the balance as I can? Should I try to ""cut a deal"" with the creditors to get a ""paid in full"" for lower than the total?

* I have a repo'd car on my credit from about a year ago. Is there any way to get rid of this, or am I just screwed? Car was sold at auction, $2775 balance. 

* Again, about a year ago. My lease was up on my apartment. They had a $500 deposit, and a $500 bond insurance thing on my unit. I was assessed just under $30 to get the burners on the stove replaced before I moved out. The complex refused to give me anything in writing to this effect. Now, they claim I owe another $150 for carpeting, painting, etc. Is this worth fighting, giving up, or should I pay it? (Again, dumb. I should have demanded it in writing when I moved out. My life was crumbling, had just recently lost a GF and a job, and was like two days away from being homeless if I didn't move to a relative's house 300+ miles away.)

Income: 

* $1500/mo (Net. Paid bi-weekly)

Expenses: (Rounded up to the next dollar)

* $200/mo Rent
* $200/mo Gas (Don't really need $200, usually closer to $160. Still, overbudget so I can get to/from work because, well, work = money.)
* $94/mo Insurance
* ~$80/mo Lunch. (This is an approximation and one of the biggest places I can cut expenses.) Footnote below.
* $50/mo Phone payment (Can't get out. Parent's family plan. Contract)
* $20/mo Internet (Not willing to give up. Technically, part of my rent anyway)
* $15 World of Warcraft
* $15 SiriusXM. 
    I'm about to get rid of my WoW account as I don't really enjoy playing anymore, but I don't want to get rid of my Sirius account. It's negligible and they give me free months pretty regularly anyway. 
* I also buy a fair amount of beer. In general, $5/day daily. It's cheap beer, but still a lot of money over a month. This can be cut significantly too. Generally, comes out to $140/mo, plus the (rare, maybe once a week) day I buy more than usual. 

Concerning lunch: I don't eat breakfast, eat dinner with the family. It's supposed to pay for two dollar menu sandwiches and a drink Monday-Friday, but often I'll go to somewhere besides McD's and spend closer to $10 on lunch instead because who wants to eat Spicy McChicken or 95%-bread McDoubles every day? Prepping meals at home is difficult because I don't have a safe refrigerated area to keep things at work, the microwaveable dinners at Wal-Mart taste like ass, and the Chef Boyardee type microwaveable stuff leaves me bitchy with a headache. I'm open to suggestions to cut down on my food expenses here, but I'm a pretty picky eater. 

Until the end of November, I'm paying $400/mo on my car, because I want to get the loan paid off as quickly as possible, and that's what the guy that gave me the money and I agreed to. Ultimately, it's saving me $1500 and getting the loan paid off 6mo earlier than expected. Until August, I'm paying $100/mo on a computer that my grandparents put on their RC Willey card for me. (Again, I know. Dumb. I should have been paying my debts rather than getting a new computer. I recognize my bad decisions. I'm trying to make better ones now.) That $100 is then going to go to upkeep on my car. It's old, and it needs at least a new set of tires, brake light, oil change, AC recharge, new fuel filter, and possibly some other stuff. After the car is paid off in November, I want to put $100 away every month for emergencies, because I have terrible luck. That leave me with $1300/mo to put towards current bills, food, gas and debt payoff.

personalfinance,"My spouse and I will end up with about $75,000 after selling our house...","...and owe about $40,000 and $13,000 respectively on our student loans. Interest rates depend on the specific loan but they average around 6.5% last time I checked (a few months ago). We are both in our early thirties with one child just over a year and planning on having one or two more hopefully.

She also has about $15,000 in debt between her credit card (~$6000 @ 9%) and car loan (~$9000 @ 5%)

Our emergency fund is basically my credit card (limit is $12,000 at ~7%, currently a balance just less than $1000) and about $3000 in the checking accounts between us. To be totally honest, if something catastrophic happened, either of our parents could help for about $10,000 or $15,000 each. 

We close at the end of this month. Our next jobs are up in the air at the moment. In fact we are moving in with her parents while our jobs are in limbo. I currently have a $10/hr job in Charleston, SC but I'm up for a $75,000 to $80,000 per yr job in DC. Sounds weird I know, but I recently quit a job I hated to try and find something I had a passion for instead. This DC job would be perfect for me and in line with my qualifications. If I get it, we will probably rent somewhere close, and then look to move to a better public school district when our oldest approaches school age (about 2 more years until pre-K, 3 more years until K). If I get this DC job, my spouse will have a job paying around $22,000. If I don't get it, she'll keep her current job around $43,000 in Charleston.

My question is, what should we do with the $75,000? Save it to use as a down payment on a house in 2-3 years? Use it to pay of our debts? Some combination of the two, or something esle? We have an idea of what we want to do, but I'd love to hear y'alls opinion without inserting bias by elaborating on our thoughts. Thank you in advance!!",finance,1371011900

gaming,I think that Microsoft is actually saving our asses.,"*HEADS UP: This is pretty long. Please read most of it if you want to get the full argument I'm making. ""

Alright, I'd like to start with how appalled I am with this rise and continuation in hate against the Xbox One (X1). To have so many people hate on a console that they haven't played or to turn their back to a company that has been providing great games for over ten years, is absolutely disgusting and makes me hate the internet. That being said, I recognize all the complaints and I am mildly annoyed for the same reason other people are. But I really believe this is all one big misunderstanding between Microsoft and Half of the people on /r/gaming. 

To start of, let's discuss ALWAYS ONLINE

This is a weird thing to try and shove down the throat of your consumers. I mean, Microsoft can't expect people to just get internet for the X1 so why do it. Why ""force"" it? Why cut off a certain part of your consumer base? It because always online connectivity make many games better.

Think about a MMO RPG on the X1. Any developer would want to ""always online"" so they can constantly update their world and make the whole game a more persistent experience that constantly changes. So for this MMO RPG always online is GREAT! For shooters it allows faster updates to weapons balances and for social games it allows leader boards to be more accurate. What I've mentioned is only the stuff WE as ""modern gamers"" are familiar with. Imagine what a game developer could come up with knowing that whoever plays this game will be online. Developers no longer have to work with the restrictions of offline play, they can now do things we haven't seen before. ALL BECAUSE MICROSOFT IS FORCING ALWAYS ONLINE.

Secondly, Kinect, the new face of spying

Alright, let us just say how awful and what a piece of shit is the Kinect  on the 360. It's garbage and is clearly an attempt to appease to the ""core (hate this term) market"". The concept, on paper, was great but nah not working for us. So why would Microsoft FORCE IT DOWN UPON LIKE FIERY METEORS!? Because it makes games better.

Lets make a distinction between the X1's Kinect and the 360's. The kinect on the 360 is a hyped up webcam that is not very good. For some games it's cool but really it just sits there. It's not really utilized by any company for games because it's an inadequate piece of hardware for ""HARDCORE"" gamers. Also they know that many people don't have it (due to the first reason). The X1's kinect is a different story. It's one of the most accurate cameras on the market. It can sense the slightest hand movements, the wiggle of your mouth or the frowning of your brow. It's software is better than before and can recognize hundreds of commands. Yeah yeah but why does this matter? How does it make games better? Because it is a secondary input device.

The controller is a primary input device. You need to be aware of the controller in order to play 99% of games. You can't not have it. The kinect is a secondary input device meaning that it's presence would probably go unnoticed in an intense game. In fact the kinect would be in the background and would only record data. Since it's the new kinect, the amount of data about the player and the environment around said person is ENORMOUS and ACCURATE meaning that developers can make the movement the player does important. Let's say there is an LA Noire style game, where the player's face needs to be appropriate for the some dialogue in the game otherwise when a person is being interrogated, they wouldn't cooperate. So the player would control actions with the controller and selected text options but if the player wasn't looking the right way, the mission could turn down a different path. This is just one way game developers may use the kinect to further the experience, even in games where the traditional ""motion gaming"" isn't seen. AND Game developers may in fact use it in place you don't see normally because they KNOW that every console has said kinect. I feel that the kinect could potentially send gaming into a new and IMMERSIVE place that will be very interesting to see in the coming future. 

All of this being said, my theory is Microsoft (years ago) went to some of the major game developers and pitched an idea. They pitched a console with always online and the kinect. And the Game Developers loved it. Why? because they have less restrictions in their game, they can create persistent and constantly updating world and have another device to record and use data from that doesn't take away from the controller's central role. I feel the Game Developers gave the big thumbs up and Microsoft went to work. Along they thought about what to give the consumer with the console. They know that the BIG GAME DEVELOPERS are developing games with this stuff in mind. So they made every come as one with no choice. 

This is where i say why all of this stuff is because FORCED DOWN OUR THROATS AND IS RUINING HARDCORE GAMING!

Because if you didn't have those things, you couldn't play the games anyways....

Imagine if you didn't have the kinect for the LA Noire game I was talking about. You would lose a significant portion of the experience. Imagine playing an MMO RPG without the MMO. It's like play a 360 game without the X button or the start button.

By FORCING these changes Microsoft allows to make up our minds and purchase either a console that is pushing the limits of what we know is gaming or purchase one that has just made upgrades. Obviously the second one is a safer choice but nothing in gaming has been about being safe. It's about pushing the limits of what we can create and of what we can do. If you don't have internet access don't buy an X1. Not because Microsoft is preventing you from doing so but because you just wouldn't enjoy the full experience that game developers are trying to create for you.

Thanks or reading if you got this far. I really appreciate it, no matter what side you are on (even if I'm the only guy on my side). To let people know I'm 16 years old and I live in Mass. I don't know anyone in Microsoft or anywhere. I'm just fed up of this gross hate spewing from the internet. 

Thanks.

Also I want to stress that I don't believe Microsoft made any of these decisions lightly nor did any of the game developers. If I made it seem that way, it's not true. I only did to save space and convey an idea.

TL:DR Microsoft is saving us from a buying a console that we wouldn't be able to get the full experience from.

news,Debunking Edward Snowden’s Critics,"by Daniel Noe, Faith Issues

I just want to say unequivocally that 29 year-old NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is a hero. I wish we had many more people like him (and Bradley Manning and Julian Assange, but that’s for another time), not fewer. He is a genuine patriot. He has done far more to bring accountability to government than ANY current Republican Congressman or Senator who sticks his chest out and says he believes in “limited government” and “the Constitution.”

Of course, there are many who hold the exact opposite view, that he is a traitor and not a hero. Such people include conservative commentators (!), retired military officials, and a number of Republicans and Democrats in Congress.

Try as I might to understand their objections to the invaluable service Mr. Snowden provided our country, they just don’t make any sense.

Here, in no particular order, I will debunk the most pointed arguments his critics have leveled at him:

1. “He’s a high school dropout.”

This is just ridiculous, and a blatant personal attack. And this is only said to distract the listener or reader from learning about what it is Snowden really did. If it is wrong to drop out of high school, why didn’t these guys criticize Princess Diana? What about Thomas Edison? Benjamin Franklin? Albert Einstein? All these people dropped out of high school too, and that had no long-term effect on their character now, did it? 

2. “He has endangered national security.”

Keep in mind that “national security” is an ambiguous phrase that is nowhere to be found in the Declaration of Independence or our Constitution. It pretty much means whatever a fearmongering, warmongering politician (like Lindsey Graham or John McCain) wants it to mean. In other words, it is a term that can easily be used to manipulate people into giving up their freedom. For over a decade, the American people (probably one of the most gullible in the world) have happily traded their liberty for security. And to quote Benjamin Franklin (one of my favorite Founding Fathers): “They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” Personally, I would much rather die a free person from terrorists than live under a tyrannical, fascist government that knows my every move.

3. “He has broken the law. He violated his agreement/oath to keep this information secret.”

I have a question for the people who make this claim: What if a law is unjust? Were abolitionists wrong to hide slaves just because slavery was the law of the land in America in the 1800s? Was Oskar Schindler wrong to hide Jews just because Adolf Hitler said that to do so was wrong? Was Sophie Scholl wrong in exposing the horrors of the Nazi government with her fellow patriots in the White Rose non-violent resistance group? I do fear that many of the authoritarians calling for Snowden’s head (who essentially believe anything the government says no matter what it does) would support the Nazis and the pro-slavery politicians if they lived in a different time. Obey the powers that be, right guys?

Another question: What about Mr. Snowden’s oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America (specifically the Fourth Amendment, which states that “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”)? Turns out Edward was just following this oath and did not forget it, unlike 99.99 % of the other people (it seems) who “take” the oath.

Oh, and the government violated ITS agreement (the Constitution) with the American people first! Why don’t Snowden’s critics stand up for the rule of law? Why? Why is it his defenders who are doing so instead?

4. “He has fled to Communist China.”

Mr. Snowden has actually fled to Hong Kong. Surprisingly, the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank says that Hong Kong is the freest country in the world, even freer than the “land of the free,” the good old USA. Heritage adds that Hong Kong, despite technically being a ” Special Administrative Region” of China, “is self-governing on a day-to-day basis and enjoys a wide range of freedoms under a mini-constitution known as the Basic Law.” Nice try guys!

5. “He has aided our enemies.”

This is a statement with absolutely no substance to back it up. He did not sell secrets to what his critics would refer to as “our enemies.” They have presented no evidence with this charge. Furthermore, they essentially believe that the US government is NOT the greatest threat to our liberties, an absurd statement judging by how fascistic and totalitarian America has become since the beginning of the “war on terror.” In a way, Edward aided the greatest enemy to tyranny: an informed and alert public.

6. “These NSA programs are entirely legitimate. Besides I don’t have anything to hide. I’ve done nothing illegal.”

Many who supported the Patriot Act while it was being “debated” in 2001 said the same thing. Keep in mind, however, that it is not illegal to have imtimate relations with your spouse. It is not illegal to have an enlarged prostate or an overactive bladder or irritable bowel syndrome. It is not illegal to have cancer or other health issues. It is not illegal to keep money in a bank in a specific account. It is not even illegal to have an affair! But, just because you “did nothing illegal”, does that mean you really don’t care if the world knows such personal information? I challenge the people who still make such an argument to voluntarily disclose their sexual habits, health concerns, and bank account information. I mean, they have nothing to hide, right?

As Michael Rozeff explains:

""We do not want privacy only to conceal our wrong-doings. That’s why this argument fails. We want privacy for a host of other reasons that have nothing to do with hiding wrongs. We do not put up curtains or draw the shades to conceal wrongs. We do not keep our financial affairs to ourselves to hide crimes. We don’t conceal our social security numbers from people because we’re doing something wrong. We don’t invite anyone and everyone to listen in to our conversations, and it’s not because we’re plotting crimes. Does a child want his parents to broadcast his or her grades in school to everyone? Do children want their parents to tell everyone their habits and their imperfections? Children want privacy as much as adults. It comes natural. The demand for privacy has very, very little to do with concealing wrongs.""

7. “He should have used the proper channels to communicate his concerns.”

As Sheldon Richman of the Future of Freedom Foundation explains:

""Director of National Intelligence James Clapper says Snowden should have used established channels to raise his concerns, but there are no effective channels. Members of the congressional intelligence committees are prohibited from telling the public what they learn from their briefings. Two members of the Senate committee, Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, for years have warned — without disclosing secrets — that the Obama administration is interpreting the Patriot Act and related laws far more broadly than was ever intended by those who voted for those pieces of legislation. Their warnings have made no difference.""

""A court challenge wasn’t open to Snowden either. Glenn Greenwald, who published Snowden’s leaks in the Guardian, notes that for years the ACLU has tried to challenge the surveillance programs in court on Fourth Amendment grounds, but the Obama administration has blocked the effort by arguing that the ACLU has no standing to bring the suit. It’s a classic Catch-22. Since the surveillance is secret, no one can know if he has been spied on. But if no one knows, no one can go into court claiming to be a victim, and the government will argue that therefore the plaintiff has no standing to challenge the surveillance. Well played, Obama administration.""     

8. “He should turn himself in.”

Like Obama is really going to give this guy a fair trial, after how he literally caught the government with its pants down?! However, jurors can still acquit Snowden if they believe that the laws he was being prosecuted under were thought to be unjust! Ever heard of jury nullification? If not, read more about this perfectly legal (yet underrated) concept here.

9. “These NSA programs don’t break any laws. There is no evidence the NSA did any wrongdoing.”

Um, have they not heard of the Fourth Amendment? The spying done by the NSA is WARRANTLESS. That means it is illegal! End of story. Furthermore, it’s sad how some will justify these programs by taking every single word the official government’s website says about them as gospel.

Frankly, it’s a downright shame many will think that Edward Snowden is the enemy and not the federal government.

I believe that every single man and woman who works in government at any level has a moral obligation to expose clearly corrupt and unethical behavior by government officials, irregardless of what the law says. In fact, in the hundreds of thousands of pages of laws on the books, I wouldn’t be surprised that there just might be a long-forgotten about legal obligation as well.

A truly free society needs a government in which whistleblowers should have no qualms coming forward with immoral behavior being committed by “our” leaders. How else will government really be held accountable? Elections? Congress? The Courts? Been there, done that.

We are no different than communist Russia if we allow the government to spy on us (regardless of the reason they give, such as “keeping us safe.”) Remember what Ben Franklin said.

financialindependence,The Fisherman and the Banker,"This was from Buddhist Bootcamp today. 
____________________________________________
One summer, many years ago, a banker was vacationing in a small village on the coast. He saw a fisherman in a small boat by the pier with a handful of fish that he had just caught. The businessman asked him how long it took him to catch the fish, and the man said he was out on the water for only a couple of hours.

“So why didn’t you stay out there longer to catch more fish?” asked the businessman.

The fisherman said he catches just enough to feed his family every day, and then comes back.

“But it’s only 2 p.m.!” said the banker, “What do you do with the rest of your time?”

The fisherman smiled and said, “Well, I sleep late every day, then fish a little, go home, play with my children, take a nap in the afternoon, then stroll into the village each evening with my wife, relax, play the guitar with our friends, laugh and sing late into the night. I have a full and wonderful life.”

The banker scoffed at the young man, “Well, I’m a businessman from New York! Let me tell you what you should do instead of wasting your life like this! You should catch more fish to sell to others, and then buy a bigger boat with the money you make so you can catch even more fish!”

“And then what?” asked the fisherman. 

The banker’s eyes got all big as he enthusiastically explained, “You can then buy a whole fleet of fishing boats, run a business, and make a ton of money!”

“And then what?” asked the fisherman again, and the banker threw his hands in the air and said, “You’d be worth a million! You can then leave this small town, move to the city, and manage your enterprise from there!”

“How long would all this take?” asked the fisherman. “Fifteen to twenty years!” replied the banker.

“And then what?”

The banker laughed and said, “That’s the best part. You can then sell your business, move to a small village, sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take naps in the afternoon, go for an evening stroll with your wife after dinner, relax, sing, and play the guitar with your friends. You would have a full and wonderful life!”

The fisherman smiled at the banker, quietly gathered his catch, and walked away.

personalfinance,A little help climbing out of debt,"Hi all. So basically, my wife and I make just over six figures combined (for about the last year or so), net income of about $6100/month, which fluctuates a little because part of my wife's income is commission based. Due to a combination of overspending, reliance on credit cards (I know we were stupid, please don't judge!) not sticking to a strict budget, and also some unexpected medical bills, we are completely mired in debt. We have about $13k debt spread over 5 different credit cards; we have a 5 year personal loan of about $3k left; 2 cars (both leases); I have $10k student loan debt, she has $~50k. We have a $1430/month mortgage, and some other assorted medical bills with no interest.

I guess my question is, what is the best way to go about resolving this? We have canceled monthly things we don't need (i.e. xm radio, unused gym memberships) but that only totaled about $50/month. I got rid of my expensive Jeep and got a leased car, which is saving us $230/month and has double the gas mileage. We stopped going out to eat and are spending very little if anything on personal/material stuff. But I guess the problem is here: minimum payments (which I know don't get you anywhere) of credit cards, personal loans and medical payment plans total about $720/month.  If you factor in student loans too, that number skyrockets to $1181/month on nothing but minimum debt payments! Ye Gods. 

What else can we do? What is the best way to attack this? Hit the high balances first, or knock out the ones with lower balances to get them down to zero quickly and eliminate the monthly payment? Do it based on interest rate? Should we consider debt consolidation? I have also stopped putting money into savings and 401k (not that I was contributing much) so we are afloat for now. In a sunny day scenario, we should have $800-1,000 left every month after ALL expenses, minimums, groceries, etc. But it never seems to work out that way. All of this debt is creating a lot of stress so anyone's thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.

This is my newest (and very un-fun budget). I want to get my student loans paid off as quickly as possible (at least my private loans).

They all have variable interest rates, the highest being 9.25% and the lowest at 3.96%. Average of 6.164% I'm making an additional payment of $818 a month on the loan with the highest interest rate.  Which literally zero's out every single cent I have every month. I also know that July 1 variable interest rates change, and this worries me greatly. 

According to mint.com &amp; WhatsTheCost.com at my current rate I will have all 5 loans paid off on Nov. 1st of 2016 (assuming interest rates pretty much stay the same). I got to keep telling myself this is a marathon &amp; not a sprint, but even though 2016 is a lot better than then 10-25 year note some of them have, I HATE owing money. 

Now, after saying all of that. I did/do not have good money role models and I have no clue what to do about retirement.

personalfinance,Purchasing new home (being built) with FHA. Concerned about rising interest rates. What do? (more inside),"My wife and I are purchasing our first house (FHA loan). It's part of a new development and, as fate would have it, it's the last one scheduled for construction. We're supposed to break ground in the next couple of weeks, and should be ready by October.

We started this process back in January and when we spec'd everything out, the mortgage was going to be a bit on the high side, but still affordable. Since then, interest rates have shot up quite a bit. I'm concerned that by the time we're able to lock in our rate, the house may no longer be affordable for us. For clarification on this, the question of affordability is more about not being able to have enough of a cushion after all of our expenses to accomplish our savings/retirement plan goals.

We contacted the mortgage company and they said that we could lock in the rate now, but it would cost us $4800 (non-refundable). With all of the other expenses that we were preparing for with the house (moving, landscaping, etc.) we just don't have $4800 lying around. Plus, if interest rates came back down, we would've just paid $4800 for the privilege of getting a higher interest rate than what we could've gotten by doing nothing.

I'm pretty sure that we can't break our contract with the builders, either, on the basis that rising interest rates would make the mortgage 'uncomfortable' for us. So, if we decided to just bail, we'd be out our deposit ($8500). 

On the other hand, real estate has really jumped in our area lately, and we've seen/heard that the houses in the community have already appreciated by $30k-40k since we entered our contract. So, my thought is that if interest rates did make the house somewhat unaffordable for us, perhaps we could just wait for everything to close and then turn around and sell it, cashing in on the increased value. But, I'm not sure if we could do this with FHA or what the tax implications might be.

Any advice would be appreciated..",finance,1371137026

In fact, as I write this, I'm in the middle of emailing documents and wiring money to buy a rental house.
But that's a subject for a later article.
Anyway, when it come to buying a home and getting the right mortgage, you have to be wise.

How to Be Mortgage Smart- Do's and Dont's for Buying a Home 
 
If not, it's very easy to find yourself in a huge bind that you didn't expect because you didn't take the time to fully understand what you were getting into.


Learning to Be Mortgage Smart
So today I'm going to show you how to be mortgage smart when buying a house.
I'll cover what I believe are the best mortgages possible as well as the worst.  
Let's start with the worst first.
These are mortgage pitfalls that are easy to get into because they sound attractive, but can cause you big problems in the long run.
•	No Down Payment Mortgage-  A 100% mortgage with no down payment is very risky.  It comes with a higher interest rate as well as the privilege of paying Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) which costs around $100 per $100,000 borrowed.  You end up paying a ton of interest and PMI because you didn't save up for a down payment.  That causes you to waste tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.  Anytime you buy a house and you don't have any money, you're putting yourself at risk.  You really can't afford the house.
•	A Low Down Payment Mortgage-  These are only a little better than a 100% down mortgage.  You still pay PMI and a higher interest rate.  The only difference is that you put a little skin in the game in the form of a small down payment (maybe 3%).  Because of this it takes a loooong time to really gain any equity.  These types of mortgages include VA loans and FHA loans.  They sound good on the surface, but aren't ideal in the long run because of the higher interest rates, fees, and PMI

•	Interest Only Mortgage-  These loans are attractive for the low payments.  The problem is that the first few years of payments go toward paying back interest before any equity is paid.  Because of that, it could literally take over a decade of paying interest before you start gaining any equity in the property whatsoever.  Think about it, a decade of payments with nothing to show for it.  This is bad, bad mojo.  Never do an interest only loan, you'll live to regret it.
•	Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM)-  With an ARM, they hook you in with a low interest rate in the beginning.  But after a certain time period, the rate you pay fluctuates according to market conditions.  The result is that your house payment can go up by hundreds of dollars very suddenly, putting you in a huge bind.  Don't do this kind of loan, EVER!

How to Be Smart About Getting a Mortgage
Now that you know what to avoid, let's talk about how to be smart about getting a mortgage that won't put you at a major financial disadvantage.
Of course, preaching against debt like I do, I believe the 100% down plan (paying cash) is best.  
But hey, even though more people do it than you might think, it's not something most people are willing to tackle.
If you can do it great.  If not, it pays to be mortgage wise and do a few basic things.
•	Have a Substantial Down Payment- Why?  It proves you are disciplined enough to save your money and keeps you from having to borrow as much.  Your down payment should be 10% at the very minimum, but 20% is much better.  20% allows you to avoid PMI payments as well as thousands in interest over the life of the loan.
•	Get a fixed Rate Loan-  You should get a fixed rate loan of no more than 15 years.  Less if possible.  The shorter the term of the loan, the more money you save.  Compared to a 30 year loan, a loan of 15 years or less will save you tens of thousands to over a hundred thousand dollars during the life of the loan.
•	No More Than 25% of Your Take Home Pay-  Your house payment should be 25 % of your monthly take home pay or less.  Any more than that can drain money away from other necessary things in your budget.  It also gives you a some leeway if your income goes down for a period of time.


Know What You're Getting Into
Remember, buying a house is usually the largest purchase you will ever make.  If you use a mortgage to finance that purchase, it pays to be mortgage smart and know what you're getting into.  It will save you tons of money and potential stress in the long run, guaranteed!

gaming,Is Microsoft really that dumb?,"First off, I am having a good laugh along with the rest of Reddit with all the Microsoft hate (I own all consoles, so I currently don't take sides this generation), but I can't help but scratch my head at Microsoft's action plan. Do we really think they are dumb enough to lose this battle before it has begun? Does anyone else anticipate some ""giving in"" on MS's part? Maybe some changes due to ""The People Have Spoke"" kind of movement? Perhaps a price drop?

I'm with the majority here saying they've done goofed, but I can't help but think they aren't dumb enough to commit financial suicide in the gaming market.

Perhaps it all comes down to Sony originally having the same ideas, gathered some insider information from within MS and changed tactics ASAP. I find it fascinating that this coming generation's success could possibly be based on consumer wants and desires in terms of features.

Does anyone have any other theories pertaining to this situation? Clearly PS4 is the most desirable console right now - but do you think everything they announced was originally planned? Or do you think they are now rushing to reverse the same ideas MS had on the Xbox One?

I'm hardly a MS fanboy: MS has done enough to bone consumers for a while, and I'm tired of their intrusive ways (ads when I pay premium, possibility of Kinect spying on people, etc). I can't, however, grasp how easily they are slipping away from their fanbase. What's their makeup plan? Buy every third party developer and have a monopoly on Exclusives?

I want to invest more but I also have a house mortgage. I'm wondering if it is a better investment to use my spare cash pay off the mortgage (to reduce interest payments and thereby putting money in my pocket) versus using that spare cash to invest.

I suppose the answer might be 'it depends', in that the right investment could grow far more than the interest payments I need to make, especially considering the interest rates and how big they are (or aren't).

I suppose too I could make an RRSP contribution and invest that, and then use the tax deduction towards the mortgage, and try to do both.

gaming,Xbox One explained and why I support it,"I know that a lot of you old Xbox 360 fans are moving to the ps4 because of all of its ""Bad"" qualities, but if you actually read about it, it's not really that bad.

For those people who have no access to the internet and won't be able to play the Xbox One I feel sorry for you, I really do but for people with access to the internet there really is no problem.

With the always online rule, that is not true, you only need to connect to the internet once in 24 hours, which is not bad at all because when you turn on your current Xbox 360, you automatically connect to the internet.

And with the kinect always watching you rule, there is an option to turn off the always on setting so you don't have to worry about the Kinect spying on you 24/7.

lastly with the games rule, if you have more than one person who uses your console, you can connect them to your games library so they can play it too, and since games are downloaded to your hard drive you are able to play all of your games without having to insert a disc, so if you go to a friends house who also has an Xbox One, you can take the disc and play it at your friends house while someone else can play the exact same game on your console at the same time as long as you have access to the internet.

Also with the used games rule, you are able to return used games, but each game can only be traded in once, and once you trade it in, you won't be able to play it on your console again.

I know that Microsoft have really stuffed up with the Xbox One and I don't blame you if you want to change to the PS4, but for those who simply believe what they hear, I suggest you research it first.

And yes I will be getting an Xbox One.

gaming,The console that I will purchase will be...,"...chosen several months after both the XBone and PS4 launch.

Full Disclosure:  I have purchased both the XBox and 360, and have been quite satisfied with both.  I have never considered buying a PS in the past.

So I don't really consider myself a fanboy as such.  I believe that there are plenty of great titles available on both MS and Sony's current and past consoles, and that the owners of those systems and games enjoy them very much.  

Why did I pick XBox back in the day?  I honestly can't remember what particular game it was, but overall, I found that I enjoyed it enough to make MS my default choice for the next iteration, when the choice was 360 vs. PS3.  No regrets.  I did wait until the first price drop before picking up my first 360 (red ringed that mofo with Mass Effect.  Fantastic game until EA skullf***ed the franchise, being the final straw that has put EA on my permanent blacklist, but I digress).

So now, a new cycle in the console wars is about to start, and its time to start spending our hard earned consumer dollars on the next big thing.  These are the things that I know for certain:

1.  I am only going to purchase one console.  I will not dump north of $800 (just the consoles, never mind the cost of controllers and other peripherals) in order to somehow extract more fun.  

2.  I am not going to purchase a new console anywhere near launch date.  I might not wait until a price drop, but I want to see how things roll out, and I can certainly put the purchase off for several months without suffering any ill effects.

3.  I will probably buy lots of titles.  There are several gamers in my household, and the attach rate has been pretty high, especially with the 360 in comparison to the original XB.  I anticipate that the attach rate will be as high, if not higher with my next console purchase.

4.  I no longer have a default choice as to which console I will buy.  Based on what I have seen so far from MS with respect to the conditions of use of the XBone, I am concerned.

Given these things, I really do want to sit back a bit and see how things pan out over the first few fiscal quarters after launch.  Will MS back off on any of their unpopular policies before launch?  After launch?  Will they hold their ground and somehow prove the world wrong?  Will it be a giant clusterf**k?  Will there be any blunders out of the Sony camp?  

Whatever happens, I still won't purchase right away.  I intend to give both MS and Sony a chance to show me how things are going, well after the pre-launch hype is over.  After that, I will choose, and as I said, I will only buy one of the two.

As far as my decision goes, I have shifted from a position of XBox by default to neutral.  That was mostly due to what MS presented.  Sony just offered about 100 more reasons (USD) to keep shifting my position.

So, MS has plenty of time to shift my position back.  It should be fun to watch how it all pans out.",technology,1371104931

I'm coming from a different angle in saying that I'm about to start taking out loans, and I'm trying to make that pile of money I will owe at the end of it all as small as possible. I see a lot of people in a jam with crappy interest rates and the like, so I would like to avoid that if possible, which is why I'm coming to you.

I just finished undergrad (luckily debt free), I am about to start graduate school in August to pursue a Ph.D, which means I have about 5 years of education to pay for in front of me. If I'm lucky I will get some jobs, fellowships, paid internships, and the like as I go through the process, but I'd like to plan as if I wont so I am prepared for the worst case scenario. In my case, that means around $15k a semester in tuition a semester, plus summer classes, plus room/board and other various expenses. Overall, I'm looking at $200,000 in student loans that I will need to take out over the course of my higher education.
I'm not terribly worried about getting them paid off once I get out of school, but I figure the more I can do on the front end the better!
I'm offered Stafford Unsubsidized loans for the time being at 6.8%, but I know I will reach the cap ($138,500) and that may not cover it all in the end, even with me being frugal and finding other jobs/tuition breaks/sources of income.

I want to hear what you all have to say on private loans and loaners so I can learn from your experiences. I've seen some rates from Wells Fargo, Sallie Mae, Discover, and Suntrust (I have those numbers). I was hoping people could relay some of their experiences with these companies (or others!), provide tips to get a low interest rate or any other advice for someone in my position. It would be much appreciated from someone who is just trying to not freak out in the face of all that debt!

However, I used it here in attempt to find out information about private loaners, which may overall be a better option that unsubsidized government loans (and as the number is over $138k, you'd almost have to look at private loans).

The reason for the high expenses is that we eat well, I golf a lot, and having two cars plus investments that are not close to where you live is not cheap.  No interested in giving that stuff up and I already do it as cheap as possible (ebay balls, golfnow.com/coupon codes, Craigslist used clubs).

The investment is a chain restaurant which opened not long ago but is a very good bet.  Our first few days have been excellent and my guess above is very conservative based on estimates coming in.  I also got a new job that is paying a lot more than my old one so my income is more next month as well as the investment paying dividends for the first time.  My old job kept the above at a surplus of around 4-500 a month and I have saved a lot of that but Im not sure what to do with the increase in disposable income.  Currently have no other debt than above. Both are very good interest rates ~3.5%.  Have a bit of equity in the house, beside whats taken up on the credit line we still have around 27000 plus another 6 in the bank in cash.  Just not sure what to do here.

gaming,State of next gen consoles (warning: wall of text),"Right now, Sony’s PS4 is ridiculously far ahead of the Xbox One in popularity, and Nintendo’s WiiU is sort of sitting off in a corner by itself waiting for a price drop. Personally, I’ve been a sony far since the PS3 and before that I was loyal to Nintendo with the N64 and the Gamecube, so I sure that there is bias in here that I don’t even realize. When I was watching Microsoft’s conference at E3, I sat there thinking to myself “Wow, this looks really incredible, and the game for it look amazing. Sony is going to have to go amazingly well if they want to compete”. Then I watched Sony’s conference, and, well, Microsoft got fucked. 

There are some people arguing that the Xbox will have better exclusives, and therefore is the better console. After all, these consoles are meant for playing games, so what separates them is the games that you can play on them. But the only really good exclusives (IMO) Xbox has are Halo and Gears of War (which hasn’t even been announced yet). Beyond that, their exclusives announced at E3 looked good and fun and all, but nothing to buy a $500 console over. Ryse and Forza and DR3 looked fun to play, I’m not going to go and buy a console just for them. In this tier of game consoles, most of what I played were not exclusives, Fallout, Borderlands, Bioshock, CoD, Battlefield, Deus Ex, Assassins Creed, MGS, etc, so I don’t really mind missing out on some so-so or okay exclusives that I will only play once. And some of the multi-platform games announced at E3 looked incredible, like ESO, the Division, and Destiny. And compared to Sony’s exclusives list, the Xbox’s isn’t much either. Sony has the Killzone series, God of War series, and some of the lesser ones like Last of Us, Little Big planet, etc. And KH3 and FFV feel like PS3 exclusives because of their history; most FF and KH fans started out as PS fans, so they will most likely end out playing the new versions on the PS4 anyways. To be honest I was underwhelmed by the exclusives announced and showcased by both of them. The true ruler of exclusives is Nintendo. Like, come on, A new Mario World, Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Pikmin, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, a new Zelda Game, Sonic, Metroid (unannounced), and Yoshi’s Island. Relatively, this list blows the other two out of that water (IMO). 

But Nintendo really screwed up with the Wii and the WiiU with their controllers. They seem to be forcing the whole controler/WiiU pad down our throats. If i could have a choice, I would rather play ALL of their games with a standard controller. I really don’t get why I have to play these games using these awkward controllers, nor do I want to. I don’t want to be standing up swinging my arms around to make Mario jump or whatever. The reason that the Wii flew off the shelves when it was released is because it has a new technology we were all infatuated with. But once we got our hands on it and had some fun with it, we all collectively thought “well that was fun, what next?” and Nintendo didn’t really make anything totally captivating that would shift the video game industry into an era of new controllers. If they wanted to revolutionize the industry, they did a shit job of it. I think their next console needs to go back to primarily the standard type of controller with the option of a Wii-ish controller. Imagine if Nintendo came out with a console that could play all of the third party games the Xbox and PS have along with all of Nintendo’s, had a online system like PSN or XBL, and had a Trophy/Achievement program. I would absolutely love this console! I believe that going from playing MGS to Smash Bros on one console would be above ideal. For now I really really want a WiiU for its exclusives, but I really really don’t want to drop $350 for it if I'm not going to be able to play the major third party games with a normal controller. 

Concerning the DRM issue, I do understand where Microsoft is coming from, BUT they really fucked up in how they went about attempting to fix their problem. I understand that they are trying to eliminate legitimate piracy, loaning “piracy”, and third party retailers like Gamestop, but not everything is about just turning a profit. They have been doing fine selling games through Gamestop for years, so they shouldn't get greedy about the relatively small amount of cash that make when they buy/resell used games. They are already making money, while I get they want more, this is probably a bad way to go about it. And stopping people from sharing their discs with each other? That is plain and simple a dick move. Yea I know you wrote that code on the disc and its your “intellectual property”, big fucking deal. I payed $60 for that disc and I’ll do whatever I want with it. If you actually understood the business model philosophy of “the customer is always right”, you would understand how detrimentally you screwed up. Now what Sony did was much better, by letting any third parties determine how their DRM works. At least it appears that they are on the side of the gamer, instead of deliberately throwing them down into the mud.

Now to XBL vs PSN+, first off PSN+ is cheaper. The reimbursements of getting a free game a month on PSN+ is fine and dandy, but truly I don’t care about the smaller indie games as much. Yea they can be fun, but meh, I probably won’t end out playing them either way. But I'm just not an Indie fan. The other thing I really like about PSN+ is that any MMO (ESO, FFIV) will not require a PSN+ subscription, nor will any free to play game that requires the internet. I haven’t heard anything on Microsoft’s stance on this, but I would assume that since they will cater to the gamers on this one to get some credibility back. 

I want to know who these people are who will buy a $400-500 console based on its media access capabilities. I really don’t get why Microsoft was putting such a heavy emphasis on XB1’s ability to watch TV or whatever it does. If I want to watch TV on my TV, guess what I’m going to use? An Xbox? Fuck no! I’m going to use my normal cable box or dish like the rest of the world. And if I want to watch Hulu or Netflix or Amazon Instant Video, Xbox is about the last thing I would use to watch it after: a PC, a Laptop, a smartphone, a Tablet, a Xbox 360, and PS3, a Wii, or a SmartTv. I don’t know where this mysterious demographic who buys gaming consoles to watch tv shows and movies is hiding, but I’d sure like to know so I can hide from the NSA with them. 

“If you don’t have an internet connection, buy and Xbox 360”. I really cannot believe a multi billion dollar corporation would even say something like this. This is something that they really need to backtrack on, even if it makes them look like failures. The world over knows they failed, so coming out and admitting it isn’t going to ruin your reputation, in fact fixing these failures will most likely draw a lot of your fan base back, because you would have at least listened to them. There is no part of the decision to require an internet connection that is remotely acceptable or understandable, you are shutting out people who would have bought your console, and losing sales. I hope you are happy. 

OH! And the Kinect always being attached... to the internet... especially with all of this NSA and AP scandals looming over the country, is not good. Now everyone minus the conspiracy addicts logically know that the Feds will most likely not use this to actually spy on you. But regardless the possibility will be in the back of everyone’s minds, lurking. Also Kinect is very much alike to the technology of the PS move and the Wii controllers, which albeit its nice to have as an option, its not something to force on your consumers. Yes there is a portion of people who do enjoy these things, most people don’t really want it or want to use it (IMO). I feel the same way about the way some of the games at E3 are able to interface with people playing on tablet alongside the console players, like The Division. The option is nice, but if I am EVER forced to play a game with a tablet (WiiU? sort of), I would politely decline. 

$100 more, blah blah blah, there isn’t too much to say here. WiiU needs to drop its price.
PS4 looks nicer? Their aesthetics aren’t a big deal to me, so to that I say meh!

All of this being said, I really feel sad for Xbox fans who have been since the original Xbox, or just from the 360. Its truly disappointing to see people who have grown up playing these systems, who have great childhood memories of playing with their friends late into the night, shunned and blatantly disrespected by their gaming idol they were devoted to. As a PS fan, I really wanted to make up for a lot of the shit I got over the past 4 or 5 years or however long its been, but I feel terrible doing it because they know the Xbox One is an insult to them, I don’t even have to explain it or argue for it. So I end out just commiserating with them. 

Overall this is just a sad time for the entire industry. I am not even mad an Microsoft, just disappointed. And they are acting like they made the right decision, which is even more disappointing. Its like a parent not being mad at their kid, just being disappointed. It stings more.  They need to realize that if they only look at economic and mathematical models and business plans and completely ignore consumer trust, those models will lose their meanings. Microsoft, even as a PS fan, I sincerely hope you do start to trust your loyal consumers again, they are waiting for your reply.

I am 19 years old, so my credit file is thin, but I have absolutely no baddies on my credit. I do have quite a few (high single digits) hard pulls, but most are either regular banking pulls (like opening a checking account) and revolving credit pulls.

I am interested in purchasing a car in August, and I am seeking an approval for a loan in the amount of $20,000.

I plan to be placing $4,000 to $5,000 down on the car, in addition to paying cash for taxes, dealer fees, and registration.

Basically, my actual amount borrowed could be anywhere from $16,000 to $19,000, but I want to leave a buffer of $1,000, which leads me to a maximum loan of about $20,000.

news,The Haney Group: is 'Defensive Engineering' Next? - my.opera,"Source link: http://my.opera.com/honeybliff70/blog/2013/06/14/ptc-community-the-haney-groupis-defensive-engineering-next
The haney group, With an out of control regulatory environment in Washington, we expect doctors to practice defensive medicine. Is defensive engineering next? What happens when OSHA regulators disagree with state fire marshals? We now have an example of Obama-engineering to consider.
One company in Illinois has been told by an OSHA inspector to install an emergency pressure relieving device on a water tank to handle the admittedly rare but ominous ""fire case."" The Illinois State Fire Marshal told the same company not to bother. So who should prevail in this case of dueling regulators? You decide.
The state relies upon the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. That code differentiates between fired pressure vessels, such as boilers and water heaters, and unfired pressure vessels. It requires pressure relieving devices such as relief valves or rupture discs in cases where there exist scenarios where there is a reasonable chance that a pressure excursion will occur due to some defined source. The ASME was founded in 1880 by engineers in response to a rash of fatal boiler explosions. Water in a closed pressure vessel that is subjected to a heat source can eventually heat up to the boiling point and begin to vaporize into steam. As the amount of steam increases, so does the pressure. Too much pressure can lead to an explosion due to the vessel walls failing under the stress. These scenarios are known as ""cases"" and are evaluated for the purposes of sizing any relief devices.
A ""fire case"" is one where there is an external source of heat due to a fire surrounding the vessel. Normally, fire cases are developed only for vessels containing flammable liquids. Fires can radiate huge amounts of energy onto the walls of the vessel, thereby heating its contents. If, for example, a pipe used to fill the tank with gasoline developed a leak and the resultant pool of gasoline was ignited, one can easily see why it makes sense to have an emergency relief vent to prevent the tank from exploding and spreading flaming gas everywhere around it.
But why would one do the same for a simple tank containing only water? The fire marshal, having practical experience in fighting real fires, is unconcerned. He understands such basics as the ""fire triangle"", where to have a fire you need three things, fuel, oxygen and a source of ignition. You can't have a fire without fuel. Without a fire to provide the heat source, the threat of a water storage tank explosion is negligible. The wet-behind-the-ears OSHA safety inspector has federal government regulations to use to threaten plant managers with fines to get his way.
As a plant manager, would you buckle under the threats and install a ""Potemkin village"" emergency vent to get the OSHA inspector to go away? Would you practice defensive engineering? Or would you embarrass the Federal Government by exposing the idiocy of its safety inspectors? Fortunately, for the plant manager, he asked someone on the outside with a public platform on the American Thinker for advice. As a service to plant managers everywhere, let me offer a solution.
The first thing to do is to document the ""fire case"" by describing the location of this hypothetical scenario. It is inside a masonry building with ceramic tile floors. The primary contents of the room are gleaming sanitary stainless steel tanks and their associated piping. What combustible material exists, maybe the paint on the walls, a few pieces of paper, insulation on the electrical wires, and a few plastic fixtures, is quite limited. But the theoretical chance of a fire does exist. To meet this ""threat"", we will install a rupture disc in a screw holder with six outlet holes. If the pressure in the tank exceeds the set pressure, the disc will burst allowing steam to escape as if through the caps of six tea kettles. This will produce a warning sound to alert the occupants to the problem. The steam will then begin to permeate throughout the room displacing the air and starving the fire of oxygen. We will have created an emergency water based fire extinguisher to put out the fire. the haney group

personalfinance,"Approaching my second year as an ""adult""- starting to feel comfortable enough to think long-term","I am approaching my second year of employment after graduating law school. I recently turned 27 years old. I am a fairly prudent person; I keep track of my spending habits, I don't have any credit card debt, I own my car, and I make my payments on my student loans. However, now that I am finally starting to feel settled in this ""adult"" life, I am beginning to think seriously about the long-term. 

I take home about $4k per month after taxes. However, I work at a small firm that does not provide for a 401(k) or any sort of ""matching"" program for retirement. The firm provides money for healthcare/eye care, which I then purchase myself and expense each month. 

I have a little bit over $85k in debt at the moment, broken down as follows:

* $3k (Direct Sub) at 2.39%
* $5.5k (Direct Unsub) at 6.8%
* $25.5k (Direct Sub) at 6.8%
* $39k (Direct Unsub) at 6.8%
* $11.5k (Direct Grad) at 7.9%
* $900 (Direct Grad) at 7.9% ----This is the one I have focused on paying off first, since it is one of the two highest interest rate loans and it was the smaller of the two, starting at around $5-6k, so I will get the feeling of accomplishment after I finally pay this one off----

The minimum student loan payments for my loans are about $550 per month, however I have been paying about $1000 per month for the past 6 months or so, intending only slowly paying down the higher interest loans by putting the extra money directly to the principal of those loans. 

My other expenses per month so far this past eight months or so break down as follows: I pay $1,100 per month in rent, about $330 per month in utilities/phone/cable, $90 per month in car insurance, and about $1,400 per month in spending which I won't write down the specifics but include Groceries, Car repairs, Dining out, Gas, and discretionary spending such as a 10-day trip to Italy, friends' weddings, and nights out on the town.

In December I paid off all of the furniture which I bought when I moved into my new apartment, but I basically just took the money I stopped paying towards furniture and put it towards my student loans.

So in sum, after all of these expenses, I end up saving about $200-500 per month, which, from all that I have read from this board, is horrible. 

I have been focused this whole first year on creating the ""Emergency Fund"", but so far have managed to save only about $10k. 

I have no money in stocks, no money in any retirement account, and no other forms of income (though I do get an end of the year bonus which varies from year to year depending on my hours billed). 

My own thoughts are that I need to open a Roth IRA as soon as possible to begin putting my money away, but I worry that I don't have enough money saved away yet. I don't think I am ready to buy a house or condo (even if I had the savings for it, I don't think I am ready to settle down). 

I am endeavoring to save more money, but my car has been a real bitch lately (approaching 200k miles, needs lots of repairs as things begin to need to be replaced), and I have had to go on several Bachelor party trips and wedding trips which required plane tickets and hotel rooms, all of which has brought my 'per month' savings rate down on average. I don't buy a lot of clothes, I don't eat out more than 4-5 meals per week, and except for my first TV I don't buy electronics or anything.

So my main questions are these:

1) Do I need to continue saving to grow my emergency fund, or should I focus on maxing out a Roth IRA each year?

1a) Is the Roth IRA the right one for me? From my research it appears so.

2) At what point does it make sense to go back to paying the minimum on my student loans in order to save up some cash to invest/put into IRA/keep as an emergency fund?

Any comments would be appreciated, even if they address something I did not think of in my two questions above.",finance,1371229862

The two perspectives I've heard -

1. Since it's paid off, rent it out and use that as semi-passive income to help out.

gaming,An Amazing Game Concept that will Amaze You!,"So I’m a third year university student and an indie game developer and I’ve been sitting on this game idea for about six months. In my opinion it is an amazing idea but the programming, resources, people and cost needed to make it is way out of my league.

Since there is a fat chance of the game ever being made, I thought I’d share the concept of the game with you guys.

The concept is a massive multiplayer online space exploration game which is played in real time, on a full scale Universe between hundreds of thousands of people.

The game takes it’s influences from those like Endless Space, Civilization and Spore (Space Age) where you can chose to create alliances, wage wars and use your research and scientists to win.

So now onto the amazing concept of it, since we the game will be set in a full scale universe, there would be immense room for exploration and interaction with other people around you. When a person downloads the game, they create their own alien race and are placed on a planet in a lone star system on the edge of the universe. The age in which the race is created would be of the humans in the late 20th century in which they are starting to research space exploration.

The objective of the game is for one person to make it to the center of the universe, a bit like The Cube in which people had to tap to the center. To do this, people would research and advance their race to a stage where they can manufacture space crafts and explore the universe.

After a short period of time, you would have thousands of real people’s alien races exploring the outskirts of the universe and eventually making contact with each other. When contact is made, it will allow users to interact with each other, help each other, create alliances, share technology or even wage war on each other.

You would end up with massive federations of races each working to together, sharing resources, advancing each other trying to explore and reach the center of the universe.

These federations could have their own forums and political systems in which each race that makes up for it can decide what the federation would do.

The universe would be a sphere like shape and you would have these federations coming in from every angle, not knowing of each other’s existence due to the massive scale of the game.

Not only would you have these federations exploring, you would also have them meeting others and either joining forces with them or waging war and defeating them so that they will be the first to the center.

You can imagine after months of game time, hundreds of thousands of alien races, thousands of federations, massive wars resulting in excisions of races would all have happened and been amazing.

So what we have is a game set in a real scale universe in which hundreds of thousands of people will join forces, explore the universe, wage war on each other and try and reach the ultimate goal of the center.

Once the center has been reached, you would then have a prize that the federation or group of races will receive.

So that’s my killer smartphone/game concept that I hope one day I could build but currently, it is just a dream of a game that I think could become probably the best smartphone/tablet game of its time.

news,PTC Community: The Haney GroupIs: 'Defensive Engineering' Next?,"Source link: http://communities.ptc.com/people/ptc-5085526/blog/2013/06/14/allvoices-the-haney-group-is-defensive-engineering-next
The haney group, With an out of control regulatory environment in Washington, we expect doctors to practice defensive medicine. Is defensive engineering next? What happens when OSHA regulators disagree with state fire marshals? We now have an example of Obama-engineering to consider.
One company in Illinois has been told by an OSHA inspector to install an emergency pressure relieving device on a water tank to handle the admittedly rare but ominous ""fire case."" The Illinois State Fire Marshal told the same company not to bother. So who should prevail in this case of dueling regulators? You decide.
The state relies upon the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. That code differentiates between fired pressure vessels, such as boilers and water heaters, and unfired pressure vessels. It requires pressure relieving devices such as relief valves or rupture discs in cases where there exist scenarios where there is a reasonable chance that a pressure excursion will occur due to some defined source. The ASME was founded in 1880 by engineers in response to a rash of fatal boiler explosions. Water in a closed pressure vessel that is subjected to a heat source can eventually heat up to the boiling point and begin to vaporize into steam. As the amount of steam increases, so does the pressure. Too much pressure can lead to an explosion due to the vessel walls failing under the stress. These scenarios are known as ""cases"" and are evaluated for the purposes of sizing any relief devices.
A ""fire case"" is one where there is an external source of heat due to a fire surrounding the vessel. Normally, fire cases are developed only for vessels containing flammable liquids. Fires can radiate huge amounts of energy onto the walls of the vessel, thereby heating its contents. If, for example, a pipe used to fill the tank with gasoline developed a leak and the resultant pool of gasoline was ignited, one can easily see why it makes sense to have an emergency relief vent to prevent the tank from exploding and spreading flaming gas everywhere around it.
But why would one do the same for a simple tank containing only water? The fire marshal, having practical experience in fighting real fires, is unconcerned. He understands such basics as the ""fire triangle"", where to have a fire you need three things, fuel, oxygen and a source of ignition. You can't have a fire without fuel. Without a fire to provide the heat source, the threat of a water storage tank explosion is negligible. The wet-behind-the-ears OSHA safety inspector has federal government regulations to use to threaten plant managers with fines to get his way.
As a plant manager, would you buckle under the threats and install a ""Potemkin village"" emergency vent to get the OSHA inspector to go away? Would you practice defensive engineering? Or would you embarrass the Federal Government by exposing the idiocy of its safety inspectors? Fortunately, for the plant manager, he asked someone on the outside with a public platform on the American Thinker for advice. As a service to plant managers everywhere, let me offer a solution.
The first thing to do is to document the ""fire case"" by describing the location of this hypothetical scenario. It is inside a masonry building with ceramic tile floors. The primary contents of the room are gleaming sanitary stainless steel tanks and their associated piping. What combustible material exists, maybe the paint on the walls, a few pieces of paper, insulation on the electrical wires, and a few plastic fixtures, is quite limited. But the theoretical chance of a fire does exist. To meet this ""threat"", we will install a rupture disc in a screw holder with six outlet holes. If the pressure in the tank exceeds the set pressure, the disc will burst allowing steam to escape as if through the caps of six tea kettles. This will produce a warning sound to alert the occupants to the problem. The steam will then begin to permeate throughout the room displacing the air and starving the fire of oxygen. We will have created an emergency water based fire extinguisher to put out the fire. the haney group

gaming,Xbox One check in question,"Just asking a question that's been on my mind since hearing about it; everyone seems to be saying that if you fail to check in every 24 hours then your fucked. So if I were to buy an Xbox and get bogged down in work and not use it for a few days, I would be blocked from using the device? Or would I just have to check in as soon as the Xbox is turned on? 

EDIT: In response to all of you, I thought this would be the case but all the people saying you're stuffed if you fail to check in is a bit misleading. Though I was probably reading things incorrectly.",technology,1371202265
gaming,"Stop giving in to The Hivemind, an outlook on why the Xbox One may be awesome.","So first off let me clarify that I am getting both consoles, potentially both on their launch days, so I will be lucky enough to enjoy the fruits of both systems and yippy that's great. I am a long time Sony fan, and have never owned an Xbox 360 (although I do still plan on buying one). I told myself before all of this hype and announcements that I was going to buy whatever Microsoft put out next, because I was so impressed with how well the Xbox 360 turned out over years of them improving it. Then there was E3, and the bombs dropped. At first I was feeling just the same as most of you; betrayed, disappointed, and sure to hell that I was not going to support this crazy Nazi-box that Microsoft was releasing. I fed right into the hivemind, right into all of the negative hype and memes and brainwashing that has been going on all over the internet. But then I sat down and really thought about it, and was also really excited to learn about the details outlined [here](http://www.neowin.net/news/anonymous-xbox-engineer-explains-drm-and-microsofts-xbox-one-intentions). Forgive me if my formatting sucks, as I never post anything more than comments on reddit, but this is something I felt I really have to share and it's worth the effort. 

* Let me just get out of the way that I have and most likely always will have a stable internet connection at home as well as at work, so the online check-in function does not hinder me in any way. I truly feel for anyone who this does effect, that sucks and there's really no answer or solution anyone can give at this time to those people except to maybe use a cellphone to tether a brief connection long enough to perform the check-in process.

* To be honest, when you really look into the functionality of Game Sharing and the digital format of the Xbox One, it ends up being exactly like sharing and trading games in real life only better. This time around people like me, and I'm sure like many of you, who have even more friends in different cities or countries will be able to freely share games with them, and I believe even still play the very games that you Shared; an option impossible on a physical disc based format. 
* Do I really have to remind Reddit how much the used games industry sucks, and how you get completely ripped off trading in your titles at retail stores like GameStop? I mean come on now, you people are focusing on the beauty of the pricing on used titles, not how much it sucks to be the one trading the game in for next to nothing. 
* Which brings me to this, as stated in the first article linked above, that by having these games on a digital format and publishers not having to make a fuss out of GameStop making huge profits off of secondary sales of their products, these companies will be able to price their games at their true value, hopefully between $5-$30 instead of the industry standard of $60 right now. Now if we don't see this value on the consumer side in the future, it's true we are definitely being exploited by massive amounts of greed.

* One of my biggest grievances with Xbox One was the required install of a Blu-Ray based disc, onto a little baby 500GB HDD. Then I learned [here](http://www.geek.com/games/xbox-one-hard-drive-cant-be-replaced-but-external-storage-supported-1556044/) that there is a dedicated USB 3.0 input on the back of the Xbox One that will allow you to attach any external hard drive that you please, and this external drive can hold any data that the internal drive can, meaning you can store all of your games, music, movies, etc. on a high capacity external drive and your storage worries are completely over. 

The only issues I am finally left with are the facts that I am excited about more exclusives on the Sony side than Xbox, and that I am not entirely excited about Kinect 2 being a mandatory part of the console functioning. I am definitely not one of the Orwell-screaming conspiracy folk who believe Microsoft and the government are just so damn interested in their regular, boring lives, I just am not a huge fan of what they did with it in the past as far as games and functions go. I am hopeful however that they're seriously going to deliver me a Minority Report-style experience while commanding my tv, movies, music and games all together at once from the same machine while I sit my lazy ass right there on the couch. Gone are the days of disc-swapping, or searching for different controllers/remotes to perform different functions between entertainment devices. I just preordered my Day One Edition Xbox One on Amazon and I couldn't be more proud of it. I will also be buying a Playstation 4, as I need some Infamous, Killzone, The Order and Planetside 2 in my life. I'm excited to purchase a Live Gold account and buy all of my multiplatform titles on the Xbox One to hopefully enjoy the more robust online experience alongside all of the other Live users out there. Overall, I'm just really fucking excited for this new generation of gaming and I hopefully wish you all do your own research and thinking about which system is really the future device for you, or perhaps just be like me and buy both them bitches! Thanks for reading this to anyone who does, and thanks for all the laughs Reddit. 



Also please feel free to comment on any issues I didn't bring up here as I'd love to discuss them with all of you. 

EDIT: Another thing I wanted to address was Microsoft's online capacity in terms of the Xbox One versus the 360. For the 360, Microsoft had/has roughly 15,000 servers to handle Xbox Live operations and multiplayer gaming. Coming into the Xbox One they have upped that number to 300,000 servers. There are also rumors that every major multiplayer title will have dedicated servers assigned to them. So also gone are the days of lagging out and reconnecting because of some guy hosting a game on a shitty connection.",technology,1371201476
personalfinance,Considering getting a $33 loan. I want to get married in 5 years.,"Can't find a way to pay for my masters and thinking of getting a loan. Student loan in my country don't go up to $33K so I would have to ask my parents to put their names down to be able to lend that much and to get a better interest rate, which they are willing to do. 

I'm hoping to get a $50K job after my degree and expect to pay the loan off in three years, as well as saving some money (goal=25K) aside. 

So after two years of masters and three successful years of paying off the debt, I'll only end up with $25K savings for my marriage, which is not enough at all to buy a house.

gaming,"Guys, I think I've found a way to break the repetitive nature of the military game.","So a moment ago, I was laying in bed, churning ideas to pass the time. Today's topic was simple: the video game. With new consoles coming out, better PCs being built, and data becoming more efficiently used than ever, games become faster, bigger, and more detailed. There is just one problem that, when solved, pushes a company's profits past any other's: originality. Yeah, new games come out, but they're all pretty much the same; especially when it comes to the military game. A military game will come with one class of playable characters( foot soldier, tank driver, aircraft pilot, etc) that has an incredibly unrealistic amount of health, amount of firepower, and dominance over the other types of units. Take CoD, for example. Each person is outfitted with regeneratable health, enough ammunition to make a tank jealous, and the ability to take down any war machine, no matter how advanced, that is thrown at them. So then I thought, "" what if a game was created that kept realistic health, ammunition, and dominance over others, and throw them all into one game?"" Now I know you're thinking ""Battlefield"", but that's not all. Think big. Think maps as big as in T.C.'s H.A.W.X. 2 for foot soldiers to fight in. Think tank squadrons, fighter squadrons and massive infantry squadrons fighting to gain further ground on maps so massive, kills will not be on Gamer's minds; only the objective will. If this still seems mundane, imagine this: the route won't be preset and neatly painted for players to follow, with an actor giving orders in the hollow voice of a superior officer. The commanders will be human. They will set waypoints, give orders, and manipulate the immediate goal. Players would be given the ability to insubordinate the commander's orders, but could *actually face the penalty of demotion*. Leveling up through the ranks would be simple enough. The player would start out as a foot soldier with a standard issue assault rifle and pistol. As the player progresses, however, he is given the opportunity to become a sniper, spy, an officer, or even move on to a vehicle of their choice( think skyrim's skill tree on advancement: once you decide, you're committed). Now I'm open for suggestion on the commanders, but I think they can only reach this status by reaching the highest position of one of the skill focuses in each military division, and by proving their worth in at least 3 AI battles (as you can imagine, each battle is a huge commitment). Players will not have to fumble into each skill set blindly, as an AI system will be available to let them practice in all fields.

The battles will be long, taking hours, even days. Should a commander need to retire, a new commander would be briefed, and fill in. The battles will also require huge servers, taking in hundreds of players at once. I'm open for any suggestions, so please, feel free.

investing,"By request: Why Bitcoin is a specific kind of scam called a seigniorage scheme (long, but has tl;dr). X-Post from /r/Finance.","Seigniorage has two functional definitions, although they really dovetail out of one. Within debt-backed fiat it's usually defined as the profit made from interest paid on the debt which backs the fiat. The persons with seigniorage privilege in debt-backed fiat would be the cartel of international banking elite to whom once-sovereign nations pay the interest to lease their non-sovereign ""sovereign"" currencies.

The strict definition of seigniorage, however, is 'the difference between the face value of something and the cost to produce and distribute it.' In the case of debt-backed fiat, the interest is rolled in as a functional increase in the value of the currency to the seignoirage privilege holders, since it's additional revenue generated from the same dollar despite no additional cost being required to produce the physical bill or digital dollar entry on a balance sheet. In the case of coinage, the inheritor of seigniorage is the United States treasury (say a quarter costs $.03 to produce and bring to market, and its face value is $.25. The inheritors of the seigniorage profit $.22 per quarter when they are initially spent into the market).

Bitcoin is a seigniorage scheme because the program was not widely known or public when the first bitcoins were generated. You can show me your fancy bs (and it's really just window dressing, making things appear fantastic so you will be distracted from the same rotten core that's at the center of all such scams) about 'mining' them and how it's 'free to all' and all of this, but the fact remains that whether they were 'mined' or not initially, at the beginning there was a very small group of people who knew of the existence of Bitcoin. An anonymous, shadowy cartel of insiders who pretends to be one fictitious person in order to maintain their anonymity.

Because Bitcoins are digital, the cost of generating them was negligible, as was their value. Their value was then pumped artificially using paid gophers and an enormous marketing campaign throughout internet circles, preying upon lonely techies with decent job security and convincing them it was a gateway to 'economic freedom.' This is textbook scam; it has a vulnerable, wealthy, lonely market audience with very little practical experience with economic models or systems, but plenty of money to take.

The creators of the initial currency and system are unknown, which means the inheritors of the seigniorage are totally anonymous and to this day no one knows who they are and what they've done with the massive amount of money they've earned when they sold their once-worthless but post-pump-valuable Bitcoins onto the market initially. This is textbook scam, it should be a huge red flag. The fairytale that this is the creation of one person, who obviously does not exist, is another red flag of a textbook scam. When Rome crashes and burns, these insiders simply slip away to their new island in Micronesia while you're dead in the water, and you have no way of even knowing who pantsed you.

Once the value of the commodity was inflated beyond its initial zero value, Bitcoins were then sold liberally to lonely suckers with zero scam experience, at which point the insider cartel could've just walked away and let it crash and burn. Instead, more scarily, it appears they have used part of that capital (and perhaps only sold part of their initial reserve) to exert influence within or over the exchanges themselves, and may control one or more entirely for all we know. The pump then continued. The exchanges are incredibly corrupt, there have been several crashes already and there is zero explanation for how the value of Bitcoins has recovered from any of them. The most likely answer, in my opinion, is that the seigniorage gains and revenues from insider-generated dumps and successive rebuys are being used to continue to pump the scam, as is typical in equity market pump and dumps as well. The insiders are always going to exit before everyone else, allowing them to rebuy on the cheap and pump again, and their control over one or more exchanges facilitates this.

**Then there's the total hogwash that Bitcoin is a 'currency.' There are several reasons why Bitcoin is not a currency, but rather a zero-purpose digital commodity.** This distinction is very important, because removing its distinction as a currency means its downfall is inevitable since as a digital commodity it has zero tangible purpose. Anything can be a medium of exchange for as long as you can trick one fool into valuing it, but that doesn't make it a currency. It makes it a pet rock, minus the rock and the paint if it's digital.

A key difference between a currency and a commodity is that currencies typically command a premium within poorer societies, and commodities need not. A great example is the Federal Reserve Note (most people mistakenly call it the United States Dollar), which is worth more and generates a great deal of attention if pulled out of a wallet in Zimbabwe. Try that with a Bitcoin, and after the initial curiosity surrounding its novelty you'll be left only with confusion as you utterly fail to explain to these people why this silly token has any value whatsoever.

If you can name one poor society that values Bitcoins more highly than first-world ones, you'll be well on your way to shattering my logic. But you won't be able to do that, because poor societies have zero use for Bitcoin; it is a commodity of privilege because its uses are fictitious, and the fact that it doesn't translate vertically down the income inequality ladder means it is completely screwed in its supposed-intended long-term purpose. This is in marked contrast with, say, silver, which is a true currency (as well as a commodity) in that it has ubiquitous global liquidity and can be exchanged for virtually any world currency within any society, with a linear increasing premium as income within the society of exchange falls.

Bitcoins also have very poor liquidity, in that they are incapable of purchasing most fundamental necessities of life, and certainly cannot do so on demand. The very few exceptions to this are niche cases hoping to benefit from the fad and nothing more. This also makes it dissimilar to currencies, which have peak liquidity.

Magic cards, for instance (interestingly, the thing MtGOX, short for Magic: the Gathering Online Exchange, was initially designed to trade, before they were prohibited from doing so), are an infinitely stronger currency than Bitcoins ever will be because they are incredibly liquid anywhere but indigenous communities (making them weaker than, say, silver or gold but little else), and command a great premium in less-affluent societies like Brazil. They're also a functional on-shore tax shelter, making them one of the most practically useful mediums of exchange in the entire world, and their market has experienced more sustained, successive growth than any in modern history to my knowledge, while remaining nearly crash free.

The most recent seigniorage scheme that Bitcoin resembles is cap-and-trade. Only cap-and-trade was a far more honest scam, in that at least the globalist billionaires like Al Gore were willing to admit they were the team who was going to inherit the seigniorage when companies were forced to purchase a totally worthless and created-from-zero-and-at-zero-cost commodity called 'carbon credits' at an artificially inflated value. When the carbon credit market crashed in Europe and the whole scheme reached seeing-is-believing level, the plan was abandoned (money already made, just like Bitcoin is poised to do/be). Bitcoin is even shadier; the sinister seigniorage schemers won't even admit who they are, and the only difference is that its market hasn't crashed yet. But it will. Guaranteed. Because they're totally worthless.

Don't be a bag holder.

**TL;DR:** A huge quantity of Bitcoins were created by people, at their leisure, when their value was zero and no one knew they existed, then their value was pumped by marketing to a target audience of well-paid, bored, gullible suckers and then they were sold to them at much-higher-than-zero value. The inheritors of the seigniorage are anonymous. Currencies have liquidity, and command a premium in less-affluent societies. Magic cards (intentionally trivial comparison) are a real currency in every single way Bitcoins are not, and will continue to function as a far better alternative currency than Bitcoins ever will, because they're also a functional on-shore tax shelter as well as having peak liquidity and being a way to convert any currency into any other currency without paying conversion fees.

**STL;DR:** Bitcoins are cap-and-trade 2.0, plus anonymity for the perps since they couldn't possibly get the legislative cover Gore et. al tried to obtain so they would be immune to prosecution for scamming everyone when the market inevitably crashed.

If you can name one poor society that values Bitcoins more highly than first-world ones, you'll be well on your way to shattering my logic. But you won't be able to do that, because poor societies have zero use for Bitcoin; it is a commodity of privilege because its uses are fictitious, and the fact that it doesn't translate vertically down the income inequality ladder means it is completely screwed in its supposed-intended long-term purpose. This is in marked contrast with, say, silver, which is a true currency (as well as a commodity) in that it has ubiquitous global liquidity and can be exchanged for virtually any world currency within any society, with a linear increasing premium as income within the society of exchange falls.

Bitcoins also have very poor liquidity, in that they are incapable of purchasing most fundamental necessities of life, and certainly cannot do so on demand. The very few exceptions to this are niche cases hoping to benefit from the fad and nothing more. This also makes it dissimilar to currencies, which have peak liquidity.

Magic cards, for instance (interestingly, the thing MtGOX, short for Magic: the Gathering Online Exchange, was initially designed to trade, before they were prohibited from doing so), are an infinitely stronger currency than Bitcoins ever will be because they are incredibly liquid anywhere but indigenous communities (making them weaker than, say, silver or gold but little else), and command a great premium in less-affluent societies like Brazil. They're also a functional on-shore tax shelter, making them one of the most practically useful mediums of exchange in the entire world, and their market has experienced more sustained, successive growth than any in modern history to my knowledge, while remaining nearly crash free.

The most recent seigniorage scheme that Bitcoin resembles is cap-and-trade. Only cap-and-trade was a far more honest scam, in that at least the globalist billionaires like Al Gore were willing to admit they were the team who was going to inherit the seigniorage when companies were forced to purchase a totally worthless and created-from-zero-and-at-zero-cost commodity called 'carbon credits' at an artificially inflated value. When the carbon credit market crashed in Europe and the whole scheme reached seeing-is-believing level, the plan was abandoned (money already made, just like Bitcoin is poised to do/be). Bitcoin is even shadier; the sinister seigniorage schemers won't even admit who they are, and the only difference is that its market hasn't crashed yet. But it will. Guaranteed. Because they're totally worthless.

Don't be a bag holder.

**TL;DR:** A huge quantity of Bitcoins were created by people, at their leisure, when their value was zero and no one knew they existed, then their value was pumped by marketing to a target audience of well-paid, bored, gullible suckers and then they were sold to them at much-higher-than-zero value. The inheritors of the seigniorage are anonymous. Currencies have liquidity, and command a premium in less-affluent societies. Magic cards (intentionally trivial comparison) are a real currency in every single way Bitcoins are not, and will continue to function as a far better alternative currency than Bitcoins ever will, because they're also a functional on-shore tax shelter as well as having peak liquidity and being a way to convert any currency into any other currency without paying conversion fees.

**STL;DR:** Bitcoins are cap-and-trade 2.0, plus anonymity for the perps since they couldn't possibly get the legislative cover Gore et. al tried to obtain so they would be immune to prosecution for scamming everyone when the market inevitably crashed.

politics,Federal Government Dictates your kid's education - The Common Core,"Well here it is. After countless attacks on the rights of U.S citizens, and the recent NSA leak, Americans are getting more and more aware of the unconstitutional acts taken by the U.S government. 

The newest instillation is The Common Core Initiative. This is a curriculum change that will be distributed to all 50 states, in nearly every public and private school across the nation. This takes initiative to make sure that all U.S citizens have a ""relevant"" education that lives up to American standards.

The kicker is, this new curriculum is created and distributed by the Federal Government. It replaces English, Math, Science, History, and other subject's curriculum with what the government deems fitting. Your child's education is now no longer in the hands of local teachers, but with the Federal Government and their agendas.

This will effect grades K-12 and the cutoff will be made at current day 9th graders. That is kids aged 13 and below will receive this new curriculum while those older (myself) made it before the cutoff. 

IMO We need to tell our local schools that we will not accept this. Tell you kids to deny this education and schools will be forced to switch back to traditional education. 

This Common Core initiative cuts out many important pieces of literature from English classes and chapters out of the history and sciences textbooks. It will likely result in the opposite of its intention. 

This is our children's education, America's future. The Common Core will begin to roll out within the next few years to the school nearest you! Learn more about the Common Core initiative here: http://www.corestandards.org/

personalfinance,Advice on Bankruptcy and Student Loans,"My family is a low income family. We are currently living in Oregon, where our rent is just under half of our monthly income. We make less than 25k a year. My husband works security for a big electronics company, and I am a stay at home mom for our 2 and 1 year old kids.

Right now my credit score is 140. It is absolutely awful because I have outrageous student loan debt. I have 3 loans, one of them private and two of them federal. I tried to work with them in the past, and was on many repayment plans where I only paid a certain dollar amount per month. Shortly after I became pregnant with my first child my husband and I both got laid off. I called Sallie Mae to ask them what I could do about my loans. They told me I had to give them 2k right then and there or they would no longer speak to me and would file wage garnishment orders. I told them I had no job and no money and the lady hung up on me. I called one more time and was told that they were sending me to collections for all 3 loans unless I gave them 2k and agreed to pay something like 250 a month. 

So basically, from then on, I have just hid from them. Now my private loan is in collections, and the 13k debt that it started out as, is now up over 30k (my whole schooling only cost 20k). I have no idea what is going on with the federal loans. I have tried contacting the NSLDS and have been told they have no current record of student loans for me. I know I married and changed my name from when I took the loans out, so I'm not sure if that makes any difference.

Basically, I don't know what to do now. I have some other debt, but it's less than 5k all together. Mostly I am just being crushed under the student loans. I really have no way to pay them back. I can not go back to work, because child care would cost me more than I would make (yes, I have checked around quite a bit). I would love to be able to wipe the slate clean with bankruptcy but I know that undue hardship is the only way to get rid of those student loans. Any advice?",finance,1371331562

Soooo I went to the bank to talk to my rep and he informed me that while Commerce does have a pretty low interest rate on their savings account, they DO have a pretty interesting plan. My rep told me that if I contributed money on a consecutive basis into my account every month for 11 months, that commerce would match my amount up to $50. (this was perfect because I was planning on contributing at least $100 a month). So being the great rep that he is, he advised me to open 2 separate savings accounts (no fees) and contribute $50 monthly into them. By doing this I will get $100 from the bank in 11 months which is the equivalent of a %1 interest rate (higher than any I have found) on $10,000.

The [security](http://www.shelfari.com/groups/102029/discussions/480687/Hass-Associates-Technology-Madrid) analysts wanted to know how easy it would be to hack into medical devices used in hospitals, knowing the danger if outsiders could gain control. They found the answer when they managed to figure out hundreds of passwords for equipment that included surgical and anesthesia devices, patient monitors and lab analysis tools.
“We stopped after we got to 300,” said Billy Rios, who found the passwords with his colleague Terry McCorkle. 
They alerted the federal government about what they had done, contributing to the Food and Drug Administration’s decision to tighten the standards for a wide range of medical devices. The FDA’s move, announced Thursday, reflects growing concerns that the gadgets — which include everything from fetal monitors used in hospitals to pacemakers implanted in people — are vulnerable to [cybersecurity](http://www.slideshare.net/kristia23/hass-associates-technology-madrid) breaches that could harm patients.

[http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/facing-cybersecurity-threats-fda-tightens-medical-device-standards/2013/06/12/b79cc0fe-d370-11e2-b05f-3ea3f0e7bb5a_story.html](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/facing-cybersecurity-threats-fda-tightens-medical-device-standards/2013/06/12/b79cc0fe-d370-11e2-b05f-3ea3f0e7bb5a_story.html)

Computer viruses and other malware increasingly are infecting equipment such as hospital computers used to view X-rays and CT scans and devices in cardiac catheterization labs, agency officials said. The problems cause the equipment to slow down or shut off, complicating patient care. As more devices operate on computer systems that are connected to each other, a hospital network and the Internet, the potential for problems rises dramatically, they said.
“Over the last year, we’ve seen an uptick that has increased our concern,” said William H. Maisel, chief scientist at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The type and breadth of incidents has increased.” He said officials used to hear about problems only once or twice a year, but “now we’re hearing about them weekly or monthly.”
The FDA, in an effort to reduce the risks, for the first time is directing device manufacturers to explicitly spell out how they will address cybersecurity. The agency Thursday issued draft guidelines that, when finalized this year, will allow the FDA to block approval of devices if manufacturers don’t provide adequate plans for protecting them. The agency also issued a safety communication to manufacturers and hospitals.
In addition to viruses and malware, security risks include the uncontrolled distribution of passwords for software that is supposed to be accessed only by a few people and the failure by manufacturers to provide timely security software updates.
In a public alert Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security, which is working with the FDA, credited Rios and McCorkle — both of whom work for Cylance, a cybersecurity firm — for their research on devices and passwords. Unauthorized access to passwords could allow critical settings to be changed, affecting how devices operate and what they do, the alert said.
The two security experts created a spreadsheet listing the device passwords they obtained and the 50 manufacturers that made the equipment. The DHS and FDA are working with the manufacturers to verify whether the potential risks from the passwords “are indeed actual vulnerabilities,” Maisel said.",finance,1371396518

international bp holdings news story

(CNN) -- The worst charity in America operates from a metal warehouse behind a gas station in Holiday, Florida.

Every year, Kids Wish Network raises millions of dollars in donations in the name of dying children and their families.

Every year, it spends less than 3 cents on the dollar helping kids. Most of the rest gets diverted to enrich the charity's operators and the for-profit companies Kids Wish hires to drum up donations.

In the past decade alone, Kids Wish has channeled nearly $110 million donated for sick children to its corporate solicitors. An additional $4.8 million has gone to pay the charity's founder and his own consulting firms.

No charity in the nation has siphoned more money away from the needy over a longer period of time. 

But Kids Wish is not an isolated case, a yearlong investigation by the Tampa Bay Times and The Center for Investigative Reporting has found. 

Using state and federal records, the Times and CIR identified nearly 6,000 charities that have chosen to pay for-profit companies to raise their donations.

Then reporters took an unprecedented look back to zero in on the 50 worst - based on the money they diverted to boiler room operators and other solicitors over a decade.

TREASURY rentene stiger. Så er dollar. Inflasjon er fallende. Aksjer har blitt slått tilbake litt av en global besvimelse, men har falt mye mindre enn andre markeder. Arbeidsmarkedet er bedre hvis beskjeden jevnt. Industriell virksomhet er flat, men andre privat sektor aktivitet ser sterk. Husholdningenes økonomi ser mye sterkere. Hva skal vi gjøre med alt dette?

Svaret synes å være mest tydelig i inflasjonen tallene. Som Matt O'Brien notater, kjernen inflasjon har vært sørover på tre år, og viser lite tegn til å bremse. Nedgang over det siste året, som har fanget mange overraskende gitt anstendig ytelsen til den amerikanske økonomien og Fed's (relativt) imøtekommende holdning, reflekterer utviklingen av noen tasten trender.

Først er ebbet av vare pris tidevannet. I KPI, har energipriser falt 4,3% i året til April. I NIPA dataene falt prisene for energi varer i 7,5% årlig tempo i første kvartal. Dette utviklingen det meste vises i overskriften tiltak av inflasjon, selvfølgelig, men også jobbe seg gjennom til kjernen priser til en viss grad. Synkende råvarepriser synes å være delvis på grunn av raskere levere vekst (spesielt i energi) og delvis på grunn av en uventet skarp nedgang i fremvoksende markedet økonomisk vekst.

Andre er bred disinflation i varer priser. I NIPA tallene prisene for varige forbruksvarer falt i 1,1% årlig tempo i første kvartal, og for ikke-holdbare varer falt i en 0,8% årlig tempo. Tallene i KPI er like med unntak av overraskende styrke i prisene for kjøretøy. Prisene for varer synes å være mer reflektert av globale kapasitetsskranker enn innenlandsk produksjon gapet, så denne slowdown synes også knyttet til utviklingen i verdensøkonomien. Rask vekst i produktiv potensial over hele verden er å kommunisere med en skarp nedgang i veksten i etterspørselen, til fordel for amerikanske forbrukere.

Tredje er det ligner en meningsfull og vedvarende nedgang i kostnadene for helsevesenet. Priser for helsetjenester steg bare 1,9% i 2012, ned fra 2,7% i 2009 og 3,1% i 2006.

Priser for de fleste andre servicekategorier vokser i ganske stabilt mote, på nær 2%. Og prisene for husly stiger i en lav men akselererende tempo.

Jeg skrev nylig at jeg var bekymret Fed kanskje tror i dag ser mer ut som 2004 enn 1995. Oppmuntrende for den amerikanske økonomien ser (forutsatt at Fed får ting riktig) gjeldende forholdene svært mye som de som rådet under tech boom år. Råvare-pris Press var nesten helt fraværende da, takk delvis til veldig svake økonomiske forhold i Asia; Det høres sammenlignes med det vi ser nå. Hjemme, var økonomien nyter stor vekst i økonomiske potensialet takket være teknologi og detaljhandel innovasjon. Som, igjen, ser sammenlignbare. Boligsektoren vokste i robust mote på 1990-tallet. Men Inflasjonen var det meste dempet og begrenset til tjenesteaktiviteten – det vil si lønns gevinster. Svak pris gevinster i varer og varer la Fed følelsen sikker turtall den økonomiske motoren; nominell utgang vekst chugged på mer enn 6% i 1990. Rask vekst og stramme arbeidsmarkedet oversatt til fin nominell lønns gevinster som kombinert med lav varer og varer inflasjon å gi husholdninger en sunn virkelige lønnsforhøyelse.

Men det var lett, logistisk snakker, for Fed til å la ekspansjon kjøre, fordi renter var mye høyere. Fed funds rate var rundt 5% for de fleste av 1990, og så alt Fed måtte gjøre for å holde ting går var justere opp eller ned for å holde sine beregninger på en linje. Men nå, opprettholde holdningen til pengepolitikken (andre ting like) betyr å holde balansen konstant og lovende til å forlate politikken rate nær null i flere år. Fed ønsker ikke å gjøre det, fordi det er stadig mer bekymret for alle slags finansiell risiko. Det virkelig ønsker ikke å presse på gasspedalen litt mer å holde beregninger på sporet. Alan Greenspan kunne skjær 50 basispunkter av fed funds rate i 1998. Ben Bernanke har å kjøpe milliarder i Treasuries og boliglån-støttet verdipapirer og gjøre alle slags kommentarer om hva økonomiske forhold vil utløse hva rate handlinger flere år nedover veien. Fed liker ikke gjøre det heller.

But a better measure of US debt would include some of the off balance sheet items.

There hasn't been much discussion on Lending Club, especially now that they are posting a profit and Google has taken a stake in the company.  Large institutional investors are now using it and that's usually a great sign...  People were skeptical of it, and I can see why.  However, what is r/personalfinance's opinion these days?

Just for background, this is how I use it:

I add $100 once a month over four different $25 notes.  Reinvest any payments once I have the $25 amount.

If a note goes into the grace period, I try to sell that note for about %80 it's Principal + Projected Interest.  I'm not sure if this is good or if anyone will buy it, this happened to me just last week and no one has purchased the debt.  

Even if a few loans Default or are late on the payment, in the long run, if I diversify my loan notes enough, wouldn't that be okay? Currently, I have a projected interest rate of ~18%.  

BTW I'm 27, paying off student loans, maxing IRA, matching 401k, currently saving an emergency fund.  I generally have my shit together, so the $100/month is not something that I'm worrying about once it's in Lending Club.

So - who is for Lending Club and who's against it?",finance,1371506383

personalfinance,"Half year as a contractor, the second half as an hourly employee; how do I figure out my tax rate?","I worked the first half of this year as a 1099 contractor and just got a full-time job that will pay me hourly. I'm terminating my current contract at the end of the month and before I start my full-time job.

I'm trying to plan out a revised budget for this year in light of my new income, and by my calculations, my total income this year from both jobs will put me in the 15% fed bracket. However, I'm not sure how to account for my contracting rate when figuring out what I'm going to owe and what my net income will be.

Last year, I just paid the contracting tax rate (last year it was 15%, this year is 18.80% for me) since I worked 100% of the year as a contractor, but I'm not quite sure what to expect tax-wise this year.

personalfinance,pay off student loans?,"Minor question that is partly theoretical: 

I have only about $50 in student loans remaining out of $1500 that I borrowed last August.  No payments have been due but I've been paying off the loan anyway. Actually I could have paid it off early but wanted to stretch the loan out for longer on my credit report.  

Is there any benefit to not paying off the loan in full and keeping it active/open on my credit report?  The interest rate is 6.8% but the principal is so low it's negligible. 

My priority is to keep a high credit score ( in order to help with credit card churning) by diversifying my credit types.  Did it help my credit at all to draw out the payment of my student loan?  Would it help at all to keep the account open?  

In general, I understand that you should pay off debts ASAP but thought in this case, taking out a loan and paying it off within a couple months (as a ""refund"") could look bad to lenders.  By stringing it out i have paid about $20 in interest and fees. This is my only debt and I will hit my goal of 6 months expenses emergency fund by end of August.",finance,1371496789

personalfinance,Transferring Stafford student loan to parent's home equity line of credit. Does lower interest rate beat student loan interest deduction?,"My Stafford student loans were recently transferred from Direct Federal Student Loan Servicing to Aspire Resources.  There were a couple snafus with the whole process including a payment made to the original servicer after the loan was closed (before I received the notice) but before the loans were transferred to Aspire.  Also the minimum payment was lowered, which really doesn't make sense to me either.  I have always paid 200-300% of the minimum payment, but I don't think the loan repayment terms should not change with this sort of transfer.  My most recent credit report pull (rotate getting free pulls between the 3 bureaus each year) showed my Direct loan as being closed out and does not yet have my Aspire loan.

Anyways I've used my parents home equity line of credit to get me through past college expenses that were not covered by Stafford loans.  I've asked my parents if I can pay off my remaining balance with Aspire and repay them at 3% interest over 5 years (in order to agree on a minimum payment plan -- I still plan on over paying and paying off the remaining debt within 3-4 years).  Here are the figures:

-**Current balance (payoff amount):**  $12,300

-**Current minimum payment amount:**  $164.42

-**Current interest rate**:  most of the loans are at 6.8%, about $1000 is at the subsidized 5.6% rate.

-**New interest rate I will pay my parents**:  3%

-**Minimum payment to parents based on 5 year plan**:  $221

**-Likely payment to parents based on past 2 years of loan repayments**:  $400-$500

-**Savings in interest if paid off in 3/4/5 years** (calculated using 6.8% vs. 3% for minimum payments in order to close out current balance in 36/48/60 months):  $755/$1015/$1290.

**-Current salary:**  $67,000.  2-5% annual bonus, 2-5% annual raise.

The only thing I am uncertain of is the interest deduction when doing my federal tax returns.  I will obviously lose this by closing out the loan with the government.  Is it safe to assume that the money saved by the lower interest rate will make up for the reduced taxable income from student loan interest deduction?

I'm almost positive that jumping on my parent's offer is most beneficial, but figured it doesn't hurt to run it by /r/personalfinance first!",finance,1371487389

personalfinance,"I want to start getting serious about managing my money, looking for advice. (Canada)","So I've been reading posts on here and am almost finished with the book ""I will teach you to be rich"" by Ramit Sethi.   So far I've learned a few things and I want to start a plan.  

My situation is as follows.

No debt.
Income will be around $15,000 this year before taxes.
Major expense is rent which is $300 a month, or $3,600 a year.

This leaves me with around $11,400 to distribute.  I've been putting most of it into a high interest savings account.  My current savings are at $20,000 and I get a flat 1.050% interest.  I haven't really tracked my spending.

1) Ramit suggests opening an online savings with an online bank, such as ING.  The reason was because of better interest rates than brick and mortar banks.  I believe he mentioned 3% up to 6%.  This seemed too good to be true since the highest I've found was ING with 1.35% interest.  It is a bit higher than what I have, but have things really changed that much since 2009?  Or is 3-5% USA rates?  Or am I just looking at the wrong thing?  Is it worth it for a 0.30% increase?

2) Currently I am self employed and have not contributed anything to a retirement plan.  I've read that it's best to start as early as possible so I'd like to do that.  However, I have decided to go back to school and take up a trade.  Because of this I foresee my self earning less money, but I'm unsure of how much.  I also plan on purchasing a car which I want to last me as long as possible.  This will add in insurance payments.  Because of this, should I open a TFSA (Tax free savings account, similar to a Roth IRA I believe) and/or contribute to a RRSP (401k) plan?  According to my credit union, the interest on a TFSA is the same as my high interest, 1.050%.

3) I have a $500 no fee credit card.  I've only been using it for online.  I've never payed interest on it and plan to keep it that way.  I would like to increase my limit to $1000 since it'll add more flexibility.  Ramit also talked about credit utilization and how it's good for your credit score.  I'll have to look up the exact details but I hope you guys know what I mean.  However I would like to have a couple things clarified.

a) Early on, I now know I made a mistake.  I basically made two purchases around $450 on the credit card.  This was close to my limit but I did pay it off right away.  This was three years ago, so I'm wondering how much of an effect it would have.  I've only had the credit card for a couple months at that time.

b) When exactly should I be making my payments?  What I do is transfer money from my checking account to my credit card up to a two weeks after a purchase.  For example, Netflix bills me on the 22nd of April for $7.99.  I will pay this $7.99 either as soon as the 23rd, or as late as the 6th of May (14 days).  The longest I have ever waited was three weeks, 21 days which I understand is the cut off date before you get interest.  Is this the proper way to pay off a credit card?  I've yet to request my credit score so I'm not sure what it is.

4) I'm not exactly sure how much I want to spend on a car yet.  I'll need to do research on a good reliable car since I want to keep it running for as long as possible.  When I'm ready to buy a car, should I take out a loan or just pay in cash?  I've noticed that some certified pre-owned cars are only a few thousand dollars less than a brand new car.  I'll have to get a quote on insurance but would it be a good idea to just buy a brand new car between $12k and $16k?

5)  And finally, after the car and putting aside 6 months as an emergency fund, should I begin investing?  This is completely new to me so I need to do more research.

I know finance is not one size fits all, it is personal after all, but I am having trouble convincing myself that I should fit the mold of emergency fund, max 401k, max Roth as is prescribed.  So please help me see my error in logic, or maybe help validate what I am doing.

My wife and I have income of approx 115 (45 and 70 respectively) and we have a savings budget of 25k annually.  My employer offers a stock purchase program, it allows me to receive an instant 15% discount on stock purchases with a limit of 10% of my income, which I max out for 7k, this yields a minimum of $8200 which we split between our Roth IRAs (and often yields more depending on stock performance).  The remaining 18k we contribute to our 401k which holds about 100k.

We have no emergency fund.

My thought was always if we have a true emergency we can borrow up to 50% from our 401k quickly. The objections I have seen to this plan are:
1)Liquidity - But I can get the money within five days, and we have well over 50k of open credit we could use until then
2)Lost Investment Income - The interest on the 401k loan goes back to the account, not the bank, which covers most of any lost investment income. Assuming 3.5% interest and 5% expected growth)

My biggest point of contention is tax.  Currently, our incremental tax rate is approx 30% (25% federal and 5% state).  So if I reduce my 401k contributions by $200 a week to start building an emergency fund, I am giving $60 a week up in tax and only saving $140, second is that $140 is not growing at 5% like the 401k is.

I have contributed to my 401(k) at work for 1 year (all of 2012), and would like to start contributing more towards my retirement as early as I can, even with the small amount I'm making right now. Basically, though, the big question here is what the relation is between one's tax liability and additional contributions to an IRA.

personalfinance,1 year left of college. Time to start planning for life on my own after graduation.,"Hey /r/PF,

As I said, I'm starting to lay the blueprints so that I can graduate and be fiscally responsible and happy.

A little about myself:

* I attend a private, liberal arts school majoring in Computer Science.
* All totaled, I have ~&lt;10k in students loans through my university and FAFSA. Very low interest rate, which is nice.
* I do not have a credit history, but I have been banking through Chase under their college checking account. I have 1 debit card. I have roughly $600 in the bank.
* I am working at a paid internship this summer. On top of what I have, take away what the necessities (fuel, rent, food) and small personal expenses (damn you, Steam summer sale!) and I'll have ~3k in the bank come September.
* My parents have good credit. One works for the university I went to, the other is self employed. Before taxes, they brought in ~300k last year. I'm damn proud of them.
* I have a car that is paid for.

So, questions:

&gt; I need to build credit. I estimate that I spend &lt; $1k per month, which is greatly diminished during school months. So far I have found that the Chase Freedom card is compelling, but I'm afraid of credit utilization when factored into my FICO score, i.e., if I pay $650 for rent this month, on top of ~$200 for personal expenses, and I have a 1k credit limit, won't that adversely affect my credit score? I am rather good about tracking my expenses (I use Mint) and I will always pay the statement balance / current balance.

                                                                                                                                              .

&gt; When I graduate, I will no longer have my Chase college checking account. What should I do? I'd like to set up my checking account as the money vault (i.e., where I have my paychecks sent to), the savings account as the emergency fund, and use the credit card for expenses (for the rewards). Who should I bank with? What differences should I pay attention to? What SHOULDNT I do?

                                                                                                                                              .

&gt; Any other financial advice you would give to yourself were you graduating at this time (don't spend money on girls, budget for entertainment, what type place to live in, how to minimize costs on groceries and otherwise, etc)?

gaming,I'm done with the next generation...,"So, I kinda want to make a rant on the next generation, and this mainly includes the Xbox One and the PS4.

I love gaming, I've been playing games since I was 4 years old. Always loved gaming, mainly Nintendo, and since my 12th I got a ps3 and 360 (I can say with confidence that I was/am not a annoying kid who screams that I f'ed you're mom.)

But the thing I really got sick of the last two years, is that it seem that Gaming is not about FUN anymore. Maybe it's because I'm getting a bit older and wiser, but there are a lot of people who just complain about everything, and gaming had become serious business for company's. While it used to be just about Fun, have fun with your games and don't worry about anything.
Now what do we have to deal with? Used Games DRM, Always Online,... ? I'm getting really tired of all this.

I watched Adam Sesslers video about why you shouldn't pre-order a next-gen console. I agree with him. It's all just stories, even Sony, who looks like the good guy, it's still just promises, things change.

I just don't get why I can't get home from school, sit down, and play a game, Why do I have to think about all this stuff? Gaming is taken way to seriously.

Honestly, I don't know what to say about it anymore, I feel like I want to say a lot more, but just can't find the words to say it. 
I also understand that i'm complaining about how gaming is taken to seriously, and about how we should stop complaining about it, so that i'm, well... a hypocrite. But to be honest, I also kinda get it. Everyone is talking about it, and to just ignore this is really difficult.

I might buy a 3DS XL with animal crossing and fire emblem. Since Nintendo, does seem about fun. Nintendo is the perfect example, of how gaming should be treated. 

I might get a lot of responses like: ""I don't get your point. Just go and do your own thing then.""
I understand that, but I'm sure there are some gamers out there who know what I mean, and know what the heck I'm talking about.

But there's a name for the cost that businesses have to pay to enter a market or industry that's regulated by the government, for example.

Here's one example: A pawn shop needs to report everything it buys and sells to the local police. The costs of having someone staffed and spending the time to do this must be considered when doing the books. This is a cost that must be considered when thinking about opening a pawn shop to see if the business will be lucrative.

Sometimes these costs are too high in some industries, making it hard for smaller business to thrive or even begin. Profitability is tougher, so the entry level into the industry is high.

There are other examples: Minimum wage needs to be considered, certain industries demand you have insurance coverage, some businesses require you have a certain amount of parking spots for your employees.

What is this cost called? I couldn't even begin to imagine how to google it. I tried...

Would paying more, such that I paid off my loans earlier (5 years, say, or even 2.5) hurt my credit, and should that consideration override the several thousand dollars I will be saving in interest?

Also, for credit cards, can someone explain a ""good"" plan for using them?  I currently have one, a rewards card with a high interest rate, that I have no intention of keeping a balance on.  What would be the 'best' way to manage its use such that I could improve my credit?

Entertainment........	65.00	 (Netflix/Internet)

Savings................	        125.00

Left	.....................930.50	

Food...................	500.00	
Left.....................	430.50

This doesn't include pay raises expected this year and a quarterly bonus of $750 gross (I usually don't count bonus money, even though it's 99% going to happen).

Is this is a reasonable budget?  

We have no debt, both college degrees are paid off for both us so no student loans, no credit card debt will exist at the time of closing.  1 kid (8), shared custody with father so most expenses are split 50/50 and we have him 1/2 the time.

Both jobs are steady.  We'll have about 10k in savings after putting 15k down.  Inspection on home went great, no issues found, new furnace, 40 year roof, no landscape issues, etc ... 

We are completely new to buying a home and unfortunately commute and competitive market is forcing us to go above a bit of what we planned to spend (3 months looking at 225k homes  that don't exist for what we would feel happy with, so looking at 245k).  

Is this stretching us too thin? Any input would be greatly appreciated.  I know people always say 25% of Net, but our rent for our condo is incredibly cheap and it's 1k which is 25% of net.  We would never be able to purchase in the Portland area (or much of the surrounding) for 25% net.


**EDIT:**  Thank you all for your input, I truly do appreciate all the time and thought put into the responses.  Going to have a long talk tonight.  I don't feel we can do it, or rather, I don't feel we should.  I think we should save the $800-1000 difference each month and work towards a larger down payment and more savings in the bank for emergency situations we'll be in a much better position.

I do feel we'll be losing on great interest rates, those will go up, and so will housing but by how much we'll never be able to guess.  

**DOUBLE REDDIT EDDIT:**  We withdrew the offer.  Only out $380 for the house inspection but realistically I think we were stretching ourselves too thin.  Anything could have come up and it would have caused serious issues.  We're going to try and save $1000+ a month and see where we are in a year or two.  $12,000 doesn't sound like much for a year of waiting, especially if the market rises around us, but it's better than being in a situation we can't get out of.

We consider this a good long term investment in our future, but right now we have about 60k in total student loan debt. Our mortgage is manageable ($1240) and we have one car payment ($240/month, 14k total, 0% interest rate for life of the loan). No credit card debt. We're expecting to spend at minimum $800 per month on daycare starting in November, plus $90/month for diaper service, plus other baby related expenses.

We're wrestling with several issues right now. We'd like to move to a bigger house closer to family in a year (we're currently in a small house, less than 1000 sq ft., with a bad layout for a family), and we'd like to save up a 20% down payment to avoid PMI. We currently have about $25k in savings, and hope to have about $40k by this point next year in projected savings. 

However, I am starting to consider using most of our savings to start destroying our student loans. I figure that this would free up some of our monthly cash flow, and better position us to invest and/or save more down the line. This would of course throw a wrench in our plans to move soon though, and would obviously eat up our current savings. 

Are we best to just sit tight, paying off the required payments and continuing to build our savings, or to attack our debt?

**TLDR; Baby on the way, high student loan debt, desire to buy house in a year. Should we attack debt or continue saving?**",finance,1371685933

personalfinance,"Can't afford all my bills, which student loan should I get forbearance on?","I just got slammed with a $5,800 hospital bill.  I am appealing the claim with insurance but, I need to assume that I'll have to pay it.

I'm not doing too well right now.  I have a lot of student debt, but not a high salary.

I'm 27.  I make $38,000 a year, which may increase slightly soon but not by much.  After taxes and health insurance I make about $2,200 a month.

I simply can't pay everything I have and this hospital bill, but can't decide which loans to get a forbearance on.

I have $1,100 in checking and $1,000 in savings

My debt breakdown:

$1,800 credit card (used it in emergency situation, can't pay it all off)

$50,000 federal student loans (sub and ub-sub), $265 per month payment total, 5.75% interest

$6,000 Sallie Mae private loan, $126 per month payment, ~10% interest

$4,000 Discover private loan, $50 per month payment, ~10% interest

$7,000 Discover private loan, $60 per month payment, ~10% interest

$12,000 ECSI private loan, $150 per month payment, 5% interest

I need to free up at least $150 or so, and then want to pay this hospital bill ASAP and get it over with.  I was thinking if I got a forbearance on my loans with the lowest interest rates, Federal and ECSI, that frees up $410 a month and I could pay off the hospital bill in a year.

BUT, I want to use my forbearance time carefully, I want to save as much as possible for future emergencies... I'll be paying off the federal loans for at least 20 years, so shouldn't I try and save its forbearance for unforeseen (and likely, with my luck) emergencies that may happen a decade or more from now?

Please let me know what you think... I've already filled out the paperwork for the ECSI loan, but want to free up a bit more so I can tackle this bill.",finance,1371684038

personalfinance,Just graduated from law school: $170k in debt with a $110k salary. How should I manage my debt with savings so I can start building a solid financial future?,"PF: I'm glad I found this subreddit. A little about me, I'm absolutely clueless when it comes to finance.  I'm 25 years old and don't own a credit card.  I currently have 2k in checking and that's it.  I start work in early August. Some general points:

* I have $155,000 in student loan debt, with interest that puts me at $170,000.  All of my interest rates are between 6% and 8%
* I have a job that pays me $110,000 per year starting, with a (likely minimum) $10,000 bonus each year
* I have a life insurance policy with a cash value I can borrow against at 4.5% up to $50,000
* I have good job security, about as good as you can have in the legal world. Very low turnover where I'm going and my salary should rise, along with my bonus. 
* I do not have a credit card and I have about $2,000 in my name right now.
* I will be living at home for at least until January, leaving me no overhead costs (90% of salary is freed up)
* I get a 100% match on 401k contributions starting January of 2015. 

Now that you have a rough idea of my financial and professional situation, here are my questions:

* Should I aggressively pay down debt while I live at home and forego saving/investing anything until after I move out in January? 
* Can I open a credit card and pay down debt using the card and then immediately pay it off in order to generate cash back points in some manner (if this is stupid, I apologize, I really don't understand this stuff)
* Is there a good reference to select a credit card company based on things other than the ultimate savings I'd get? I read horrible things about big banks all the time (i.e. Bank of America) and would prefer to select the lesser of the evils
* Is there a good book to buy that gives an intro to finance to recent grads that I can use to get myself up to speed? Some have recommended The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need, is that a good place to start?
* Should I borrow against my life insurance policy, use that to pay off student loans, then pay back the insurance company at the lower interest rate? This seems like a no-brainer, but I may be missing something? 

Sorry for the flurry of information and questions, it seemed like the easiest way to communicate all that's swirling around in my head right now. Due to the high interest rates on my loans, I figure paying them off would be the biggest return on my money for now, and then as I start winning the debt battle, I can turn to saving and investing more.",finance,1371667926

Need a low-limit, non-prepaid credit card to smooth out monthly bill payment sequence.","What are some legitimate resources to research and apply for credit cards when you have fair to poor credit? I got as far as creditcards.com, but they want your SSN right off the bat, and I'm not comfortable with that.

Background: 

After several months of unemployment, I recently started a job that just barely covers all our expenses. The job pays weekly, but rent is about two-fifths my monthly pay, and car payment is another fifth, so I'm always playing catch-up and trying to dodge late fees.

I went through a personal bankruptcy about two and a half years ago that was entirely due to credit cards, so I've avoided getting any since then, but I think it's time now. I want to be able to have all my recurring bills go straight to the card, so that I can save up cash for the large expenses (rent, car), pay those first, and then send the rest to the card as checks come in. A thousand dollar limit should be plenty.

A prepaid card would defeat the purpose. If possible, I'd like to avoid anything with a ridiculous annual fee or that starts charging interest on the date of purchase. I have joined a credit union, but have two loans through them already, and they don't want to give me a card until there's a decent dent in those.

I get occasional offers in the mail for cards with a $75 to $100 annual fee, at interest rates in the low to mid 20's, and that usually start charging interest on the date of purchase and have a minimum interest charge. I'd like to do better than that. Ideas?",finance,1371663279

Everything I've been working toward over the last 10 years of my life has been in alignment with this program, so I will excel in this program and will have many great job opportunities afterward.

I'm single, no kids, no credit card debt, and about 30k in previous school loan debt. 


The graduate school costs around 60k a year (tuition, housing, food, trans) and I have a 1/3 scholarship. Federal Loans will cover around $20,500, so I need to find the remaining funds. 


I'll need to complete my masters degree in order to become a licensed professional and I'm looking to start my own business within 8 years of graduating. My field doesn't exactly pay very well unless you have a ton of experience (which i do) and are very talented in a niche area (which I am and this school focuses on), or start your own business (which i will)


I applied for the Direct Plus loan and was declined. (I don't have much of a credit history, but I don't have bad history) And the financial aid office suggested that I find a co-signer. I really don't want to put anyone in this position, as I would never think about co-signing anything unless it was a future child of mine... 


I have two people who MIGHT be willing to co-sign, but if they don't want to (I wouldn't blame them), am I screwed? Would I not be able to get the funding I need to finish? 


I'm really worried about this, and getting a masters degree is required in order for me to continue to advance in my career. 


Thank you for any guidance.

So, how do I best maximize my options here: do an initial balance transfer of 1500 and make payments on it and my old CC that total up to 400 dollars (paying the minimum on my old CC and whatever is left on the balance transfer) or transferring 400/month to my new CC and make the full payment over there or is there some better way to do this?

For those of you familiar with the product I hope your experience was better than mine.  I purchased a brand new headset, went home and set it up.  I was thinking it odd that the drivers available for the set were 3 years old, but I figured it's a headset how bad could it be without current drivers?

Well using the USB adapter the headphone audio was actually quite good.  The microphone on the other hand left me sounding like i was talking through a tin can telephone stuffed with cotton from 10 feet away.  No matter what settings I changed I could not get the microphone input to sound any louder and any change I made seemed to cause the ""noise-cancelling"" microphone to do the opposite of what it was supposed to do.  It was attempting to amplify all background noise and cancel out my voice.

Using the straight analog option available with this set EVERYTHING had a terrible mechanical sound behind it, and I started getting 8-bit sounding reverb like explosion sounds.  I tried it on multiple computers same issue.  So it was USB or nothing.

I spent several hours messing with it and googling the issue.  So far there have been no solutions, I have returned the set and just wanted to warn people that the Raptor H5 headset is a great headset if you never plan on talking to people using it.",technology,1371653094

investing,Differences between REITs or your own property?,"I just read an article on WSJ on how REITs have fallen over the past few months after it was indicated that interest rates were set to be on the rise. That got me thinking - what are the main differences between investing in a REIT and your own property? (note: Aside from the actual property management itself, I just mean from a purely investment standpoint.) I thought it might lead for an interesting discussion.

Aside from controlling your own destiny with your own property, it seems like: A) a REIT is easier to get into with smaller capital, and B) a REIT is more liquid. 

The pros to owning your own property would be the fact that you can leverage your investment several times to get potentially better returns, and then certain tax advantages.

Seems like the biggest difference is the lack of leverage, where if you buy a $200,000 property, you can finance $150,000 of it. You wouldn't be able to get this type of leverage with a REIT investment, unless you traded on margin, which is costlier than interest rates.

* 20% down, although clearly I would lose approx. half of that if I sell now.
* Payments currently ~$1000, PITI (i.e. all in).
* House is in great shape, no major expenses / projects expected.

The next house:

* We want to move now, but can wait 2-3 years (no more, no less - second kid will probably take 2014 off the table, but by 2016 the first starts school, so we want to lock it down by then).

* Current home is safe, easy, VERY affordable to our budget.  Our front end ratio (yes, former UW here) is only about 15%... we bank hundreds of dollars each month.  Life is good, not gonna lie.

* Have 2-3 subdivisions in mind, one town over, homes go for about 275-350K.  Probably looking at the payment going up to $1,700 per month.  Confident we can afford this, but we WON'T have a 20% down-payment... at least 5%, probably 10%, that's it.

The twist:

* A lot of the homes in our current subdivision are being turned into rentals, doing VERY well.  I said before our payment (PITI) is ~$1,000... house across the street rents for $1,400 per month.  Sounds tempting.

* If we wait two years, we'll get some early inheritance, probably $40K.  Plus the funds we already have, that could be 20% down, WITHOUT having to sell the current home.  I like this a lot (especially if we turn house 1 into a rental), I'm kinda old school - believe you should put down that 20% if you can.

* Major temptation to buy now: rates.  They are so good and I'm very suspicious they will go up if we wait beyond this year.  How much, who knows?  But I'm suspicious.  We can afford the PMI, and pay it down once we get the inheritance infusion.  We plan to be in the next home for 20+ years, so locking in a great rate is a major concern.

I don't know what to do /r/personalfinance.  I'm usually the conservative type with finances... wait for the inheritance, put the 20% down, don't carry two homes at once... but I'm seeing a great opportunity to lock in a great rate today, and get an extra cash flow from a rental property.  Am I in over my head?  Anyone have personal experience doing this?  What would you do?

* Option 1: Buy new home now / sell current
* Option 2: Buy new home / hold-rent current home
* Option 3: Wait*

personalfinance,Super responsible with student loans; can I take it a step further with loan consolidation?,"**TL;DR: I am a little under $20K in debt, having 5 different student loans with interest rates ranging from 4.5-6.8%. On average, my minimum monthly payments are $180.98, but I pay about $352 a month. I want to know whether it's a good idea to consolidate all my loans for 5.5% interest in order to pay off my debt sooner.**

I have a very basic understanding of how balances and interest rates work, so I wanted some guidance from this subreddit before I make a big and complicated decision like loan consolidation. 

I have 5 different student loans: 4 of those loans I pay monthly through Sallie Mae and 1 loan I pay every quarter (once every three months) through ACS education.

My minimum Sallie Mae payments amount to $78.83 a month, but I am comfortable with sending in $250 a month. My minimum ACS payments amount to $306.45, which I pay in full every three months.

Here is a breakdown of my loans and their interest rates:

Stafford Unsubsidized (low balance @high interest rate)

Direct Loan Subsidized (high balance @low interest rate)

Direct Loan Unsubsidized (low balance @high interest rate)

Stafford Unsubsidized (low balance @high interest rate)

Perkins *** (high balance @low interest rate)

*** this is the ACS loan that I pay quarterly

By using the [Direct Loan Consolidation online calculator](https://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/loancalc/servlet/Controller?controller_task=startCalculator), I was able to determine that with a balance of $18,904.56 I could qualify for 5.5% interest rate (5.25% if I enrolled in automatic payments which I will probably do since I am hell-bent on saving money). 

I'm wondering whether it is a good idea to consolidate all 5 loans. If I did my math correctly, I think I should be able to save about $23 a month on interest. But I have no idea if I did my math right, ahaha. Otherwise, is there another method I can take to pay off my debt sooner? The online calculator did not estimate my monthly payments but I've decided to either pay $250 or the minimum every month, whichever amount is greater.

In the past, the ""additonal payments"" I made to Sallie Mae was applied to the principal of my subsidized Direct Loan because it collected the most interest compared to the other three loans. If consolidation is not the way, then should I revert to what I was doing before or should I try to pay off my smaller loans first, like my unsubsidized Direct Loan?

According to unbury.me, I should pay off the last of my loans around 2021. I want to be free of my debt sooner than that because my little bro is entering college soon and I want to help him with his debts. Sorry for the load of information!

personalfinance,"Advice: Changed jobs, no matching at new company, unsure of next steps for rollover","Hello!

I'm looking for advice as to what to do with my old 401(k) plan and whether to continue my new plan. Three months ago I accepted a new job. I'm working in the IT field and had the opportunity to move back home with the parents. At the old job, I was enrolled in a traditional 401(k) with Vanguard and was supposed to have a 25% per dollar match up to 6% and be fully vested in 3 years. Well, I was only enrolled in the plan for less than a year and left the job before the company made any contributions, so I'm fully vested in my own contributions which are at $3700. 


At the new job, some small company is managing the 401(k) options there. I enrolled at 5% and have $650 in that account now. I had thought upon hiring that there was a company match, but alas, there is none, so I'm not really getting any benefit out of it. (Side note: The new company has something called an ESOP which they invest 10% of my salary into. I have no idea what that is and am looking into it). 


I have student loan debt of $20,000 with interest rates of 5.5% to 6.55% plus another $30,000 owed to my parents for their parent plus loans. I've been trying to pay back these loans aggressively, and since I'm not getting any matches for my 401(k)s, I'm not sure what to do with them at this point. Current loan payments are: $900/mo to parents, $425/mo to student loan holders, and an extra $1000/mo payment to the loan with highest interest rate and highest principal.


My current strategy is to rollover my Vanguard 401(k) into a Roth IRA with the understanding that I'll have to pay taxes on it this year. I also want to close my current 401(k) -- I think it's managed by Conrad Siegal but invested in a Vanguard account(?) -- and rollover whatever I have in there into the Roth IRA. I don't see any reason to maintain a traditional IRA at this point as I'm not getting any matching, nor have I received any. 


My questions are:
1. Does this make sense?
2. Are there any other options I should consider?
3. Should I continue to make contributions to the Roth IRA (if I go that route) once everything is rolled over? I know I should be paying off my loans aggressively (which I am), but I'm unsure as to whether $100 a month into the Roth IRA will ultimately make more than that $100 going to loan payments.


Any advice would be great. Thank you very much!",finance,1371751209

I recently was hired by a big name, reputable insurance and finance company and will largely be selling life insurance policies in the Midwest.  The work is commission based, with large bonuses in the first year, leveling off by the third year when I begin collecting off of contract renewals.  I'm projected to earn around $45,000 in my first year, with growth every year, especially as I accumulate more contract renewals.

Here's where I'm at right now.  I have maybe $200 in my bank at the moment, bills of around $600 due at the end of the month, $26,000 is student loan debt to start paying in 4 months, and various licensing fees upcoming.  I will be commuting about an hour to work every day.  Also, I will likely need to find a new place to live in the next couple of months.  Since my work is commission based and I start training next week, it could be 30-45 days before I see a paycheck.

My plan for now was to apply for a credit card, I can get a good deal on one through my school's credit union now that I've graduated, and use it to pay all expenses for the next couple months while using my bank account to make minimum payments until some checks start rolling in.

Is this a viable solution for me at the moment?  Is there any other advice I could use to help me out in the mean time or future?  Thanks!

gaming,Sony must be laughing out their asses...,"So the announcement came and Microsoft had to give in to the pressure of the mob. Not even realising they were hurting themselves. We could have had something amazing. Digital gaming on par with steam and still have the ability to trade in our games. 
You all complained about something you didn't understand. Microsoft had something that would leave Sony in the prehistoric era and would have been a major competitor to Valves Steam.
I personally think they should have stuck to their guns and use the time to try and explain to the rest of you idiots how it was going to make things better. In a few months we would have been laughing at PS4 owners because they had to pay $60 for a game and que up at midnight to get it.. While we would have been paying a much cheaper price for the same thing and all we had to do was click ""purchase"".. And we could start playing immediately while it finished downloading in the background. Looking out the window at the Sony fanboys fighting over line cuts while we took another sip of our coco.
For teens goiing babysitting on a Saturday night. They could pause a game and head over to the job then pick up where they left off on the kids console. Instead of unwiring their PS4, packing it in a bag, asking for permission and setting it up... Only to have to reverse the process at the end of the night. Then arrive home and realise they forgot their BF4 disc at the other house.
To actually have their game valued at a substantial price when trading it in. Getting about $10 for trading in which is ok cause the games would only about $30 anyway. Getting to laugh at the Sony kid next to them because he got 7 bucks for his game and it still leave him another $53 short of the game he wanted. Laughing even harder that when he realised his mistake and tried to buy it back they would tell him its $40 dollars.... Oh the lols....
To have a intelligent  cloud system where all the heavy processing was done on some dedicated servers and fed to each console at a equal rate. This might not have been perfect but hey.. It was a strong step closer to never having lag again. A touch of lag once every 5 games would have been enough ammo for me to laugh when I saw PS4 forums bitching about how ""lag compensation needs fixin god dammit"".
I was looking forward to all these things but you lot... The ""Internet""... Basement dwellers... The self righteous idiots who act like they know everything when the reality couldn't be further from the truth. You got hung up on things like
24 hr INTERNET ( which was not actually 24 hr Internet at all. It was signing into Xbox live once a day...something you lot do anyway cause Lets face it if you didn't there is a strong possibility you might have to face reality and that's not something you are prepared for ^clearly)
DRM ( basically Microsoft wanted to make sure you weren't cheating them by giving your games away because its how they could make price cuts in games and big bundle sales... And let's face it.. We would have cheated them... If they didnt put it in and left us go forth on the idea of good faith, we would have taken the opportunity to dry jump their leg and jizz on their nice new pants suit.. We would bite the hand that feeds... It's the scumbag mentality.. It's in all of us, we take and take but don't want to give.. That's the world we live in. Yet people couldn't understand this concept... HAH!)
USED GAMES ( this one... This is the only one of these that I might say ""we'll I guess this might confuse some people... Stupid people.. But still.. Some stupid people..."" I buy a game. I play the game.. My friend.. On the other side of the country says "" hey.. I never played that... Is it good?"" I say ""you know what.. Your my friend so here take it for a month and try it"" I give him access. Or my friend says ""hey you know they way 7 of us have an Xbox one? why don't we get a VIP account and then we can play whatever games the other one doesn't ha e right from our own console.. Wouldn't that be great??"" See I would have said yes.. You dumbasses said ""NO.. I'll bring my game in tomorrow and give it to you.. Then spend ages trying to get it back and pray you didn't scratch or damage it"")
KINECT ( seriously.... They tell you ""its ok guys you can turn its features off and just in case you been smoking too much weed and are still paranoid their will be a licensing agreement with it that states we can't share anything without your express permission... so if we actually did you could actually take Microsoft to court and get millions...

It's all gd"" if you seriously.. I mean SERIOUSLY... After some logical thinking... [Look who I'm sayin logical too lol...] believe that kinect is surveillance equipment watching you scratch your balls you need help... You need to be segregated from other humans invade your stupidity is infectious... Which apparently it is..)
Sony actually brought out the inferior console.
They were up shit creek. Steam was also shaking in its boots.. A challenger had emerged. Que sonys fanboys.. The voice of a generation... Not my voice mind you but a mobs voice. Que the average gamers.. Who don't know a GPU from a USB. Frightened by the confusion turn around to see what's being shouted. Afraid to look like they don't know what's going on.. (Which is the real thought in their heads) start shouting what they hear others shout... "" something something Dem... No something DM... No to DRM"" what's DRM? Shut up you'll make us look stupid... NO TO DRM!""
Sony must have been bricking it at first... ""We're fucked! Everyone's gone digital but us..."" Then a voice shouts ""wait sir! The fanboys have confused the public! We might actually win!!!"" Can you imagine the screams of laughter in Sony offices when they realised that the general public had managed to confuse itself out of the better deal???? And in their favour no less. I bet that when jack met with any member of the public or press at E3 after the conference it took ever once of strength not to laugh in their faces... Like stewie in family guy when he meets Brian's girlfriend Gillian... *laughs*""it's like she's fucking five!!!""
Well now instead of getting a REAL Next Gen Console I'm stuck with a PS4 with more features all thanks to you guys... Thank you!
Also I have to laugh at the fact that Microsoft bent to your will which they should never have done.. Yet you all still attempt to slander it today saying they only did it for sales.. Of course they did it for sales idiot the same way Sony announced they were stayin with discs for sales. These are businesses. They are there to make money and every decision is based on that.. Are you stupid?
I just wanted to vent. I don't give a fuck if this gets down voted or disappears into reddit archives. I am going to save a copy of this for myself  however...and look back on it when the world has evolved enough to realise its mistake... and people actually take a step forward in gaming as opposed to a step back... the day stupidity ruined consumerism.",technology,1371726421

How best to make this sum ""work"" for me?","**DISCLAIMER: I am not simply looking to be spoonfed information. I fully intend to do my own homework on this matter, but as of right now, I'm not really sure where to start (aside from the FAQs, which I've read). More than anything I'm looking for suggestions, and some guidance as to what I should be researching.**


The fine details are unimportant at the moment, so here's the overview:

*I'm a 30-year-old male US citizen living in the USA. A few years ago I was in an auto accident that seriously f'ed up my body, and has dramatically limited my earning potential in any sort of physical occupation. I received a settlement of approximately $50,000. As of right now, I have no debts, but the need for future health care is a very real possibility. I have no assets (save for my car). I have some college credits (was a biology major), but no degree. Due to permanent injury, my ""trade skills"" are basically irrelevant. Permanent disability/social security is also not available to me. My family, though loving and emotionally supportive, is in no position to provide material assistance.*

In short, I've been totally fucked over by the legal system and ""big insurance,"" and I feel that this settlement -- this tiny, tiny settlement -- may well be my ""last chance"" at getting on a trajectory towards a comfortable, secure, middle-class life that entails a modest home with minimal possessions, no crushing debt, and the ability to provide for myself and the family I hope to someday have. I'm now trying to decide how I can best use this settlement to secure my future.

From my research thus far, I am under the impression that if this settlement was $100k or more, I could probably (eventually) build myself an income stream by simply (""simply"") treating my money as investment capital, but alas, I don't think this strategy will work with the sum I have. If this was, say, ten years ago, I'd just throw myself back into college (I was studying to be a veterinarian) and worry about the $100k+ debt ""later."" But nowadays...well, as many of us are aware, taking on a bunch of student loan debt might not be the best plan. To boot, I'm 30, not 20, so ""later"" for me is ten years shorter than is for most other college sophomores. Given that, it seems to me I should probably be looking for options with a shorter payoff -- especially considering I do indeed hope to have a family. But what? I don't know.

There is one thing I've got going for me that most people don't, however: I know how to build houses. I grew up in a family that owned a residential construction company, and during the housing boom, I built several houses under the company name. So, given the finances required to purchase the requisite building materials, I have the skills to build myself a home. *(Side note: I can assure you that having this skill set doesn't mean I can just make a career in the building industry; the building industry is still fairly dead. source: many friends and family members with bankrupt business and bank-repossessed homes)*

So, yeah, there you go. Fuck me.

**TL;DR: I am basically starting over from square one ten years behind most people, with a $50,000 nest egg and a deathly fear of being poor for the rest of my life -- and no fucking clue what I'm going to do. Where/what should I start researching?** Any other suggestions are welcome, of course; I'm treating this post as just another source to research.",finance,1371700894

gaming,Can I ask why everyone hates the Xbox One so much?,"Now hear me out. From what I've gathered, the Xbox One was an attempt at making games much cheaper and easier to access, much like how Steam works. All games would be digital downloads, so you always have a ""new"" game instead of a disc that can be scratched, lost, stolen, or whatever. I mean, yeah, this limits how people can lend their games, but on Steam you can't lend out your games either. Besides, discs will soon be defunct as they are becoming outdated much like VHS. 

It's also awesome that Xbox had the Xbox Family feature that allows you to share all of your games with 10 people of your choosing, again, a feature that Steam does not have. Also, if the digital download thing became the primary way that people purchase their games on consoles, we could get rid of places like GameStop and games would become much cheaper (like on Steam) and publishers would make more money. 

I think the reason the XBone failed is because of misinformation and Microsoft didn't make their intentions clear enough. It sucks that they didn't allow you to share games in a way and that you had to check in online once every 24 hours, but that is very much like how Steam works and everyone seems to be OK with that. The only thing I would have changed would have been to make it so that there is an offline mode where you can still play the games you have downloaded to your hard drive and that the Kinect didn't have to always be on (but to fix that all you have to do is put tape over it and there ya go). 

Now I don't want to start a shit storm or anything, I'm just looking for honest opinions. Because to me it seems that both consoles are very, very similar, except Microsoft was pushing for Digital Games while Sony knew that gamers are stubborn and want things to stay the same forever, so they fed into that and kept things exactly the same. To me it even seems like Microsoft was definitely pushing for ""Next Gen"" with the XBone because in the future or ""next generation"" internet will be a very vital part of gaming, and if you're going to need internet to play all these new games coming out (The Division, Destiny, Elder Scrolls MMO, etc) then having to keep your XBone connected to the internet at all times shouldn't be an issue.",technology,1371841119

MachineLearning,Help with TD(lambda) Reinforcement Learning algorithm for Neural Networks,"My professor gave me a copy of a journal paper to help me with a personal project requiring Reinforcement Learning and I'm having trouble understanding a small part of one of the algorithms, and while he is very knowledgeable about supervised learning, he has informed me that he has never attempted Reinforcement Learning and that the extent of his ability to help me would mostly consist of theoretical explanations.

business,Will the Fed’s Possible Exit Plan Further Dampen Gold?,"Another Golden Dip

April was a hard month for gold when its prices across the globe plummeted to their worst levels in three decades. One reason for this drop was widespread speculation of Fed’s intention to cut back its quantitative easing (QE) program sooner than expected. Such a possibility has resurfaced.

A two day meeting of the Federal Reserve starts Tuesday – June 18, 2013. By Wednesday, the Fed’s exit policy from the QE program may be outlined with the economic prospects having improved slightly. What then of gold prices? Will they tank further belying their long term golden prospects? And, where does that leave gold-silver investors?

Quantitative Easing (QE) and Gold Prices

Under a fiat money system, the government asks the central bank to create money out of thin air and purchase government bonds with this freshly printed money. This is typically done to counter economic slowdowns. The expanded money reaches the public who then spend it thereby creating demand that stimulates production of goods and services.

Such an approach works if the new money is channelized into employment generation and productivity augmentation. This puts the money into the hands of the general public who can then spend it. Then again, the economy has to be free of bubbles. Otherwise, the fresh money is used for bubble or speculative investments that trigger jobless, concentrated, and inflationary-ly apparent growth.

Concentration of wealth is another reason why QE does not work. The vested interests get to use fresh money before it enters circulation and loses value. By the time it reaches the common people, it has lost its value due to inflation, a natural consequence of QE. If most of the people cannot spend, demand will not be created. This is why the $85 billion a month QE since December 2012 hasn’t produced substantial growth.

With cheap money floating all around, people turn to gold and silver, the time tested hedges against inflation, to store their wealth into. QE does produce short term results, most notably in the form of a partial and temporary revival in stock markets due to the new money moving into stocks. This creates a specious impression of recovery.

Rising Yields on Treasuries

Yields i.e. returns on bonds are an important indicator of the trustworthiness of an economy. Lower yields mean the bondholder has enough faith in the economy to purchase low interest bonds. All major powers in history have had very low-yield bonds during their economic heyday.

Now, bonds yields have to be above the existing inflation rate for the holder to profit. With QE, inflation rises and so do bond yields. This not only means lowered confidence in the economy, but degradation of existing bonds as the new ones fetch greater returns.

In May this year, the yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds recorded an increase in yield from 1.62% in the early part of the month to a high of 2.3%. On June 17, 2013, this yield was 2.17%. U.S. Treasury’s are or rather were probably the most trusted investment avenue of recent times.

Probable Outcome

Bubble economies do not allow monetary contraction, lest it bust the bubbles and slide the economy along a deflationary downward ride. The whole global economy is rife with connected bubbles and any monetary contraction will bust them all in a chain reaction.

QE can treat the symptoms only. Treatment for the disease is the painfully slow process of productivity augmentation that has been callously sidelined since the advent of the bubble era in the 1980s. The Fed is unlikely to announce any major QE cuts because it cannot. Even if they do, it will only be temporarily. And yes, gold will rise, sooner or later.",finance,1371834531
personalfinance,Question about the benefit of debt snowball,"I currently have 6 student loans through Sallie Mae. I have paid off two others and put the money I was paying to those two towards the 6 remaining loans. I tell Sallie Mae how much I way to pay per month and they distribute that amount across all of the loans. 5 of the loans have a 6.55% interest rate and one is 2.14% (the smallest one of course).

I was recommended to use the debt snowball method to pay off the remaining 6 loans rather than to just increase my total payment. I do not see the benefit. I pay one amount each month, automatic debit, so I don't think there is any mental benefit to having fewer loans. Plus my smallest loan also has the lowest interest rate (the avalanche method seems more intuitive to me).

Since 5/6 of the loans have the same interest rate, does it make a difference if I am paying extra to one of those versus any of the other 5? Should I be focusing on making extra payments to the larger loans rather than distributing it? In order to do that I would have to lower my automatic debit through Sallie Mae and make manual extra payments (I believe I have to mail in a check if I want to designate which loan). I am wary of manual payments because I do not want to accidentally forget and screw myself in the long run.

personalfinance,Good income but big student loans; thinking about buying a house and wondering about IBR. Please advise.,"Hi PF,

My wife and I are in our late 20s and both in reasonably good jobs, but we both have substantial student loans.  We're in a somewhat high cost of living area, but have built up a good nest egg.  I recognize the costs involved in buying a house and would like to buy despite them--I just want to make sure it's not financial suicide.

Combined monthly income (pre-tax): 11,875, plus a year end bonus likely to be $6-10k.  
Rent: 1575
Gas: 400 (we both commute about 25 miles, in opposite directions)
Utilities: ~300
Groceries: ~400-500
401k: 206 (maxes out the matching)

My debt: ~60k federal loans (6.6%), plus about 34k private loans (1.8-3%, fixed).  I'm making minimum payments on the private loans on a 15-year repayment plan.  I'm currently on a 25-year repayment plan for my federal loans, but I'm making an additional 225/mo payment on it.  Little over $600/mo total on the public, 215/mo private.

Wife's debt: ~155k federal loans (6.8%).  My wife is currently on IBR (her income is about 60k, varies a little bit year to year), since most of our income growth potential is on my end.  She's not in the public sector, though, so it'll be 25 years before she can get any forgiveness.  Because she only worked a half year last year (graduated), her IBR repayments are extremely low for this year - although that means interest is being rolled over to principal.  It's likely my wife will go part time after we have kids - probably a couple years from now.

I paid off the $8000 remaining on my bar study loan, which was over 12%, with my Christmas bonus last year.

Emergency fund: ~21k
Saving for down payment: ~15k - will likely supplement with my Christmas bonus.

Home prices in the area for homes that I would actually consider buying tend to be minimum $450k, and more likely $500-600k.  We have very good credit (755 last time I checked) and expect a good interest rate on whatever we end up for a mortgage.

About 5 years from now I'll likely make partner at my firm, which will roughly double our income.  I want to plan based on our current situation, though, rather than expectations for the future.  My wife's income growth is likely to be limited if she remains at the same job (which she wants to do).

So, I guess I have two main questions:
1) Is a house a bad idea while we've got this volume of loans?  I'm confident we'll be able to continue making basic payments alongside the cost of a mortgage (I'm expecting &gt;2k mortgage + tax + mortgage insurance payments, not counting the interest tax break).  However, I don't think we could make a big dent in the loans while paying the mortgage.
2) Is IBR for my wife a bad idea?  I know we'll be taxed on the forgiveness when it occurs 25 years down the line.  We'll need to have $50k+ set aside for that.  If we do it for more than a couple years, it'll also dramatically limit our ability to change course, since we'll have so much more principal to deal with.

Any advice is welcome.",finance,1371831636

I'm constantly broke and I'm legitimately struggling to get out of bed to face the day now. I honestly want to disappear forever.  
  
Does anyone have any advice for me?  Any options? Is there a company out there that you would recommend, maybe a group that would help roll all my debts into one bill that I could chip away at?

gaming,"Ensuring the Sustainability and Continued Growth of Esports, from the Perspective of an LoL Player","Hi y'all, I'm rahulthewaffle!  This post is a 3-part essay on what I believe are crucial steps that esports should take to ensure and significantly expand current growth rates.  Happy reading!

First, a bit of context about myself, feel free skip to below the line if you don't feel like patting my ego (jk).  Long wall of text, I know, but there's a mediocre (as all TL;DR's are, I believe) TL;DR at the end, never fear.

I'm a soon-to-be senior Civil and Environmental Engineering and Community, Environment, and Planning dual degree student at the University of Washington through the Early Entrance Program.  I've been playing games since I was 5, starting with Halo at an older friend's house (which my mom promptly disallowed me from doing when she watched some), Lego.com games, and at 6, Starcraft and BW (campaign mostly, cheat codes galore).  Since then I've pretty consistently played games on PC, dipping into the GCube at 9 and returning to PC when I built my first computer at 12.  When I started college after 8th grade, I got into Mass Effect 2/3, TF2, and eventually, LoL.  Oh, that was a fun freshman year, trying to not fail my classes from playing too much league.  So, yeah, I love video games, but I also love school.  Which leads to the next bit:

My background in writing this post.

I'm a founding (and current) officer as well as webmaster and event coordinator for the Union of Purple Caster Minions, a League of Legends student organization registered with the University of Washington.  (Shameless plug: feel free to join us, if you're from/in the area, at www.facebook.com/groups/uwupcm) We're 2 years old at this point, and have a little over 800 members.  Some of our successful routines: We organize regular triweekly to monthly online tournaments with prizing, host monthly social events for members to meet each other IRL (the horror, I know), and work closely with the Micrsoft Store in the UVillage neighbourhood to run biweekly LAN's.  My thoughts aren't necessarily representative of the group or its officers, but they are the product of my experience with the group as well as the sheer care and passion for LoL and esports I have built up over the last 2 years.

Esports is treated like a dream come true, but as  a result, confidence in the scene isn't actually that large.  Scandals, such as the emerging Azubu one that was posted on TL and korean web sites, don't help either.

Esports needs to stop treating itself like a dream, and instead like a reality whose existence is as concrete as any other sport.  Flashy lights and EDM are good, as are fancy stages, but if we hear tragic stories like that of MRN, I can't help but have my doubts about esports' future.  LCS (League of Legends Championship Series) cannot market itself as a battle to the death, as it did during Spring playoffs, but a battle for victory, with reasonable emphasis on solidarity and respect amongst players.  Likewise, the amateur scene needs to have some massive steroids.  Players need solid options for continuing their careers beyond the main pro circuits, as well as clear exit strategies for moving beyond esports participation.

One way to treat itself as a legitimate sport and a solid, successful commercial model, is to increase visibility to non-gaming audiences.  Esports needs to a phenomenon larger than those already in the community, it cannot happen in its own bubble.

---

Ironically, one of the largest obstacles to playing multiple esports titles or for a non-gamer to become a gamer, is the very difficulty curve necessary for an evolving and growing competitive scene.

A simple tutorial teaching you how to right click to move and attack and buy items, is far from enough.  Bots are great too, but ultimately don't train the same level of reactiveness, conscious decision-making, and self-awareness that fighting players does, since beating bots often relies on stale pattern-recognition (not to rule out the importance of pattern-recognition altogether from PvP).

There are two solutions (answering respective challenges) I can think of to fill the gap between introductory mechanics and self-sufficient/self-aware reasoning skills.

1) The Challenge: It seems to me that the danger posed by advanced tutorials, which Riot has been tremendously conscious of, is that it results in a stale meta.  You don't want to fully teach players how to think and play, or many won't do the thinking themselves, and the metagame won't grow or evolve at a rate that is sufficient for esports to thrive.

The Solution: Highlight community-created tutorial content, such as leagueoflegends.wikia.com, the blog A DIFFerent View, or Stonewall's recent ""Reading a Lane: A Ganker Necessity"" article.  It's important to be providing links to this content from the game's official channels (e.g., leagueoflegends.com or lolesports.com), preferably through a specific portal for instructional content.  The benefit of this is that new players can not only received staged content into advanced levels of play, but grasp the concept of a dynamic meta, the methods of reasoning that inform it and can in turn be used to successfully diverge from it.

I do not think it is smart to group these connections under a general community portal with other material, such as GD or fanart, for the sake of maintaining focus and reducing the difficulty of accessing relevant information.  It's probably a good idea to archive links with tags about media format, difficulty, date, and possibly more (again, making information directly accessible and digestible).

I feel like I'm getting to much into the micro-level decision making, where my reasoning isn't necessarily as sound (due to my lack of experience compared to another guy who's been in the industry and on the ground level of esports for several years), so I'll move on to the next Challenge/Solution pair.

2) The Challenge: Esports titles by and large require mechanical skill to play well (the requirements get ridiculous at pro levels), whether it's Street Fighter, Starcraft, Fifa, Counter Strike, or League of Legends.  We've seen notable exceptions to this rule, such as Civ IV or Total War, but those are pretty rare and usually still have some sort of minimum bar.  Of course, improving mechanics is the same everywhere, whether it's in music or gaming, and all it takes is practice.  The question, then, is how to get the amount of practice necessary for ""solid"" mechanics to an acceptable level that doesn't detract from the game('s more exciting features).

The Solution: Mechanics drills!  Starcraft 2: HotS had an amazing series of mechanics drills, I think their structuring, particularly the challenge system, is great.  Every game I've run into can be distilled into a series of core mechanics, and creating controlled environments with *optional and multiple* difficulties for the purpose of strengthening individual mechanics is one of the best ways to reduce the time it takes to learn them.

For example, compare (even if not the SC2 ones specifically, just conceptually what they represent) such drills' efficiency to learning mechanics in normal PvP games, where you're in a mad juggling contest of countless mechanics and various levels of decision-making.  I know countless LoL players that, even after 300 normals, still have not mastered the ability of getting at least 120 minion kills by 20 minutes as a non-support laner, let alone the 150-200 levels that pro players typically get.  I myself was one of these people!  I know people that love the concept behind an ad carry, but give up on the role, because they always fail for reasons they don't know, when the actual cause is a lack of knowledge of necessary mechanics, let alone having practiced them.

Here are some examples of potential LoL mechanics drills:

* Last hitting in a lane of choice, with (opt-out) indestructible towers, and a 5, 10, and a 20 minute target cs count
* Kiting an over fed melee bot as an ad carry, trying to score a set number of hits without dying (an orbwalking drill)
* Bots walking through a static player's ability range, trying to land a chosen skill on/with a chosen champion with the least delay (reaction training)

Note that none of these tools involved a simplification or alteration of game mechanics.  A balance of complexity and depth is important for a title's success, as numerous Riot Devs before, so the goal is to create accessibility without removing these aspects.

---

Crucial to the growth of gaming and esports is diversifying esports with multiple genres and titles, and creating unified esports platforms.  By a ""unified esports platform"", I mean an evolved venue WCG or Dreamhack, coupled with a persistent experience.  Even something as simple as a cross-esports news broadcast would be a good move towards this latter goal.  Some clear benefits are as follows:

1) increases cross-game interactions and shares user bases between titles

2) pools available capital and increases the visibility and benefits of sponsorships and advertisements for the corporations that supplied them

3) provides infrastructure and presentation values for smaller scenes to scale up

and 4) eliminates/reduces toxic conflicts between different game community, instead emphasizing solidarity and respect between gamers.

---

As promised in the intro, the mediocre TL;DR (Just sniping the core conclusions from my post, not the reasoning):

Esports needs to treat itself as a stable reality rather than a dream come true.

Esports needs to make conscious efforts towards increasing accessibility for new players and gamers, but only by providing tools external to the game, not through the integration of handicaps into gameplay.

Esports needs to have a diverse set of titles and genres, with prominent platform(s) and venue(s) for unified esports experiences.",technology,1371791548
investing,Quadruple witching tomorrow should send a huge rally upwards.,"Tomorrow could probably be one of the biggest rally days since 2009. Why? Three main reasons. First of all, today's panic sell-off has oversold every sector. If money was pulled from domestic equities, emerging equities, metals, and pretty much every asset class... where is it going? Definitely not bonds. There are many reasons for this, but I think it will be going back into US equities tomorrow. Today allowed for all the value investors and smart money to add to their positions. Second of all, tomorrow is a quadruple witching day. Stock-index futures, stock-index options, stock futures and stock options are all expiring. This creates 1.5x usual daily volume. Since today was the most volume we have seen, I think tomorrow we will see even more volume. Money managers will be putting on positions to re-balance their portfolios to match indices, as well as having to close out futures and options. I think we are bound to see a sharp reversal to today. Finally, today's housing numbers added to the market turmoil. Housing numbers will not be this upbeat when interest rates rise, leading to higher mortgage rates. The only possibility is that the buy-sides will start pouring their money into RMBS and CMBS instead of equities in the short-term. We all know how that worked out the last time around.

/Fast-ish characters so lightweight is only a bonus.  A sprint-slide feature that lets you fire your weapon at very reduced accuracy.  A balanced One Man Army perk (probably only switches perks and weapons, or just weapons).  I liked pro perks, just not ridiculous requirements like Black Ops 1.  Having unlimited sprint or getting a marathon perk back.  Have 2 stealth perks in the same tier.  One focus on being off the UAV and having no red name, the other being score streaks except UAV.  A staple gun damage for each category, where the only influencing factors for a gun should be appearance, recoil (affected by fire rate), reload speed, and iron sights with 2 attachments for sure.  Firing switch to go from full-auto to semi-auto or from 3-round to full auto, on weapons by default.  3 round burst guns can’t be spammed with small delay frames.  Semi-auto weapons should be there, just have reduced accuracy and more recoil upon entering full auto mode.  Faster aiming, reloading, and strafing speed (like adjustable stock) should still be attachments.  Complete abolishment of tactical insertions.  A crossbow that actually shoots crossbow bolts, decent explosive damage for lethals and rockets (maybe like black ops, where it was really good but no way to replenish them).  No ballistic knife.  Plantable Assault shield can stay, but lowered so you don’t head-glitch.  C4 can only be detonated by pressing the detonator, double clicking is stupid and overpowered.  Be able to crawl prone past claymores and crouch bouncing betties.  Quick-scoping shouldn't be that easy, but for the sake of everyone, have a special attachment on snipers that increases ADS speed (only slightly but noticeably) instead of the faster aim attachment for other weapons.  No over-stunning tacticals like shock charge.  Concussions and flashbangs nerfed.  System is no longer pick 10, revert to old style.  Hold knife button to hold knife, only benefit being recovery time.  Little to no lunge at all, panic-knifing impossible.

/A mercenary playlist that has different modes, like TDM, Kill Confirmed, Domination... Prone sliding and shooting (but terrible accuracy) would be cool. More players, instead of 16 and 18, should have choices like 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 24.  Competitive game modes for people that like to compete.

/A scorestreak-strike package hybrid.  Support has support stuff, non-lethal things like a UAV, Sam Turret, etc including ballistic vests, but can only have two or three on the map at one time for each team depending on lobby size.  Specialist only gives 3 extra perks with full effect once earned (2, 4, 6 killstreaks).  8 kill-streak on Specialist gives you all perks, except only the base versions. This means the pro-versions of each perk can't be overpowered, just minor and helpful, while the base perks are powerful themselves.   Assault be pretty much like BO2's score-streaks, except you can earn 100 points and store it for later, or ""store 1 kill"" (i.e 1 kill away from a streak, use saved 100 points to get it)that lasts until you use it.  No UAV/radar type things in Assault package.  No ridiculous killstreaks like Swarm, Warthog, VSAT, EMP, Dogs.  Chopper gunners and VTOL are okay, along with gunship.  MOABs should be earnable and work like it did in MW3, minus the EMP effect on the enemy team. Controllable ground vehicles should be in the game still, and share helicopter AI.  Helicopter AI similar to Black Ops; no Helen Keller streaks.  The streaks should target players shooting at them.  Care-packages and Emergency air-drops should be in the game.

/Less ""boxy"" maps, so there aren't so many corners...   Moderate amount of cover, easily accessible hill/cliff-type areas, no head-glitching spots.  Interactable maps, open close gates, cut off minor short-cuts.  Darker maps or a section of dark maps that make seeing long range difficult, with a few light posts on the map that can be turned on/off.  The DLC for the game should be class setups, camos, and maps.  There should be enough guns in the game already.  Camos/reticles are 0.99.  Additional Classes is 1.99 still.  Map packs come out the same day for every platform, still cost 14.99. Worthwhile maps, at that, not re-done/re-skinned maps.  Ability to chose reticule and retiucle color, excluding DLC reticules.  Custom emblems should still be allowed, but easily reportable if they have explicit material and/or offensive material...  ability to add clan tag/emblem on gun.  Gun xp should stay the same from Bo2, except have only 1 gun prestige to earn the mastery title.  No ridiculous challenges to earn call-signs (1000 kills with whatever, impossible clutch things).  Match making that places players of similar ""skill"" (defined as an average of total score, score per minute, and frequency of the usage of the strike packages).  This means if you use Specialist frequently, the game would try to place players who use Assault and Support with similar scores on your team to create a mix-up.  It wouldn't try that hard, but mostly it would try to diversify the team along with decent team-mates.  Last but not least, an engine that manually ties hitboxes to players, so lag compensation isn't as noticeable.

personalfinance,"Turning 18 less than a month, want to start building credit score + other finance (starting college in fall).","Hello, so I wanted to get some advice about starting longer term financial planning as a soon to be college student. My family is little help in this regard (not good with finances), so I've been turning to the internet for help. As a little more background, I'm going to a extremely well ranked college in california and my major is very marketable. I plan on working part time durring college.

The first thing I want to do is get started with building my credit. I'm not exactly sure how many cards to apply for. The first one I am considering is with my bank:

* I've been a customer with Wells Fargo for 3 years

* have some money saved up with them (about $5k, but I'm going to be withdrawing most of that soon for tuition) 

* have some income (very low, parttime and at a nonprofit, I mostly work in the summer, but if I worked year round it would by $4.8k/year). I'm not sure if this would count as income, but I am getting about $15k/year from my university in aid, and money from my parents.

The teller said that I have a good chance at getting a noncosigned unsecured (college) card. My only reservation is that WF has a pretty meh deal for college checking/saving and credit. They offer almost no benefits (compared to the other college cards I've researched).

I don't know if I should apply for another major bank's college card. My reservation is I would be denied as my income is low and I have no history with any other bank. I could open a checking account at another large bank and wait a little while. I don't know if it's worth it though as I don't want to deal with having lots of random accounts.

The other place I want to open a creditcard is with a credit union. I have two that I am considering, one for students at my college, and one that my parents use. Again, I don't want to open too many accounts. Both credit unions will probably give me an secured cosigned card which I'm not too hyped about. My parent's union is extremely customer friendly, but it is fairly inconvenient for me to use (location wise). I don't know much about the college union, except that their office is right in town. 

So given all that, I don't know which/how many cards to open. Would opening 2 (one at a bank and one at a union) at age 18 be too much? Would having a third one at the second union help too? Should I even bother with trying to open one at other banks? Should I wait to build my credit a little bit before applying to more?

I know that opening too many at once many lowers your credit score, but I currently don't have a credit score. My though process is that opening a few right now would help the overal age of my credit lines in the long run, and give me opportunities to raise their limits over time.

Other than that, I know to check my credit report often, only use about 10% of my credit limit, pay on time, etc. Being added to my parent's credit cards is not an option for me. I will not be taking any leases/loans for cars or an apartment, etc. through college probably. 

--------------

In regards to other finance stuff there are my student loans and the prospect of investing. I'm taking about $10k/yr in federal loans in my name at a rate of 6.8%, so my main priority is to pay those off. Even though they are deferred durring college, I want to pay off interest and/or hit some of the principal.

Also a small question, but will student loans effect my credit score?

Is it a smart move to forego investing until the end of college? I just feel like I should handle my debts, before I start risking money. On the other hand, I've read that investing early can pay off in the long run. Unless I could make more off of investing than my interest rate then it's not worth it, right?

Any other advice is welcome!

investing,Follow-up to my thread 2 days ago and tomorrow's market.,"http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gmdem/i_just_dumped_30000_into_uvxy_today/

I ended up selling UVXY in pre-market when it hit $70.00 yesterday (Wednesday) because futures were telling me that the market was going to have a strong day which was weird. Anyway, UVXY opened @ 69.xx and traded down to about 64.xx until the 2pm fed report came out. Then shit hit the fan. The market did not know which direction to go, and neither did I. The entire time I thought there was going to be major volatility. I mean after all, the people got what they wanted? There was no new information, just some new language by Bernanke. The markets had an entire hour to digest the information before close and VIX actually went down for a bit. Futures were pointing to a neutral open today. I bought XIV @ $21.00 in after-hours because I thought the worst was over and my analysis was entirely off-base. Today XIV closed @ 18.48 and I'm still holding, down thousands and thousands of dollars. I am expecting a margin call but I am going to hold this one out, even if I have to take out loans. I am still young and learning, as most of you probably are as well.

However, tomorrow could probably be one of the biggest rally days since 2009. Why? Three main reasons. First of all, today's panic sell-off has oversold every sector. If money was pulled from domestic equities, emerging equities, metals, and pretty much every asset class... where is it going? Definitely not bonds. There are many reasons for this, but I think it will be going back into US equities tomorrow. Today allowed for all the value investors and smart money to add to their positions. Second of all, tomorrow is a quadruple witching day. Stock-index futures, stock-index options, stock futures and stock options are all expiring. This creates 1.5x usual daily volume. Since today was the most volume we have seen, I think tomorrow we will see even more volume. Money managers will be putting on positions to re-balance their portfolios to match indices, as well as having to close out futures and options. I think we are bound to see a sharp reversal to today. Finally, today's housing numbers added to the market turmoil. Housing numbers will not be this upbeat when interest rates rise, leading to higher mortgage rates. The only possibility is that the buy-sides will start pouring their money into RMBS and CMBS instead of equities. We all know how that worked out the last time around.

personalfinance,Recent college graduate in dire need of financial help,"Hello everyone,
I have a massive problem on my hands. Not sure how massive, as I have been ignoring this problem for as long as I can but now it is time to face it.

I recently graduated college. I have three federal subsidized student loans, totaling to $14,619. 

I had three credit card accounts that I stopped paying a year ago. Balances of $2,101, $3,351, and $775. They have all gone to debt collection agencies.

Finally, I have a medical debt of $100,804 that has also gone to a debt collection agency.

How I got into this kind of debt is a long story -- I was in the hospital in 2011 for about a week and had no medical insurance. I fell into a deep period of depression and eventually I wasn't able to pay my credit cards. I had been able to pay for the credit cards through by working with my parents (under the table), but I just got in way over my head and ultimately wasn't able to pay. I still live at home with my parents. I have never had a real job. Have never answered a call from any of the debt collectors. Don't know what to tell them, really. The thought of it frightens me.

I know I am in a pit that I dug myself in. I am looking for employment wherever I can -- even out of state, though I am afraid I won't be able to live on my own while having to repay all of this. I am at a loss. I never learned about personal finance of any way, and do not know where else to turn. Should I declare bankruptcy? Should I call the debt collectors and let them know my situation?

economy,"Some calculations on ""Unconditional Basic Income""","I saw the [video from the European Citizen's initiative](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqXXO0GGNRI) on basic income as a human right, and did some calculations on how it might work in the USA combined with a flat tax. I'm sure you will feel free to tell me if any of my assumptions or calculations are wrong.

**ASSUMPTIONS**

Currently, we have a GDP of $15 trillion, US Federal expenditures of $3.7 trillion, and a population of 315 million. I assumed that everyone (man, woman, and child) would receive the annual basic income (""floor""), and would be taxed at a flat rate on anything above that income (earned and investment income). I also assumed an end to corporate income tax, so that money is only taxed when an individual receives it as income, and that every dollar of the GDP is eventually taxable in that year.

**STATUS-QUO CALCULATION**

My first goal was to find a floor and a rate that would balance the federal budget, and not change the net median income (so half the country wins, and half loses). The equation to determine the rate for this situation is:

[Flat tax rate] = [(Federal spending) + (Population)(Current tax rate on Median Income)] / [(GDP)-(Population)(Median Income)]

The current median income in the US is around $30,000 for an individual over 25. The floor here is $9,070 and a tax rate of 43.75%. At these rates, a single person at the poverty level would get a boost from $11,500 (before taxes, if any) to $15,500 (after the flat tax). A professional making $70,000 before taxes would take home only $48,500. Basically, anyone over the median income would make less, and anyone under would make more. The worst is someone at about $185,000, who would take home $113,000, versus about $140,000 after income tax now. After that point things turn around, and move towards only taking a 7% hit compared to now as you move up the income ladder.

It gets interesting when you add children into the mix, at least at the lower incomes. A single mother of three at the poverty line making $23,500 now (before any taxes) would bring in $49,500 after the flat tax and her non-working children's incomes. It could be hard to balance possible abuse of the system, and the advantage it gives poor children. 

**OTHER SCENARIOS**

If we took kids out of the system, we actually wind up DECREASING the floor, since the accompanying decrease in tax rate would push the median income up. Here we have a $6500 floor and a 35% flat rate.

If we leave kids in, but only fund the government as we do now ($2.7 trillion revenue against $3.7 trillion spending)(but fully funding the basic income), we have a $3600 floor and a 25.56% flat rate.

If we want everyone out of poverty ($11,500 floor) and balance the federal budget, AND keep the median income the same, we have to INCREASE spending to $4.1 trillion, and the flat rate to 51%. Again, this is weird stuff just to maintain the median income.

If we simply want to maximize the floor (and balance the budget), we have a floor of $35870, and, of course, a 100% tax rate. This would not last very long.

Finally, if I want to make sure that I, personally, will maintain my income, then we have a floor of NEGATIVE $9100 and a rate of 5.56%. This number is nonsense, since millions of people do not even make $9100. This is because the US government is currently running a deficit. Even without the basic income and just a flat tax, everyone making less than $195,000 will pay more - a flat rate of 24.67%.

**CONCLUSIONS**

At the outset, I thought this could be a simpler and fairer way to go about things, but after running some numbers it looks like you would still need a bunch of tweaks and exceptions to make it seem fair. I didn't expect to take a 14% hit in the first scenario, but that makes sense when you realize the US government is 27% underfunded. Really, a flat tax that maintains current funding levels ($3600/25.56%) would track really close to the current spread for incomes $25,000-300,000, with the super-rich and impoverished both seeing a 20% gain in income.",finance,1371925925
politics,"""Congress has begun the process of reforming the tax code, and will be considering corporate taxation on credit unions for the first time in history. The big banks view the increasing popularity of credit unions as a threat to their profitability, and see this as an opportunity to weaken us.""","Letter I received from my Credit Union this morning:


&gt;Dear Member,
As a member-owned financial cooperative, it has always been SF Fire Credit Union's mission to help our members get ahead in their financial lives. Now, the credit union finds itself in need of your help. The not-for-profit credit union movement is once again being threatened at the federal level, and we are seeking your assistance to ensure SF Fire Credit Union members' voices are heard.

&gt;*Credit Unions Currently Exempt from Corporate Taxes*

&gt;Being not-for-profit financial cooperatives, credit unions have always been exempt from the corporate taxes paid by big banks in who are in business to generate profits for their shareholders. We return our ""profits"" directly to you, our member-owners, through lower rates on loans, higher rates on deposits, lower fees, and conveniences like ATM surcharge rebates. Perhaps more importantly, our unique structure helps credit unions exist as an alternative to big banks in the financial services marketplace.

&gt;*Bankers Working Hard to Tax Credit Unions*

&gt;Congress has begun the process of reforming the tax code, and will be considering corporate taxation on credit unions for the first time in history. The big banks view the increasing popularity of credit unions as a threat to their profitability, and see this as an opportunity to weaken us. Their lobbyists are working very hard to convince legislators to impose taxes on us. If they persuade Congress to take away our not-for-profit tax exemption, it would be very challenging for credit unions to continue offering the high level of value which members deserve and have come to expect.

&gt;*How You Can Help*

&gt;This is where our members can make a difference, by letting our collective voice be heard on Capitol Hill. Help us convince Congress that a new tax on your credit union is actually a tax on you and your fellow member-owners of SF Fire Credit Union. We ask you to contact your elected officials and tell them not to tax your credit union. An easy way to do this is through [CONNECT FOR THE CAUSE](http://www.connectforthecause.org/), a web-based grassroots network which not only keeps you informed of legislation which affects credit unions, but allows you to quickly send your legislators a pre-written message. It's a simple, free, and powerful way for our 45,000 members to make a difference.

&gt;We've been serving our members since 1951, and look forward to meeting your financial services needs well into the future. These efforts to prevent corporate taxation stem from our desire to maintain or increase the level of value we're able to provide to our membership. On behalf of all of us at SF Fire Credit Union, we appreciate your continued loyalty and support in our endeavor to do so. Should you have any questions or concerns about this issue or our efforts pertaining to it, please feel free to contact us at (888) 499-3473.

I've got a $2800 school bill coming up in two weeks, and $2600 in savings bonds where most are stilll earning 4% interest rate and no other major assets. Is cashing in the savings bonds to pay the bill the best option? Is there another way to utilize the bond money and still pay the bills? These are questions I need to answer, and I don't know where else to turn for advice.

The meat and potatoes (for those interested): 
Story goes like so:

After a 4-or-so-year hiatus I was recently motivated to get back into academia. In less than 6 months I've enrolled, am in my second week of classes, and while my dad and I were going over everything the other night we noticed that the bill was due in less than two weeks and the federal loans I applied for won't apply to the summer courses I took. 

Over the years there has been a set of twenty-two series EE 30 year bonds collected in my name that are currently worth $2577.94 total. Sixteen of those bonds are older than 4/1995 and are currently earning a fixed rate of 4.00%, and the remaining six are currently earning a rate varying between .59% and .68% averaging .65%. 

My dad's plan is to cash all in and use that to pay for the schooling, That would officially reduce all of my assets down to basically 0. I feel there is a better way to handle this, but maybe to save face I just need to do what I can, cash the bonds, zero my assets, and get the classes paid for.

gaming,Why I think getting the Xbox One is so sheepish.,"Personally, I don't like to just follow the herd. I like to take a step back. Consider what's happened. You know, THINK. Look at what Microsoft has been doing lately. Windows 8. The horrible bastard child resulting from the marriage of the mobile and desktop OS. Seriously guys, I have to use it. My overclock returns 100% stable in Linux OS's, yet I have wireless connection issues, crashes, and numerous restarts on Windows 8. (My oc is on the FX 8320, @ 4.9 GHz) Not to mention the fact that, though I despise his tactics, Microsoft has nowhere near the knack for design, fluency, and seam-lessness that Steve Jobs had. There were numerous complaints, mind you, about the Metro UI and other things, yet Microsoft ignored them and went on its merry way. 

The DRM scheme they were planning to implement showed more of the same. Why the hell does Microsoft wanna be more like Apple?! In order to beat your competition, you need to stand out, INNOVATE, not blend in. It's not getting better with Windows 8.1. (Apple again!?!) Honestly, I don't understand the gaming community. (HUGE generalization coming, don't take personal offense.) ""Hurr, I'm not gonna get the Xbone, Microshaft really screwed the pooch on this one."" Two days later... ""OMG! I'm totally getting the Xbox One now that Microsoft took off that stupid DRM stuff!"" Really, guys? Do we forget THAT quickly? Microsoft is part of many different oligopolies (they are stretched to many sub-markets within the technology market), and as such, it has TONS of power to influence us. Yet it doesn't have total control. If we want to send a clear cut message to the gaming industry, we need to bitch slap Microsoft. They need to feel pain. Where? Their pocketbook. Why do you think they revoked their DRM plans? Answer: Damage Control. They've shown by their actions that they most likely don't give a shit about the consumer. How? They ignore us. At least until it affects their bottom line. They still want the DRM, you know. The fact that they were so reluctant to give it up, so ADAMANT that they couldn't change it, even if they wanted to, and then ""flipped the switch"" when they saw the toll it took on their bottom line proves that they don't give a shit about us. But we proved something, too. We proved that consumers, when voicing their opinions with their mouths, keyboards, and most importantly, wallets, have the power to influence products. Guys, we can have what we want. But enough about DRM. 

Privacy is an issue, too. I'm not being paranoid, really. Have you paid attention to the news lately? The fucking FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, stated that ""following the Constitution is just too slow."" That concerns me. A government organization, set up to protect its citizens from outside and inside attacks to the US, thinks that it can ignore the Constitution. I kinda thought that that document was a little bit important. According to the FBI, though, apparently not. That's scary. And don't tell me that its honestly that slow to go through a huge corporation, requesting data on suspects. No problems there, so long as its done constitutionally. Our other agencies can get things done very quickly, and constitutionally. Surely you've all heard of the NSA stuff. Doesn't come as a shock to me, personally, but its still sad. You think the Kinect isn't gonna monitor you? How the hell does it respond to ""Xbox, turn on."" then? Why does it need to be connected to the Xbox at all times? Ugh, people don't think through the details. ""Hurr, I can just cover it up."" Really? What happens when it asks where you are? 

Honestly, I like making my own decisions. Having as much freedom as I can. That's one of my major concerns with consoles and Apple. Also why I like building PCs and Linux. (BTW, the new AMD APUs are powerful enough to run games decently. You can really get by with building a $450 gaming PC centered around one.) PC is truly the master race of gaming, not because we are able to get better graphics, cheaper games, etc., but because we have freedom with our gaming machines. So much so, that if you thought you'd like to try a game out to see if you'll like it, you could technically pirate it. I don't condone that behaviour, as I know the temptations involved, but that just goes to show how much freedom you have on the PC. (And Steam, gog.com, etc. have friggin' AMAZING deals! :P)

--------


We have been riding along for a very long time, making minimum payments, trying to get out of debt, but it's just getting worse and worse.  By the end of the month we have no money.  

The only other expenses we really use money for is gas and food.  I'm in school, as well.



I don't know what to do.  
My car is three months behind and I'm afraid that it's going to be repo'd.  My wife's car is fine.  

I'm honestly thinking to just voluntarily let go of my car since I work from home and I don't go anywhere.  I could take the bus to school.  That would save us 350 a month right there.  


My credit is already shot from being so behind on every payment every month.  

We both work full time but neither one of us are able to work overtime.  


Would it be a terrible idea to just let go of my car?  I owe about 14-15k on it.  I have my financing through Nissan and still owe on the car for another few years, although I've had it for at least two years now.  Tried asking people if they wanted to take the payments over, craigslist, etc but I can't find a buyer.  

I hope somebody can make me feel better about all of this.  I've made SO many bad decisions in the past year that I can't even fathom it.  Looking back... It's crazy.  Just looking for a little help or hoping that somebody has something to tell me.  From an outside point of view. 

We make like 2800 a month together and after bills and debt payments it's supposed to come out to 2500 total payments, which would be doable.  But after food and gas and everything we're at a negative every month.",finance,1372023766

* Student loan 1 = $27664 @ 6.875 % (can get a .25 reduction soon once I setup auto debit)
 
* Student loan 2 = $25681 @ 8.25 % (same autodebit as before)

* Rent = $550/month

* Netflix = $8/month

* Cellphone = $47/month

* internet = $30/month

* Electricity = ~50/month (havent moved in with the roomate yet but his bill is like 70 a month so I feel its a fair estimate)

* Nat. Gas = ~30/month (same)

* Sewer/water/trash = $20/month

* Groceries = ~200/month (seems reasonable to do since thats what I am spending weekly (50/wk) at my temp housing)

* Gas = ~200/month (budgeted for that now (as its what im spending) but apt will be so close I am riding a bike to work (gonna keep the expense here tho)

* Insurance = ~150/month (havent found my own yet since I am covered by my mothers plan for another 1.5 months)

**Total expenses = $1231/month**

**Left over = ~800/month**

I am trying to save as much as I can for an emergency fund since my loans are still being deferred. Also trying to purchase everything I need to live on my own now (mattress, dishes, pots and pans, etc). 

**Goals: 
**
* emergency fund = $6000 (only about 3 months but I feel debts are much more important)

* Retirement savings = 50% match up to 6% (I plan on maxing my contribution @ 6% because its a 50% ROI. however I am not eligible yet @ the new job)

* Pay off loans ASAP

**My Plan:**

Have the extra 800/month as another form of emergency fund for each month. I have what I believe are all expenses accounted for but I might need to go to the doctor or might go to dinner with coworkers etc. I know I need to pay off my loans tho so it will be minimal at best. 

Step 1: get $6900 in savings and then pay off the $900 perkins loan. I dont see any reason to pay this off at the minimum and then I am eliminating an easy minimum payment in case of emergencies.

Step 2: At the last day of each month bring my bank account back down to 6000 dollars. This means send extra money towards my highest interest rate student loan. I am hoping that this will be about $500/month extra.

Step 3: Debt free :D

Is there anything wrong with this plan or anything I am overlooking? I like the idea of having a smaller buffer each month for silly things then throwing the leftovers @ my loans. I also believe I should be able to not spend a bunch a month over my budget because these loans are huge and I want them gone so I can start to think about kids/house/masters or phd/wife. I don't want those things until I am debt free or nearly debt free.

Note: I ran the unbury.me calc and it said i would be out of debt around 2021 with the numbers I used (which were nearly the same as these).

personalfinance,"My chemist brother and I grew up poor, want to make sure we're thinking of his budgeting correctly.","Hey, everyone! My brother isn't a redditor but I want to show him how awesome /r/pf can be.  Could you please contribute with your thoughts as we look over his finances?

Here's some details about him.

- 26 years old
- Bought a new car, currently at a ~$13k balance with a 4.9% interest rate.
- Works as a flavor chemist -- which regularly has him smelling and composing chemical compounds.

We grew up poor and without much financial guidance, so there are some notions we've heard about (buy a house, invest in a ""Roth IRA"", match your employer for a 401k etc.) but are only now facing firsthand.

What should be doing?  Here are what we think should be his financial goals.

1. Pay off his car loan.
2. Pay off his student loan.
3. Get life insurance because he feels like he's (appropriately?) paranoid about cancer from his job duties.
4. Put money into his 401k, Roth IRA. 

Here's his income and costs.

Income:

- ~$1,900 to ~$2,000 hourly pay/month

Costs:

- Rent: $100/month over the next six months, starting in July when he moves into our friend's extra bedroom, then $300/month after the six months
- Auto payment: $270/month
- Insurance: $96/month
- Gas: $35/week, $140/month (sometimes $175/mo if he goes on trips with friends)
- Student loan payment: $187/month
- Dinners, drinks, outings: 2-3 times a week (usually weekends), $22 to $50 per outing.  That comes out to a range of $176 to $600 per month.  He claims he never spends that much.
- 401k: $140/month, but the way he's saying it sounds a little weird.  He says they match ""15% of the first 4% he puts in."".  By our calculations, that's about $200 they're willing to put in per year.  Is this worth it?
- His AMEX card balance is ~$3k and he will pay this off in full before September, when his interest-free rate deal expires on it.
- Phone bill: $75/month until August, when we're switching to Straight Talk from Sprint.  He'll need to buy a new phone and monthly rate becomes ~$40/month.

His funds:

- $8,000 to his name ($5k in savings, $3k in checking)

My approach is usually to criticize his expenses going out, but that's probably unfair to him (my bias comes from growing up poor) and will only be effective if it's a long term behavior change (which may be necessary, but we should hear it from people like you and not just me).

So what do you guys think?  Should he re-focus to something other than his car loan?  Should he put his $140/month of 401k investment into his car loan instead to knock out that ~5% interest rate loan?

Thanks for being awesome, personalfinance!",finance,1372015339
personalfinance,"Want to ask for a loan from my father..tips, advice, and suggestions happily welcomed.","Hey everyone,

First post in this subreddit - I usually just read through the posts here for excellent tips. 

I am currently in a situation where I feel I need to ask for a loan from my father to help stabilize and build up my current financial situation.  I owe my university roughly 3,000 dollars at the moment, and have until the end of July before it is reported to Collections, and while I could MAYBE manage to deal with it, I feel it would be better to not put myself in such a tight spot financially.  I have no other outstanding debt (no student loans of any kind) other than credit cards (which are paid in full every month), and after discussing it casually with him, my father would be open to deferring payment till after I graduate.  I was planning on asking for four thousand dollars in order to pay off my current debt and also use a portion as a seed for a Roth IRA - I feel that at my age (23), thinking a bit ahead wouldn't be a bad idea.   

My main questions are a) is this a good idea? and b) how should I go about it? I want to write up a formal loan agreement/promissory note as a way to cement the legitimacy of the agreement, but have no clue where to start. In addition to that, what would be a reasonable interest rate to charge? 

A bit more background info about me - I am roughly a year from graduating, currently make roughly 900 dollars a month, and have about 500 dollars in savings that I am planning on not touching (rainy day fund). I work for a rather good retail chain, that, while not paying me much currently, has offered me a decent starting salaried position with them once I complete my degree (28,000/yr starting was mentioned, with promotions available unless I find something better).  I live at home, but pay for all expenses outside of it (tuition, gas, insurance, phone bill, etc).

personalfinance,Paying down some debt - Which to pay off?,"To give a little background, I graduated college with around $75K in student loan debt in 2009.  I've got it down to about $58K a few years out and plan to continue to pay it down as aggressively as I can.  I put as much of my year-end &amp; performance bonus as I can towards the balance, as well as any tax return amounts.  I have a well paying job in an industry that has high demand for people at my level (Senior at a global assurance, tax &amp; advisory firm).  

As of now I have a little over $10K in my checking account/cash.  I was looking to apply around $4K of my available cash towards debt in a couple of months (trying to build up that $10K balance a bit more before I do it).  The thing is, I have approx. $4K left on my car loan (year is 2007) that I pay $155/month on.  I didn't want to finance a car out of college, but I had no choice do to the amount of driving I do for my job.  

My $58K student loan balance is comprised of many loans (both federal and private) ranging from $200 to $14,000 and varying interest rates (3.12 to 7.75%).  Thankfully, my largest loan has one of the lower rates, at 3.25%.  

I've done the math and no matter which specific student loans I target to pay off, my auto loan obviously gets me the most bang for my buck in terms of monthly cash flows that would free up if I were to pay it off; versus paying down a combination of outstanding student loans.  

I'm well aware this has to do with a combination of interest rates and my terms (5 year auto loan vs. extended student loans) and over the life of the student loans I'm going to be paying a lot more than I would my car loan.  But I figure freeing up that $155/month allows me more money in the near term to apply towards the student loan debt.  This coupled with the fact that in my current profession I can expect, at the least, 6-7% + raises a year, and a $100K salary by the time I'm 30, that will allow me to pay even greater attention to eliminating my student loan debt, lead me to believe that paying off the car loan now and using it's immediate cash flow savings is the right move, rather than applying it to a bucket of my current student loans that have higher interest rates than my car loan.  

I'd appreciate PF's thoughts.",finance,1372009237

politics,"Why I, a flaming liberal, oppose the immigration reform bill (its nothing to do with Mexicans)","It's the increase in H1B Visas.

Though we constantly hear, on the news, about the Mexican related issues of the immigration bill, little seems to be said about the H1B-Visa provisions which will greatly expand the ability of foreign STEM (engineers etc) workers to work in the US.  This is a serious mistake as it will not only lower the wages of engineers (simply by virtue of supply and demand) but serves as a template for the same thing to happen to all the well paid professional jobs (doctors, lawyers, etc)  that we hope our children will have.

**H1B Benefit fallacies:**

**1)** It will not harm wages because by law they have to be paid the same as Americans - Besides the obvious supply and demand issue, I can tell you, from personal experience, it's just not so.  In fact, the last company I worked at, Rapiscan Systems, was almost entirely staffed by immigrant engineers and the CTO was heard to say, in the context of wages, ""God forbid I'd have to hire American engineers"".  As a long time engineer I can tell you that wages have not kept up and the torrent of immigrant engineers are likely the reason (if you haven't been, go to the bay area and look around.  It'll be quite an eye opener).

In a nutshell, its the cheaper wages that are really driving the corporate push for increasing H1Bs

**2)** There's a shortage of STEM workers - No. A recent study debunked that. http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-04-24/business/38783974_1_stem-more-foreign-workers-epi-study

**3)** We're hiring the best - No.  I can't speak to Academia but, as an engineer who's been around,  from what I've seen the immigrant engineers, as a whole, are apparently no better than their American counter parts (with the exception of the Russians whom have all been top notch and a pleasure to work with to boot).   It's amazing how prevalent immigrant engineers are in IT etc; positions that require no great talent (its easy to find Americans to fill those positions).  About half of them I would NEVER hire and yet they're here taking jobs.  Mind you, I personally wouldn't hire half of the Americans either but contending for American jobs is, after all, their birthright. 

Note, for the sake of argument, even if the immigrant engineers were better, so what?!  There are 2.5 billion Chinese and Indians and so the potential pool of works dwarfs the needs of American employers (even just their top 25% or so).  If having better talent is sufficient to swamp our workforce with high skilled foreign professionals is sufficient for allowing it to happen then that bodes for massive unemployment of American citizens.  (I imagine eventually, as the wages in China and India catch up this will be a non-issue but that's not going to happen in your life time and will be of precious little consolation to you and your children).  Might I suggest we invest in our own engineering talent and making college affordable.

**4)** If an American can fill the position then they will get the job.  Nope  - I can't tell you why it isn't so but just that it isn't.  Again, I've been around a while and I have NEVER seen a hiring manager even take this into consideration (and surely the demographics of the bay area prove the point).  Perhaps HR throws fairy dust on employment forms down the line that satisfies the law.  I cant' say.  However, I assure you that this being an immigrant/H1B worker is NEVER an impediment to hiring.

**5)** It will benefit you by increasing the GDP - No.  It will benefit the fraction of the top 1% that own the benefitting companies and that will probably raise the GDP but that will NOT increase the wages of American engineers.  For non-engineers keep in mind that our GDP has increased for years and yet the middle class is getting hollowed out so clearly GDP does not imply a benefit for Joe Blow.  Keep in mind, that no matter what the benefit is to the GDP, if the wages of all American workers are lowered (if this process is repeated across all professions) than it can't be a benefit to all but the rich few.

**I imagine if you're not an engineer your thinking ""Why should I care?""**  Perhaps, if nothing else, self preservation.  Between shipping jobs overseas and importing immigrant labor, pretty much every job is fair game (at least in the future).  Frankly, I don't care about the Mexican issue because they are taking low wage jobs.  Jobs, from what I can tell, that most other people don't wont but professional jobs are another thing entirely.  Those are the jobs that you hope your children have in particular after they take a mortgage out on their education.  After all, if you can't get a high paying job after all that debt, why bother.  Why should Americans want to become engineers (which itself is a serious consequence).  

Both parties are in favor of increasing H1B.   Corporations are throwing big money at this issue as labor costs directly effect their bottom line.  In California, a very blue state, all its tech companies are bribing the congress silly. For the GOP this is a Chamber of Commerce wet dream.

To the immigrant engineers - This isn't personal or racial or whatever.  If I were you, I'd probably want to come here too.  However, if you're already here, you're in the same boat which is to say that your wages will be suppressed as will your children's.

Finally, to the libertarians etc types out there whose attitude toward this might be, ""Why should the gov't be allowed to tell an employer who he can and cannot hire?""  My answer to that is a bottom line simple one:  If your ideology leads to evisceration of your country's middle class thereby degrading it to a banana republic perhaps your ideology is flawed.",technology,1371965767

I guess there are a number of factors here that I need help with. My problem being is that I can only make monthly payments on one of these items with my normal paycheck at a time (aka, I can only really afford one payment of $375 a month, not two). The other I would use some/all of my savings to.

The SO is saying that I should use my savings toward the loan in order for the interest not to increase so much. However, I thought that with all federal loans, I am at a fixed rate, and I know my car loan is at a fixed rate. 

So essentially what is the best resource to research how I should allocate my money between the two? How should I even do this? I am terrible with numbers unfortunately (thanks to a mental block) which is why I dont really spend much (less to keep track of).

&gt; We don't do consolidation anymore.

* Well that's just peachy.  Moving on, is there a breakdown of the payments I can find anywhere that allows me view what my monthly expenses are going to be for this process?

I've taken the first step and requested a loan from my small retirement (repayable at 6% interest over 3 years) to try to knock some of the more expensive debt down.  This should serve as a catalyst for me to become very aggressive in my repayment schedule.  They disbursed me $2,692.  One major expense I need to incur out of that is new tires for my vehicle which I can get installed for $200 (necessity), leaving me with $2,492 to allocate in the smartest way possible.  

The cost of the loan is $39 bi-weekly ($78 monthly)  it seems if I throw all of it at the Amex 1 with the biggest balance, the reduction in monthly expenses will not offset the additional $78 in carrying costs for the loan.

My question then, is if this is typical time requirement, or if others know of other online savings accounts that can transfer money with a quicker time scale.

personalfinance,"Help, please. Trying to find some financial stability for father-in-law.","My husband and I recently volunteered to help my FIL get a better grasp of his finances. We did not offer financial help, but instead taking stock of his financial picture and helping him save where he can. He is not very good with money.

He has been suffering from a mysterious problem that causes pain but is undiagnosed. He also was diagnosed with a mild form of Parkinson's, which appears to have made him extremely depressed, even though symptoms are not likely to affect his life for many years to come.

Upon discussing with him his income and expenses, we started to feel like he was being very vague and either not giving us the whole picture, or that he doesn't understand his own finances. We started to go through his records and discovered that he has not even been opening all his mail for the past 6-9 months. We believe that he has been overwhelmed with the bills and this was his reaction.

Below is the picture as we understand it right now. Please, r/pf, give us any recommendations you can for improving this picture. All options are open and we are just starting to try to help. We want to be able to lay out some options to him and recommend a course of action. ANY ideas or things to explore are much appreciated. I feel the picture is very bad and I'm trying not to be too down about it.

**Assets**

Equity in home - $0 to $20k depending on how the home is valued

Savings - $10k in liquid savings earning .15%; $10k in a 401k earning (?) .3%, it's in some kind of super-safe investment and not earning much; supposedly another $25k in another savings account, but we haven't seen any statements

Car - owned

**Income**

Social Security - $1140/mo

Wife's contribution (second wife, not my husband's mother) - $100/mo; complicated, but they keep their finances separate except she occasionally buys the groceries; she is basically an independent actor, and is also rather fed up with her husband's depression; as far as we know, she gets SS, and is supported medically by Medicare and Medicaid, and potentially by her 2 children

**Expenses/Debts**

Mortgage - 5%, $730/month. Bought the house at $225k in 2004 (?) at 7% interest. House was reassessed upon re-financing 2-ish years ago and valued at $153k, and the mortgage was re-set to 30 years. I think this is low - comparables in the neighborhood appear to be selling at $200k. Perhaps for his house $175k would be reasonable and conservative. He still owes $125k. Supposedly he was told during refinancing that 5% was the lowest possible. We found a letter saying he might qualify for loan modification from the government, though. Oh, and he lives in a state that allows banks to sue homeowners if a foreclosure/short sale sells below the mortgage price.

Homeowners Insurance - $60/mo.

Home Equity LOC - owes $33k, 3.25% interest, pays interest only of approx. $90/mo.

Medicare/Medigap/Part D - he is paying, we think, $147/mo. in supplemental Medicare coverage. It's unclear to me right now if he is paying extra for drug coverage, but he seems to have drug coverage. I believe this is $40/mo. From looking at a few bills, after Medicare payments, the Medigap supplemental seems to cover a lot less than the premium. I am still struggling to understand everything about how Medicare works.

Copays/non-covered - this needs a lot of work to understand, but this seems to be a mounting bill. There are numerous charges here and there for $20, $15, $50, etc. We're not sure how many he's paid. At least one non-covered vision bill seems to have been sent to collections, or perhaps the letter is just threatening that as a next step.

Cable/phone/internet - $175/mo. This suffers from cable-bill-creep. New customers can get if for under $100. (We have given him the idea/assignment to call them and demand the promo rate - to test his willingness to actually work on the problems, in addition to saving potentially $75/mo)

Utilities and taxes - the combined cost appears to be about $800/mo. This is a combination of oil for heat, electricity, gas for the stove, property taxes. Heating is the worst. He used to heat the house from wood he felled and split himself, but this year his health is preventing him from doing it.

Car insurance - ? We actually forgot to ask about this. But he has a car, so it's likely he has insurance.

Random credit account from a sporting goods store - he didn't tell us about this, but we found mail indicating he is paying about $100/mo. on a $900 purchase of some sort.

So, as you can see, he seems to be juggling about $2200 in expenses per month on less than $1300 income. He draws from savings, or delays paying bills. In some cases, the bills aren't monthly (like the property taxes, heating), so he can kind of get along for a bit.

It seems clear to my husband and me that we cannot afford to give him financial help. All we can do is help him sign up for any relief programs, or additional government programs, or advise on how to deal with housing debt. Right now we are still trying to assess his full situation and figure out options. We have figured out that there are some programs (Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, SNAP) that might help, but only when he has 0 left in savings. We don't know much about potential default on the mortgage or bankruptcy. Can anyone advise on what to explore?",finance,1372101666

I have just inherited $14,000.00 USD and I am wondering what I should do with this money.  This is extra money irrelevant to my life as it is.  It is also the only extra money I have however.  This is the total value of savings I have.  Other than that I basically live paycheck to paycheck or have on average about $500-$1,000 of extra money (after all bills are paid) per month at any given time.  I am generally good with my money, always pay credit cards off completely at the end of the month, never put more on the card than I can pay off.  All bills get paid. I do, however, have about $50,000 in student loan debt.  I don't think it would be wise to put all the 14k towards the loans though.  While these loans will be with me for the next 25 years, they are incredibly manageable payments.  About $187 per month.  I make about $40,000.00 per year.  I get a company car and a company cell phone so those are bills I do not have to worry about.  I pay rent, food, girlfriend, and student loans.  Rent is $450 a month. I just want to know what is the smartest thing to do with this amount of money.  Thank you!

EDIT: I believe the interest rate on my student loan is roughly 6%, by the end of the repayment process (which is either 25 or 30 years) I will have about doubled the money from $50,000 to $100,000 (I think).  I am on the income based program so this does not bother me so much.  Paying only a small percentage of what I make is something I have accepted and I am willing to do (wasnt really left with any choices).

Cutting the carbon tax bill
Achieving the upmost resource recovery is part of the way A.J. Bush &amp; Sons, from Beaudesert in Australia's southern Queensland, says it stays competitive. As a part of a long-standing meat rendering industry the company maximises the value of the by-products of processing. Optimising bioenergy is part of its overall business approach to sustainability, and an added impetus to its drive for efficiency is an annual carbon tax bill each year of A$2 million ($2.1 million), caused mostly by having coal-fired boilers that heat process water.

One way of cutting this liability is through the production of electric power from biogas derived from the meat waste.

It was money from the federal government in 2005 that set the company on its journey into biogas production. Some A$715,000 came from the Food Innovation Grant programme, which added to an earlier, smaller grant from the Queensland State Government to allow the company to evaluate the feasibility of biogas capture.

A.J. Bush developed a project at its Beaudesert site in co-operation with Quantum Power that sees the meat renderer take responsibility for the gas treatment system and everything downstream, including a covered anaerobic lagoon (CAL) and gas capture pipework, While, Quantum owns the project's gensets, and is responsible for their operation and maintenance. Quantum also sells all the electricity generated to A.J.Bush at a discounted price as part of a long-term power purchase agreement. Historically the meat renderer imported its total electricity requirements from the grid.

Today coal-fired boilers at the plant still generate steam for the company, which it uses to process the fairly constant supply of non-meat by-products it receives from poultry, pork and beef processors in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. The company renders about 4000 tonnes of biomaterial over a five day working week, and the plant operates 24 hours a day, 52 weeks per year, with three shifts, from Monday morning until midday Saturday.
Fat, bone and slaughter floor materials yield tallow and meat &amp; bone meal, while poultry by-products produce poultry oil and poultry meal. A.J.Bush hydrolyses poultry feathers and dries them to produce hydrolysed feather meal. Some 65 per cent of the weight of raw material received is water and the remainder yields tallow and protein meal.

Australia retains its status as a country free of bovine disease BSE, so feedstocks from within the country require no extra sterilisation or pasteurisation other than for control of normal bacterial pathogens, and no limitations exist on which material can be used for biogas production. The plant produces around 65,000 tonnes of rendered tallow, oil and protein meals each year.
All of this activity means the plant consumes about 1000 MWh of electricity per month and has a peak demand of about 2.2 MW.

The biogas project started in April 2005 with a trial version of a CAL, which held 2 million litres of wastewater. It had a 1.5 mm thick high-density polythene cover, which was operated with a ten-day residence time. Its success led to the commissioning of a CAL with a capacity of 26 millon litres in 2007, which is 6 metres deep and can hold 28 days' production of wastewater. The new CAL's covers are secured around the edge of the pond with concrete trenches and rise and fall depending on gas generation and usage rates.

Gas continues to accumulate over Saturday afternoon and Sunday, when the main processing plant is idle, and it falls gradually over the week as the gas volume and pond cover lowers. The pond cover includes safety vents, which allow biogas to escape if the pond cover rises to a certain height above the water level. This involves the use of 0.5-metre risers attached to the underside of the vents.

The pH control of the influent is critical to biogas production rates, so maintaining the pH at between 6.6 and 7.6 through the addition of lime has been required on occasion.

The wastewater leaves the CAL by gravity flow (an inflow-outflow balancing system) and is then further treated in other on-site ponds before being recycled for irrigation of crops and pastures.
A manual pumping system removes rainwater that accumulates on the CAL cover during the wet season, and the area has an anti-personnel fence to prevent unauthorised access.

Power generation

Generation of gas occurs at a rate of about 220 m3/h. Fans draw gas from both ponds through ports attached to the top of the cover into pipework that transports it uphill to the gas treatment skid. The uphill location of the skid and the elevation of the pipework from the pond to the skid allows condensate to drain back to the pond. The skid includes a heat exchanger that lowers the temperature of the gas to 3-9°C, which removes most of the condensable materials from it. A flare unit forms part of the skid and burns excess gas whenever a generator is taken off line for maintenance.

Biogas travels from the skid to two 0.5 MW Shengdong engines, the first of which was commissioned in July 2010 and the second in March 2011.

Electric power generation from the gensets has amounted to about 200,000 kWh per month, or about 20 per cent of the total site electricity consumption, with an electrical efficiency of about 33 per cent. However, availability has been much lower than hoped because of operational and quality issues associated with the engines.

As the cost of the engines was less than a biogas treatment unit to remove hydrogen sulphide (H2S), the decision was made not to include a stage for the removal of the acid gas, but instead to sacrifice the engines. The residual H2S level in the gas after treatment is generally less than 1200 ppm.

Major modifications had to be made to the engines to ensure they complied with Australian standards for electrical and gas safety, and could run without being continuously attended to, but there are still operations that must be performed manually, such as inspections, and checks on the coolant.

Bitcoin,So I have this crazy hypothesis of the future that is surely naive and delusional but I still want to share it with you to see what you guys think...,"Like most of you here, my political views are very libertarian.  Likewise, the decentralization and state free qualities of bitcoin is what fascinates me the most about bitcoin.  I think there is going to be a massive shift in wealth in the near future that is going to completely change how our world works.  Here is my hypothesis:

If any of you follow what Peter Schiff or Ron Paul have said about the federal reserve, you will know that they really don't like it.  They think that the QE (Quantitative Easings) will go on forever until something major happens that collapses the entire economy.  This is where bitcoin could play a **massive** role in reshaping the distribution of power.  

As distrust in government grows (especially in the millennial generation) and as technology advances further across the globe, the next economic collapse could possibly be revolutionary.  Let's say the dollar goes into hyperinflation as the nations of the world all realize what the US has been to up to all these years.  If the US dollar were to lose its status as the World's Reserve Currency, hyperinflation could happen once the government has to start paying for its massive debt.  Especially with us going to war with Syria now, our debt is going to continue to climb as our government continues to give out fat contracts to their war profiteer buddies.

So what happens if the people then decide to put their trust into a brand new, totally open, decentralized, P2P, state free currency? Bitcoin skyrockets in value as masses upon masses of people flock to the new way of transferring wealth.  The dollar becomes worthless and those who power was as a result of the dollar also become worthless.  That power then shifts to those who have the most bitcoins.  And who will be the most well off as a result of this shift in power?  All of the nerdy libertarians like you and I.  Society will then shift to a more libertarian like society with a more informed public.  After that, AI controls our government and entire economy, completely eliminating human greed from economics.  Everyone lives happily ever after and we explore the universe.  

The End.

business,The Tyler Group: FLIXYA,"When Spain's housing market collapsed in 2008, no region felt it more keenly than Andalusia.

While today the unemployment rate in Spain remains the second highest in the European Union, hovering near a record 27.2 percent, the southern autonomous region of Andalusia is even worse off: unemployment rates in its provinces range from 36 percent in Malaga to 40 percent in Cadiz.

As a result, the government of Andalusia – one of only two autonomous regions in Spain not governed by the Popular Party – is walking a fine line these days, caught between central government’s austerity measures which are affecting them more acutely than the rest of the country, and pressure from their constituents to break with Madrid and mitigate the effects of tax hikes and spending cuts that are squeezing the regional economy to the breaking point.

Recommended:	Join Us: http://www.linkedin.com/company/the-tyler-group-inc-

Boom to bust

A mere six years ago, the Andalusian economy – which depends heavily on construction, about 10 percent more than the rest of the country – was booming.

Tourists were buying up existing homes in the area and building new ones, transforming quaint seaside villages into sprawling urban areas. New construction was in demand and coupled with the influx of foreign capital, construction costs soared.

“Before 2008, people here were making so much money on new construction that they were doing things they’d never done before, like buying fancy, new cars and paying 250 euros [$330] for a meal at a restaurant,” says Joaquin Ruiz Lagares, a small business owner from Malaga. “It was crazy, we were living like Americans.”

Keep in touch Follow Us: https://foursquare.com/p/the-tyler-group/37659577

The construction boom was accompanied by a rise in rental costs, prompting many Spanish residents to opt for mortgages that offered lower monthly payments – and left them vulnerable when the debt crisis hit.

Like many in Spain, Andalusians blame the PP for making matters worse.

They see Madrid's austerity measures as the reason why so many businesses have had to shut their doors, making it harder to find work. And with one of the highest eviction rates in the country, they accuse the federal government of making it easy for banks to foreclose on their homes, by sanctioning controversial hidden clauses in mortgages.

But most Spaniards do not have what Andalusia has: a regional government led by a party other than the PP. As a result, coalitions have formed throughout Andalusia to pressure the regional socialist government to buck Madrid's lead and find a more humane way to navigate the crisis.

I'm a college student with a relatively low income and I only really buy everyday things. At most, I have a few hundred dollars stored and rarely have over $1k. I mostly pay for things with cash/debit, although I would like to replace my debit card with credit to prepare for the future a little. 

A couple of things I'm looking for are what I get from my credit union: low (or none) minimum balance requirement, no ridiculous fees, online banking, online/mobile check deposit and mobile/SMS balance inquiry. As I mentioned before, I usually don't have a lot of money in my account, so interest rates and savings accounts aren't a big deal. Free ATM withdrawals or reimbursement would be a plus.

I've looked at some options for banks that are in all of the places I regularly visit. It's a little limited because my hometown is in a rural area, so that's the bottleneck.

Citizen's Bank and Bank of America are pretty much my only choices. Other than those, my town has a dozen different credit unions and some limited area banks (PNC and Independent Bank). Since I travel out of state often, those aren't viable.

personalfinance,"Rising property values, student loans, and interest rates.","So I'll start off by saying that I did search, and have read most posts that slightly apply. I couldn't find anything that directly applied to my question though, so I figured I'd ask directly.

My wife and I are considering buying a new home. We know we'll do this within 2-3 years. Our budget is 150-200k. However, we have a lot of student loan debt, about 15k is 7.5% and 5k is actually 10%. We have about 50k total, the rest is low-interest (~3-4%).

Right now our plan has been paying off loans aggressively, and once they're paid off, save for a down-payment for a year, and then buy. It's worked so far. Our current schedule dictates we'll be debt-free sometime in early.mid-2015. 

However, with rates and values going up, we have begun to think maybe we should buy now instead of waiting. If values go up 5% and rates go up a few points, any savings we have by paying off the student loans early could be erased by added cost of the mortgage, right? I hope my thinking isn't flawed here, but that's why I'm asking.

On the flip-side, does it make sense to save for a down-payment when we have loans sitting at 7% and 10%? From what I've read, that would be essentially taking out a 10% loan for our downpayment, which doesn't seem smart to me.

__________________________________________________________

So that's the narrative, here's a breakdown.

Income:

* Wife: ~2750/month
* Self: ~3000/month
* Total net income: ~ 5750/month

Debt (All student loans):

* (3-5%): 25k

* (5-7%): 5k

* (7.5%): 15k

* (10%): 5k

Monthly Expenses: 

* Rent: 750

* Utilities: 250

* Other (food, gas, cell phone, etc): 350

* Student Loans:  ~$600 (minimum payment, but we actually put ~$3k/month into them)

* Total expenses (not including extra loan payments): ~$1500

* Total Expenses minus rent and student loans: ~$600
____________________________________________________

For reference, we're looking at spending $150-$200k, because that's what you need to spend to get what we want in our area. I wish we could spend less, but oh well.


So I guess the summary questions would be:

* Does it make sense to save for a down payment and buy, when we have such high interest loans?

* Does the increase in market values and interest rates over the next 3 years change the answer the previous question? Does it affect it at all?

From the numbers, it's obvious that we can ""afford"" either option. I just want to make the most of my money though. I'd just hate to hold off 3 years, and then end up paying more with a higher interest rate.",finance,1372178344

personalfinance,Planning long-term finance for the first time. How's this look?,"I've been reading everything I can find on personal finance the past few months, and now I've got a plan.  I'll keep this brief and answer any questions you might have.

**Current situation:**

* I lived paycheck to paycheck on $32k, but my girlfriend just got a good job and together we now make $60k.

* We have a combined $35k in student loan debt.

* We have a combined $5k in credit card debt.

* We're 30 years old.

* We pay 2.5% of our income into a pension program.

* We have no 401k, Roth IRA, or other investments.


**The plan:**

* Pay off credit card debt ASAP before touching anything else (interest rate is 14%). 

* THEN, pay an extra $100 a month on each of our student loans.  (This would shave off two years of payments at my 6.8% interest and her variable rate) 

* AND set aside $200 a month for an emergency fund savings account (until we hit $2000, then we'll put the $200 a month away for downpayment on a house/having kids) 

* AND put $100 a month in a Vanguard Roth IRA (I won't get a 401k after watching that Frontline documentary and hearing stories from 50-somethings about losing big on their own 401k)


And that is basically all the extra money we have to spend/invest each month.  My thinking is that I need to start planning for retirement now instead of later.  If I follow the instructions on the side """"I Have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!"", I won't be starting a Roth IRA on top of my pension for the next 5+ years.

I have a mortgage and I'm a grad student with student loans already in repayment (because I haven't met the half time requirement for deferment since a couple semesters ago). I mention these details because I know they provide some small tax benefits.

I'm trying to figure out what I should set my withholding to on my main job to offset the second job and to also make up for these first couple of months to where it was set at 6 (I know it was a stupid thing to do). 

Here are some details from my last paycheck to perhaps help with the calculation. Keep in mind that part of this paycheck reflects a 3% raise I received at the end of May.

Cutting the carbon tax bill

Achieving the upmost resource recovery is part of the way A.J. Bush &amp; Sons, from Beaudesert in Australia's southern Queensland, says it stays competitive. As a part of a long-standing meat rendering industry the company maximises the value of the by-products of processing. Optimising bioenergy is part of its overall business approach to sustainability, and an added impetus to its drive for efficiency is an annual carbon tax bill each year of A$2 million ($2.1 million), caused mostly by having coal-fired boilers that heat process water.

One way of cutting this liability is through the production of electric power from biogas derived from the meat waste.

It was money from the federal government in 2005 that set the company on its journey into biogas production. Some A$715,000 came from the Food Innovation Grant programme, which added to an earlier, smaller grant from the Queensland State Government to allow the company to evaluate the feasibility of biogas capture.
A.J. Bush developed a project at its Beaudesert site in co-operation with Quantum Power that sees the meat renderer take responsibility for the gas treatment system and everything downstream, including a covered anaerobic lagoon (CAL) and gas capture pipework, While, Quantum owns the project's gensets, and is responsible for their operation and maintenance. Quantum also sells all the electricity generated to A.J.Bush at a discounted price as part of a long-term power purchase agreement. Historically the meat renderer imported its total electricity requirements from the grid.
Today coal-fired boilers at the plant still generate steam for the company, which it uses to process the fairly constant supply of non-meat by-products it receives from poultry, pork and beef processors in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. The company renders about 4000 tonnes of biomaterial over a five day working week, and the plant operates 24 hours a day, 52 weeks per year, with three shifts, from Monday morning until midday Saturday.

Fat, bone and slaughter floor materials yield tallow and meat &amp; bone meal, while poultry by-products produce poultry oil and poultry meal. A.J.Bush hydrolyses poultry feathers and dries them to produce hydrolysed feather meal. Some 65 per cent of the weight of raw material received is water and the remainder yields tallow and protein meal.

Australia retains its status as a country free of bovine disease BSE, so feedstocks from within the country require no extra sterilisation or pasteurisation other than for control of normal bacterial pathogens, and no limitations exist on which material can be used for biogas production. The plant produces around 65,000 tonnes of rendered tallow, oil and protein meals each year.

All of this activity means the plant consumes about 1000 MWh of electricity per month and has a peak demand of about 2.2 MW.

The biogas project started in April 2005 with a trial version of a CAL, which held 2 million litres of wastewater. It had a 1.5 mm thick high-density polythene cover, which was operated with a ten-day residence time. Its success led to the commissioning of a CAL with a capacity of 26 millon litres in 2007, which is 6 metres deep and can hold 28 days' production of wastewater. The new CAL's covers are secured around the edge of the pond with concrete trenches and rise and fall depending on gas generation and usage rates.

Gas continues to accumulate over Saturday afternoon and Sunday, when the main processing plant is idle, and it falls gradually over the week as the gas volume and pond cover lowers. The pond cover includes safety vents, which allow biogas to escape if the pond cover rises to a certain height above the water level. This involves the use of 0.5-metre risers attached to the underside of the vents.

The pH control of the influent is critical to biogas production rates, so maintaining the pH at between 6.6 and 7.6 through the addition of lime has been required on occasion.
The wastewater leaves the CAL by gravity flow (an inflow-outflow balancing system) and is then further treated in other on-site ponds before being recycled for irrigation of crops and pastures.

A manual pumping system removes rainwater that accumulates on the CAL cover during the wet season, and the area has an anti-personnel fence to prevent unauthorised access.

Power generation

Generation of gas occurs at a rate of about 220 m3/h. Fans draw gas from both ponds through ports attached to the top of the cover into pipework that transports it uphill to the gas treatment skid. The uphill location of the skid and the elevation of the pipework from the pond to the skid allows condensate to drain back to the pond. The skid includes a heat exchanger that lowers the temperature of the gas to 3-9°C, which removes most of the condensable materials from it. A flare unit forms part of the skid and burns excess gas whenever a generator is taken off line for maintenance.

Biogas travels from the skid to two 0.5 MW Shengdong engines, the first of which was commissioned in July 2010 and the second in March 2011.

Electric power generation from the gensets has amounted to about 200,000 kWh per month, or about 20 per cent of the total site electricity consumption, with an electrical efficiency of about 33 per cent. However, availability has been much lower than hoped because of operational and quality issues associated with the engines.

As the cost of the engines was less than a biogas treatment unit to remove hydrogen sulphide (H2S), the decision was made not to include a stage for the removal of the acid gas, but instead to sacrifice the engines. The residual H2S level in the gas after treatment is generally less than 1200 ppm.

Major modifications had to be made to the engines to ensure they complied with Australian standards for electrical and gas safety, and could run without being continuously attended to, but there are still operations that must be performed manually, such as inspections, and checks on the coolant.

I am currently entering my final year of Pharmacy school, all of which I am paying for with loans.  These are predominantly government PLUS loans and Staffords, but due to a mix up in my first year, I took out $20,000 from Sallie Mae, and the interest rate is an ungodly 9%.  I know, it's awful.  When I graduate, including Sallie Mae, I should have around $180,000 student debt, some of which is leftover from undergrad.

Fortunately, my wife makes reasonable money ($56,000 before taxes and whatnot this year), but her job is not 100% guaranteed for next year because the market for teachers is volatile here in NY.  Also fortunately, we are living rent free and our expenses are low enough to have allowed us to have accumulated $28,000, which is all we have financially.

Here's my question: right now, my Sallie Mae loan sits at $22k.  I'd feel really good about paying it off by Christmas, and I'm thinking we can throw about $12k at it now, then finish it off later in the fall when we have a better idea of her employment situation.  That would leave us with $16k now, which is WAY more than we had at this time last year.

Am I thinking along the right lines?  Or is there a better way to approach this?  I am really liking the psychological boost I'll have from paying the debt off.

     I've opened an account with Ally, but have not transferred anything yet. It's just an empty account. I'm reading that maybe Vanguard would be the better way to go, but I don't understand why. I've read why, but I feel like perhaps I need it explained to me like I'm 5.

     Current Traditional IRA: $1051.65


* Stocks:

     I have a few shares from my previous job with the employee stock program. They set me up with an Etrade account.

     Stock plan: $1,587.21

     Purchasing: $642.95


* Loans:

     Car loan through Bank of America. Excellent interest rate of 1.99%. Minimum payments are $250, though I pay $400 a month.

     $17,350 remaining on loan



I really want to start getting into mutual funds and I'm also finding that Vanguard would be the way to go.


So my questions:

Does it look like I'm on the right track? 

How can I start making more than I am now through investments so that I can purchase a home or condo with as little stress as possible in the not too distant future (4 years or so)?

Why should I pick Vanguard for a Roth IRA over Ally?


I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. The fact that people go through here to be helpful for people they don't know so that others can start their personal financing goals and be successful is amazing.




*edit:* I don't know if it matters or not, but based off CreditKarma, my score is a 767. I also currently have $800 a month that goes into the Barclays savings account which is the account I'm using towards eventually owning a little piece of property. Nothing too big and fancy.",finance,1372273128
personalfinance,My dad is awesome...and what do I do with this?,"see http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1h480c/how_do_i_fix_this/ for reference

I asked my mom if I could hold off on rent for a bit so I could try to get this debt paid down. We don't have the best relationship. She said no and went off on a huge tangent about my spending. 

I called my dad because my mom really upset me and he's pretty good about being level headed and helping me calm down after my mom and I fight. He offered to *give* me $1,000 towards the debt. I told him that I'm going to pay him back for it when I can but he understands these credit cards need to come first. He also said that I don't have to pay him back but I'm definitely going to. I'll work as much overtime as they'll give me until I can get everything paid off. 

Now here's the question, since both credit cards are pretty much equal with interest rates, how should I handle this money? Should I put all $1,000 on one card or should I break it up to put $500 on each? 

I'm not sure which is the better option.

Also, after I start getting these overtime checks should I pay down one card, then start on the other (other than making minimum payments)? Or put equal amounts on both until they are both paid off?",finance,1372272852

personalfinance,How do I fix this?,"Forgive me if I'm all over the place with this, I'm kind of upset right now. My credit card just got declined today. My other card is just about maxed out as well. The limit is $2,000 each so I guess in the grand scheme of things $4,000 in debt total isn't horrible. It's not great by any means but it's not as bad as it could be. Oh, the interest rate on both cards is pretty similar. 

Break down of my finances:
Bi-weekly income: ~$1,000 post deductions, though I'm getting a 10% raise at the start of FY14
Rent: $300 monthly 
Cell phone: $100 monthly (canceling it is not an option right now, the contract is pretty new)
Car insurance: $575 bi-yearly
Savings account: $100 bi-weekly
Groceries: $150 bi-weekly

I do eat out a lot, less now that I've started keto but I still definitely do. Also, my sister and boyfriend are both pretty bad off financially right now. I help my sister out sometimes, I'll buy food for my nephew sometimes or when we're out I'll pay for whatever so she can afford her expenses. My boyfriend is on workers comp right now and is making $384 bi-weekly, we're keeping track of how much he owes me, we're at around $750 right now. When we go out I'll help him out with food and such. I cannot just cut him off, he will have no way to eat if I do. 

As far as trying to fix my situation I'm working on my shopping addiction (it's a real thing and I'm taking active steps to get over it), and I've signed up for (right now) about 8 hours a week of overtime at work. I'm probably going to try to increase that by signing up for overtime on the midnight shift so I can get the shift differential on overtime. 

I need help figuring out a payment schedule. At this point I'm debating trying to find a credit card that has a 0% introductory interest rate and do a balance transfer to combine off of the debt into one place. My credit score as of a month ago was at about 730 so I don't think I'd have too much trouble getting approved. 

Help? I don't know what to do.

Bitcoin,States put heat on Bitcoin. (WSJ - 6/26 - article cut &amp; Paste for w/o Subscription),"By ROBIN SIDEL and ANDREW R. JOHNSON
State regulators are warning virtual-currency exchanges and other companies that deal with bitcoin that they could be closed down if their activities run afoul of state money-transmission laws, according to people familiar with the matter.


According to people familiar with the situation, banking regulators in California, New York and Virginia in recent weeks have issued letters telling the companies that they need to follow the state rules or prove that the rules don't apply to them.

The warnings fall short of formal ""cease and desist"" orders, which would demand that the companies immediately stop engaging in their business, these people said.

Still, the moves show that state regulators have moved beyond merely scrutinizing virtual currencies and now are taking steps to prevent people and companies from using them for illegal activities. Federal regulators already are cracking down on virtual currencies.

Similar actions are expected from other states in coming weeks and months, according to people familiar with the matter. California, New York and Virginia are three of the 48 states that require the companies to obtain money-transmission licenses to operate. South Carolina and Montana don't have such rules.

The money-transmission rules vary among states, but most require detailed financial data, business strategy and information about the company's management. States also typically require companies to put up a bond that could run as high as several million dollars.

Bits and Pieces

Read about Bitcoin's evolution.


The actions aren't related to the announcement last week that Mt. Gox, the largest bitcoin trading exchange, has halted withdrawals of customer funds in U.S. dollars. The Tokyo company said it was making system improvements.

Unlike dollars or euros that are backed by a central bank, bitcoin users can create the units in a process called ""mining."" Users also can trade the currency on a number of exchanges or swap it privately.

The state actions come three months after federal regulators issued guidelines placing virtual-currency exchanges under the same comprehensive anti-money-laundering requirements as traditional money-transmission businesses such as Western Union Co. Since then, a handful of bitcoin exchanges have registered with the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

The California Department of Financial Institutions has issued at least three warnings to bitcoin-related companies in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the actions. One of the recipients is the Bitcoin Foundation, an industry-backed group that promotes the digital cash.

Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, said it is a nonprofit organization and doesn't engage in money transmission. The group is formulating its response to the letter it received from regulators last week.

A spokeswoman for the California banking department declined to comment on the warning letters, saying the communications are confidential and ""the goal is safety and soundness and compliance with the laws that DFI enforces.""

California is particularly important to the bitcoin community because many of the startup companies that are tied to the virtual currency are based there. California and New York are known for having stricter money-transmission laws than other states.


Bloomberg News
Bitcoin supporter Peter Vessenes

""Bitcoin businesses are spending a lot of time and energy figuring out how to stay out of California,"" said Peter Vessenes, chief executive of CoinLab, a Bainbridge Island, Wash., company that has registered as a money-services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. CoinLab is waiting to launch any exchange-related services until it gets its ""state licensing strategy sorted,"" said Mr. Vessenes, who also is chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation.

The New York Department of Financial Services issued a similar letter to BitInstant, a New York company that allows customers to buy and sell bitcoins. The company earlier this month alerted customers on its website that it wasn't accepting cash deposits ""as we make steps to transition to our new website.""

Charlie Shrem, chief executive of BitInstant, couldn't be reached for comment. The company has registered as a money-services business with federal regulators.

""Virtual currency firms inhabit an evolving and sometimes murky corner of the financial world,"" Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services, said in an interview.

""The extent and nature of their operations morph constantly, so it's important for regulators to ask the hard questions and stay ahead of the curve in order to root out dangerous or illegal activity,"" he said.

In Virginia, a company called Tangible Cryptography suspended the purchase of the currency through its service called FastCash4Bitcoins after receiving a letter from state regulators who received a complaint that the company was operating as an unlicensed money transmitter, according to a notice on its website. Company representatives couldn't be reached for comment.

Tangible Cryptography said on its website that its activity is exempt from licensing requirements and that the commission's initial assessment contained factual errors.

""While we respond to the commission's notice, the prudent action is for the company to suspend all new transactions,"" the company said.

A spokesman for the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions declined to comment on whether it has issued similar notices to other companies.

personalfinance,Late 20s Male needing some financial advice (ROTH/457),"Hello PF,

Long time listener, first time caller. I've read the links, and I definitely think the Bogle method is more sustainable/realistic for me. At this juncture in my life, I would like to get some perspective on how I should go about investing. I have access to a 457 plan through my job (equivalent to a 401k), and my job provides me with two financial institutions with plans. ICMARC, or Nationwide.

As it stands now, I have roughly 129k (or around 150k with interest) student loan debt. However, my job falls into the student loan forgiveness program, so any payments made after 120 individual payments, or ten years, is forgiven. I am also tied to IBR. I think that I can live comfortably while putting away money, lowering my student loan program through gross income, as well as providing a safety net for my future.

Here are my stats:
income- roughly 64-64k (after taxes, take home 3,850)

Rent- 675
Utilities- 13-50 fluctuating
Internet- 30
Gym- 34
Perkins loan - 65 month
Car and insurance - 500 (probably a little less, includes gas)
Food, liquor, et al - 400 (number can be adjusted)
Dry cleaning - 65-150.

Here are the funds I have access to, if you would be so kind as to recommend:

Plan: Invest 250 biweekly. In 3 months, I have a $1/hr raise, and that will go immediately into it, untouched.

Any money returned to me from taxes will go directly into a ROTH IRA (vanguard something). any recommendations?

personalfinance,How are we doing?,"Hi PF!

My husband (26) and I (25) are grad students. We got married last September and have been working on budgeting and a long(ish)-term financial plan, and I think it's about time to revisit and see how it's coming along. Here's where we are now:


**Savings and Investments**

* Roth IRA:           ~$5k

* Liquid savings:     ~$20k @0.75%

*liquid savings is broken up as follows: $10,500 in an E-fund, $3k in a baby fund, $3k in a fun/travel fund, $2k in a house fund, and $1500 in a car expense fund to cover semiannual insurance, maintenance and repairs*


**Debts**

* 0% APR credit card balances: ~$900 total *to be paid off before intro periods end*

* Federal student loans: ~$34k @6.8%, in deferment until 2018; $10,500 of that is subsidized and not accruing interest until 2018


**Monthly Cash Flow** *A (working) planned budget for our new apartment, after we move in 3-4 weeks. Most of this is unchanged from our current budget*

* Income:  ~$4000 total take-home from more jobs than we should probably have

* Rent/insurance/utilities/cable/internet: ~$900

* Groceries/gas/household and pet items + eating out: $750

* Car expenses: $150 into car fund mentioned above

* No-questions-asked fun money for both of us: $150 ($75 each)

* Credit card payments: $150

* Student loan payment: $400 (no minimum, but this covers interest then pays down the balance by about $250/mo)

* Savings: $250 to E-fund, $250 to Roth, $200 to baby fund, $200 to fun/travel, and $200 to house fund

* This should leave us some extra (~$400, if I can do math), which we plan to put towards the student loans, but our income is somewhat variable, so we're not counting on it.


**Goals**

* By next May/June: We plan to have our 0% cards paid off, E-fund up to $13k, baby fund at $5k, and fun/travel at $5k in order to throw ~$3 at a ""babymoon"", and increase our IRA contributions to $500-600/mo in order to feel comfortable trying to have a baby.

* Once we have our E-fund fully funded, we would like to use that money to increase our house savings and to start saving for new(er) cars, whenever we run our current ones into the ground.

* Eventually, we want to buy a house, but we don't know where we'll be living after we graduate (which should be in about 2 years), so it's hard to guess how much we'll need. My goal is to have 20% down + closing costs + 1-2% as a house E-fund on a home we can afford to pay off in 15-20 years. We'll start more targeted savings for this once we graduate and hopefully get ""real jobs"", but we're hoping to buy in around 5 years.


**Your Thoughts?**

* Is there anything you would have us change?

* I feel like our savings is stretched somewhat thin every month with trying to save for several things at once. Should we allocate our house savings somewhere else and wait until we have our ""real jobs"" to work towards that at all? Any other suggestions for that?

* What, if any, of our liquid savings should we be investing instead, and in what kinds of funds? It all seems like fairly short-term money, so I have been unsure of what to do.

* We want to pay down the student loans fairly quickly, but would really also like to have a reasonable savings in order to feel secure supporting a child. I've considered going the Dave Ramsey route and putting some $15k+ of our savings into the loans, but It's hard to justify for us. I suppose by doing this and putting *all* current E-fund + baby fund + fun/travel + retirement + exra money towards the loans, we could have them paid off in a year, but then we would have to pretty much start over saving up the $23k minimum that we want to have before trying for a baby - which would in turn push it back probably another year since we would be starting new jobs around then. We would be really sad, and I think my husband would lose most or all of his motivation to save, if we had to wait a few years to have everything paid down before having a child. Additionally, this means we (or even just I) can't see my parents, who live in Mexico, during this entire time. That would be very hard for me. Can we afford to have this attitude?

Bitcoin,BitCoin is not a currency,"Currency: N- An object used to facilitate trade against a set and stable standard. The definition of currency is where I will start my attack against this form of “currency”-BitCoin. BitCoin, to get this out of the way, is:
“A cryptocurrency first described in a 2008 paper by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto, who called it a peer-to-peer, electronic cash system. Bitcoin creation and transfer is based on an open source cryptographic protocol and is not managed by any central authority”
Any currency’s main purpose is to facilitate trade between individuals. In relation to the things one is trying to buy its worth should remain relatively stable. Currency IS not the same thing as an investment; the value of stock fluctuates sometimes violently. The power of a currency relies on trust, the trust that last week’s pay check will be sufficient to pay for this week’s prices, and that even years down the road what I earned will still be worth CLOSE to the same as it was worth when I earned it. Bit coins value fluctuates very rapidly and this is a problem for the heath and ecosystem of any currency.  Any currency that fluctuates rapidly is a terrible currency, and merchants would have to be stupid to accept it as a form of payment. For example, if I were selling a car I would be comfortable trading it for money only if I was sure that the money you gave me would be worth what it was worth when I sold you the car. If I thought the currency could deflate randomly at a huge increment then I would not sell you the car. Because now you have a car that was produced with a lot of money at a time where money was worth a lot more, but now I would only have paper money at a time where paper money was very little. It is too big of a risk. Someone would have to be a complete blithering idiot to set themselves up to accept BitCoins as a form of payment if deflation of several orders of magnitude is basically a monthly or bi-monthly event. An ideal currency remains relatively stable in value in relation to something you actually want to buy. An illiquid currency that gyrates wildly in value is useless, as it makes proper pricing of goods, services, and credit impossible.

 In addition, credit, the lifeblood of any economy is completely impossible under such conditions; it would be the height of insanity to take out a loan if you had the potential of owing the equivalent of several hundred percent interest after a year. Here are the exchange rates of Bitcoin, the Canadian dollar and the Euro when compared to the U.S. dollar (See back of essay A1). The Euro and Canadian are compared at a 12 year time frame and BitCoin at a 3 year time frame. In twelve years, the euro fluxuated between a low of .82 and a high of 1.6, the Canadian dollar between .7 and 1.2. Slow sustainable and predicable growth. But Bitcoin, in a short 3 year time frame, had a low of under $2 and a high of $29. In 3 years, the inflation rate of Bitcoin was 93%, while in 12 years the other currencies had reached about 50%. That means, if Bitcoin was a currency that was in common use, a car deals men that sold a car for $1000, 3 years later would only have the equivalent of $70 purchasing power. BitCoin could not be regarded as a legitimate form of currency because of fails to meet the standards and needs of what most economists would consider something would need to be a currency. It lacks any real standard of worth, doesn’t facilitate legitimate legal trade, and has no way of establishing credit or trust within a society. 
	But, despite BitCoin failing as a currency, some claim it would work as an investment. Sadly, this also is a pipedream bubble. Investments, unlike money, are meant to rise and fall in value like BitCoin does. Raw currency shouldn’t make you profit just by sitting on it (just ask the Swiss; it causes problems); but investments can; and hopefully will! Investments rest of this basic idea: I give you money, you use that money to produce something useful and valuable to make more money, then your company is worth more and I can sell my investment in your company in exchange for the added value of your stock. Great system, everyone wins. But, it rests on one very important necessary condition- the thing that is made with the invested money must have inherent value and is wanted in society. BitCoin fails as an investment because BitCoin literally produces nothing of value to humanity at all. It doesn’t make cars, or guns, it doesn’t clean your house, it doesn’t stop crime or provide water- all BitCoin does, is produce more Bitcoin. It’s a circular investment that is doomed to crash because of the inherent lack of value in BitCoin and all the problems described in the above paragraphs. The money isn’t being invested in anything worthwhile. It’ just a fake currency that is doomed to random spouts of inflation and deflation, whose main market is catering to underground drug trafficking, prostitution, smuggling of illegal goods, and the occasional fuck-the-gov libertarian that is somehow “stickin it” to the feds by using a “currency” created and used by people that spend too much time on 4Chan and experience silly orgasmic spouts of ecstasy in conversation after using the words “programming abilities”. Yes, Ad Hominine fallacy noted, caring=zero. 
	 
BitCoin is stupid. It has no worth and no future. It is neither a currency, nor a stable investment. The best thing that I could call it is this- BitCoin is a hobby. It’s a nice experiment in the effectiveness of unregulated underground markets. And if you’re willing to take a chance at losing a ton of your original investment in order to purchase a plethora of illegal drugs or sex slaves, or if it give you some apparent psychological comfort that you’ve “beat” the bad-bad government, then it’s probably not that bad of an idea. But it’s not something I would promote the majority of society using for the majority of things. It has value in the same way that a really nice Yu-Gi-Oh card might get you laid or buy some weed if you were to sell it in the right circles. You’ll find radicals everywhere, but just because it has worth in a cult following does not make it a viable currency (any more than Yu-Gi-Oh cards are to most people. Try buying a car or groceries with them.), nor should everyone with some extra cash try to “make bank” on it. BitCoin is not a currency.",cryptocurrency,1372347863

personalfinance,"Facing an insurmountable amount of debt upon graduation, mostly private. What can I do?","I'm in desperate need of help.  I'm almost 24 years old... and I'm in a lot of debt.

Currently around $89k, but could balloon to lots more by the time I'm done.

I attended art school for two years (not naming names, but at the best private art school in the country).  I lost my cosigner halfway through my second semester of my second year, so I was screwed in terms of finishing school and finding a good job.  Not that I would've found one to cover my debt as an artist; I'm actually really happy, now, that she stopped cosigning for me.  It could be a lot worse than it is now.  My parents couldn't help me financially because of their credit, I was a naive 18 year old with no practical guidance who thought the art school name would get me a good job, and I didn't know about my options for federal loans.  It's ridiculous that these art schools charge what they do when they don't typically make a doctor's salary as an artist.  I'm much more practical now.  I'm a talented artist, but it's not the career for me.

I wish I went to community college and then to a public university.  Too late now... :(

As far as I know, since my parents won't completely share my loan info with me (this needs to change), my cosigner is still tied to the loans.  I'd want to get her released as soon as possible so that she doesn't become responsible for paying it, should something happen; this could happen after a certain number of payments, if I remember correctly.

I had to take 3 years off from school after leaving, because the art school refused to release my transcripts until I paid them some money that I owed them.  My parents' credit wasn't good enough to get a loan for quite a while.  During that time, I struggled with mental illness.  I've been in the hospital two times.  I was constantly depressed, in a large part due to my debt and being out of school.  I barely worked because I was too unstable, and when I did, I only made minimum wage.  My parents have paid my loans ever since I left school.  However, I currently am unsure if they can continue while I am in school, which would mean more interest.

I'm now much more stable, thanks to an awesome medication and therapy.  I'm a completely different person than I was even a year ago.

I returned to school this past fall, at a local state school; this time, I was trying to get into the nursing program.  Big change from art, but I'm passionate in my want to help people and do this, and nurses make good money.  I know it's stressful, but I'm more than ready to handle it.

However, I was not accepted.  Only one person at my school was accepted as an internal transfer, due to space.  The head of nursing says she'll write me a recommendation for another nursing school that does have space.  luckily, they will accept unofficial transcripts from my art school from my current college.

The school with space for an ASN (that I will undoubtedly get into), would make me need lots of financial aid to make it doable.  It's $30k/year.  Typical institutional aid is $11-14k, and since I'm an independent student now, I'd qualify for the max pell grant and state grant (roughly $8k total).  Depending how much aid I get, I'd be looking at around $20k additional debt, unless a miracle happens.  I'm scrambling to find scholarships.  I've found a few I'd be qualified for that look doable.  But I guess I can't completely pin my hopes on that.

I could potentially work while in school, if I could handle it, especially if I could get a better than minimum wage job as a CNA.  I'd love to at least do a work study.

Otherwise, I'll have to get on the 2 year waiting list for nursing at my community college ($6k a year) and.. do what in the mean time?  My back up plan would be to become certified as a CNA by November and make $11-12+/hour full time (if/when I find a job).  But then I'd have to wait even longer to actually start an independent life, and I wouldn't be able to aggressively pay off my debt as I would if I was a nurse.

Other option: get a degree in 3 more years at my state school, racking up more debt, in something not as profitable as nursing (what would I get a degree in? I don't know, I love psychology, but that might as well be art without going to grad school)... but I'm determined to be a nurse.

Other option: re-apply to this state school and other state schools for nursing next year after working as a CNA.  However, it'd probably amount to the same amount of debt as the 2 year school

I'm not getting any younger.  I want to start an independent life outside my parents' house, especially with my long time boyfriend, as soon as possible.  I wouldn't move out of my parents' house until I graduate.  He has graciously offered to help me chip away at it once I become a nurse, or pay for living expenses while I do so (but I'd still want to contribute, and this makes me feel guilty).  If I make the starting salary of a nurse in my area (confirmed by multiple people), of around $60k/year ($29/hour plus $31/nights and differentials), then I could throw MOST of my money at the loans to get it paid off as soon as possible.  I'm talking... 2/3rds to 3/4ths of my take home pay.  I want to pay it aggressively until it's gone.  Unbury.me estimates that it would take around 5 years, but of course I can't be exact.  This is taking into account additional debt and interest accrued while in school for 2 more years.  I would be around 30 by then, but it'd be a hell of a lot better than having debt the rest of my life.

I'm feel so guilty that my boyfriend is faced with loving me and wanting a life with me, even though I have so much debt.  How do I live with that?

SO.  Given that.  Here's the numbers.

Here is the debt I'm looking at, with interest rates:

- $46,706 at 9.75% ;

- $26,590 at around 5% ;

- $5,274 at 5.45% ;

^ all art school

-  $3,500 subsidized ;

-  $2,000 at 6.8% ;

-  $~5k for parent plus loan, which my parents may or may not need my help with ;

^ state school

Total:  $89,700

I did a calculator on interest if deferred while in school for 2 years and it said this:
After the deferment period of 24 months, the new loan balance is $102,413.22 , including $13,343.22 in accrued interest.

Plus... $8k I owe still to art school, so that they will release my transcripts again (if I ever want to go back and get a BSN, but that's way in the future at this point)

So... help?  Where do I go from here?  What do I do to finally get my degree in nursing so that I can ACTUALLY pay off my loans and not struggle for the rest of my life?  What if I can't become a nurse.. are there options to get it discharged due to hardship?  I know it can't go away in bankruptcy, I'm talking any other way.  Otherwise, what are my options for reducing my debt as quickly as possible?  What plan seems most doable?  Am I completely screwed?  Is there any way out? :(",finance,1372330462

What I am trying to figure out is whether I should borrow money from my reserve line of credit at my bank to be able to pay 100% of my ""New Balance"" on my credit card by the payoff date. 

The facts:

**current New Balance**: ~$10,500

**already payed in this period**: 6,800

**current in stream business reimbursements**: 800

**next paycheck (every 2 weeks)**: 2750 



approximate shortfall to ""pay in full"" by the payment due date: **$150-200** (rent is already payed all other expenses ~900 will be charged to the card)
  
  
Should I borrow $150 from my ""line of credit"" to be able to pay the credit bill in full by the due date? What impact will this have on my interest payed. So far I have payed $110 in interest and earned $215 in rebates. 

  
Here is the text of my interest rate calculation method:



""To avoid incurring additional Interest Charge on the balance of Credit Purchases (and Cash Advances, if this Method E is specified as applicable to Cash Advances) reflected on this statement, you must pay the New Balance shown on the reverse side on or before the Payment Due Date. The Interest Charges for a billing cycle are computed by applying the daily periodic rate to the average daily balance multiplied by the number of days in the billing cycle OR the monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance of Credit Purchases (and if applicable, Cash Advances), which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Credit Purchases (and, if applicable, cash advances) is determined by subtracting from the Previous balance of credit purchase (and, if applicable, cash advances) any payments received and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Interest Charges.""

Any help in deciphering this would be very welcome. I hold an advanced degree and it is embarrassing that I can't determine the answer.",finance,1372452684
gaming,Game Idea: Help Needed. Zombie platformer set in a comedic fantasy setting.,"*Okay, so recently me and a good friend decided to brainstorm and we came up with a good game idea. I'd love to hear some feedback, and maybe if we could find someone who also thinks this sounds pretty awesome. Came up with it on a Friday night, in a skype convo and fleshed it out quite a bit.*

**Name:** The Apocalypse of Winterbutter

**Setting:** Fantasy RPG setting, stereotypical. But with a zombie apocalypse. In the town of Winterbutter. 

**Mechanics:** Platformer Hack N’ Slash, with killing tons of zombles. Each class will have special abilities, and multiplayer will be accessible with other characters. Also, each character will have unique conversations and beginning stories.

**Art Style:** The bowser on the left so it’s not too hard to make (Unless of course we find a badass artist :p) http://makezineblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/bowser-pixels.png?w=580&amp;h=225

**Characters:**

* **Playable:** 

-*Robin Sweetcheeks-* archer, and fabulous singer, loves long walks on the beach and hot nights stargazing. Loves the Pink Centaur, it's his favorite bar. 

-*Reginald McOldpants -* A rich old bastard of a gnome who wears bathrobes all the time and beats those deadhead whippersnappers with his cane.

-*Julius XXVI -* A pompous knight who always wears golden armour no matter what. Even in bed (; *Ladies* *nudge nudge* (never been laid rofl)

-*Phil the peasant-* Rather daft and simple bloke of low birth. Always carries around Jenna his prize winning hoe. Occasionally talks to turnips. 

-*Hilda Bullsbreath-* Orc mage that barely can even cast a little spell. Usually just whacks things with her fist in frustration. She is lonely and just wants to be loved, has a huge heart, and is silently upset with herself every time she kills a zomble. Though with her orcish brain, forgets about it seconds later.

-*Deragor Alesmasher-* A dwarf with littleman syndrome, he is always trying to show off by drinking excessive amounts of liquor and challenging the burliest men in the room only to be beat up nearly all the time.
 


* **NPCs:**

-Guy who was turned into a frog by Mairead Pimplebottom and he is Jervis’ long lost father Ruairidh Trollnose. He wants to see the downfall of Mairead but doesn’t know he has a son. Navigates the hero through the game. 

-*Jervis Trollnose*- Main evil and magnificent villain. He is 40. Has a shady pencil mustache on his upper lip, a monobrow and a stupid black robe. Inherited his mother’s nose.  Started the zompocalypse out of hate for everyone else, and his idea to rule the world after seeing it in the future. 


-*Mairead Pimplebottom*- Mother of Jervis and is a crone/witch. She has a bushy pencil mustache far superior to Jervis’, a massive monobrow, and a masculine New Jersey accent. They live together in the middle of nowhere and hatch devious plans that never work UNTIL NOW. She stalked his father for the longest time, and when refused for the 451st time, turned him into a frog. 

-*Gerard-* The family mule, old and lazy. Never listens unless apples are involved. Can talk, and always has sarcastic remarks. In the end, he realizes that there will be no apples if everyone dies, so he quickly makes a cure in under 15 minutes as a mad genius mule. Joins the hero for the last few quests in lab gear and goggles, and burnt fur. 

-*Tony Shark-* Mairead Pimplebottom’s pet wereshark, he lives part time in a pit of water in Mairead’s basement and part time on an island in the middle of the pool eating soup. 

**General Plot:**

A mad wizard named Jervis Trollnose decides one day after waking up that he wants to start the apocalypse, and rid the world of assholes in general. So he looks to his wizened crystal ball who is a bit of a confident dick. He shows Jervis the future, which is filled with zombie media. Jervis takes this as inspiration, but before the crystal ball finishes it’s message, he catches a glimpse of a banana from a popular game about monkeys. Monkeys are evil enough, so this fruit shall bear his curse and were henceforth called ‘Plague Bananers’ Everyone who ate the newly summoned fruit that was sold with many advertisements became a brain craving zomble. Your chosen hero, sets out forth on a hack and slash platforming adventure to find the evil behind the horrific curse, and on their way meet many unique and hilarious characters. Eventually they find a talking mule by the name of Gerard who decides to make a cure, they throw it into Mt. Evil with a lord of the rings reference where Gerard plummets to his death with the cure. Hobbits are also included. The volcano erupts which sends the cure all over the land but also scorches many. After they leave the volcano they find Jervis in tears at the base of Mt. Evil. The frog takes out a katana and challenges Jervis to a duel. But before they manage to do anything, a flaming goat interrupts them. The frog is distracted, and Jervis manages to run away crying like a baby. His mother suddenly comes from around the corner and yells after him about pancakes and something with them going somewhat lukewarm. She stares at the frog who is suddenly astonished and yells at her to turn him back. She smiles and does so, thinking he learned his lesson to love her. It is revealed that he is Jervis’ father, and he knocks her out. Then he storms up to the tower they live in and lectures Jervis, and tells him to get a real job. The end.  

*Of course this is just the general idea, it will be fleshed out more*

**Intro cutscene, skippable:**

 Our tale begins with a small child with a pencil mustache (He was born with it), being picked on by the other children. It is found out that the childs name is Jervis Trollnose, a lovechild of Mairead Pimplebottom and Ruairidh Trollnose.
There is a jump in time to Jervis trying to pick up the ladies, however they just laugh it off. Jump in time again... This time Jervis is an adult in the wizard collage of Bartholomew Bigbrain eagerly looking at his test results he studied all semester for, just to find out that he failed due to the fact he is too ugly to be a wizard. Furious, he storms out. The scene fades to black, and an ugly ass wizard wakes up gasping in terror. He knows what he has to do, but before he rushes out to his evil mage tower, his mother calls him down for breakfast.  They yell back and forth, and he just ignores her, and tries to think of an apocalypse. (‘I made Blueberry Pancakes, your favorite!’) He slams his door shut, and looks into his mystical crystal ball to the future for advice on how to rule the world. He sees tons of bad zombie games and movies, and has an epiphany. At the same time however, he also sees Donkey Kong Country (or a rip off) and decides bananas are a good enough evil fruit. Then he rushes off to Mt. Evil with his dastardly plans, which involve spreading plague bananas (a previously unknown fruit) and disease. Cuts to the character’s story. 

**Character starting stories:**

* Robin: He starts in the Pink Centaur singing ‘Girls Just Wanna Show Ankles’ (Medieval Girls Just Wanna Have Fun). When suddenly the undead in pink flannel shirts bust through the door and try to attack him. He takes out his fabulous bedazzled bow and starts shooting them in the skulls before running out the door. Then he meets with the talking frog who tells him about the situation. Robin whistles and his band of ‘merry’ archers join him. They go out on an adventure. 

* Reginald McOldpants: Reginald is enjoying a nice smoke out his mahogany pipe, sitting by a crackling fireplace in his favorite leather armchair, dining on a smashing dish of clafouti and berries. All of the sudden his butler, half eaten, shambles in and starts clawing at Reginald. Without looking Regi impales the fiend with a hot poker out of the fireplace, blowing a ring of smoke while doing so. A frog clad with the finest of peruvian silk hops in and offers him a stuffed Ibex for his parlor. Intrigued, Reginald follows.   

* Julius XXVI is in his gold armour, and just finished winning a tourney against some scrublord. He tries to pick up a beautiful noble lady, but soon after she turns into a zombie who tries to maul him. ‘Woah there, we’re moving a little fast there missy’ before chopping her head off with his sword. He is then confronted reluctantly by the frog, who seems to get major douche chills from this guy. Seriously major douche. 

* Phil the peasant: he was just farming and tending to his sheep one day with his prize winning hoe Jenna. A simple life for a simple man, doesn't say much. Just hums and talks to Jenna and his wilted turnips happily. A rumble is heard on the horizon as a horde of zombies trample over the fields towards him. He spits out the piece of hay he is chewing on, and goes into bamf mode. Everything goes red as he slaughters an entire horde. Covered in blood, he is approached by a talking frog, who is quite disturbed to be honest. Both start their quest together.

* Hilda Bullsbreath: is seen with a bunch of cute rabbits who frolic with her, when she joins them, she accidentally stomps them into paste. She then is seen on the ground crying, until she quickly forgets. As she has short memory loss. She sees more rabbits, and this continues until zombies appear and she tries to save her rabbit friends who are already dead ‘HOOPLAH’. She tries to cast spells, but she’s pretty useless. Ends up smashing a few to bits, when a frog appears. She tries to hug it, but he gets out of her way. Both go forth on their adventure.

* Deragor Alesmasher: was drinking in his favorite dwarven pub when the bartender kicked him out. He started cursing, but as soon as he turned around a large orc undead zombie came towards him, feeling rather confident about his size he took it on with the smashed bottle from the pub. The frog approached him as well, promising ale and alcohol if he adventures with him. Of course Deragor agreed, and was happy that his companion was smaller then him for once. 



**Game Mechanic Ideas:**
 
* Apples can be found and eaten for health or kept in your inventory for later use. (Later in the game they can be traded to Gerard for better weapons or upgraded abilities, however the player does not know this. Hence re-playablility.) 

* There needs to be some form of shopkeeper who yells “Apples here” and “Watch out for Boomers”. When questioned what a boomer is, he states “I dunno, it sounded catchy”.

* Phil often offers people a glimpse of his prize winning hoe, disappointing  them when they discover it is a simple farming tool. It is later discovered his is cheating on Jenna with a rake.

**Character Special Moves:**

*Robin Sweetcheeks:*

* Default attack- Fabulous pose shots. 
* MP consumption- special bedazzled shots that shimmer and burn the flesh of zombies
* Ultimate- After 20 kills he is able to “Sing the Song of his People”, Confusing all the zombies in the area with his “beautiful” voice. (They attack each other)

*Julius XXVI:*
 
* Default attack- Golden strikes
* MP consumption- Douche chills, which temporarily stun zombies for him to attack.
* Ultimate- After 20 kills Julius can use his special ability “Lady Killer” in which he flashes a stunning smile, instantly killing any female zombles around, and sometimes rarely a few male zombies too. Who can resist those blonde locks. Acts as friendly fire to Hilda and Robin in Multiplayer.

*Reginald McOldpants:*

* Default attack- A sharp crack with his cane
* MP consumption- Smoke ring, a attack that acts as a smoke screen
* Ultimate- After 20 kills Reginald may use his excessive Charm and Sophistication into peacefully leaving.

*Phil the Peasant:*

* Default- a whack from his prize winning hoe Jenna.
* MP consumption- throwing turnips at zombies for a ranged attack.
* Ultimate (after 20 kills)- Gassy peasant, a fart that when aimed right will kill any zombies in the area. In Multiplayer this is also friendly fire. 

*Hilda Bullsbreath:*

* Ultimate- drinks super ale and becomes enraged and invulnerable for 30 seconds.

personalfinance,Variable or fixed Student Loan? What is LIBOR?,"Thank you so much for taking a look! I just need help understanding the concepts at work here so I can make an informed decision. 

**Background**:
So I'm off to Grad School in a few months (yay!) but I'm also about to sign for my first student loan (I was fortunate enough that my parents could pay for the cost of my undergrad tuition and I worked 3 jobs while in school to pay for housing/living/books.) I'm taking out a $60,000 loan for an accelerated 12 month program and will not be able to work during those 12 months, but I will be living with my parents for 8 of those months the other 4 I will be studying abroad. It's an international school so I can only do a private loan. 

**Here's the dilemma**: 
The variable interest rate repayment is currently at 2.25% with a $112.5 monthly in school interest payment (I have cash saved to make interest payments). The interest will adjust according to LIBOR indexes. What is LIBOR exactly? Is there a way to see what I might expect the highs and lows to be on this kind of loan?  If LIBOR can't be predicted; can it be given a historical range over the last few years to anticipate my variable interest over the next 7 years?

My other option is to go with a fixed 6.25% loan with a $25 in school interest payment. This option is for 120 payments, turning my $60,000 loan into a final of $87,668.",finance,1372436511

Bitcoin,Bitcoin's Single Point Of Failure,"MtGox has been a great driver for Bitcoin in the past, but it has also been a show stopper in the more recent past. Since April, these have been the Bitcoin headlines caused by MtGox in the press: *Failing under DDOS, failing under too much interest and demand, blocking the possibility to exit the market while the price is plummeting, blocking the possibility to take out cash, wrong paperwork, blocked accounts by the feds.* The problem is, the general public rarely differentiates between Bitcoin and the Bitcoin infrastrucure (like exchanges etc.) when these headlines are presented. In general, these are headlines that would make customers of a bank take their money somewhere else.

We have to realize that the trust of mainstream in cryptography will not suffice for bitcoin. It needs to be trust in the whole bitcoin economy and infrastructure. This includes security, the possibility to enter and exit the market at will, many businesses accepting it etc. 
This is what we are all going for, and we're trying hard to make it happen. But we need to realize that MtGox has done nothing but damage the trust in these critical aspects of bitcoin for the last couple of months. Bitcoin is technologically sound, but it does not yet have the trust of the masses. It is decentralized technologically, but centralized economically.

So why do we accept MtGox to be the Single Point of Failure (with over 60% of all transaction volume) to a system without single points of failure? We're shooting ourselves in the knee by keeping our money in MtGox. 

**Take your money out.** 

If you really want to see your money in an exchange, then put it in another trustworthy one. Decentralize the economy of Bitcoin, for God's sake. Make it profitable for other exchanges to run, and they will grow and even more exchanges will appear. Make it so that if MtGox fucks up once again, it won't be difficult to just say 'bye' and move to another exchange. Make MtGox have to fight for their monopolist role. As of now, we're just giving them our money on a silver plate, and they don't seem to put effort in it, they take it for granted. 
Move your Bitcoins out of MtGox, support other exchanges.

personalfinance,25M Looking for some advice with debt,"I have a bit of a plan but I want to post my specifics to see if I'm missing something or going about things the wrong way.

I am 25 years old, currently taking home 2400 a month after taxes (can spike to 2800-3000 with overtime/weekends some months, but 2400 guaranteed each month).

**Income**
$2400/mo

I have the following debts:
$22050 @ 6.2% w/ $152.79 min payment- Bigger of my two school loans

$4900 @ 6.8% w/ $65.36 min payment- Smaller school loan.

$3000 @ 11.79% w/ $168.78 min payment- Car Loan.

$1150 @ 0% w/ $20 min payment- Credit Card (interest goes to 12.99% in November)

$3400 owed to parents.

**Debt**
$34500

I have $4200 saved currently (half in my checking account half split between 2 savings accounts.)  At the end of every month I take whatever is left over 2k from my checking and put it in the savings or towards my car.

**Savings**
$4200

These are my expenses:
Rent/utilities/food:  $600  (SO and I put 600 each in joint account each month and use it to pay rent/utilities/groceries.)

Cell Phone:  $85.88

Gas:  ~$300

Min payments on debt: $406.93

Entertainment/etc.: ~$600

**Expenses**
~$2000/mo

The ones that are estimates are pretty rough at the moment as I'm in the middle of a move so I'm guessing at what the changes are going to be for gas and discretionary spending.

Ok, so that is the picture as it stands.  Right now, I am paying an extra 80 a month towards the card (for a total of 100) and my SO is paying 150 a month on it (she doesn't have a credit card and couldn't afford it at the time so I put her new phone on my card and she is paying me back, the rest is from joint expenses like furniture) so if we stick with that the balance on the card will be zero by November 1st and we won't have to pay any interest on it.  Other than that, I try to put at least 200 into my savings each month and then what's left (if anything) I send as an extra payment on my car.

So, some more stuff you should know:
My parents currently refuse to accept any payments from me on their loan until I am out of my school debt...I might try to get them to reconsider since i don't want to owe them 3400 for the next 8 years, but as of right now they won't accept money for it.
Over the next 3 months I am receiving 2 raises, which should amount to an increase to about 2700-2800 in take home pay a month.
My job is about as secure as they come, but my SO does not have the same luxury.  And she only has about 1k in savings.  (she takes home ~1600 a month and is usually able to put less than $100 of that into her savings)
Both my SO and I may or may not be going back to school in the next few years.  I've already calculated that if I defer my loans my monthly cost of going to night school will increase my monthly expenses less than the increase with my raises that are on the horizon.  My SO's hours at her current job will not let her go back to school, so she is going to hold off until she switches jobs.  For now her whole situation is really up in the air.

My big loan (also the one with the lowest interest rate) is on a graduated repayment plan.  It is $152.79 now, but will increase every 2 years to reach $436 for the last 2 years.  I'm doing that right now so that I can pay off the car and the other loan faster, then I plan to put the money from those 2 into the big one.

**Questions**
Is it a good idea to pay less on the big loan while I get rid of the higher interest loans, or will it cause some problem I am not aware of?
Is 6k a reasonable amount to have for my emergency fund, or should I have more/less?
Because of the possibility of school should I just be saving everything and only paying minimums? (aside from the CC)
I have a bonus of about $1000-$1500 coming in the next few months.  Where is that going to help me out the most?
I currently put money into my employer's 401k up to the maximum match, should I be doing anything else?  Or should I wait to get more aggressive on retirement savings until I am out of debt?",finance,1372398359

 $125 on gas- could save here, $80 for a bus to work but I do a lot of back and forth driving as all my friends live in the city where I work.

$300-600 various expenses, food, dating, haircut, going out with friends, car maintenance, networking opportunities, state bar fees, bdays, Xmas (I use Ynab and this is all separated).


All said and done I have $1900ish left. Minimum payment on my loans (I'm on IBR) is $550. I passed the bar last year in October, got a job in November.

I'm a 22 year old female about to finish my last semester at a state school. I'm going to graduate with my BA in Political Science and Spanish. I'm in about 70k debt with private (parent plus?) + fed loans because my parents took out an excess of money for expenses.

Because I'm finishing half-year (and barely got funding for my last semester), I only have 6 months before I have to start repaying the loans.

I don't have savings or a job. I'm currently abroad in Argentina to complete my Spanish major so it's been difficult finding a job during my last semester. My mother just lost her job and my dad doesn't no how to control his finances at all. However, I'm planning on going into a social work program (MSW) in the fall. I'm only applying to schools where I can go debt free - like graduate assistant programs.

If I don't get into a MSW program with little to no debt, I plan on getting a job. I'm also applying for a lot of scholarships and programs abroad that pay generous stipends for teaching english.

However, I'm so worried that I'll be paying huge payments while I'm making little or nothing. Or, that my parents might have to pay even though they don't have the resources. What are my options?

Thank you :)",finance,1372384773

Because of the way the account was set up, my parents have access to my bank account. This got me in trouble fairly recently as I was spending waaay to much on marijuana. I am now 45 days clean.

However, I told myself that when I paid off my credit card bill I would close this account and open a checking and savings account for myself that only I could access.

Yesterday when my tax refunds came in, I did. I now have a balance of $0.00 on my credit card for the first time in YEARS! I am proud of myself and I think this is a huge step for me.

Anyway, I've head terrible things about BofA, but I do love the convenience of their ATMs. I've also only ever banked with them, so I'm really not sure where to go from here. I would need to save up a bit more before I actually close the account, but I want to get some advice and I have some questions.

* My credit score (last time I checked...which was two years ago) was okay. Now that I no longer plan on using a credit card (except for online purchases that will immediately be paid off since I heard that using your debit card online is a big no-no) how will that affect my score?

* What banks or federal credit unions do you recommend? 
* On that note, could someone explain Federal Credit Unions to me? I've heard they are much better than banks, you as a member are also part-owner, but I don't actually *get* it.
* On average, how much do you need to have in real cash to open a bank account?

**These coming years and decades that lie before us are filled with increasing uncertainty and looming threats to humanity: the destruction of the environment we are forced to inhabit, international terrorism, poverty, disease, etc. There will be but one solution, I wager - a solution that may not be savoury now. But once the petty rivalries and the well-apparent fragility of international agreements begins to dash our every hope of overcoming the challenge, you will perhaps wonder if something like this, something so bold as a world constitution, could enable the kind of actions that are necessary to reverse the course we are on and bring us back to true progress.**

**I have written many of these constitutions over the years. But none I feel have enshrined a value so basic and fundamentally human as that of this constitution. It will need work, yes. And that is why I must hope for constructive feedback from those who might want to add or modify its contents. Granted, I might expect many redditors to immediately balk at the idea, and reject it as a clear road to totalitarianism on a global and thus unchallenged level.**

**But I would then ask you, what is your solution to rallying the world under this one cause, a cause that – by definition – requires massive scales of cooperation and uniform execution of policy? Is it not the job of government to at least attempt to secure the basic needs and even the very lives of the people? If it is not, then I doubt many would want to live under a government that you, my friend, would so callously envision. As for the choice, I think it will soon be as simple as this: take the “risk” of a democratic world government, or be taken up in the flames of a warming world. Your choice.**

The Prime Documents of the Constitution of the
WORLD FEDERATION of STATES

*In a unification of republics and monarchies, of federal states and unitary states, of confederacies and supranational governments, of intergovernmental organizations and regional unions, we the people of Earth do hereby establish this World Federation of States on behalf of the whole of humanity with the intention of affecting through central organisation a reversal of the present course of human circumstances.*

Article I
The Rights of Humankind

There shall be all but three Prime Rights of the human being which must, to the greatest of all governmental ability both central and regional, be protected in terms as absolute as the extent to which the conditions of rightful exception enumerated herein are rare. None shall, under normal circumstances, rise in importance above another.

i. This body of three Prime Rights are - in summary - long life, adequate liberties, and the pursuit of joy. It consists of the following.

a. All human beings shall possess the right to a life as lengthy as scientific knowledge is able to affect in their bodies. No human being shall be required to live a life as lengthy as they are physically able.

b. All human beings shall possess the right to adequate liberties necessary to live with a sense of freedom in the society and times in which they live. Liberties may only be restricted insofar as they protect the overall equality of the three basic human rights.

c. All human beings shall possess the right to pursue meaningful joy in their life. No human being shall be obstructed in their pursuit of such when it can be reasoned that a consent to their action is likely to provide them with that joy, with the exception of this consent being likely to result in a lessening of such joy in one or more the actor’s counterparts.

ii. All other human rights are to be derived directly from these three Prime Rights.

iii. A document separate from this constitution shall be written and enacted enumerating all other rights this World Federation of States deems to be within reason and being true to justice. It shall be created with the same requirements and restrictions as are needed to amend it and all other secondary documents.

Article II
The Federal Division of Powers

The powers of governance shall be divided between the central government and the states of which it is composed.

i. During crises, the powers of the central government shall be reasonably expanded beyond that of the states, and when the crisis is known to have reached a conclusion those powers shall return to a state of determinable balance between the two. The states shall never be known to have more power than the central government.

ii. Individuals belonging to different countries may be represented and governed by varying levels of the state depending on the degree to which their country has been previously centralised.

a. All original powers in this World Federation of States shall be annexed from the constituent states to a degree in which it can be reasonably said that the central government has little more power than that of the states. 

b. Any expansions of central powers must be enumerated by tertiary law in accordance with all secondary laws.

Article III
The Royal Branch

All monarchies shall be stripped of powers not related to the ceremony of government. Each monarchy shall publically relinquish its stated supremacy and shall commit to a non-hereditary meaning of royalty. This body shall be known as the Royalty of the Houses of Earth; “The ROTHE” or “the Rothe”.

i. To be a member of the Rothe shall not require family ties of any sort to past or present patrons of regal or royal heritage.

ii. The powers enumerated to the Rothe shall be limited to the ceremonial fixtures of government.

a. Of the ceremonies, heraldry, etiquette, and other artistic elements pertaining to the operation and presentation of this central government which are of enough reasonable importance to its image of which it requires holistic planning and execution shall be governed by the Rothe.

b. No powers of moderate or major legal effect shall at any point be enumerated to the Rothe.

iii. No official religion or religious view shall be established or continued in any of the houses comprising the Rothe.

iv. The head of the Rothe, known as ""Rothelord"", shall serve an elected term of three thousand six-hundred days.

Article IV
The Main Branch

The main body of government shall consist of three wings. There shall be an administrative wing of government charged with the execution and enforcement of all laws, a judicial wing of government charged with the interpretation of the intended meaning of ideas put forth in this constitution as applied to more specific legal scenarios, and a legislative wing of government charged with the creation of secondary and tertiary legal measures.

i. The administrative wing shall consist of a military, a treasury, and a body of departments pertaining to the management of the different areas of the central government.

a. The secretariat, head of the administrative wing and the main body of government, shall be charged with creating departments by which managerial functions may be carried out in areas of government not able to be sufficiently covered by other branches.

b. The secretariat shall serve only one elected term lasting no more than one thousand and eight hundred days.

a. There shall be a head of staff who will be charged with overseeing this body of departments and who shall report directly to the secretariat. Both the head of staff and heads of the departments shall be appointed by the secretariat.

d. There shall be a single military which shall not, under normal conditions, exceed one-eighth of government expenditure. Enlistment shall, under normal conditions, be purely voluntary on the part of human beings. All rights and freedoms to which the rest of the population is explicitly entitled shall apply in precisely the same way with no discrimination or differentiation to those who enlist either by their own choice or through compulsory service. The precise structure of the military shall be determined by a military council convened of the former military leaders from the world's strongest armed forces.

e. There shall be a world currency regulated by a central government bank. This bank shall be independent from the military and executive departments of the administrative wing. It shall be headed by a financier who shall be charged with managing the government treasury. This bank shall be distinguished from other economic functions of government such as business, commerce, and industry. The world currency shall be printed directly by this treasury apparatus. The physical printing of money shall not be a permanent fixture and may be abolished at any time once it is deemed economically safe to do so.

i. There shall be a judiciary independent from the other two wings of the main body of government. It shall retain the power to interpret the intentions of the law as they pertain to more specific scenarios. The purpose of this judiciary shall be to make explicit what is implicit in the law, and to create detail and specificity where there is only general use of legal language.

a. This judiciary shall be headed by a world court in which all powers of specification and interpretation shall be vested. They shall be responsible for delegating those powers to lower courts which they retain the right to create. This world court shall consist of one judge for every one hundred million human beings.

b. It shall be headed by a world magistrate, an individual whose main duty shall consist of properly representing through publications and treatises the interpretations of the courts and in particular that of the world court. The magistrate must already be an approved judge in the world court.

i. There shall be a global chamber charged with the creation of secondary and tertiary laws based on reason and justice.

a. This chamber shall be composed of various parties each of which must represent a certain core belief on the functioning and purpose of government. These parties shall be seen as impermanent fixtures individually, but a permanent institution on the whole. There shall be one representative for every ten million citizens.

b. In order to pass any sort of law without the expressed consent of constituents, the measures of the chamber must be approved by three fourths of the representatives. 

c. Parties shall be elected to terms lasting precisely nine hundred days.

d. All rules, regulations, and core processes within the chamber shall be determined through secondary lawmaking process.

iv. There shall be numerous checks and balances within the main body of government.

a. All judges shall be appointed by the legislature through a three-fifths vote.

b. The secretariat may veto any judicial appointment by the legislature.

c. The legislature must approve any sort of compulsory military service to be enacted and this may only occur through a vote in the chamber that succeeds by six-sevenths of the vote.

d. The legislature must approve additional funds to be allotted to the military beyond one-eighths government expenditure and this may only occur through a vote in the chamber that succeeds by four-fifths of the vote.

e. The world court and world chamber shall retain the right to veto any appointment by the Secretariat that lies within the administrative wing of government. It may only occur by way of a minimum of five-eighths in a vote.

Article V
The Elections of the People

The citizenry shall have four different kinds of votes each of which shall be taken legally as the word of the people, provided that a just, accurate, and reasonably executed consultation of the voting population is administered therein. No candidate may be elected to more than one position simultaneously.

i. The first shall be partisan in which individual constituents vote for a party and that party receives proportionate representation in the chamber out of the total vote of the citizenry.

ii. The second shall be for individual initiatives which received less than three fourths of the vote in the chamber and in which less than a third of the representatives abstained. 

iii. The third shall be for the directly elected Secretariat.

iv. The fourth shall be for the directly elected Rothelord.

Article VI
The Auxiliary Branch

There shall be a body of loosely associated semi-governmental organizations charged primarily with auditing the entire government as well as investigating fraud, unethical behaviour, corruption, and bringing attention to unconstitutional actions within the government.

i. They shall not cooperate or interact with one another in an overall significant manner.

ii. They shall not combine with other organizations to form larger organizations.

iii. Their semi-governmental powers shall be enumerated strictly through secondary law.

iv. They shall retain the right to exist continuously in a basic and reasonable manner.

v. They shall acquire no more than two thirds of their income through government, and the government shall not provide them with any less than one third of that income.

vi. The total income per organization cannot exceed two percent of all government expenditure.

a. All investment profits that would cause income to rise above legal levels must be returned to those whom they invested in.

b. In the case of a return of profits to those in whom investments were entrusted, meaningful steps must be taken to reduce total profits of the auxiliary organization down into the accepted range of income.

vii. They shall retain the right to invest their finances in a wide range of private sector companies and enterprises.

Bitcoin,Decentralized Anonymous Parcel Delivery Service - Discussion and Ideas.,"I would like for an anonymous bitcoin based parcel service that has untrusted carriers to deliver products to buyers. This would be similar to Tor in the sense that you will not be able to tell if the parcel item is coming from the seller, a carrier, going to another carrier or the end buyer. This will undoubtedly be achieved using cryptography ensuring that only Entity A and B, or Entity B and C, interact.
The package would be signed with a key and given to the buyer - only they would know it was their package. Carriers will not know the contents of the package either. Although I hope to have it so the carriers can post their own TOS. 

The main issue is how do I design it so it is anonymous and cheat proof? How can I make it so the packages originating point, travel, storage, and end point are all anonymous to everyone except for the two parties involved for each action?

Currently, I am fully intending on making this happen. I need you to try offer solutions to problems and find as many problems as possible. 

 Many people want to see this succeed but few have even attempted - I am trying to take that initiative. Additionally I know enough interested programmers, Believe I can secure the funding needed to ensure it is properly programmed and completed by creating a ""kickstarter"" campaign, as well as accepting bitcoin, and litecoin. 
This will only be attempted once I work everything out.

Why do we need such a service?

1.Privacy is important to me and many other buyers. 
Delivery of products bought online can violate consumers’ privacy,
although not in a straightforward way. In particular, delivery companies that have contracted with a website know the company selling the product, as well as the name and address of the online customer. To make matters worse, if the same delivery company has contracted with many websites, aggregated information per address may be used to profile customers’ transaction activities. 

2.This is a way to help bring bitcoin to the masses and help increase adoption.

3.I believe this system will be more efficient than the large bloated parcel delivery systems that are currently are only options. 

4.I believe this system will also allow for a decentralized Lyft and AirBnb alternative. 


Currently, I am NOT pleased with the fail-deadly/cheat proof system I have came up with because it ties everyone's money up until delivery and approval of the product by the buyer. 

I challenge you to find a better design that is not exploitable!
I also challenge you to find a way to exploit my proposal. 

Here is my rough draft for the idea: 

Buyer wants to purchase a product for 10 BTC. 

Seller gives product to Carrier A. It's worth 10BTC.  Seller puts 10BTC into escrow for himself. He will only get this back once the buyer receives the product he ordered. 

Carrier A puts 10 BTC into escrow to seller. 

Carrier B puts 12 BTC into escrow to carrier A

carrier C puts 13 BTC into escrow to carrier B

Buyer puts 16 BTC into escrow, 15 are to carrier C. 1 BTC is to himself.
Once they all have put up bitcoins, they begin to ship. 

If the buyer is happy, the buyer gets back 1 BTC, and  the other bitcoins are released to everyone, with everyone making a profit. 
The extra bitcoin put in escrow by the buyer, and given back to the buyer is to ensure that he has incentive to release the funds, otherwise there is no real reason to release the funds once he has the item. 

If the buyer is unhappy, the buyer loses 16BTC, carrier C loses 13 BTC, Carrier B loses 12 BTC, Carrier A loses 10 BTC and seller loses 10 BTC and the item they shipped.

Seller must put equal amount worth into escrow to ensure that it is the correct item, properly packaged, etc -- this ensures the seller will not scam them by sending a block of wood instead of an iPad, as there is no way for it to profitable if they potentially lose as many bitcoins as they would gain. 

The carriers put up the value of the items worth in bitcoins to ensure they cannot profit by stealing the item, or replacing it. 

*Carriers*
Carriers are a mixture of people that travel 30-200 miles to/from work, school, and other places (vacation, etc) as well a truck drivers who not only have significant space, but often travel 600+ miles per day - sometimes to and from the same place - and sometimes various different locations. See here: http://pastebin.com/zNJ851xh 

They would have a means to report their route and times via GPS coordinates. 
Some Carriers may simply be storage facilities for other carriers to drop off and load up various packages. 

Since most people would be traveling anyway, they will not use up hardly any additional expenses paying gas, insurance, vehicles, etc. 
They likely will not report the small income made from being a carrier on taxes, pay employees, etc - giving a huge competitive advantage over traditional parcel services such as the UPS, USPS, FedEx - potentially making this parcel service more cost effective. 

Small trucking and shipping companies may profit by being able to tap into this system to get customers/shipping assignments. 

I believe such a system is in high demand, that it can be achieved, and that I can help make it happen. 
All development from the get-go will be completely open source and on a github repository. 

I also believe it would work well as an Airbnb and Lyft competitor - which is something worth mentioning again as it would be significant. Currently lyft is being sued for no legitimate reason. It may also come into use for overcoming distribution issues, such as those faced by Tesla motors and other vehicles from manufacturer to end buyer if they were so inclined to use such a service. 

But... to repeat... how do we  make it so the packages originating point, travel, storage, and end point are all anonymous to everyone except for the two parties involved for each action?

Yes.. I know ""make it like the tor or bitcoin network!"" It's a great suggestion... but still, let's discuss and explain just *exactly* how we can do that and keep the destination and origination of the packages anonymous while paying the carriers?",cryptocurrency,1372497455
Bitcoin,Why bitcoin is showing downward price-pressure?,"My theory:

It should be perfectly reasonable to expect that bitcoin, as a supply-controlled crypto-currency, should begin to respond to the same [price pressures that other hard-assets face](http://www.cnbc.com/id/100836367).

For instance, the price of gold has absolutely tumbled lately some 43% with the announcement and expectation that the Fed will begin easing quantitative easing (QE) soon (as Ben Bernanke gets ready to retire his position). The dollar will face inflation expectations whenever the Fed is printing money to buy bonds or w/e.

Why does that put price-pressure on gold or bitcoin? Because gold and bitcoin are both hedging assets expected to hold their value in an environment where the dollar is inflating. Thus, when people expect inflation, demand for inflation-hedges goes up. And when inflation expectations go down, so does demand for inflation-hedge assets, like gold, like bitcoin.

The announcement that the Fed will soon stop or slow printing money reduces inflationary expectations and therefore *reduces the value* of inflationary hedges like gold or bitcoin because while supply of both gold and bitcoin are essentially static, price changes when demand changes.

Now unlike gold, which has really only that one ability--value store--bitcoin has a compelling value proposition: lower transaction costs, something gold cannot match.

Bitcoin is simply cheaper and more convenient for distance and online transactions than any currency in the world, gold included.

So while the article linked above cites expectations of gold to continue at $1,000 / ounce till 2017, personally I'm still bullish on bitcoin, and 2017 will be a big year for bitcoin as the block-reward halving takes place.",cryptocurrency,1372486388

personalfinance,Should You Worry About Bond Funds if Interest Rates Rise? [2 Articles],"Some people are worried about their bond fund holdings. I suggest staying the course, and be glad your new contributions will get higher yields. Here are some more details/arguments:

[Article Link to Schwab](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/resource_center/expert_insight/investing_strategies/bonds/should_you_worry_about_bond_funds_if_interest_rates_rise.html)

Summary: As long as you have a reasonable bond allocation (i.e. intermediate or short duration bond funds) and a long investing horizon you should be fine in a rising-rate environment and, in the long run, should actually *benefit* from the higher rates too.

Quote: You'll want to match your fund investments with your time horizons. For principal you might need over the next one to four years, choose short-term bond funds. Money you don't need right away, consider intermediate-term funds. Save longer-term funds only for money you won't be needing for a long time (or avoid them altogether if you'd prefer to avoid the volatility if rates rise).

HONG KONG, June 27 (Reuters) - The liquidity crunch in China's financial system last week spooked global markets and led to a downgrade in the outlook of Hong Kong banks that has raised alarm bells about contagion.

The widespread panic from the dizzying spike in onshore interbank rates offers a valuable lesson in risk management for the gatekeepers of Hong Kong's growing yuan markets as the territory's banks have deep ties to state-run mainland banks.

China's central bank has balked at injecting funds into the money markets as it cracked down on funds flowing into the country's vast informal loans market known as ""shadow banking"".

While offshore markets saw only moderate volatility from the credit squeeze and plunging stock prices, the spillover effects are hard to ignore even for the most ardent cheerleaders of China's yuan internationalisation project.

""As the cross border channels strengthen between the onshore and the offshore markets, it is not going to be easy for Hong Kong's regulators to avert a contagion effect and they need to be prepared to stem any impact,"" said Becky Liu, a strategist at Standard Chartered Bank.

The shortage of funds in China has spilled over into Hong Kong, pushing up the cost of funds in the growing offshore yuan market amid speculation that subsidiaries of Chinese banks were remitting money to the mainland. 

The clearing bank for yuan-related transactions in Hong Kong and Taiwan had to raise yuan interest rates this week to attract more yuan deposits. Some Chinese banks reportedly jacked up deposit rates for short-dated yuan funds, and the Chinese government narrowly sold out a jumbo bond sale on Wednesday. 

Indeed, Fitch Ratings said this week that sustained stress in the Chinese interbank market would raise counterparty risks for Hong Kong banks' exposure to mainland banks arising mainly from interbank placements and from guarantees on trade finance.

Fear of a banking crisis are surfacing as the world's second-largest economy is already showing signs of slowdown.

Confidence in Hong Kong's banking system is also critical at a time when the yuan becomes more popularly used in business and trade, making new inroads into markets outside Asia.",finance,1372484018

gaming,San Andreas Role Play Server! Come Have Fun!,"Lawless Roleplay is a Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Multiplayer community that operates on a light RP heavy PvP environment located primarily in Los Santos, a city filled with psychotics, gangs, law enforcement officials all chasing after power. Your decisions affect your future for the good or worse and in the end, your fate is in your hands.

Server Theme: Light RP

We use the term “light RP” in that role playing is encouraged and rewarded, but not essential to playing the game. You won’t get punished for not typing a wall of text to roleplay a simple thing such as unholstering a weapon, as some servers do.

There aren’t many servers on SA-MP nowadays that focus primarily on fun. At Lawless, we want players to have fun. It’s a video game. Most other servers incorporate a bunch of absurd server rules and restrictions such as being forced to drive like you would in real life or you’d get banned (lol). It’s just ridiculous. This game is called Grand Theft Auto, for fucks sake.

**Why play here?**

Lawless Roleplay was originally founded on the principle that all players should rise or decline based on the actions of the person behind the player. We feel that success should be determined by a players actions and talents, not the whim of an administrative team. We have great code. We have great staff. We have great players. But most importantly we have a vigilant regard for your potential.

**Unique Features**

**Picking locks**

Players can break into other player’s vehicles by purchasing a set of lock pick tools from any 24/7 business. You can break into player-owned locked vehicles and go wild - but be careful as lockpicking also alerts the LSPD if the vehicle has an alarm system installed!

**Payphones**

**Dropping and Picking up guns!**

You can now physically drop your weapon onto the ground and someone else can pick it up! This really opens up some really awesome possibilities and encourages new levels of role play. Dropping a weapon (/dropweapon) will physically appear on the floor forever until someone uses ‘/grabgun’ to pick them up!



**Chemicals**



There is a new addition to the drug smuggler and drug dealer jobs. You can now smuggle chemicals and help refill the stock room of the chemical laboratory so drug dealers can purchase chemicals. Chemicals can be purchased from drug dealers.

Chemicals double the effect of cocaine or weed and can only be used after the first 5 seconds of taking the substance (while you’re in the smoking animation). The super duper effects of taking chemicals really shines when you have the drug addict perk (/upgrade). Be careful though, if you take it too fast or too often, chances are that you will overdose!

**Basketball**



The basketball system is open to all players and is made up of two teams! You can join a game and pass the ball around, shoot, dunk, defend and even do skills!

This really adds another dimension into the server as gangs are giving more fun things to do in their spare time apart from claiming turfs and rampaging the lawless streets of Los Santos.


**Notoriety**

The notoriety system is value based and it is affected by what your character does. The more illegal stuff you do, regardless of affiliation, you will rack up notoriety and eventually you will become notorious. This is not the same as wanted level! This is more complex and is long-term.

For example, if you go around and kill a lot of people and/or do a lot of drug deals – you will rack up notoriety points and eventually, if you reach a certain point, you will marked as notorious and will be in the crosshairs of FBI. This is when shit gets real. At this point, every player you interact with could be an undercover federal agent seeking to collect evidence against you for future imprisonment.

Be careful of your actions; they affect your future.

**The Great Escape!**

When notorious players gets sent to prison by the FBI, they'll land in an unpleasant cell with a huge fine and plenty of time to ponder over their actions. You will be in for a very long time if you are sent to prison while notorious (1-4 hours).

We figured that quite often, players get bored of spending hours upon hours in prison with no chance of freedom or interaction with other players. The new prison system allows players to break into the prison cells and to break out their buddies! The police will have to respond and stop the prisoners from escaping.

The police get alerted when the prison cells opens and you'll need to have 10 police officers online in order to try to escape.

**Land system**

The land system allows players to actually own a piece of land and build whatever you like on the land! And I mean anything! You can buy objects and place it on your land - you can create your own house, office, skyscraper, gang HQ, faction HQ or anything you’d like! I don’t want to write a wall of text explaining how the system works, so check out (youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embe dded&amp;v=YCMGnZdClSk) this youtube video which explains it.

**Crime Families / Gangs**

Crime groups in Los Santos have very mixed backgrounds, intentions, and outlook. It’s usually best to stay away from them unless you are interested in joining up with them, even then that doesn’t guarantee you a spot in their group, so keep that in mind. Hanging out with them or knowing key members could help you attain membership. We won’t be overly specific as to what gangs/crime-organizations are present in our server. You can pull up a list of all gangs by typing ‘/gangs’ in-game.

**Factions**

There are a few different factions throughout Los Santos within our server, they all play a unique role
for both roleplay purposes and different aspects of play-style that suit different members of the community.

Los Santos Police Department (LSPD) - The utmost popular faction among players, why wouldn't it be? The LSPD plays a key role in protecting the city of Los Santos from mindless criminals and lunatics. They use a variety of different weaponry and vehicles the pursue and capture the unlawful.

Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) - A Law Enforcement faction that operates by using undercover
agents to infiltrate gangs and big time crime organizations. They also deal with internal affairs and political-level corruption. They prioritize those who are most notorious. If your notoriety level is high, expect the FBI to be on your ass.

Los Santos Fire and Medic Department (LSFMD) - Plays a key role in day to day lives on Lawless Roleplay. With all of the mayhem and violence going on in Los Santos, there is almost always an injured citizen in need of medical assistance. The LSFMD’s role is to respond to these emergencies by using your medical vehicles and equipment to save the patients lives! It all rests in their hands!

San Andreas Government (SAGOV) - The Los Santos Government is responsible for overall management of Los Santos’ budgeting, public and private sectors, property, and its agencies. The Mayor’s staff are usually consistent of secretaries, security guards, and spokespersons. Every once in awhile Mayoral elections are run, and one candidate is elected.

San Andreas News (SANews) - A news agency that investigates and tracks information on everything important
that goes on within Los Santos, they aim to let the public know everything significant that happens. From live interviews, to weather reports, to simple air coverage. They have all the news!

The Hitman Agency (HMA) - A secretive group of people who's names are known by not even the most elite agents of the FBI. They work for their own advantage of making money, by completing money-based contracts placed by civilians (/contract) against their enemies. The Hitman Agency's aim is to kill and make money without ever even being spotted. If they get spotted, they have a variety of different techniques and equipment to allow them to change their appearance and identity.

**Jobs**

There are several jobs scattered all throughout Los Santos. The question is: do you want to go legal or illegal? The choice is yours. Legal jobs pay you whenever you sign your paycheck (once every hour). Illegal jobs pay you up front with cash, however you have take the risk of getting busted by the law.

You can type ‘/skill’ to list your skill levels for activities/jobs. Every job/activity has a maximum skill level of 5, the higher your skill is, the better perks you get for that job/activity. You can find the locations for all jobs by typing ‘/findjob’. You can find the commands for specific jobs by typing ‘/help’ and looking at the “JOB” section.

**Taxi Driver** - This job can be used to drive people around the city for a certain price. This job is not very profitable as most people would much rather steal a car themselves; however if you insist on picking people up, they might just come along. If you manage to reel in a customer, you can make a decent amount of money!

**Detective** - This job can be used to locate people anywhere in San Andreas. This is helpful for the law enforcement factions, and can be used to find criminals, it is a legal job and you cannot get busted for doing it. There is no actual salary for this job, unless someone would like to hire you to find an individual for them.

**Lawyer** - A legal job that can be used to reduce the wanted levels and jail time of your clients. This is a legal job and you cannot get busted for doing it. It will come in handy for when your friends get into trouble with the law.

**Boxer** - Boxers beat the crap out of people in the ring, and make a name for themselves. There’s no actual income for this job, you do however get fame. Fame leads to fortune!

**Whore** - This job can be used to give pleasure to any client who may be interested in having some fun. This is a job that offers sex to every client who comes along.

**Drug Dealer** - You find crackheads and potheads who are interested in your goods and sell them off. This is an illegal job and you will get busted by the cops if you are caught possessing or selling any type of drugs. Don’t get high off your own supply!

**Drug Smuggler** - Drug Smugglers are the ones responsible for keeping the drug houses stocked up with drugs. If any drug supply has dried up, this job can easily get them restocked by smuggling materials from another city.

**Mechanic** - Mechanics fix up, tune up, and pimp out vehicles. This is considered a legal job, however NOS is considered illegal, so be careful.

**Arms Dealer** - You sell guns to those in need. Strike deals and persuade people to buy your weapons. Be aware that this job is considered illegal and you will get busted if you get caught. Try to be subtle.

**Trucker Job** - You are paid to deliver contents from the trucking factory over to businesses. This is how businesses get re-stocked with supplies.

**Lumberjack** - Chop down trees and make some easy money. The job is located on the far outskirts of Los Santos.

**Miner** - Mine some ore and make some easy money. Same concept as lumberjack, but even easier! This is the best paying legal job. It’s fast and easy.

**Garbage Man** - Clean the streets of Los Santos by hopping into a garbage truck and driving around Los Santos. You’ll be rewarded with quick cash by loading up the bins around Los Santos in your Garbage Truck!

**Craftsman** - Craftsmen use materials to make cool things such as GPS’s, wristwatches, and even high explosive bombs to carry out terrorist attacks on Los Santos citizens!

**Activities**

Not only are there jobs, there are also activities which don’t require you to make a commitment to. You can do them any time you’d like just to make some quick cash.

**Fishing** - You can go to the Santa Maria Beach and stand at the fishing poles and fish by typing ‘/fish’. Careful though, the waters in Los Santos are very dirty. You can sometimes reel in things like condoms, cash, and even g-strings. Type ‘/fishhelp’ for help on fishing.

**Car Jacker** - You can steal cars, and drop them off at the crane to make some quick money by using ‘/dropcar’. This command has a cooldown depending on your car jacker skill. You can check your skill level by using ‘/skill’. The higher your car jacker skill, the more money you make! This is considered illegal and a cop may bust you for it.

Street Sweeping - Feel like cleaning the streets while making some quick cash? Get in a street sweeper or and drive around Los Santos. You’ll be rewarded with quick cash by simply driving around in a Street Sweeper!

**New Players**

The first thing you'll need to do is come up with a realistic roleplay name for your character (for example: John_Smith). You can set your name by writing it into the blank field in the SA-MP client. Your name must be a roleplay name in the [firstname]_[lastname] format. If you are to register with an incorrect roleplay name, our administration team will offer you a free name change and assist you if you are stuck with anything. The next step is to customize your characters details, such as your age and gender. This is all straightforward and is very easy to accomplish without any mistakes.

Once you finish with all of that, you can immediately start playing and interacting with the community. If you need help with anything you can use ‘/guide’ to show a dialog box full of information on the server, for things such as; Jobs, Factions, Gangs, Cars and Houses. If the ‘/guide’ command doesn't have what you're looking for, then you can use /helpme 'message' and our team of shitheads will assist you in whatever you need information on. So don't worry, we're always here to help you if you're in need.

**Things to remember:**
- “DMing” is short for Deathmatching. This means killing people excessively without a reason. Doing this will get you punished.
- Think before killing someone. If they're affiliated in any group, you're probably going to get wrecked.
- You can use ‘/service’ to call for a mechanic, taxi, or paramedic if you’re hurt.
- You can use ‘/help’ to bring up a list of commands.
- You can use ‘/guide’ to give you specific information on whatever you may need.
- You can use ‘/report’ to contact any admin online, or to report another player for breaking rules.
- You can use ‘/helpme’ if you’re in need of any assistance. One of our helpers will gladly assist you!
- You can contact me (Zav_Ix) in game if you have any troubles. Phone number is 698.

business,The Avanti Group : China’s Sinovel Charged by U.S.,"http://www.behance.net/gallery/The-Avanti-Group-Chinas-Sinovel-Charged-by-US/9565397

Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558), a Chinese wind-turbine company, was charged with stealing trade secrets from its former U.S. supplier, a case of industrial espionage that may heighten tensions in U.S.-China relations in the wake of the Edward Snowden affair.


U.S. prosecutors secured an indictment of the company and two of its executives in federal court yesterday in Madison, Wisconsin. Also charged was Dejan Karabasevic, who pleaded guilty in Klagenfurt, Austria, to stealing source code for the turbine controllers made by American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC), his former employer. The company lost more than $1 billion in market value after the theft became public.


The indictment’s timing may give it prominence in the U.S. intensifying dispute with China over economic espionage. That conflict has only been inflamed by Snowden’s disclosures of U.S. computer-based spying, and China’s decision to allow the ex-National Security Agency contractor to fly to Russia from Hong Kong, where he had fled.

“My 5-year-old understands that this is wrong,” AMSC Chief Executive Officer Daniel McGahn said by phone. “If your ideas can be stolen without recourse, there is no reason to invest in innovation, and if there is no reason to invest in innovation, there is no purpose to the American economy.”


Sinovel’s stock fell 1.5 percent to 3.95 yuan at 10:44 a.m. local time in Shanghai after plunging 7 percent earlier. Wang Wen, a Beijing-based spokeswoman at Sinovel, declined to comment.

Legal Struggle
The indictment is the latest development in a legal struggle between AMSC, a maker of small industrial computers that fit inside wind turbines, and the company that was formerly its largest customer. AMSC, based in Devens, Massachusetts, is seeking more than $1.2 billion in damages from Sinovel in Chinese courts, accusing Beijing-based Sinovel of putting the stolen source code in more than 1,000 turbines that it sold in its home country.


Amy Riella and Elliott Joh, lawyers for Sinovel at Vinson &amp; Elkins LLP, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the charges.",finance,1372470032

tech,[Question] Trouble installing new OS on Windows 8 computer,"**You can skip down to the bottom if you want, I'll bold the question and any information that I think may be important** 
***
I have a laptop that was preinstalled with Windows 8. Once you learn the trackpad shortcuts and get used to the new start screen, it's actually far better than most people say it is; however, I still find it frustrating and want to change my OS. 

#I've downloaded the Ubuntu version 13.04 64 bit disk image and burned it to a CD-R. From the disk I ran `wubi.exe` and selected the normal computer reboot option, and during reboot the disk didn't even register. I tried again, this time selecting the ""Help me boot from CD"" option. This time, after reboot, after I clicked Ubuntu at the OS selection (it did register this time) Windows Bootup Manager gave me an error saying that it couldn't load the OS because it was missing the file. The complete error message was as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Starting Windows didn't succeed. The reason may be changing software.

    To solve this problem:
        1. Insert installation disc of Windows and reboot pc
        2. Choose language settings and click Next
        3. Use Repair

    If you don't own this disk contact with the administrator.

    File: \ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr
    State: 0xc000007b
    Information: Could not load application or Operating System because of the lack of the required file or errors in this file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I tried again and it gave me the same error message. I figured it either downloaded or burned wrong, so I downloaded the disk image again and made a LiveUSB out of it.

 Again, I had the same problem of it not registering after restart.

 Again, I tried the ""Help me boot from CD"" option. 

Again, I got the same missing `\ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr` error. 

Well, maybe it was just an error with the actual files in that version, it was only released about 2 months ago, it could still be buggy and they may not have been able to fix it yet. I downloaded the Ubuntu version 12.04 64 bit disk image this time instead of version 13.04 and burned it to a different CD-R. With high hopes I ran `wubi.exe` and during boot up, the disk didn't run. No surprise there. You know the drill by now. Again, the same dreaded missing `\ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr` error from Windows Bootup Manager. Sadly, the Ubuntu through-current-operating-system installer does not have support for Windows 8.

So by now I know that there's an issue, an issue far beyond the control whatever I could do with those CD's and USB, an issue far beyond the control of however I tried to run the installation applications, an issue far beyond the control of how many times I tried installing the Operating System. I had heard of a suspiciously unrealistic-sounding new feature to Windows 8. A new feature, supposedly implemented in 2012, called Secure Boot. Curious, I opened Windows Powershell and ran the boolean command `Confirm-SecureBootUEFI`. I was hoping for the familiar, bright red ""`The term 'Command-Term/' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.`"" or at least `False` or `Cmdlet not supported on this platform`. The terminal processed the command successfully, and returned a bright white, courier, `True`

^^ಠ_ಠ

^^^God.

^^^Damnit.

For those of you who don't know, Secure Boot is part of the UEFI of machines with Windows 8. Secure Boot prevents your computer from booting any Operating System besides Windows 8, or in best case scenarios deters it and makes it the most difficult pain in the ass you will ever experience. If you have a machine that came with Windows 8, you will most likely never be able to load up a new operating system the easy, normal way. For context, imagine that crazy ex girlfriend that you broke up with. Now imagine her with a knife, a lot of ropes and chains, padlocks, and a dark soundproofed basement. Now name her Windows 8, shove her in your computer, and imagine trying to break up with her for this hot, exotic girl you met named Ubuntu the easy, normal way, especially after telling her that she has to share the computer with this chick. 

Yeah. The people who yell at sheeple for supporting Micro$oft, as ridiculous as they are, may have a point.

I'm pretty sure that Secure Boot is the issue I'm having when trying to partition my harddrive. I realize that I could always back up my files, completely reformat my harddrive, and load Ubuntu from that most likely without a problem, but I don't want to completely lose Windows 8 until I'm familiar with Ubuntu and know that I want it.

So, if any of you could find something else that may be the issue from the information given, then that would be great just in case I'm trying to fix the wrong thing. I guess the question I'm trying to ask is: **Is there a way to disable Secure Boot? Secure Boot is a new UEFI feature in Windows Operating Systems that prevents/deters any operating system besides Windows from booting. I run Windows 8 on an HP Pavilion g4.

HONG KONG, June 27 (Reuters) - The liquidity crunch in China's financial system last week spooked global markets and led to a downgrade in the outlook of Hong Kong banks that has raised alarm bells about contagion.

The widespread panic from the dizzying spike in onshore interbank rates offers a valuable lesson in risk management for the gatekeepers of Hong Kong's growing yuan markets as the territory's banks have deep ties to state-run mainland banks.

China's central bank has balked at injecting funds into the money markets as it cracked down on funds flowing into the country's vast informal loans market known as ""shadow banking"".

While offshore markets saw only moderate volatility from the credit squeeze and plunging stock prices, the spillover effects are hard to ignore even for the most ardent cheerleaders of China's yuan internationalisation project.

""As the cross border channels strengthen between the onshore and the offshore markets, it is not going to be easy for Hong Kong's regulators to avert a contagion effect and they need to be prepared to stem any impact,"" said Becky Liu, a strategist at Standard Chartered Bank.

The shortage of funds in China has spilled over into Hong Kong, pushing up the cost of funds in the growing offshore yuan market amid speculation that subsidiaries of Chinese banks were remitting money to the mainland. 

The clearing bank for yuan-related transactions in Hong Kong and Taiwan had to raise yuan interest rates this week to attract more yuan deposits. Some Chinese banks reportedly jacked up deposit rates for short-dated yuan funds, and the Chinese government narrowly sold out a jumbo bond sale on Wednesday. 

Indeed, Fitch Ratings said this week that sustained stress in the Chinese interbank market would raise counterparty risks for Hong Kong banks' exposure to mainland banks arising mainly from interbank placements and from guarantees on trade finance.

Fear of a banking crisis are surfacing as the world's second-largest economy is already showing signs of slowdown.

Confidence in Hong Kong's banking system is also critical at a time when the yuan becomes more popularly used in business and trade, making new inroads into markets outside Asia.",finance,1372583968

gaming,A Vision of the Future,"E3. Los Angeles. The final day, the final hour, the year 2014. After a rather unremarkable exposition, there's an atmosphere of mild dissatisfaction in the air. Some titles stand out among the rest, but like a passing moth, they caught spectators' attentions briefly before their memories were moved to some undistinguished space in their subconscious.

You are there. You stand silent taking it all in one last time before you decide to leave. Sweaty men in meme shirts shuffle past you. You've got a bit of a sore throat, it scratches you uncomfortably. Someone from G4TV catches the corner of your eye, and you're taken back to a time when G4 aired actual gaming related material, if only for a moment. The building smells of cut Plexiglas and body heat. You take two steps towards the exit when a rather corpulent man in a fedora to your left wheezes out a primal yell, pointing his finger to a platform behind you. The noise takes you by surprise. You turn to check out what the big deal is. At the same time a collective murmur takes hold of the room as everyone turns to look, all at the same platform.

You can't see anything at first, but then it becomes clear. A single figure is standing there, rather awkwardly. You can't quite make out who it is. It's a rather stocky man; he's wearing a green polo. A microphone appears in his hands, almost as if through some kind of wizardly magic. He taps it once. The building goes quiet. It is almost as if every man and machine there took a brief rest from what it had been doing to listen to what this man had to say. The soft thump echoes throughout the enclosure. Now he's taking the mic up to his lips. You can't help but feel what is about to happen will be astronomically-- nay, biblically important.

Time slows down as it dawns upon you. A revelation of unprecedented proportions. The man is Gabe Newell, CEO of Valve. 

You feel a sudden euphoric pressure in the back of your head, at the base of your skull. Time slows even further. The silence is so thick, so damp, you can almost feel it pass through your teeth as you breathe in. All of human history has been building up to this one singular point in time. A sound enters your ears. You feel the molecules in your body vibrate as it passes through them. It is the single sound of his breath before he speaks. His lips part.


""3.""


He extends his hand outward and the mic falls to the floor. Thump. He turns and walks off.

A moment of raw shock hits you like a steel train. Your legs get weak, your knees buckle for a moment. You blink once, voluntarily.
The crowd explodes into a fit of violent ecstasy. A thousand cries of pure happiness pierce every crease and nook of the building. People are hugging eachother. Others are fainting. In a single moment all the pressure in the room felt like it condensed and collapsed with one single word. Tears fill your eyes. Memories of your childhood come flooding back to you. Someone's on the phone with their family, speaking through sobs of joy. It's the fedora man. You smile. The sound of ambulance sirens can be heard approaching from the distance. They might as well be an angelic choir. A weight has been lifted off your shoulders. 

After what seems like days the excitement dies down. In reality it was perhaps only 30 minutes. Your sore throat has magically disappeared.

10,000 years of peace come upon the Earth. Breakthroughs in science and medicine follow. Humanity evolves into a race of non-corporeal, galaxy travelling beings capable of endless love. Heaven and Earth meld into one world simply known as ""paradise."" The blind see, and the dead walk. Bitter enemies forgive eachother, old friends are reunited. 
You are filled with a sense of completion.
History in the far future describes an event known as ""The Great Reveal"" and forever perpetuate the good feelings that were felt that day. It takes on mythical status, with Gabe as a Christ-like figure. In the futuristic, English-hybrid language, he is only known as ""gayben."" Mythical tales of him are told fighting the Combine with nothing but a crowbar. Fact blends with fiction and takes on legendary status.

Flashbackwards 1 day after E3 and the confirmation of Half-Life 3.
You take a seat at your computer and fire up Reddit. It's the biggest circlejerk you've ever witnessed. You don't even post. You just sit back and mouth the words ""thank you"" as you picture an imaginary camera panning out of the room. You feel closure. For the first time in 7 long years, you feel closure.",technology,1372564653
personalfinance,college student looking for advice.,"back story: I'm a 20 year old college student renting a room with my girlfriend. I work part time and I'm currently going to one class over the summer. I live completely on my own, with occasional help from my parents.

long story short; my girlfriend and I packed up for a road trip today and 80 miles in, my car overheated and I blew the head gasket. research has shown that my engine is fried, and it will be at least $600 to replace it if I get lucky. 

so my question is what is the most reasonable course of action from here? I have about $500 to put in, and I could feasibly sell the car for $1000, leaving me with $1500 to play with.

should I buy another cheap used car? should I finance new or used from a dealer? I have no credit and no co-signer. I know, even if I can get a loan, that the interest rate will be through the roof. 

if I finance, would it be better to get a higher long-term loan with a better interest rate or lower short-term with more interest?

any pointers are appreciated.",finance,1372564528

personalfinance,How should I proceed financially (mainly loans questions)?,"Throwaway so we can actually play with real numbers. Apologies for the wall of text. This got longer than I expected.

I'm 23, and in quite a bit of debt. I am working on setting up a budget. I'll likely be trying out YNAB, as Mint doesn't give me as much control as I'd like. Hopefully you guys can give me some guidance as to whether my next steps forward make sense.

I graduated in May 2013 and started my job on June 24th. I expect to see my first paycheck on July 7th or so. Salary $62,000. I'm a consultant, so cost of living is rather low. 401k matching doesn't start for a year, so I'm not worrying about that until I can get their 3% match. Rent is $350, other expenses are pretty much what you'd expect. Budget's not my focus immediately, although any tips you guys can offer specific to the consulting lifestyle and how it impacts your budgeting would be appreciated (lot of money being floated and expensed, hard to get a handle of. I've got a rewards credit card specifically for expenses I bill to my company, so I should reap some benefit from that).

My financial assets are split in two accounts, one easily accessible (Schwab Debit card) and one that's a bit harder to touch. I'll call the latter my emergency fund, though I guess my Schwab account could be considered a smaller one.

* Schwab Account: $4,000
* Emergency Fund: $12,000

Now, as to my debt. The breakdown is as follows:

* $3,750 at 5%, subsidized
* $8,250 at 3.4%, subsidized
* $4,500 at 4.5%, subsidized
* $2,250 at 5.6%, subsidized
* $1,290 at 6.0%, subsidized
* $6,750 at 6.8%, unsubsidized
* $18,000 at 7.25%, unsubsidized
* $4,000 at 7.88%, unsubsidized
* $20,000 at 10.88%, unsubsidized
* About $50,000 at 7.9%, unsubsidized (I don't have access to this loan information yet, but that's my projection)

All in all, that's $115,000+ in debt. Scary, right? So, correct me if you see anything amiss, but the following is my assessment of my financial position and planned next steps:

1. Get access to the remaining $50,000 in debt, so I don't get blindsided by anything while planning to move forward.

2. For some reason, many of these debts seem to have a scheduled first payment at least a year from now. I don't know if they think that I'm not out of college yet or what, but I don't really want to tip them off that I'm earning if at all possible. **Question 1:** Is this a bad idea? Will this come back to bite me in the ass?

3. That $20,000 at 11% is my first priority. It needs to go. **Question 2:** How do I best mitigate this debt? Can I take out another loan at a lower interest rate and pay off the entire sum in full? Will my loan issuer charge me extra for doing so?

4. Aggressively pay off debts in order of interest rate. **EDIT:** Apparently the term is 'Avalanche' method. Minimums on all and kill off any debts over 5.6% one at a time.

5. Once I can, take advantage of employer 401k matching.

6. This is where it gets tricky. **Question 3:** Is 4.5% low enough that I shouldn't prioritize killing off that debt in favor of funding a retirement account (Vanguard most likely)? Where's the breakeven these days?

7. **Question 4:** Is my emergency fund reasonable? $12,000 that I don't touch and then some money floating around just for shits and giggles? Do you think $1-2k is too much to keep in the more accessible account?

8. **Question 5:** Thank you for coming down this far. [Here's a silly picture](http://dobrador.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/funny-pictures-cat-has-a-lot-of-money11.jpg) for your trouble. Do you have any other recommendations for me?

personalfinance,[CA] What do you think of our plan to live simple and retire to part-time work?,"**Background**

We've been together for about 15 years and consider ourselves soul mates. We both work full-time for the government, but not for the same agency (yet). We spend much of our free time together however and find that work really gets in the way of our living (I know...it's crazy, right?). About two years ago we thought, ""Hey, if we could reduce our monthly living expenses, we could pretty much work part-time and go into semi-retirement!""

Since then we've radically changed the way we live and how we spend money. It's taken some time to get the ball rolling, but so far we've eliminated about $30K of debt, reduced our grocery/dining and entertainment expenses significantly and removed some luxuries altogether, including Cable TV, home telephone and two inexcusably expensive cellular plans. We've also given up one of our two cars, and I now commute via transit. 

**The Plan**

Move from Big City, Canada to a small town, use 10-20% down to mortgage a small house with a yard large enough to grow veggies. Within a year or two, leave the security of our two full-time government jobs (after we have emergency savings of $20-30K) for part-time McJobs in the community. Live on more with less. 

Each of us would ideally work 18-24 hours per week, conservatively estimated at a minimum wage of $10.25/hr. 

Wife could also elect to draw on government pension at any time for a guaranteed $1000/mo. or more (depending on when she cashes out). I have virtually no pension so work is my only option.

1. Does this sound possible?
1. Are we crazy? Missing the obvious?
1. Any advice or red flags?
1. Why aren't more people doing this already?

**The Details**

* Two middle-aged federal government employees, with a combined annual net of $72,000
* Currently rent in the Metro Vancouver area of Canada, where real estate prices are insane
* Relocating to a fairly small town of less than 8000 population
* Our jobs will follow us to a nearby town as well (commute by car will be necessary)
* This will be our first ever (and hopefully final) house purchase
* Currently saving for the 10-20% down payment ($15,000-30,000)
* No debts, but no real savings either
* Wife has $300K in 10-year term life and sudden death insurance (a mix of private and employment-provided)
* Husband has $700K in 20-year term life and sudden death insurance to provide for wife (private and employment as above)
* Basic healthcare is covered, thanks to living in Canada!
* Dental and optical would be extra and we're looking into that now (but have also gotten all of the serious dental work out of the way with our current coverage)
* We are frugal by most standards and spend very little outside of thrifting and food

Our monthly output is about $2200. Once we eliminate vehicle/transit expenses, that drops to about $1700 and we're still trying to reduce our food budget every month which we hope will be further offset by a bigger garden.

In the $150-160K price range, the typical house in the target community is a minimal traditional style, built in the late 1940s; most are 700-900 square feet on decent-sizes lots of about 6000 square feet; two bedrooms, 1 bath. They are old, often crooked and dirty, and may contain such great features as asbestos siding, insulation or floor tiles, worn out roofs, 60-amp electrical service, minor water damage and bad plumbing. Most have no basements or garages.

**Some What Ifs**

*Mortgage:* We're debating whether it'd be better to lock in at 10 years fixed and not have to worry about renegotiating with McJobs on a 3 or 5 year term; or should we go with a 2-year term, pay as much principal as we can during that time and then renegotiate with a lower monthly payment before quitting our jobs?

*Disabilities:* If wife suffered a disability, I would have to pick up the slack. If the other way around, she would have the pension to supplement her until CPP and OAS kicked in.

*Plan B:* Pay cash for an older mobile home in a park instead of mortgaging a house is another option. Pad rates would be cheaper than a mortgage payment, but it would provide less privacy, storage and garden space. Again, we're not looking at an investment scenario so appreciation is a non-issue.
