personalfinance,"120k Student Loan Debt, living in Boston, making about 24k a year. Need advice.","Hi all! Here are the basics:

* 90k in debt between 3 private lenders ($700/month min)
* 30k in debt in direct federal loans ($300/month min)
* Rent and utilities every month runs me ~$860
* I make about 24k a year waiting tables, but will likely in the next 6 months be able to find a job making in the neighborhood of 40-50k.

Anyway, I had been squeaking by, making minimum payments on my private loans ($700/mo) with the intention of aggressively paying off my loans as soon as I came into a better employment situation. Then, I got a call from Federal Loan Servicing telling me my payments are 3 months behind ($1,200) on the four federal loans that up until that time I was unaware I had. Eek.

Obviously, since I was barely making it when I was unaware of my Federal loans ($300/mo), there is no way I can make it with them. So I ask you folks, what are my options?

What is the likelihood of being able to receive some sort of forgiveness/forbearance/deferment on some of my loans? And should I seek that forgiveness/forbearance/deferment from my private lenders or from my Federal lender?

There are also other repayment options (Graduated/Extended/Income-Contingent). Would any of these be a good idea?

What about loan consolidation?

Many questions, I know. There is just a lot going on with many lenders and I'm not even sure where to begin. Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,Age 29 with 300k annual income. Running out of investing ideas.,"I'm 29 with approx. 300k in annual income from self-employment. I have been contributing quite a bit to SEP-IRA for a few years. I have $166,000 in SEP-IRA. Last year, I contributed the maximum $50k, and this year, I am considering to contribute another 50k. The retirement money is invested in Lifecycle 2050 funds.

The problem is that I feel like I'm locking away a very large portion of my income into a retirement account where I wont see the money for 30+ years. If I want to go invest into a new business or something else -- that money is locked up and practically untouchable without significant penalties.

On the flip side, I feel like I'm wasting a HUGE amount on taxes by not maxing out the SEP-IRA. With my fairly high income, and high tax bracket, if I don't put 50K into the IRA I pay probably close to $20k in additional taxes (huge waste).

I own a home with a $500k mortgage on it. (put 20% down) and 3.8% interest mortgage rate.

Other than my home and SEP-IRA, I'm not really investing into anything else. I was considering to start buying up some gold with the value near $1,200 now.

Any ideas from the experienced investors here? Should I continue to max my IRA and lock my money away, or are there better investment techniques I should consider that won't keep my money locked up for 30 years but still minimize my tax burden?

No matter how I do the math I'll be losing money when I start having to make student loan payments.,"Currently working three minimum wage jobs in the Boston, MA area. I average about 75 hours a week. 

Average monthly income: $2600

CURRENT EXPENSES: 

Withholdings: $728

Rent (includes all utilities and internet): $900

Health insurance and co-pays: $625

Cell phone: $10 (pre-paid)

Transportation: $70

Food: $100

That leaves $267 left for savings and other expenses.  

Next month student loan payments start and I am losing sleep over it. $30k of my debt is federal and eligible for IBR and $30k is private. This results in a $160/month payment on the federal loans and a $345/month payment on the private loans. I'll need to make another $238/month just to break even. I'm honestly at a loss of what to do. 

In hindsight I know it was foolish to get into so much debt but I thought getting a chemical engineering degree would pay off. Sadly I haven't gotten anywhere near an offer for a real engineering job and I'm stuck making minimum wage. I honestly don't think I'm physically capable of working more hours. Monday-Friday I work about 14 hours a day plus spend 3 hours commuting to and between jobs. I come home and collapse on my bed and sleep until it's time to go to work again. I'm trying to find another job for weekends but it's tough because I'm competing against high school and college students for those jobs plus I need time for doctors appointments (I was very fortunate to find a place that's open Saturday mornings). I feel I've cut my costs as much as humanly possible. I never eat out, I buy day-old food that's on sale at the grocery store, I have a pre-paid cell phone and I never text anyone, I never do anything that requires spending money that's not necessary to live or work. I could probably cut internet and get a small discount on my rent, but then it would be harder to apply for jobs. 

I have $2000 in savings, and some people have suggested I use that money to pick up my things and move to an area with better employment opportunities and lower living expenses like Houston. My fear with that is that if I don't find a job soon after moving I'll end up literally homeless and possibly dead from not being able to afford medical care.

personalfinance,"My student loan servicer sent statements to the wrong address, now I'm in default.","This is kind of a long story so hear me out.  I took out a number of student loans to finance my college, and attended 3 different schools by the time I graduated.  One of the loans I took out was a Federal Stafford Loan.  I graduated, got a job, and started receiving information on paying back my loans.  I started making payments to 3 different loan processors (Sallie Mae, Nelnet, and ECSI).  Never missed a payment, no problems.

I got a letter in the mail (to my parent's address) saying I was late on paying a student loan, and gave me a person to call at one of the schools I attended.  I called the number, and it was disconnected.  I called the school directory and asked for the name listed on the letter, and the school said they didn't have anyone there by that name.  I started thinking the letter was a scam, and disregarded it.

Several months later I get a call from Williams &amp; Fudge (Debt Collectors) saying I have a student loan in default that has been turned over to them.  I told them I'd look into it and call them back.  I called the school, and they said they don't service their loans but to check NSLDS to check the validity of the debt.  I looked the loan up on NSLDS and confirmed it was valid.  ECSI is the school's loan servicer, so I called ECSI to ask them about the loan.  They were sending the statements to my former address, which explains why i never received them.  They never attempted to find my current address, phone number, or anything (saying it was not their responsibility), even though I have been making payments to them for almost a year on a loan from a different school.

I talked with ECSI and the school, explained the situation, and offered to pay the past due amount if I could repay without getting collections involved.  They refused, saying their policy is that once they have turned an account over to collections, they don't deal with it anymore.

So I called back the collections agency.  The original loan was $2000, but they added about $100 in interest and $700 in collections fees making the total balance about $2800.  They said I have 3 options, pay the full balance now, pay the full balance in 9 months, or consolidate this loan with my other federal loans under the Direct Loans program.  I didn't have $3k to cough up, and don't have the budget for an extra $300/mo student loan payment, so I told them I would opt for the consolidation.

Williams &amp; Fudge sent me the loan application.  I completed it and mailed it to them.  A month later, I received another application from Direct Loans, asking for my tax return and paystub.  Apparently, if you are consolidating a defaulted student loan you must apply for Income Contingent Repayment.

So this is where I'm at, and I really feel like I'm being taken advantage of.  First, ECSI sends statements to an old address.  Through 6 months of not receiving payments, they never made an attempt to find a current address, or call me.  I know they had my current information on file, because I was making payments to them on a loan from a different school.  6 months later, they turn my loan over to a collections agency, who charges me a $700 collections fee.  My student loan payments are already $450/mo and I don't have the resources to fork out another $350/mo to pay the defaulted loan back in 9 months, so I'm forced to consolidate.  Now I have to consolidate all my federal loans under an Income Contingent Repayment.

I have several questions, and am looking for advice from anyone who might know more then me about the student loan process.

Do I have any legal ground to dispute the $700 collection fee?
Will my loans now have a higher interest rate since I'll be consolidating after the new doubling of student loan interest rates?
How does the Income Contingent Repayment work?  I saw that the Dept of Ed. can request my tax information every year to adjust my payment.
What would you do if you were in my situation?

If I were a conspiracy theorist, I would say the Dept of Education could be directing loan servicers not to contact borrowers who have missed payments, in hope of the loan defaulting so they can use collections agencies to pressure borrowers into consolidating.  But that would be scandalous, and our government would never do anything like that?",finance,1372796093

personalfinance,Is there a 'best' way to pay back student loans?,"I recently finished my Associates in IT and required $14,438.00 to finish it. Unfortunately this required subsidized and unsubsidized loans. $6,188.00 at 3.4% and $8,250.00 at 6.8% . Now thankfully I was able to get a good job paying $34k a year, and my first payments are a few months away so I'm curious if there are any ""smart"" methods of repaying this loan.

Checking the website, I see two options offered through them. Both of which I could afford, but one is a lower monthly payment that increases throughout the term of the loan, and the other is a flat rate. At the time I received the loan I was still rebuilding my credit so 6.8 did not seem bad, but looking back on it now when I just refinanced my car at 1.9% it seems awful.

I looked into consolidating my two loans and doing some quick math, if they take the average of the two interest rates the interest rate will be 5.1% . Checking here
https://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/loancalc/servlet/Controller?controller_task=startCalculator

The final result has me at
Standard 180 $115.12 $20,721.08
Graduated 180 $80.57 $21,912.76

Which actually has me paying more in the long run, but less monthly payment wise as they appear to use 180 months instead of 120. My borrower website has

Standard 120 $164 $4,491 (interest) $19,630 (total)
Graduated 120 $110-$245 $5,354 (interest) $20,493 (total)


I'm curious if there are any programs (doubtful as I have not found any yet) that someone with a high credit score could utilize to get a loan with a lower interest rate, and use it to payoff the student loan? The unsubsidized has apparently already accrued $582.77 in interest since it was issued (wow) so it is already up to $15k before my first payment!

In the end, I'm just curious if there is any way that I should pay back this loan in the smartest way possible, other than maximizing my monthly payments to lower to paid interest over all as I'm buying a house soon and money will be tight over the next few months as I scrap together a down payment. Though once I am settled in the new house, perhaps this will be an option. My bi-weekly checks end up being $1077 after taxes, insurance, etc so I am certainly not looking to avoid this debt, simply looking into the most efficient way of paying it back.

Thanks for your time!

Also as a note, I know I should have already started paying on it before the Grace period was over, I should have read the details of the unsubsidized loan more closely as I was unaware it was accruing interest the entire time. This was my mistake, and I will begin making payments on it soon, just curious if there is any way I should go about approaching it outside of the ""Choose the standard repayment plan, and get to it"".",finance,1372794508
personalfinance,PSA: Consider consolidating certain variable interest student loans now to lock in the low rate.,"For Stafford and PLUS loans originated through 6/30/2006, the interest rates are variable and are tied to the rates of certain Treasury instruments.  Treasury yields are very low right now, so the corresponding variable rates are low.  The rates update on July 1, so they just updated for this year.

If you consolidate these loans, the consolidation loan will be fixed rate based on the loans consolidated and rounded up to the next 1/8 percent.  You can then get a discount of 1/4% for direct automatic payments.  What this means is that for variable loans that are now at 2.35%, the consolidation loan could be as  low as 2.125%, which is the lowest possible rate for a consolidation of these loans unless treasury yields go negative.  So, if you have any 2.35% loans, it may be good to consolidate now (unless you are going back to school and could get them consolidated at an even lower rate of 1.5%).

If you have loans at 3.15% or 3.39%, it's possible that you could get one more 1/8% off of the consolidation loan if Treasury yields drop more next year, but they could go up as well.  In any case, the rates are pretty close to the lowest possible without Treasury yields going negative, so it's probably a good time to consolidate and lock in the low rates.

See [here](http://www.finaid.org/loans/scripts/interest.cgi) for more info on how the variable rates are calculated, [here](http://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/help/rate.html) for how to calculate the consolidation loan rate, and [here](https://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/loancalc/servlet/Controller?controller_task=startCalculator) for a consolidation loan calculator.

**Edit:** [Here's](https://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/AppEntry/apply-online/appindex.jsp) the page to start working on your consolidation loan.

**Edit 2:** Since a lot of people are asking, this applies only to Stafford and PLUS loans originated on or before June 30, 2006.  If your loan was originated on or after July 1, 2006, this does not apply.  Also, private loans may have variable rates but are not eligible for federal consolidation.  It's really going to depend on your loan terms and what refinance/consolidation offerings private companies have to determine whether it would be worth if for private loans.

Given that the cutoff date for origination of these loans is 2006, most folks with these loans will be close to paying them off unless they had a long period of deferment, forbearance, or nonpayment or had them on an extended payment plan.  I don't want anybody to think that they'll be able to get their 6.8% loans down to 2.125%, but for people with these loans that won't pay them off by next July (when rates change again), consolidation may be a good option to lock in low rates.",finance,1372793906
personalfinance,Savings Account vs. CD for ~2-3 year savings goal?,"I read the sidebar ""I have $X"" and want a little more specific advice to the current financial times we live in. 

My fiance and I received a $20,000 gift for our wedding. We want to use this toward the down payment on a house (which will happen in 2-3 years). The current question is whether we should put it in a saving account or a CD. Our savings account options can give us a ~0.15% ROI, CD's ~0.25% at the high end. It seems like the 6month CD option would be best, considering that the Fed has been hinting at easing on their stimulus measures. So I don't want to get locked into a 2-3 year CD only to have the Fed increase the federal interest rates in 6months-1 year and then be locked into a garbage ROI when the CD rates will increase somewhat as well. 

I suppose the real question is, when the difference is ~0.1% interest (about $20 increased return over 6 months) is it even worth it to consider a CD vs. a savings account? Or is there a better low risk investment vehicle for the 2-3 year period that I'm not considering? 

Full disclosure: my fiance is extremely financially conservative and is not willing to assume any risk on this money, so putting them into something like an index fund is not an option for us. 

Edit: Furthermore, it's likely that we will be continuing contributions to this money over time. So something that can be added to on a semi-frequent basis would also be optimal.",finance,1372790952
personalfinance,"Withholding and the ""Interest Free Loan"" Argument","Curious for input.

Considering how god awful savings interest rates are, is it still considered inadvisable to withhold too much for the purposes of  ensuring a fat tax refund?

investing,"Let's talk Shale Oil - Drilling, Extraction, Refining, Transport, etc.","This has been a topic a few times in passing on other subreddits (environmental, economics, etc.), but I haven't been able to find a nice big one in /r/investing.

My interest got piqued a few weeks ago when I attended a lecture by one of the men who discovered the now-famous Parshall Bakken shale oil field in North Dakota.  He made a really good presentation on America's increasing energy independence and the Parshall field in particular.  I had three main takeaways from the talk:

1) the field is very, very large - estimated at the second largest in the US (10 billion BBS of reserves), second only to Prudhoe Bay in Alaska (whose production is actually winding down) and ~ 20th largest in the world.

2) It is (relatively) early in development, having only been discovered in 2006.  Here's a graph of existing wells as of 2013: http://i.imgur.com/8wLzDkg.jpg.  If you notice the very dense area on the right side of the map - the whole field will look like that once it's fully developed.  

3) Although many of the big players are involved (Exxon, Phillips 66, BP, etc.) the beauty of the Parshall field is that it has allowed a large number of smaller drilling &amp; exploitation companies to come in and gobble up wells and land, mostly because there are very few federal land regulations in North Dakota.  These companies include (but are not limited to) - Triangle USA, Oasis Petroleum, QEP Energy, EOG Resources Inc., Helis Oil &amp; Gas, etc. (I could post a full list if people are interested).

Many of the wells become profitable within a year, some within 1/2 a year.  Additionally, production and drilling costs are going down (projected to fall ~8% this year alone), and studies are underway to determine if there is enough downspacing room for 6 - 8 wells per 1280 acres (well above normal).  

Additionally, the big players (specifically BP and Phillips) are making some moves, setting up refineries and railroad loops for transportation in and out of the area: http://www.theolympian.com/2013/06/29/2604554/2-wash-refineries-ready-for-north.html

One of the biggest problems (obviously) is that with increased domestic production, oil prices are bound to sink a bit, but how does everyone view the shale boom in general, or the Parshall (and Eagle Ford) operations in particular?  Anyone have any strong feelings one way or another?  I've been looking at many of the companies, and a lot of them are small-cap, but companies like PHX seem poised to make big gains from it as well.

The historical average interest rate for a business loan is around 7.5% and I will need around $15,000-20,000 to start up my business.

I figure the tax penalty will only affect me in the current year if take the withdrawal, as opposed to me getting hit with an interest charge every year until the loan is paid off.  So Reddit, does anyone have any particular knowledge about this and if so could you please provide some insight on this situation?

personalfinance,On IBR. $170K in debt. Would it even make sense to pay more than the minimum?,"Hey all. I have about $170K debt from law school. I'm a couple years out of school and am making around $70-80K a year (depending on bonuses) at a firm. It's a good job, and I have a chance for some growth career-wise. 

All of my loans are federal, and I'm on an IBR repayment schedule paying about $500/month. IBR, as you know, is a plan that tracks to your current income, and after 25 years the remaining debt is forgiven (of course, depending on the tax laws 25 years from now, I'll likely have to pay a big tax bill when that happens). 

My question: would it make sense to pay more than the minimum payment every month if, right now, it seems like I'll never be able to pay it off in less than 25 years? I can probably afford about $1000/month total if I needed to. A couple of the loans are GradPLUS which have a 8.5% interest rate. I also wonder if I could even pay off more than the monthly interest that is accruing. 

I know that my salary will likely increase over the years, but I'm not sure if it will ever increase enough to completely pay off the loans early. Should I continue to focus on putting my extra money away for savings/investments, or should I switch my focus to paying off the student loan debt in the hopes that I'm able to pay it off in 10-15 years?

personalfinance,Student Loan Dilemma,"Long time lurker, first time poster. 23 years old making 41k a year

My ACS loan (myedaccount.com) got transferred June 26 to FedLoan Servicing (myfedloan.org). My loans are due on the 21st of every month but I pay them with the first paycheck of the month so June 7 I sent payment for what was due June 21st. While the amount transferred to the new loan company was correct and reflected the June 7th payment they are saying I am now delinquent because I didn't make a payment for June 21. I contacted the company and explained my situation and they said:

&gt;Your loan(s) transferred from Direct Loans to our office for servicing effective June 26, 2013 and reflected a delinquent status.  We should receive the payment history from Direct Loans within 60 days of the date your loan(s) transferred to our office for servicing.  If a payment was made to your previous servicer that would satisfy the current delinquency, please allow approximately 60 days for the payment to be forwarded.  Once the payment is received, it will be posted to your account with the same effective date Direct Loans received the payment.
&gt; 
&gt; You may request a  60 day Transfer Forbearance to resolve the delinquency on any loans that were transferred to FedLoan Servicing within the last 60 days.  The interest that will accrue while on this forbearance will not capitalize (be added to the principal balance).  These transferred loans cannot be more than 60 days past due and a payment for these loans must have been submitted to your previous servicer.  If you qualify for this Transfer Forbearance, please reply to this email with your request.
&gt;

Do I trust them to fix the mistake? I KNOW I was not delinquent. Do I tap into my very small 1,000$ emergency fund to cover it? I just moved and I am not currently saving besides the 10% into my employee matched 401k (a problem I'm working on). My credit score has already taken a dive since my student loans were some of my oldest accounts (not that I need credit right now but I don't want to deal with a delinquency on my report later on.) 

I'm leaning towards tapping the e-fund since I have solid job stability. The payment is under IBR and about 250$ a month with interest rates varying from 4.5%-6.8%. and the total amount is $22,000 with only $5,401 at 4.5%. I also have been making (more aggressive) payments for the parent plus loans taken out for me which currently total about $13,500 at 6.8% - since January I have been putting $350-$400 towards these. 


So after typing this all out I'm thinking take it out of the e-fund which I can hopefully replenish with better budgeting this month and moving forward but worst case scenario I have 3 paychecks in August meaning $1,000 extra which can go straight to savings.  

TL;DR I sort of figured it out after typing this wall of text, but you guys are great and one of the best subreddits around! Suggestions still welcome",finance,1372778420
personalfinance,Can the Federal Gov't Take 100% of my Tax Return for Defaulted Student Loans? [AZ],"I went to college for 2 years and racked up about $10,000 worth of student loan debt. I paid as much out of pocket as I could and quickly realized that college was just a huge debt that I did not need and I could succeed in life without it. 

Anyway, my student loans are now in default. I am looking at different rehab programs for my loans as I have used up all my forbearance and deferment time allowed. 

I have a 2 month old at home, and from what I have seen there are some pretty hefty tax credits for having children on your tax returns. 

My question is, can they take 100% of my federal and state tax returns and apply them to my student loan debt, including the credits for having children? 

Are there any options besides loan rehab that could still get me a tax return next year without forking over $250/month to my loan creditors in hopes that I could even get them out of default in time? I was told it takes 9-12 months for loan rehab but not guaranteed.

38k

Car worth 8.6k

Is there a way to take the lump sum and convert it into a 529 plan to use for school without taking the 10% penalty? Should I even do that? 

Or should I take out private/federal loans and then borrow against my retirement account? (But if I do that, can I only borrow against half of my 401k or is there a way to borrow against IRAs)

So far the fed has been able to buy bonds endlessly, keeping liquidity up but without creating significant inflation. How?

business,The Southwood Norsemytho Group: 'Annakodi' lifeless (Tamil movie review),"http://india.nydailynews.com/entertainmentarticle/c91fcc9298269e877388c33a3dab6a7f/annakodi-lifeless-village-pot-boiler-tamil-movie-review

Film: Annakodi; Director: P. Bharathiraja; Cast: Lakshman Narayan, Karthika Nair, Manoj Bharathiraja, Renuka, Meenal and Subiksha; Rating: *

Veteran filmmaker Bharathiraja wields the megaphone after five years. One of the highly respected directors in the industry, he is known for his long association with films set against the village backdrop. Over the years, he has explored some bold and funny themes, mostly village based. ""Annakodi"" happens to be another village love story from the veteran's factory that takes us to a bygone era to tell us a story we have known for years.

Annakodi and Kodiveeran, young residents of two neighboring villages, fall in love with each other at first sight. As much as they want to be together, life has something else for them in store and so do the evil village head and his son Sadaiyan, who want to separate them. What is the fate of these hapless lovers? This forms the rest of the story.
It's not because we are bored of village flicks, but rarely does ""Annakodi"" keeps the audiences engaged and that's why it miserably fails. From a village's point of view, the film might work for a few but it has nothing to offer to the city bred, Bollywood and Hollywood exposed cinephiles.

It treads a path most village flicks have done in the past. That people in villages are still doomed by caste and creed, and love is something they don't see with a fresh pair of eyes. We can't disagree but neither can we appreciate it because we have been fed similar stories for decades now.

The film and its characters bear lot of resemblance to the director's own debut classic ""16 Vayathinile"", which featured Sridevi, Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth. Bharathiraja seems to have tweaked the story with fresh faces and some soulful music, hoping audiences would embrace it. Unfortunately, the effort backfires and questions the credibility of the director, who has given numerous blockbusters such as ""Muthal Mariyathai"" and ""Kizhakku Cheemayile"".
There is no closure given to the love that was kindled in first half. It gets lost amidst elements such as violence, tragedy and sentiment that engulf the second half, forcing audiences to search for love and romance in the process.

Even though the film progresses at decent pace, it fails to connect with the audience on an emotional level. The story lacks depth and passion needed for narrating an emotionally compelling story.
Bharathiraja chooses to narrate the story in flashback, from the point of view of one of his characters. It makes an instant connection with the viewers, but doesn't last long to leave an impact. You need to force yourself to sit through the film, let alone hope to be entertained.

Karthika, daughter of Bharathiraja's protégé Radha, impresses in his role sans make up and glamour, while the male protagonist Lakshman is equally fitting but turns little cumbersome in the most emotional scenes of the film.

Manoj Bharathi in a role with shades of grey is brilliant. One needs guts to shed his hero image and take up such roles. He deserves two thumbs up for the role that unfortunately doesn't shoulder the fate of the film.

Bharathiraja takes back in time but doesn't quite make us feel the soul of his village pot-boiler.

What are you doing to protect yourself against a rising rate environment?


i'll go first:

1) Buy real estate. staying away from traditional REITs and going for a more leveraged bet with DMO

2) Take off interest rate risk and replace it with credit risk. sold my position in Fixed Income with a duration greater than 1.

3) invest in better indices. I've become a fan of funds that track fundamentals weighted indices - like PRF. and Min Vol products like USMV.

3) sector rotation - I'm overweight energy. buying energy ETF's.

my problem is that none of this gives me much upside in the near term when rates do rise - it should just minimize the effects of adverse market moves. i have no great long ideas.

I'm currently a college freshman at a pretty great (and pricey) college. My first year, we've taken loans in the amount of $32k, all federal. One loan is deferred until I graduate and has a great interest rate, that is not of my concern right now. I have an unsubsidized loan and a subsidized loan in the amounts of 2k and 3.5k for the whole year, respectively.

In regards to my job, I got my first paycheck of $363 the week before I left for vacation which I am still on. I deposited $100 in my checking and the rest went into my savings, which brought my savings account balance up to $1.3k. This is great, the highest my savings has been in months. I make $11/hour and when I get back, I'll be working 3 solid 40 hour weeks for the rest of July. Each paycheck will be $440, so tentatively I'm waiting on $1.32k in the month of July.

I'm not sure what I should put into savings in order to pay off my school loans and what I should give myself for spending allotment. I don't spend a lot of money (although I will be buying cheap lunch a couple days a week because I don't have a choice) and occasionally treat myself to a new bottle of nail polish. My job is secured for the rest of this summer, all of next summer, and possibly even the summer after that.

I will be able to get a job on campus once school starts but I'd like to not factor that in right now.

So, with the money I'm making from my job this summer, what should I save and put toward paying off my loans or making a pool to pay them off, and what should I allot myself for things to buy during the month?

I want to maximize my savings without completely cutting myself off from spending.

Because of scheduling issues I dropped below half time for the last two semesters of school triggering my student loan and forcing me to put it in forbearance.

Luckily I've been able to find a full time job in my field just a month out of college so I'll be able to start making payments. However I am questioning if I even should at the moment.

At the end of my forbearance the interest I've accumulated with capitalize back to my loans. I have multiple loans with interest rates going from 3.4% up to 6.8%.

Now what I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to instead let this interest capitalize but then make a payment equal to that amount immediately afterwards. With no current interest due that money would go to paying down my 6.8% loans principle, the effect of which would be essentially moving part of my 6.8% loans principle down into the lower interest rate loans.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin raffle/lottery for Reddit?,"Would anyone be interested in a **lottery bot** ran using the Reddit API? 

This is how I envision it being done:

You would tip (with our beloved tip bot) the lottery bot user. It would immediately send your tip to a trusted *escrowed* public address. The bot would add that total to the lottery pool and report your current chances of winning the lottery (based on your proportional contribution) and the payout (based on the total pool of contributions). It would also give you randomly generated numbers (say 1 to 10,000). You would get more numbers the more you contributed. Say for 1 mbtc you get 1 number, for 10 mbtc you get 10 numbers. You may also choose your own numbers.

The ""drawing"" would occur at a predetermined blockchain block in the future. I would propose using the block at difficulty change (approx. every two weeks). A hash would be taken of the block header and fed in to a PRNG as the seed. This number would be used (in some centralized or decentralized method) to determine the lottery winner. Perhaps a certain portion of coins could be contributed to a predetermined charity (say 10-20%) as well as the escrow operator.

I have a few problems with this and a some solutions. I've outlined a few of the more troublesome ones:

1. Legality: No idea if this would violate Reddit TOS or cause other issues with legality.
2. Trust/Fairness: I think these issues can be ameliorated in a number of ways. The bot's source code would be completely open. The use of the blockchain block headers as a means to seed a PRNG makes the lottery ""drawing"" verifiable (and I think this method doesn't introduce any bias into the lotto numbers, but I could be wrong). The lotto account would be held by a trusted escrow party that wouldn't have access to the funds. All of this can be done as transparently as possible so that no gaming would occur.
3. Concern for hacking. I think this is another good reason to use an escrow.

How do you feel about the idea? I'm not really that serious about it, but I get tired of all the price discussions in here. :)",cryptocurrency,1372955616

Unfortunately we will not be able to release what specific program was detected, or how, since that information can be used to circumvent out methods.


BULLSHIT. I mean seriously, come on. They haven't detected anything, because there's nothing to detect.

I've been playing games online since I got my first dial-up modem. That was about 16 years ago. I haven't been banned from a single game in 16 years, and I certainly, have never hacked.

What frustrates me the most about this situation is that SOE doesn't even want to know you once whoever decides you've been hacking has marked your account as banned.

Your original account is useless. You can't even log into it. You can't use it to submit a ticket to even have your ban looked at. You need to register a second account just to submit a ticket.

Not only is your original account completely inaccessible, but good luck ever trying to play Planetside 2 again. You're shit out of luck, because even with a brand new account, a HWID ban or IP ban will preclude you from even creating a new character.

So this is my current situation:

I'm waiting on a reply on a ticket I submitted through an account registered for my by a fellow outfit member (yes, they even stopped me from registering accounts from my IP!). I have asked them to escalate the ticket to someone who can check the validity of the ban. I'm sure once this happens, they will see they done goofed, and remove the ban.

Is it likely this will happen before the double XP weekend is over? Not likely considering the 4th of July holiday, but at least I should be able to jump back into the game sometime next week.

I'm wondering if anyone has any horror stories about false bans, and what you did to get them lifted?

meaning I am an internet service provider ISP that erases its logs every day

if the feds subpoena for any particular IP they can't get anything because my company assigns a different IP every time somebody connects and we don't keep any records

pros - with the current scandal of NSA tracking your data and people getting charged for stupid shit they say online this would not be difficult to market

cons - of course the criminal element, child molesters in particular, would be drawn to the service, bringing bad PR and possible lawsuits

personalfinance,Roth IRA plan for returning expat and wife,"My wife and I are returning to the US in 2 months and I am trying to figure out how to take optimize tax-advantage retirement accounts. It feels a bit strange so I wanted to run it by r/pf.

Since we currently live outside the US, for 2013 taxes, all the income we have made outside the US will not be taxed due to the foreign income exclusion.

I estimate our marginal federal tax rate will be 10% (~$17k) for 2013 on income earned in the US. At such a low rate I believe it is smart for us to max-out our contributions to a Roth IRA for each of us.

Should I forgo any 401k contributions to max out the Roth IRA or even all together for 2013? Or even dip into EF? 

Other facts: We got married in 2013. Wife will not necessarily be working in the US in 2013. I have a small student loan debt ($4k @ 2.1%), I have ~$10k in taxable brokerage accounts, wife has ~$15k in traditional 401k from previous employer (suggestions for this?), and we have ~$15k in cash/savings after moving (~7 months expenses). For new employer 401k I estimate only a 30-40% chance of becoming vested in 50% match after 3 years.",finance,1372911622

personalfinance,25 Living at Home and Gainfully Employed. I Need Help.,"I'm 25 years old living with an older sibling and my parents in the greater Pittsburgh area. I'm ready to move out on my own though nothing is forcing me. I get along with my family and I'm single so there is honestly no rush. I contribute enough to my family between rent/food/home supplies that living at home is not saving me much more than moving out would. I really just want some more space.

I've been out of school and gainfully employed for several years now and I have built up some savings along the way. I managed to get through school with limited school loans &lt;20k and no credit debt or credit score. I ended college with negative dollars to my name and proceeded to make a poor decision. I purchased a new car that was more expensive than I needed and it came with a terrible interest rate. The car loan rate is at 6.75% and has less than two years left in its term. My credit now exists and is in good standing. I also do not hold a credit card balance. I have enough money for about 20% down on a house or to pay off my car. If I did both the down payment would drain me to nothing and still not be 20%. My budget for homes takes my monthly car payment into account so I can maintain my standard of living with a car payment and mortgage. I've already been pre-approved for a home loan with the rate I want.

Keeping in mind that I want to move out within the next year does it make more sense to pay off my car loan or to move out?  Does it matter? If there is any more information I can give please let me know.


Edit: As per demosthenesss' suggestion it's less than 25k on student loans and car combined. I'm reluctant to give my exact income but I will say I'm a software engineer and I don't work at Google so less than 100k. 

Also I figure the absolutely best thing to do would be to live at home as long as possible and pay everything off but that's unreasonable at this point.",finance,1372903547

The situation is that he recieved a 10-year mortgage, with some sort of contractual agreement to refinance after 10 years. (sounds fishy already considering the low interest rates at the time). The 10 years finished, and now they are making it impossible to refinance, meanwhile his mortgage went from $800 to $3000. Payment for not refinancing the mortgage, that they refuse to refinance. 

I think he'll be alright in the end, refinancing with another bank or lender. However if he wasn't wealthy, or had a nest egg, he'd be fucked.

investing,Advice on Brokerage Account- question about Capital Gain taxes,"Hello wise Investing Community! 

So, here is my scenario and subsequent question. I am an amateur investor and this is my investment portfolio so far:

* Traditional IRA with a mutual fund ~ I've contributed a couple hundred dollars this year
* Roth IRA with an assortment of non-commission ETFS ~ contributed $600 this year 
* Betterment account- contribute $75/month: 55% stocks 45% bonds 
* 401K- with company match- I put in 3%
* 6 months of income saved in my emergency fund  

I don't want to tie up all my money in retirement accounts, because I'd like to be able to get into it within the next few years (school, buy property, start a family). But I don't want to keep all my funds in savings, as interest rates are dismal and I feel its losing value due to inflation. So, I'd like to take some money from my savings, and open a brokerage account and put ~ $2500 in a mutual index fund. Can someone kindly explain the tax implications of this once I decide to take the money out? I have no idea how taxes on capital gains/investment income work. Do I get any tax benefits by putting money into a brokerage account... or is it all post-tax income similar to a ROTH IRA?

investing,"Is there really any benefit to buying a house ""while interest rates are at an all-time low?""","I know its probably more of an /r/personalfinance question, but you guys seem to have a better grasp on macroeconomics. Obviously lower interest rates mean you can take out a larger loan and buy a more expensive house while keeping the payments the same. So I've been having a lot of family members pushing me to buy a house now.

The way I see it, if interest rates go up its going to put downward pressure on house values. The amount people are going to be able to spend on a mortgage isn't going to drastically increase. While I don't expect values to necessarily go down, I do find it analogous to bond markets: as interest rates increase the value of the principle decreases.

My co-signer filed for bankruptcy, leaving them willing but unable to co-sign private loans for my final year of college.

To give you some insight, my credit score is 650, but will likely be 680+ by the end of july (reducing my utilization rate majorly and paying an unsecured loan off). With three years of credit history and no negative marks, I should have an average credit score by the time I apply.

personalfinance,"Need advice digging myself out of $22,000 auto loan trap.","Due to my poor credit, I opted for a Santander loan. I can afford my  monthly payments of $521, however, a very small portion of that is actually going towards paying off the debt. Last month $280 of the $521 went to interest. My rate is 19.43% which is putting my daily rate at about $11.53. What is this rate even compounding against? $11.53 is not 19% of $521 - so at this point I'm not even sure what my loan payment is before any interest is applied.

The only thing I know to do, which isn't really feasible is to make an extra payment each month the day after my first payment is made so that all of the second payment goes towards them auto loan. 

Current Payoff: $21,680
Current interest rate: 19.43% (locked in)
Daily rate: $11.53
Interest accrues daily. The interest accrual begins the day after a payment posts to the account and continues until the day the next payment is posted. With each payment the accrued interest is paid first then the remainder of the payment amount is applied to the principal balance.

Edit: Unfortunately, I have to find a way to get out from under the loan.

If you are thinking of running your own business and would like to sell products online, then this simple guide will take you step by step through the process from setting up to running it from home. This is not from an MBA or a business book but from personal practical experience setting up our online business. 

+ Research the market

Before you start your business, do yourself a favour and research the market:
-	what consumers are buying. There’s no point selling things people do not want.
-	what other businesses are selling (ie. the competition) 
-	what prices your competition is selling things. If you can sell it for cheaper than your competitor or offer “added value” for your product to the consumer, then go for it. If you can’t, look for another product
-	from where you can get the products (ie. your supply source)
-	what gross profit you can make from each product (roughly the retail price minus the cost to you)
-	How or where you will store the stock; home garage? Self-storage unit? Industrial warehouse?
 

+ Write a business plan
Failing to plan = planning to fail. Write a business plan. Did you hear that? Write a business plan. It will force you to think of issues you’ve not thought of and show you any areas that need more attention. It’ll show you if you need more money and whether you’ll make a profit. Many businesses fail because of lack of cash flow or working capital. A business plan will alert you to potential cash flow problems, which means you can look into funding before a crisis hits!

You can use Business Plan Pro, Business Plan Template or any other software. Get advice from www.gov.uk, your local Chamber of Commerce, an accountant or a business person.


+  Legal &amp; admin

Are you going to incorporate your company to form a limited company or sell as a sole trader? A limited company means your personal assets are safe in case something should go wrong but you will have more admin like filing for incorporation at Companies House, filing Annual Returns etc.  See companieshouse.gov.uk for guidance.

If you decide to incorporate a company, you will either need to prepare the documents yourself or use a Company Formation Agent. There are plenty on the internet.

You’ll need to think of a company name. Search the list of companies at Companies House to see if the name is taken. If it isn’t quickly snap it up! 

If you go down the sole trader route, good luck; we can’t help you there!

You will need a business bank account. Shop around for free banking for start-ups. You may also find a package that includes Business Plan writing software or accounting software included for a monthly fee. That might get you started quicker than having to buy them individually.

Don’t forget to set up some insurance for your business. You’ll need some for stock cover, employer’s liability, product and public liability etc. Perhaps business interruption insurance too. 

If you don’t intend on holding stock, at this stage reach an agreement with your supplier for them to drop ship the goods to your customer when the sales come in.

If you haven’t done so, read up on Distance Selling Regulations!

+ Branding

Now that you’ve found your product and written your plan, work on your branding:
-	Business name. Linked with this is the domain name (ie. your website name)
-	Logo 
-	Tagline
-	Your Unique Selling Point (“USP”)
-	“Corporate” colours 
You can pay a graphic designer to design a logo or you could use websites like graphicriver for logos.
You will need to register your domain name. We have used sites like domainmonster or 123-reg.
Get business cards done following your corporate colours and in line with the image you’d like to portray. 

+ Web design &amp; hosting

Get quotes from web development or marketing companies to design an e-commerce website and host it. Check where servers will be located, server capacity, and speed and so on. Check whether you will have complete access and control of the Content Management System (ie. the backend of your website) or whether you will need to pay the web company to manage and maintain your website. You can see where the costs are going to rack up.

Alternatively, explore a Wordpress site. You can purchase a Wordpress template for $30. That’s what we did. Provided you get someone to download it and host it, you can then do your legwork filling out the site with pictures, descriptions and so on. With Word press, you can add the e-commerce shopping cart yourself and whatever plug-ins thereafter. With something like £300, our website was up and running.

At this point, you’ll need product images and descriptions. You can pay a professional photographer to take images or you can ask your supplier for images. Most have high resolution images that they can supply to you for free. If you get your own photographer you will have to purchase some stock beforehand. 

Set up your payment gateway from your website. You’ll need a:
-	Card payment processing provider (eg.  WorldPay, Ogone, Sage Pay)
-	Merchant Account to receive funds (this is different from your current account but check with your bank or shop around to see what rates are for debit cards, credit cards and how many transactions can be processed for free)
You can also integrate PayPal as a payment mechanism relatively easily. See their website for details on how to integrate that into your website, if compatible.

+  Search Engine Optimisation

The internet is a competitive place. If you aren’t on page 1 of Google, you won’t get much business but not everyone can be on page 1. So you’ll need to work on Search Engine Optimisation. There isn’t an overnight solution but rather a consistent effort to improve your search ranking. Please read up on SEO. We aren’t experts but here’s what we do: 
-	Create fresh content on our site regularly
-	Keyword our products and tag our images with words that people are using in Google searches (Google Keyword Tool can help)
-	Create backlinks by listing our business on other business directories, third party websites
-	Blogging
-	Social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and so on
-	Commenting on forums
-	Writing articles
ETC
You can pay a SEO company to this for you for a monthly fee or you can plod through yourself!

+  Marketing

This will require more time and effort than you think. You have to consistently market your business. This is what we’ve done:
-	Google Adwords
-	AdSense
-	Social Media - Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest
-	Email marketing 
-	Print leaflets
-	Magazine advertising
-	Memberships of the Chamber of Commerce and local networks
-	Attending networking events
-	Prizes/Competitions
-	Corporate sponsorship
-	Attendance at fairs/markets
-	Word of mouth referrals 
The list is endless but you’ve got to do it.






+  Processing orders &amp; postage

Now you’ve done all the behind the scene work and your website is up and running, look forward to some sales!

When orders come through, you will need to process them from book-keeping, generating sales receipts, packaging your product safely (to withstand bashing around) and then dispatching it to your customer, within 2 working days generally.

If you are not intending to hold stock, then you will pass the request to your supplier to drop ship the goods to your customer.

Make sure you inform the customer when the goods are dispatched. Our Wordpress e-shop has an automatic dispatch notification function.

Investigate the most cost effective and reliable delivery service for your parcels. It could be Royal Mail or private couriers like Collect+, MyHermes etc. You can use courier brokers like Parcels2Go to search for prices. If you are sending large items, you could set up an account with companies like Interlink, DPD, City Link, UPS, and Fedex etc whereby they will collect the parcels from you. 

The receipt of the parcel by the customer is the first bit of real contact they will have with the product, so make sure it’s packaged well and your delivery service is reliable. If the couriers damage or lose the item, although it’s not your fault, your customer will be unlikely to buy anything from you again.


+  Third party platforms

In order to reach more customers when you are starting up, it’s not a bad thing to experiment with selling on Ebay, Amazon or Etsy. They all have pros and cons and you’ll soon see which platform is paying off for your type of product and price range. 

You’ll need to set up accounts on each site and follow their rules and payment mechanisms. Their fees also vary, so remember to check your statements at the end of the month to see whether selling on those platforms are profitable for you.

+  Stock control

As you sell stock, you’ll need to replenish. Keep an eye on stock levels. Your accounts software, if you have one, should be able to generate a stock take sheet and report stock levels by item or supplier. Re-order in regular intervals. Watch your cash flow levels to see how much you can afford to buy. Order more of the popular items, less of the unpopular items. Physically count your stock from time to time (some people do a yearly stock check). It is boring and tedious but has to be done to account for deterioration, loss, theft and so on. Adjust your stock numbers on your website when new stock arrives or when stock is lost, damaged or no longer available (assuming the website adjusts stock when sales are made through it).

I hope you find this guide useful. It’s in no way meant to be comprehensive and the companies or websites mentioned here are in no way recommendations but merely examples of what we have used.

personalfinance,Pay off Mortgage or Invest? Details Inside...,"Struggling with my current situation, currently I am a 23 year old male living in SW VA, Some College (No Degree) focused on web design and development. One 4-year old daughter. Currently an E-4/Cpl, 5 Year Marine Corps Reservist (EAS will be 6 Years Total on July 2014, when I will be getting out.) I will more-then-likely not be a Veteran for federal benefit purposes (No active duty time).

Presently I work full-time providing Variable Data Printing for a marketing materials manufacturer making 10.50 an hour. I've been here for 2-3 years. I make an additional ~4.5k from the Marine Reserves. My mortgage was refinanced in May to a 15-year 3.375% interest rate, and is now a whopping $68,000. It's an FHA Loan with no PMI as of my August payment (which I actually just payed). And I typically pay 70-100 a month extra. The mortgage is my only debt thankfully.

I have 8k in emergency savings, 1800 in my 401k (which is maxed out to the full-employer match of up to 5%), and my daughter has a college fund of ~5-6k of which I'm the sole contributor.

Basically I'm just looking for some advice, should I continue to pay off the mortgage early (I have an additional 100-200 I could put towards the payment), or should I apply any leftover money towards investments? I assume my 401k is fine for now, and would be more interested in looking into Real Estate (I'm decently handy and have contractors/tradesmen for friends), or into stocks. Bonds not so much because I'm a long way off from retirement.

In terms of the next year I worry about exiting the Corps and losing that income (Obviously), but it's time to move on...and I should say I have every desire of retiring early in some fashion.

Sorry if this is a bit jumbled, it's 3am and I've been up all night thinking. I decided to quit one of my favorite hobbies (MMA), to pursue my financial goals at this time. Ideally, I'd like to have my mortgage paid off by 30-32, unless investing is going to be the better option. I'm also considering going back to school next year, I will qualify for 11k in GI Bill benefits so I may as well use them, whether or not I can get grants or acceptable loan interest rates will determine what happens after that 11k runs out. Graduated with honors in high school, joined the Marines and then tried attending college where I didn't do so well which I contribute to having a failing relationship, a young baby, my reserve obligations, and working full-time at a (more stressful) different place of employment; luckily, almost all of those items have changed in my life so hopefully things go better the next go-around.

If you need any more information just let me know, I'm interested in as thorough as an answer as possible on what options I should consider. And if it matters, I'm interested in possibly pursuing a finance degree after I begin college again. Basically, I've been all over and done all kinds of things, but I'm really trying to straighten out this bit of my life; I don't feel my finances are a wreck minus not making enough, but I don't feel I know 100% what I want to do either.",finance,1373010913

DSHI is pleased to report that CEO Tom Bryson and other team members were invited to join the provincial and federal governments on a trade mission to Mexico for the Green Expo held September 26-29 at the World Trade Centre in Mexico City.

The Global Resources Environmental and Energy Network show was well attended by exhibitors and visitors from around the world. A series of key matchmaking sessions were set-up in advance by BMT Global Consulting on behalf of the Canadian Government. The DSHI team were looking to establish key partnering opportunities with manufacturers and distributors of our EnerDynamic products in Mexico and throughout Central America.

Mexico City is committed to renewable energy projects and key infrastructure initiatives are currently being planned. One of the largest and highest visibility projects is the decision to purchase 8,000 Nissan Leaf 100% electric cars to replace the aging taxi fleets that clog the streets and lungs in the countries capital. This initiative is an ideal platform for the introduction of the Lamp Post EV Charge Point technology, and it was met favourably in all of the meetings the company attended.",finance,1372993183

personalfinance,"What credit score gets you the best mortgage rates, and how much can opening a new credit card hurt your score?","My wife and I are hoping to open a couple of new credit cards to take advantage of some fantastic signing bonuses, and plug a couple of holes in our rewards programs, and I was hoping to get an idea of what kind of damage that can do to a credit score, and how much that can affect mortgage rates.  The reason I ask is because in the next year or two, I'm hoping to purchase a house.  I live in Southern California, where home prices are astronomical, so small changes in mortgage interest rates can really add up to big dollars over the lifetime of the loan.

I have a great FICO score (~800), and know what goes into the scores, but have no idea of the magnitude of the effects I am considering.  If opening new credit drops your score by 5-10 points and you get the best rates above 730, then I'm agonizing over nothing, but if it can knock you down by 50 and you need over a 780, for example, then I don't want to touch it.  Does anybody know what's up with this?  Thank you for any input.",finance,1373155180
financialindependence,"Generally speaking, how are you set up?","1. How many savings and chequing accounts do you have? What are their roles?
2. How much do you keep as your buffer in your savings and chequing accounts?
3. How much do you keep in your emergency fund - is it kept in an easily accessed account, or an online banque where it will take at least a few days to get the money?
4. Is your emergency fund lumped in together with your short term fund? If not, where did you allocate the monies? Why did you separate them?


_______________________________________________
My answers:

1. (4) I have a chequing and a savings from the same banque, but I will be canceling the savings because an online banque that I just opened has a much better interest rate. I also have another savings account at a different banque that I put $2k on for only ATM withdrawals - I want to see how many years that will last me (I take out up to $100 a month) 
2. I can't decide on what to keep as my buffer for my chequing account - 1 month extra of expenses?
3. My emergency fund and short term are lumped together; I don't know if but most importantly how I should separate them. Is there even a good reason to separate them?",finance,1373154952
gaming,A conversation that must have gone on at riot pre patch 3.8,"Morello: You know what? Lane nunu just has too much sustain, we really need to alter his kit to make more room for player interaction vs him.

Phreak: I have a great idea! Lets slightly lower the healing on consume, but in turn give it more damage to creeps than smite at lvl 1! Also, lets give nunu buffs that persist through death when he consumes. Think of how much fun it'll be to jungle as nunu!

Morello: phreak, you can't just give a champion an ability that deals more true damage than smite at lvl 1 on a shorter cool down. That would be broken as balls! Listen phreak, I think maybe I'm gonna need to take executive authority on this one and pull you from the project.

Phreak: I can't let you do that morello.

Morello: And why is that?

Phreak: *removes mask* because I am nunu. And I've been plotting for the day I could retake the jungle with a rework. I'm not going to let you do that morello. We've worked too hard for that. The yetis will rise again! Solo queue will forever be sharted on by the yeti king!

Morello: no. This can't be happening. This can't be.... Phreak why are you looking at me like that? Your teeth look sharper all of a sudden. Like a devil preparing his next meal!

Phreak! No! Stop! Nooooooooooo!

*Nunu consumes morello for 590 true damage, morello dies, nunu obtained the buff lead developer. Grants attack speed and persists through death(!)*

Nunu: Now riot is mine! The league of nunu is underway. Arise my yeti brothers! Our time is now! First we nerfed the carry junglers, then we nerfed the super tanks. All of this part of an elaborate scheme to make the yeti king the most broken jungler of all time! Stand aside spider queen. Goodbye flubber. Jesters and cats beware. The yeti king is back! Muhahahahaha. MuHahahahahaha. MuHaHahaha.

*Morello awakes in a cold sweat. His pillow is several shades darker. the room has an eery feeling to it, as if the safety one usually feels in their own home has been contested. Still flustered by the dream, he picks up his cell phone off of the floor and checks for missed calls. The comfort of the outside world at his fingertips calms him momentarily. he decided to give phreak a call to tell him about the dream.

$$ring ring$$ 

Morello: Phreak you're never going to believe the dream I had! We were buffing nunu so hard that consume would make smite look like clarity! Oh it was horrible!

Phreak: where have you been man?! It's been two weeks since anyone's heard from you. We were waiting on your feedback for the nunu rework but since no ones heard from you we just let the first rework go live.

Morello: wait, what? That. That's not possible. Just last night we were discussing the rework.

Phreak: we did everything we could to reach you but there was no word from you at all. We had to hire a new lead developer. Really hairy guy. He has a strange gait as well.

Morello: what? How could this be happening? How could... Wait. How hairy was he?

*A loud shriek is heard in the background*

Random riot employee: my baby! He ate my baby!

Phreak: Morello someone's freaking out I don't know if I can stay on the phone. This whole place has turned into a jungle without you.

Morello: Listen to me very carefully phreak. There is something very very wrong with patch 3.8. And I don't think we're going to be able to fix it by 3.9. Keep a crucifix by you at all times, it'll protect you.

Phreak: Protect me from what?

Morello: Listen to me phreak. The devil is close... And he's wearing white. You need to get out. Get everyone out. Before it's too la....

*The static subsides. The phone clunks loudly, breaking the static lul. All morello can hear is the slow, drawn out breaths of the creature on the line.... Each... Breath... Heavier.... Than..... The last.

Morello: Whatever you are stay away from my family.

Phone man: Goodbye..... Morello. The balance had been broken.

Morello: You'll never get alway with this. They'll ban you in solo queue for the rest of all time.

personalfinance,Financing grad school,"Hi everyone - I'm starting graduate school in the fall and trying to figure out funding ASAP.

I'm searched through the threads here and got information but my head is still spinning a bit.

I expected my grad school costs to come out to roughly $23.5k a year.  The application for a federal direct loan says I can't borrow more than $20.5 a year.  So that's a $3k shortfall.

My wife is urging me to borrow it from my parents, but they're insane and have used money as a weapon in the past (like for example financing my undergraduate education).  They've calmed down a fair but I'm not sure I want to be in debt to them.

I checked out a Graduate PLUS student loan with a graduated payment  plan (since in theory my income will go up to match that...)  A friend discouraged me from doing that, since they start charging interest immediately and I will basically be paying it off forever.

I've seen private loans discussed here - is that the same thing as Sallie Mae?

I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person, but I'm having trouble getting a good perspective on all this.

Other details: decent credit, just finished paying off my undergrad loans, I'm two years away from getting $5k in loan forgiveness for having worked in a high-poverty school for 5 years, so there's that.",finance,1373140668
personalfinance,Advice with a car loan.,"Okay, my husband and I need some advice.  I  currently a 2012 Nissan Versa Sedan S that I purchased back in April 2012.  It was financed for $15195 with 5.74% (it was co-signed with my dad who has less than ideal credit).  There is nothing wrong with the car itself.  It gets 36-38 mpg.  My only complaint is I opted for the cheapest I could get (which obviously wants that cheap) with manual locks, windows, everything.  What I didn't realize at the time was that I was pregnant.  Otherwise, I probably would have shopped around more.  I freely admit, I rushed into the decision to purchase my car because my Chevy malibu was breaking down repeatedy and I had dumped money and effort into it.  Anyway, the car is very small, especially the back seat.  I have to push teh front seat up as far as possible in order to fit a car seat and I know we will be adding a new car seat within the next 18 months - 2 years.  I was looking at a Nissan Altima 2.5 S (2013).  We have a friend who is the sales manager and he's offering a loan of $18975 for the car (the MSRP is $23,000+).  The interest rate is 1.9%.  When we look at the long term here is how it breaks down:

Versa -- 72 months @ $250.50 with 5.74% interest.  A total interest over 6 years of $2800

Altima - 72 months @ $284 with 1.9% interest.  A total interest over 6 years of $1117

We have both recognized we will get another car to accomodate another car seat as there is simply so much hassle with the car seats and locks and whatnot.  We are more than comfortable financially and have limited debt other than a few credit cards.  I guess I'm just looking for advice on whether this sounds like a good deal.  We don't want to rush into a decision like I did last time.  Any advice is welcome!  Thanks!  Also is $18975 a good price for a brand new Nissan?

personalfinance,College student on well-paid co-op with no idea what to do with the money,"Hi personalfinance!

I'm a 21 year old college student studying computer science, currently on co-op for the summer, doing a separate co-op in the fall.  I've got one semester of college remaining before I graduate, when I expect to have a pretty well paid full time job, assuming I don't screw up at the co-ops.  My issue is that I've gotten NO financial education from my parents and despite trying to learn on my own I'm not sure what to do.

Part of the reason my parents didn't teach me about finances is that they were/are pretty irresponsible with their own.  This led to my mother deciding to not fill out the FAFSA because she thought we wouldn't get any aid.  She's been paying for my college tuition out of pocket and savings, and while I am incredibly greatful, I think she's screwing herself over and we're not even getting the grants we should be getting.  The last two years I got it submitted and we took some grants but no loans, so I will be graduating a very expensive university with no student loan debt.

Meanwhile, my CS co-ops are very well paid.  The summer one will pay about $20,100 before taxes and the fall will be about $21,000 before taxes.  The first is in Washington so I'm paying federal taxes and taxes for my home state (NY) and the second is in California so I believe I'll be paying federal, CA, and NY taxes, but I expect to get a lot back come April.

I would like some advice on what to with the money I""m making.  I have to pay for my own rent and food, and I want to spend a little on entertainment, but I also want to do something responsible with the rest.  Currently I'm just taking $1000 per month for food, rent, and other expenses and putting the rest into my savings account.

I am 24 years old and have a stable job. This is my current financial breakdown:

58k Annual Income
12% contribution to Sep IRA (I don't pay a penny of this, my employer pays all of it)
30k invested in growth income fund (started in 2011)
50k in savings

Currently I am paying roughly 1.5k a month towards rent, utilities, insurance, and general spending (food, etc).

I am looking at purchasing a home right at 100k with 20% down and at 3.5% 15 year note. I have been working with my realtor for months now trying to find a home, so I am not just jumping into this nilly willy. Homes I am looking at are move in ready(ish) in desirable neighborhoods. I've done the math and this should knock off about 350 dollars from the 1.5k that I was paying.

Edit: Seems I am getting alot advice about not pursing purchasing a home. A little bit of more information. Average rent costs in my area is about 850 per month w/ application fees and deposits that equate to almost a month's worth of rent. I am looking at a 15 year mortgage at right around 500 per month. I am also looking at homes that are below market price mainly because I am looking at foreclose/short sale/motivated seller. And yes I plan to get a home inspector to inspect every inch of the place. And yes I don't bother pursing a home if it needs a considerable amount of work done on it. And yes I know sometimes you can't see what is wrong with the home, like mold and such. In which I would just walk away if the home inspector finds anything huge. Goal is to sell the home after 2 years for a profit of at least 10k. So unforeseen maintenance costs would not necessary be an issue because I am not staying long enough for it to become one. 

Now lets say worst case I sell the home at price, I still save over 8000 dollars worth from 2 years of rent alone. Yes there are property taxes, insurance, and closing costs to consider. But still from the amount I would receive back after the sell, it would outweigh the costs of paying rent every month.

So my main question is, assuming I get the home with the interest rate that currently stands today with a 15 year note, and based on my current savings, what should be my next course of action? 

Should I: 

Start a roth IRA on top of the SEP IRA my employer provides?
Contribute more to my growth and income fund?
Start a new mutual fund all together?
Hoard money and look to purchase a new property while renting out the 100k home i plan to purchase soon?

personalfinance,Need some help figuring out a direction.,"Here is my situation.  Not in bad shape but definitely don't feel like I am ahead of the game.  

Married.  I am 35, wife is 32.  Combined income of approximately $90k - I am an attorney and she is a teacher.  Currently both state employees who would be eligible for full retirement after 25 years, vest after 10 years.  I currently have 6 years in and she has 9.  If we stayed for the 25 years we would get about $6k a month combined in state retirement benefits immediately upon retirement (age doesn't matter - only years of service).  according to our last statements we have $34k balance ($18k for me and $16k for her) in the state retirement account.  She will definitely stay at least 25 years.  I don't know that i will stay with the state - i would vest after 10 years but don't know if i will stay long enough to vest.  

Currently have $25k in my Roth which I contribute $6k a year to.  Currently have most of it in the Vanguard 500 index fund and the rest in an individual stock that I bought a while back b/c it had a high dividend yield.  that one hasn't worked out so great so far.  thinking of probably moving all of it into a 2040 target retirement fund.

We have a house that we owe $112k on an interest only mortgage on.  Interest rate is 3.1% and the payment is about $425 a month.  Value of the house is probably around $118k.  The original mortgage was an 80/20 that we got in 2007 for $140k and we payed off the 20% portion.  The interest rate adjusts every April but it will stay interest only forever.  

We have one car note.  $6k at 3.25%.  Monthly payment is $272.  we have another car that is 10 years old and no note. it will probably need to be replaced in the next couple of years.

I have student loans totaling $42k consolidated at 2.6%.  the monthly payment is only $176.  graduated repayment plan that will go up incrementally every few years. 

no other debt.  We have $6k in savings.  

we have an 8 year old and a 5 year old and currently nothing set aside for college.  we would like to move into a bigger house in the next year or so.  we also expect that our combined income will go up approximately $20k in the next year or so.

I don't like having a car note - should I focus on paying it off?  we only pay a couple hundred dollars interest a year on it so it might not be worth diverting money from other places.

should we be doing a Roth for my wife as well?  She will start collecting about $2k a month for life at the age of 48.  How should we figure those benefits into our retirement calculations?

college savings?  house savings?  

i just feel like i have no real direction other than putting $500 in the Roth every month.  I try to put as much into savings as I can every month and some months can put as much as $2k in there but then life happens (car repairs, house repairs, ect.) and money gets spent elsewhere.  

we aren't super frugal (we eat out more than we should - fast food mostly) and spend more than we should but we also have cheap prepaid cell phones and just recently cancelled Directv.  other than eating out and an annual vacation our living expenses are pretty low.  we have taken trips the last few years that were several thousand dollars a year that ate up big portions of prospective savings.  this year we will not be spending nearly as much on travel.

*edit to add that for the last two years we having been paying cash for my wife to get her masters.  it totaled about $12k which also diverted from money to set aside for savings.",finance,1373081987
personalfinance,"It's 3 years off, but definitely doesn't feel too early to start thinking about now. Is it better overall to pay off a huge student debt, or use IBR to wipe it after 25 years?","So, here's my situation.  Due to poor choices and the innate high cost of pharmacy school (unfortunately attending a public one was not an option) I will be graduating in three years with an estimated $250k in debt.  Ouch!  The good news is, based on current hiring trends and pay in my company and in my area in general, I can expect to pull a solid $130k/year right off.  Based entirely on talking to other pharmacists with my company and others, I can expect my salary to just barely keep pace with inflation but otherwise to stay fairly constant throughout my career barring any large unforeseeable changes.

So, what to do about that enormous student debt?  According to [the payment calculator on finaid.org](http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpayments.phtml), I can expect it to cost me about $2900 per month to clear everything in 10 years.  I will graduate at the age of 30, so given my expected take-home pay of ~$6800 per month (again, this number comes from talking to other pharmacists making the same amount and working the same hours I will be, so it should be pretty solid) I will still have $3900/month to live on, which is not bad at all.  In the end I'll have paid a total of $345k back, so about $95k in interest.  That sucks, but it could be worse.

On the other hand, I don't want to spend my entire 30s (yeah, I got a late start and will graduate at the age of 30) and the formative years of my kids' lives (yeah, that's already done as well...I told you I made some poor decisions; not that having kids was a bad choice because I love it, but the timing was terrible) living on a restricted budget.  I don't intend to live extravagantly, but I'd be willing to sacrifice a bit to have a nice chunk of land for my kids to play on.  

Enter IBR.  According to [this calculator](http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-based/calculator) I would only have to pay about $1300 per month (down to as little as $1100 if I have two more kids) on my loans for 25 years, and after that they would simply disappear.  That's $390k total, so a bit more than just paying it all off.  I have some questions though.

Does the fact that inflation will still be happening devalue the amount owed enough to make that extra $45k total payed meaningless when it's stretched out over 15 years?  Assuming I use half of the $1500/month I save by doing IBR to invest (by maxing my 401k, maxing an IRA, or whatever would be the best use of $9k/year) it seems like this could be the superior choice, but on the other hand I will be out that $1300/month for an extra 15 years.

I really don't know at all enough to make an educated choice here, which is why I've already started seriously thinking about it a few years before the situation arises.  Does anyone have some insight or advice for me?

SHANGHAI — China has taken another step toward loosening its capital controls and making its currency more freely convertible by approving the creation of a new kind of free trade zone here.

China’s State Council, or cabinet, said it was establishing a pilot zone in Shanghai to test some of the government’s financial overhauls, including interest rate liberalization and full convertibility of China’s currency, the renminbi, according to reports Thursday in the state-run news media.

Analysts say the free trade zone will not just promote interest rate liberalization and currency convertibility but will also allow “financial product innovation” and the raising of money abroad or investment in foreign stocks by corporations.

Since taking office this year, Prime Minister Li Keqiang has been promising bold changes aimed at overhauling the economy and improving the nation’s global competitiveness.

In May, a State Council meeting presided over by Mr. Li said that by the end of the year the government would outline a plan for full convertibility of the renminbi and make it easier for Chinese individuals to invest. Still, many analysts say they believe that China’s currency will not be fully convertible until 2015 to 2018.

“The State Council expects this experiment as an essential step towards upgrading China’s economy,” Qu Hongbin, an economist at HSBC in Hong Kong, said in a report on Thursday. “It also expects the pilot’s eventual national rollout.”

It is unclear exactly how the free trade zone would operate, but businesses and traders in the zone would probably be more free to import and export goods without customs approvals, and to convert foreign currency into renminbi more freely.

The approval of the free trade zone is a lift for Shanghai, which in 2009 won State Council approval to become a financial center to compete better with Hong Kong, London, New York and Tokyo.

Although China has the world’s second-largest economy, after that of the United States, the government maintains strict controls over capital flows and cross-border investments. It also has tight control over interest rates.

The government does that, in part, to guard against perceived threats from international currency speculators and to prevent huge inflows or outflows of money from rocking the banking sector and the economy.

But the government is moving ahead with plans to integrate with the global economy more fully by loosening controls over interest rates and cross-border trade and investment deals.

Analysts say loosening of those controls could strengthen the financial system and make it more efficient.

personalfinance,Do I put all my extra income to student loan debt or put a little in a Roth IRA too?,"My dream is to be debt free. Oh what a dream.

I realize this likely won't become reality for quite some time.

I'm in my late-20s and bring in about $2100 net a month.

I moved out of a $800 apartment (not including utilities) and am now renting a room for $450 with everything included. This has probably been the best thing I've done financially, but fuck I hate having roommates.

I have about $1,500 in credit card debt, but it's at 0% interest for 15 more months so I just pay $100 every month.

For the most part I live frugally. My other monthly expenses are groceries and gas. Thankfully, I don't drink coffee, smoke and hardly drink alcohol.

So with all my expenses at the end of the month, I have about $850 left over.

Now for the fun part. Student motherfucking loans.

I have about $58,000 in student loan debt.

Around $28,000 of it is private Wells Fargo Student Loans. This is what I'd like to pay off first.

Here is the interest rate breakdown:

1) $5,524.99 @ 9.74% variable

2) $13,440.74 @ 7.24% variable

3) $9,105.40 @ 2.75% variable

The other $30,000 is Federal Student Loans with the interest rates around 6%.

The good news is, I currently have $10,000 saved up in a Barclay's savings account as an emergency fund. And I recently opened a Roth IRA with Fidelity but I haven't actually bought anything, I just have $50 sittings in there to keep the account open.

Now should I just be putting all my money left over at the end of the month to my private student loans? Or should I take $2500 out of my savings account and buy a nice mutual fund and then put $100 towards it every month and put the rest towards the private loan?

personalfinance,My Bank said I am eligible for a mortgage modification. How to I prepare myself before talking to them? (California),"I got a shitty loan from World Savings in 2007. It was a pick a payment adjustable interest rate payment plan. I know this was a shitty loan and a very bad invsestment now, but at the time I was a 20 year old and my loan agent aggressively shoved it down my throat. My original loan amount was 170k and my payments were about 700 a month. The terms of the loan were not completely described to me and I ended up with a negative amortization loan. This is 100% my fault, I'm not blaming anyone for my mistake, I should have done more research before I signed the papers. So I started making my minimum payments for a few years and my loan blew up to 200k. I've basically been paying rent to live in this house. I was late on a payment recently and the mortgage specialist in the office and she told me I was eligible for a modification and would be contacting me soon. 

My questions for you are:

What kind of documentation do I need? I know proof of income, but do I also need bank statements? Do I need to list out my expenses? 

Is there going to be an appraisal? I need to put another layer of shingles on my roof and have a sink that doesn't work. Do I need to fix this right away? I also have a dead tree in my yard that might pose a problem if it falls. I was going to fix this anyways, but if they are going to come to my house, I don't want anything possible to reduce my chances.

I am currently unemployed. I get 1800 a month for unemployment, and i get 725 a month from an inheritance. I have a job offer for work in August. Do I need to try to postpone this until I have work? I have about 2k in savings and 8k in a traditional ira. My next job's income will be around 3500 a month + the 725 inheritance. I have 3 paid for cars valued at about 25k between them all. I have a half acre parcel next door that I own outright. These income numbers are all Gross.

From what the mortgage specialist said, my house is worth around 106k according to the data on their computer. I'm not sure what the interest rate would be knocked down to, but I'm at 8% right now. I really really like this house and don't want to short sale it, so this modification is very appealing to me.

Do I need to seek legal advice? If so what sort of lawyer should I go to?

I'd like to hear from anyone that has had experience with Wells Fargo loan modification. This is a great deal to me and I want to do anything I can to keep it as smooth as possible. Thank you in advanced personal finance!",finance,1373072793
personalfinance,I need help with my student loans.,"Most of my loans ($78,000) are private. I'm about to graduate and I received a letter in the mail stating that my monthly payment would be around $750. I'm already having trouble making payments of $200 a month.

Is consolidating my loans a good idea and will it lower my monthly payments? I'll be using federal loans for grad school. If I don't get into grad school then I will of course get a job, but $750 is still fairly steep.

I was also wondering if I could get a federal loan to wipe out the private loans and then do something like the peace corps which would forgive 70% of the federal loans. Would I be able to do something like that?

My dad hasn't found a job, either, and my mom has been lucky to hold hers.

personalfinance,"College grad w/ high student loans and no job. A bit long, but would appreciate advice or insight, please.","**Background:** 

Went to college, got a degree in Fine Art that I think is relatively useless, especially now that I'm realizing digital art was probably the better way to go. All the jobs I see related to art somewhat nearby (and there don't seem to be many of them...) all want years of experience and knowledge of a bunch of different programs. I feel out of my league since I do not have this experience. My degree focused on traditional art, the only digital program I know pretty well is Photoshop (self-taught through tutorials and such), but I feel like even these skills are still seriously lacking compared to what someone who's degree specialized in digital art would have. 

After school, I messed up big time moving away from home to be with an ex. That lead nowhere except wasting time with absolutely nothing to show for it. After that, I moved back home and have been looking for a job here ever since (about the past year and a half). 

Unfortunately there are not really many job opportunities in my town, and I cannot find a place willing to hire me in my field or otherwise (I've tried grocery stores, retail, restaurants, etc.) I suspect this is because of the general economy, the area, my ruined/no credit, and lack of much work experience. 

I'm living with my parents at the moment so I do not have any expenses besides my student loan debt (which I am not paying because of no job). I feel like an asshole not being able to contribute to my family with rent/food/bill money, but I realize I am very lucky that they are able to support me during this sucky time right now.  

Up until recently I had not been earning any income whatsoever, but a few months ago I discovered MTurk. I think it has been mentioned here before and it might not be seen as a great solution, but it has given me a glimmer of hope. I've managed to make about $1,000 so far in the little while that I have been doing it (since around April), and I'm trying to save up for a car to even get to a job. My town does not have much in the way of public transportation, so it would be really hard to get to a lot of jobs without my own transportation. But I am still months away from having enough money to buy one...

I'm also severely depressed because of this whole mess, do not have any friends in my area since moving back home. My SO is the only thing that keeps me going sometimes and he lives thousands of miles away. I feel like a giant loser and don't know how to change my situation. I try looking for jobs as much as I can, then when I do not hear anything back I start feeling hopeless and that things will always be this way. I start questioning what is wrong with me that I can't even get a little job working at a froyo place down the street. :( Not to mention the fact that I do not even feel creative or inspired anymore, and haven't worked on anything art related in quite some time.

**Debt:**

Never had any credit cards, so all my debt is from student loans, a mix of federal and private. I've never been able to make payments on them so a lot are now in default with collection agencies:

1. Wells Fargo - $6,950 is now $8,245 @ 4.25%

2. Discover - $8,950 is now $10,515 @ 11% (variable)

3. Stafford - $13,890 is now $18,200 @ 6.8% and 6.0%

4. Stafford - $7,630 is now $10,765 @ 6.8% and 5.6%

5. Perkins - $1,500 @ 5.0%

With my mom's help I was able to settle another loan I had, but none of these remaining loans seem to want to work with me in that regard. **Are there any tips to getting student loans settled? Is settlement the best option for me? Should I put everything I make towards a car so I could get to a real job if I find one? Or do I use my tiny MTurk income (about $400/month) to make a small payment on these loans each month?** 

As far as I know my credit report is already messed up because of all this debt and the one previous settlement, so I don't see how it could get any worse. And if I'm going to owe anyone money I'd rather it be a lesser, more manageable amount to my mom than to some company who will just keep adding on interest and fees forever.

This is pretty much a giant life/financial rant, sorry about that. But needed to spill and was just wondering if anyone has any bits of advice about the best way to move forward with my situation. Obviously the best case would be to find a job, which I am working on, but until that happens **just curious if I'm focusing on the right things or what I could do differently or even encouraging words**.

personalfinance,Savings or Student Loans?,"I have approximately $40,000 in student loans, with a 6.8% interest rate. I have $40,000 in a savings account earning under 1% interested. Certainly I could put my money in an account that would get a higher return, but for simplicity's sake, let's compare two alternatives.

While interest payments are tax deductible, my understanding is that the 6.8% interest will ultimately be far more than the 1% interest I'm earning.

I'm thinking about paying off the loans with the savings and wanted to make sure my thinking made sense.

Edit: thanks for all the replies. I should have specified that I have savings beyond the $40k. I have the standard 6 months saved up, and this is additional savings. I don't think I'll be able to get better than 6.8% interest in any kind of savings account.",finance,1373299886

Please stop the sale of my young daughter's only memories of her grandfather. 

Dear Family and friends of my father, Peter and grandfather, Carl (who my daughter Caitlyn is named for): 

This is the most difficult letter I have ever written. I’m asking—desperately pleading—for your help to save a part of all of us that is about to be lost forever.

I have never come to any of you before with a request of this kind and if I didn’t think it would impact all of us, I would not now.

The story:

When I was divorced in 2006, nearly everything personal item I owned or was custodian to, was moved into storage. This includes everything my father had shared with my only young daughter. Also moved to my home were many items from my grandfather, Carl including but not limited to the slides from his trip around the world, artwork, videos of the family and more.

This property was entangled in a long and complex litigation involving my ex-wife and past company in both state and federal civil court.

All litigation has now resolved and ALL property has been permanently and irrevocably released back to me. 

Unfortunately, during the pendency of this litigation AND BEYOND MY CONTROL, the storage company (PODS of CT) accrued storage cost (without informing me, the Court or the Federal Trustee, Ronald Chorches) of approximately $20,000.

While my intention is to liquidate ALL non-personal, unneeded items IMMEDIATELY upon recovery in order to pay this cost, I do not have the cash to halt the auction of ALL stored property NEXT TUESDAY, JULY 9th.

I am asking—pleading—with you today because my I believe my father touched each of you in a special way and, after exhausting ALL other options and at this last moment, this is the only way I can possibly save a piece of him. My only daughter, Caitlyn, is the last Strauss. She knew her grandfather for 1 years before his death. While she talks about him almost daily, everything he gave her and our family is locked in these containers and is going to be auctioned THIS COMING TUESDAY, JULY 9th.

I realize I have been very lucky to have what I have in my life. I also realize that all of us have lived through and experienced desperate tragedies of our own. I am saddened and moved by those thoughts everyday.

personalfinance,I've taken the updated Personal Finance Tracker and tweaked it for myself... now what?,"I have never been good with money and found myself as an 18 year old with a lot of credit card debt and no way to repay it. I was making minimum payments (and missed very few) to keep creditors away, but that was about it.

Fast forward almost 10 years, and this year I decided to take control. I was tired of trying to remember if I had paid my credit card bill and wondering why I only had $20 in my bank account at the end of the month when I brought home over $2k that month (very few bills other than credit). 

So, I used my tax return and paid off almost all of my credit cards. The one with the largest balance that I couldn't pay off, I balance transferred to a card with an interest rate 70% less than what I had been paying for the past 8 years. I'm keeping my old cards open for credit score purposes and using one every couple of months for a small purchase to keep it active. I refinanced my car loan for a much lower rate, and I still find myself some months wondering what the hell did I buy? 

I decided to give the budget a try. I've never done it, so I dove headfirst into it this week and I'm actually really excited. Not so much for the bottom line (the bottom line is, I'm still in crazy debt, thank you car loan), but I have allocated my spending to certain categories (much of my money goes to ""misc"" purchases, which is all materialistic and not needed by any means). 

My question isn't about my budget and what to do with it - I'm fairly confident that I've got a good, solid budget down (and I will tweak for the next few months to get it right), but has anybody else taken the budget workbook from the sidebar and made any tweaks? If so, what were they and how did you calculate them? I'm an Excel n00b so I've done what I can with the calculations I can figure out. 

So far I've incorporated a running debt calculator, where I can see how much I have left on my car loan, outstanding credit card and my savings account balances to see a visual all in one place. I have a calculation running that shows if I stay under budget, how much more money I can put into my savings at the end of the month. I've color coded my transactions based on if they're ""misc"", ""monthly recurring"" or ""necessities"" (being groceries, gas, etc). 

Has anybody else taken this spreadsheet and done anything really cool with it to get a better idea of where your money is going? I plan on trying to figure out how to make some nice graphs to display the data I want... I took the original graphs out and have now decided they might be beneficial. I do much better when I can see graphics and drawings.",finance,1373292062

business,Newport International Group: Europe needs emerging markets to lead the recovery,"newport international group press release code 34935207158 inflation warning, Europe needs emerging markets to lead the recovery

http://www.thecorner.eu/world-economy/europe-needs-emerging-markets-to-lead-the-recovery/27570/

The foreign sector is the pillar of the recovery in developed countries. High levels of indebtedness – in some countries of the public sector, in others of the private sector and of both in many countries – limit domestic demand’s capacity to grow. The foreign sector has therefore become the driving force of the recovery. Given this situation, it comes as no surprise that, for many countries, improving competitiveness has gone from a priority to an urgent need.

Emerging markets hold the key to the recovery. In this respect, the first quarter growth figures, in general worse than expected, have raised certain fears of activity slowing down. Brazil is finding it difficult to return to the levels of growth displayed before the crisis. Moreover, high inflationary pressures have forced its central bank to raise the official interest rate by 50 basis points. Mexico’s GDP figures for the first quarter were also disappointing and some countries in Eastern Asia, such as Korea and Taiwan, are losing competitiveness due to the appreciation of their currencies against the Japanese yen.

The wide room for economic policy in emerging countries is cause for confidence.The fact that international energy prices have remained contained means that, in most countries, inflationary pressures are relatively under control and that, consequently, there is even more room to implement expansionary monetary policies. In fact, in those countries with the lowest rate of activity, such as India, Turkey and Korea, the official interest rate has been cut in the last few weeks. Another encouraging sign is the drive with which some notable countries are undertaking their agenda of structural reforms. In this respect, Mexico is exemplary. After approving labour, education and telecommunications reforms, at the beginning of May the guidelines were presented for banking reforms whose main aim is to boost private credit.

It is the euro area that is most dependent on exports. That is why the EC has once again started to discuss the urgent need to carry out an ambitious agenda of structural reforms. Their implementation will help to speed up the adjustments still pending, especially in the periphery countries. For Spain, the list of recommendations is long and includes a review of labour reform, energy reform, tax system reform and public administration reform, accompanied by a strict schedule. Italy’s extensive black economy is still a source of concern, as well as its relatively inefficient judicial system. However, the EC has also set homework for the core countries. Germany must start up measures to stimulate domestic demand as its current account surplus, standing at 6.9% of GDP, does not look like correcting itself, while the area of concern for France is its economy’s long-term growth capacity. In this respect, making its labour market more flexible is seen as one of the key factors in turning this situation around.

Japan is also being supported, for the time being, by its export industry. The revolution carried out by Japan’s new Prime Minister, Shimzo Abe, which is now known as Abenomics, is based on three pillars: monetary expansion, more public expenditure and structural reforms. The effects of the asset purchases carried out by the Bank of Japan are already being felt. The sharp devaluation of the yen has boosted exports which grew by 3.8% in quarter-on-quarter terms in the first quarter. However, growth in domestic demand is likely to consolidate as public spending increases and particularly as the agenda of structural reforms is implemented.

The economy’s growth is more balanced in the USA although the adjustment in its public accounts has yet to consolidate. Nevertheless, this can be carried out while preserving a similar rate of growth to the last few quarters as the deleveraging of households and companies is now quite advanced, allowing consumption and investment to gradually take over. The solidity that seems to be offered by the US economy’s growth prospects has revived debate regarding the direction monetary policy should take. Some members of the Fed have expressed their desire to speed up the process of withdrawing monetary stimuli. It is important not to reduce these too quickly as the pace of economic activity has yet to consolidate but, if the macroeconomic figures improve, it might be advisable to reduce the rate of asset purchases. Striking the balance will by no means be an easy task, so the debate that has been started is unlikely to end, leading to some volatility in the markets from time to time.

gaming,"Seriously, what is wrong with mac gaming??? (Please read before you down-vote)","Okay, this is a rant thing because I'm fed up with windows fan-boys down-voting neutral posts about mac's that have nothing to do with them.

I have a mac, I game with it, my windows is broken, because the hardware is messed up, that I've replaced every single thing in the damn thing, and it still won't boot(Not the point, but there is already one thing mac has over windows, hardware is always reliable), so of course I can't actually play it.

People who say macs are bad for gaming, you've never owned a mac, you don't know what you're saying, they may not be as good as windows computers, but they are not bad, they are actually quite reliable machines.

Oh, your windows can run more games than a Mac, and/or there are more games available because of your operating system alone? That's cool, we have boot-camp to run windows, porting tools to run your games on Mac OS X, virtual windows applications that run Windows while still on OS X.

So really, mac's are just as good as PC's, they have nice hardware, look nice, but you might say, ""Oh but you have a shitty touchpad and keyboard"" If you buy a gaming laptop do you really play with that things keyboard and touchpad? No! If you buy a tower, do you just deal with having it's default nothing? No! You just plug in a mouse, or a keyboard, or an Audio system, or whatever you need to get you going.

So from now on, if you see someone talking about macs for gaming, don't call them a noob, they're still probably playing the same games as! Don't call mac bad, because they are probably almost as good if not better than your average middle-rank gaming PC, especially the newer macs.

But like I said, some windows are better than macs, I get that, but that doesn't necessarily mean that a mac is bad.

Rant = Over

(Reuters) - Euro zone unemployment is at a record high and consumer prices are being driven upward by volatile energy and food prices, data showed on Monday, underlining the fragility of the bloc's economic health.

Inflation in the 17-nation euro zone, which is suffering from its longest ever recession, increased to 1.6 percent year-on-year in June from 1.4 percent in May, the EU's statistics office Eurostat said.

Joblessness in the bloc stood at a record 12.1 percent in May, with the number of people out of work rising further above 19 million, Eurostat added.

Government austerity programs across the continent have helped fuel the economic hardship and provoked widespread public discontent, especially with more than half of young people unemployed in Greece and Spain.

June's inflation reading was the second upward move from a three-year low of 1.2 percent in April, although it remains beneath the European Central Bank's target of just under 2 percent.

Economists expect inflation to remain below the target for the rest of this year, giving the ECB scope to leave interest rates at a record low, although signs of improvement at European factories may stop the bank from cutting rates again.

""June's rise was driven rather by unfavorable base effects and the ECB has flagged the possibility of short-term inflation volatility,"" said Nick Matthews, a senior European economist at Nomura. ""We expect inflation to drop sharply again in summer.""

Prices of food, alcohol and tobacco products were the key factor driving inflation in June, followed by energy and services, Eurostat said in its first estimate for the month.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was stable at 1.2 percent, and did not appear to sustain an upward trend, economists said.

The ECB said last week it will keep its accommodative monetary policy stance to help a gradual economic recovery that is expected to start in the second half of this year.

""The low inflation rate will permit the ECB to leave interest rates at very low levels for a long time,"" said Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank, who expects the bank to start increasing rates at the end of next year.

After looking through my parents tax forms it seems that their adjusted income is $55K, which wipes out Pell Grants. I am a couple thousand short on loans for school. We've paid $107 every month out of pocket for tuition but I now have to pay it myself because my mother is unemployed. We don't really make hardly anything. I'm the only one in the house freaking out and trying to get their bills in order. 


So here's the question - I work but don't make enough to cover tuition, books, and the ridiculous amount of gas I use driving ~300 miles a week for school (I live 25 miles away, give or take detours and work). I make maybe $500 a month because a shitty retail job is all I have. I was looking into selling my plasma.

I also pay $97 a month in car insurance. 2 accidents in history, neither was that bad. It was $90 before I renewed, too. 

So, since I'm under water, should I risk going past my federal loans for a private one? Is it a good idea to get a small private loan for $3K to get me through to 2014 (graduation) and where would I get it?

personalfinance,I am looking to buy a condo and would like to be certain my finances are in order. I would love to hear PFs opinions about all of it to ease my mind or scare me straight.,"Wall of Text... apologies

Income: I am 28 and earn 63K/year (plus 3K bonus). I have been working almost 18 months, but prior to that I was unemployed for a very long time. I contribute 12% to 401K plus a 3% match. I plan on maxing out a Roth IRA this year, and in all honesty I should have done that last year. I consistently work 10-12 hours (plays a role in the standard of living considerations). My take home is about $3100/month.

Debt: None, gracious parents paid for college, and I bought my car with cash (it isn't much of one). I never carry a CC balance.

Assets: I have about 12K in retirement and will be closer to 15k once  fully vested. I have almost 45K in taxable mutual funds which has been accumulated to cover the 20% down payment of my future home (also emergency funds). I was only able to do this because I live rent free (will explain). 

Current Home: I live in a house rent-free that is for sale by owner (basically a house-sitter). As soon as it is sold I will be forced to move out. I can not Really move in, because I have no stake to the house and may need to move out at a moments notice. Also, the water has an issue that makes it unusable to shower in, drink, cook with, etc. Also, this is 40 mins away from work. 

Credit Rating: about 706 according to CK. It is perfect except for quite a few hard credit inquiries, and it is a little short (lack of history).

Future Home: I am looking at buying a condo. I am fairly handy and do not fear owning at all. Also I feel as though, because I got such a late start I should skip past renting as soon as possible. It is a highrise loft that is a 5 min walk from work and a 2 min walk to the grocery store. The loft has a good reputation (HOA doesn't have a shady record). They are asking 180K, so I will use that in calculations to be on the safe side. So, 36 of my 45K would be for a down payment. I am expecting 4.25% interest rate for 15 years. The payments would be $1085, plus HOA fees of $240 (includes insurance, sewer, water, trash, and internet), and taxes of about $160. I expect savings in gas, food (will be able to cook more!), and an improved quality of living, but I do not see much point in estimating those savings for a budget.

Concerns: I started retirement very late, so my retirement balance is very low. I am also concerned that this purchase might be cutting into my emergency funds. Closing costs are sort of confounding me, so the amount that my emergency funds will be cut to is a bit of an unknown.

personalfinance,Separation from employer; roll-over/transfer TSP?,"Hey PF.  Within the last year I've separated from my employer, the federal government.  I have a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account, similar to a 401K for federal employees, that I am allowed to keep for life.  Only thing is I cannot contribute to it since I'm no longer receiving a paycheck from them.  My question is if I should keep the funds in the TSP or roll then over/transfer to an IRA I have with Fidelity?  I'm leaning towards keeping them in the TSP for 2 reasons: 1) I am still very young (early 20s) and may end up working for the federal government again, and 2) I've heard the expense ratios are low in the TSP.

EDIT: The school costs 46k so I'm borrowing 22k a year, my parents make around 100k a year and have offered to help pay the debt, but I want to be as independent from them as possible.


Edit 2: after asking my parents some questions they told me that they plan to sell off my late grandfathers house and split the money with my 3 uncles and use that to get out of debt once they are out they plan to save as much as possible for helping with my future.  My father told me he thinks my debt problem will be difficult but not impossible I just shouldn't expect to own like a new car or new house.

I'm now working on setting up a spreadsheet to help me always understand where every cent I earn through work is going.  To do this I need to have a few questions regarding taxes answered.

* How does federal income tax work?  My salary is $50,000, placing me in the 25% bracket.  After reading three articles and playing with a handful of different calculators, I'm still clueless on what that means.  Some calculators were reporting that federal would withhold 17%, some said 15% some said 19%.  What the hell kind of black magic is this?

* Additional withholding - wtf is it?  Every calculator I go to asks about additional withholding or extra withholding..or whatever.  I have no clue what it means. 

* What are federal allowances?  No idea there...

* Back to federal income tax, is this a static or dynamic value?  If it's dynamic, what causes it to change?  I'm single with zero children.  I do, however, feed the rodents that live under my floor.  Can I deduct the rodents?

I'm particularly fond of [ADP's Salary Calculator](http://www.adp.com/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-tools/payroll-calculators/salary-paycheck-calculator.aspx) because I feel it's been the most accurate so far.

* Is this sub a good place to ask for advice regarding investing options?  The company I work for has a 401k situation through fidelity and there are several large words I don't quite understand.  I've managed to lock down the gist of the whole thing, but I would love to know what my options are regarding investing - it's something I'd like to do now, if my budget allows it.  Also, don't tell me to read *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*, I'm going to the library sometime this week to get it.

personalfinance,"Making smart and sustainable choices in the shadow of a $134,000 debt burden","Hi everyone! Brief summary: 23 year old living in NYC, recent grad, making ~46k/yr, huge student loan debt (134k), trying to save money and make intelligent decisions in the months before I need to begin paying off my loans. I'm new to having a salaried position and new to fiscal responsibility, so I was hoping to run my plan by you all and get some feedback.

Longer version: I make 43,000 a year at my day job and about 3600 hostessing on the weekends. After taxes and insurance I take home 2800 a month. Rent is 615/mo, rounded up to 700 after utilities, Internet, phone, etc. I'm paying my parents 100 a month, for the next few months, after they laid out my security deposit. Transportation is 112/mo for a metrocard, rounded to 150 with a couple cab rides a month. I have 3000 saved (and 1500 in savings bonds, which I'd like to stay away from), no credit card debt, and a staggering 134,000 in student loans. 18,000 of that is a private loan and the rest is federal. I graduated grad school in May so the loans come out of deferral in December, and I would like to use this time as efficiently as possible.

I'm a social worker and my federal loans qualify for public student loan forgiveness in 10 years. With that and income based repayment, I'm not terribly worried about these loans right now (or rather they're so big it's hard to conceive of making a dent in them any time soon). The private loan, however, I'd like to knock out as soon as I can.

Here's my current plan: my rent, utilities, phone, transportation, etc. total 1000 a month. I'm paid 1250 twice a month from my day job and immediately deposit 500 into a ""savings and loans"" saving account. Another 500 goes into a ""monthly expenses"" account (rent, transportation). The last 250 goes into an ""allowance"" checking account, which is for groceries and personal expenses. So 1000 is saved for emergency fund and loans every month, 1000 goes toward regular expenses, and 500 is for food and whatever I want (and when it's gone, it's gone). The 300/mo from hostessing will either go towards loans or just savings. Anything left over from allowance at the end of the month will go into savings. At this rate I'll have 8000 by the end of November and can throw like 5000 at the private loan, which will make a nice dent.

Thoughts? Is this realistic/wise? 500/mo for allowance and food seems like a lot, though New York gets pricey. My goal is to save as much as I can, but I also don't want to start a diet so rigid that I give up, so to speak. I want something sustainable. Please advise! Thanks very much.

(Footnote: though I have a lot of thoughts on the absurdity of the student loan debt situation in the U.S., I'd like to note that my own loans were entered into fully cognizant and I have no regret for the choices I've made. I understand that I've incurred a very significant debt and I'm not looking to complain or panic, just get some thoughts on the best way to handle them.)",finance,1373495967

So it seems Equifax has the longest most fleshed out history, but the repo is probably destroying my score on that one. 

My question is what can i do to flesh the other reports out without HURTING my credit. I learned a valuable lesson after the repo, and my financial mindset has changed alot. 

We have about 7k in the bank, and are saving at a rate of 920/month. by the end of this month, my credit card balance will be zero.

I KNOW first premier is a horrible card to have but to be honest, they were my doorway back into credit. If i could close them without losing that history i would just to avoid the fees they love to charge. However, would it be prudent to ask for an increase once my balance is at $0 (knowing they charge a fee of 25% of your increase amount) 

Would it be better to open a second credit card instead or in addition to? If so, what card would be most likely to accept me, as well as having low fees and starting with a respectable limit? (income is about 34k)

Should i have not paid that personal loan off? if i shouldnt have, should i open a new small personal loan just to have that line of credit

The accountant I hired - and no I'm not blaming this all on him, but its not all my fault either! - did my tax planning wrong and because he did things as if I was w2 and not 1099 for my LLC that failed, I just found out I have about $20,000 in taxes I owe the IRS from the 2012 tax year that we did not plan for.  Its a single owner LLC that has existed for almost 6 years now, but is currently only active on paper and has no income right now. 

We had filed an extension to file taxes, so no I'm not late to file as per the extension I have until August to file taxes, pay what is owed, etc.

Looking in mint I have the following assets and liabilities:

My Assets:

* Day job working as a software developer on a short term contract that will end in less than 2 months.

* Exactly $11,627 in liquid cash in my personal account, according to Mint.  This was supposed to be 2 months of buffer.

* A brokerage account that chase says is currently worth $3,474.85 and is down over 13%.

* I own my car free and clear, but its a 1997 so its not worth much, I just had to pay %4k to get it a new transmission (on my cc, after the 4k I had to spend on the engine, and the 700 I spent on breaks.. also on my personal cc).

* The LLC's bank account has only 300$ in it.

My Liabilities:

* Home mortgage (Amount owed: About $295,000 at 4.25%, monthly mortgage of around $1890).  The house is worth only $213,00 or so, so I am ""underwater"" as I owe more than its worth due to the housing downturn.  When I bought it I had $55,000 equity in the home, but then home prices crashed.

* Personal Credit card with a $9,189 balance at 13.9%. $350 minimal payment but I usually pay more.

* Company credit card from my failed business with $9,27 owed with a interest rate of about 24%.  I have no idea why its interest rate so high as I could have sworn it was less a year ago, but I pay the minimal every month then pay everything else I can usually, since its the most expensive debt I carry.  It used to be over 18k, but after I paid it down Chase changed the amount I could barrow to lower (15k).  Due to this I don't even have a CC card that could be used to pay the IRS the $20,000.

I already have have unknown outstanding debt in the form of emergency medical bills from being a passenger side victim in a car crash.  There are 3 insurance companies involved so its a mess.

My initial plan was to talk to the bank, get my CC interest rates down as much as possible so that the minimal payment was not too high, consolidate everything, l take out a loan for the taxes, pay the IRS, and then pay down the debt as much as I could over time... but the bank just told me that I do not qualify for any type of business loan because the LLC doesn't bring in at least $250,0000 a year, and while that sounds like an insane requirement to me they will not budge on this.

I have no idea what to do.  I got married earlier in the year and my wife did NOT sign up for this, I don't want to lose her and yet we are still going through the immigration stuff for her (She is Canadian, I'm american).

Unfortunately he tried to ignore his for several years figuring he would ""go off the grid"" and escape them, but he now has a job he likes and we'd like to get married eventually, so this is an issue we have to deal with.

A few months ago he got a default notice from his former state which started a PF discussion. We went through his credit report and tried to figure out exactly what he owed, but it was hard to tell what was what. His credit report is a bad chain of sold/discharged/written-off debt. We were able to make sense of some but not all of it, so he started a repayment plan with his former state education dept &amp; also with Chase to pay enough to avoid fees (~$175/mo payment). 

This week, he got another letter regarding his remaining federal loans. It seems they've been bundled &amp; sold, and he's being assessed a 25% fee for being default. That an additional $10-12k. I still don't know if he was successful in avoiding a similar fee for his state loan (they threatened a ~$2.5k fee before he started repaying). 

I'm trying not to let this weigh me down, but I've been strict with myself over the past couple years so I could build savings while paying off $40k so far of car, CC, and student loan debt that I graduated with. The process really sucks but I want like hell to be out of debt, so the idea that his debt is out there collecting tens of thousands in fees scares the crap out of me. What is PF's advice? Is there any shot of having some of his debt negotiated down? With the exception of the loans he just started repaying, he hasn't made payments in 3+ years. The latest letter said we can contest the debt, so I figured we might as well write and ask them to validate the debt to buy us time if nothing else.


He currently makes $37k and I make around 60k. I have minimum student loan payments of $580/mo with ~$79k to go. I never planned on relying on his income, but will his debt prevent us from living off my income? Can we haggle it down?

A friend of mine (who has never been to college and knows little about student loans) has a daughter who is looking at starting classes.  The daughter isn't terribly interested in going to the traditional four year institution, and is opting to go to a trade program at a local college (something in the medical profession, like radiology) which leaves her with a two year degree at the end of it.  The daughter has been hustling for a bit now, taking jobs and saving up money, and currently has $6000 in savings.  The program costs just under 10k total.

Here are my questions:

- Should daughter take out a loan, or try to pay for the classwork out of savings?  She doesn't want to be burdened with debt, but paying out of savings will wipe out that fund.

- If she does take out a loan, will the 6k in savings have any effect on what's offered?  Is it advisable to give the money to mom so that she doesn't have that much cash sitting in an account?  Daughter lives at home, and is claimed on taxes, so there's that.

- I've advised mom to stay away from private loans (she had been looking at offers from Discover that showed up in the mailbox), but was I wrong in that?  Should she only look to the Federal loans, or is there something I'm missing?

- Am I overlooking something obvious?  Mom and daughter have always been great with their money, but higher education is completely foreign to them, and I don't want them to make bad decisions that will haunt them later.

personalfinance,Federal Parent PLUS loans: Anyone know how to deal with these monsters?,"Hi all - and thanks in advance for any help!

Some background: I'm 2yrs out of engineering school. I went to Stevens Institute AKA one of the most expensive schools. My last two years I was forced to ask my stepdad to take 2 Fed Parent PLUS loans worth roughly $80K. I told him I would pay for it - not because he asked me to - but because I don't want anyone but myself carrying the burden of my education, not to mention my parents aren't necessarily the most wealthy (lower middle class type).

My situation: Luckily I got a job straight out of school. I make roughly $70K a year gross. Between my personal / federal loans and this Parent PLUS loan I end up giving more than half my net income as payments. It's asphyxiating. I try to save money and all but I'm basically living check to check.

The main reason is that the Parent PLUS Loan payment is $620 monthly. I filed for income based (I had to use my stepdad's income because loan is in his name, its about $55K gross yearly) payments and best they could do were 2 payment plans: Start at $583 a month and increase by $100 every 2 years, or $620 monthly forever. I went with the $620. But, it is still too much. I have other expenses and the typical bullshit that comes up (car problems, insurance, rent, food, credit cards, commuting, etc.).

My question is: does anyone know if there are any options to reduce these payments? Maybe not necessarily long term - but maybe for a year or two while I get a promotion or a raise or something. I have called Fed Loan and they 'have exhausted every option' - in other words, they haven't done shit and they think this payment is A-OK.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;Despite the 6.5% stock market rally over the last three months, a handful of billionaires are quietly dumping their American stocks . . . and fast.
&gt;
&gt;Warren Buffett, who has been a cheerleader for U.S. stocks for quite some time, is dumping shares at an alarming rate. He recently complained of “disappointing performance” in dyed-in-the-wool American companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Kraft Foods.
&gt;
&gt;In the latest filing for Buffett’s holding company Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has been drastically reducing his exposure to stocks that depend on consumer purchasing habits. Berkshire sold roughly 19 million shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and reduced his overall stake in “consumer product stocks” by 21%. Berkshire Hathaway also sold its entire stake in California-based computer parts supplier Intel.
&gt;
&gt;With 70% of the U.S. economy dependent on consumer spending, Buffett’s apparent lack of faith in these companies’ future prospects is worrisome. 
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately Buffett isn’t alone.
&gt;
&gt;Fellow billionaire John Paulson, who made a fortune betting on the subprime mortgage meltdown, is clearing out of U.S. stocks too. During the second quarter of the year, Paulson’s hedge fund, Paulson &amp; Co., dumped 14 million shares of JPMorgan Chase. The fund also dumped its entire position in discount retailer Family Dollar and consumer-goods maker Sara Lee.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, billionaire George Soros recently sold nearly all of his bank stocks, including shares of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. Between the three banks, Soros sold more than a million shares.
&gt;
&gt;So why are these billionaires dumping their shares of U.S. companies? 
&gt;
&gt;After all, the stock market is still in the midst of its historic rally. Real estate prices have finally leveled off, and for the first time in five years are actually rising in many locations. And the unemployment rate seems to have stabilized. 
&gt;
&gt;It’s very likely that these professional investors are aware of specific research that points toward a massive market correction, as much as 90%.
&gt;
&gt;One such person publishing this research is Robert Wiedemer, an esteemed economist and author of the New York Times best-selling book Aftershock. 
&gt;
&gt;Editor’s Note: .
&gt;
&gt;Before you dismiss the possibility of a 90% drop in the stock market as unrealistic, consider Wiedemer’s credentials.
&gt;
&gt;In 2006, Wiedemer and a team of economists accurately predicted the collapse of the U.S. housing market, equity markets, and consumer spending that almost sank the United States. They published their research in the book America’s Bubble Economy.
&gt;
&gt;The book quickly grabbed headlines for its accuracy in predicting what many thought would never happen, and quickly established Wiedemer as a trusted voice.
&gt;
&gt;A columnist at Dow Jones said the book was “one of those rare finds that not only predicted the subprime credit meltdown well in advance, it offered Main Street investors a winning strategy that helped avoid the forty percent losses that followed . . .”
&gt;
&gt;The chief investment strategist at Standard &amp; Poor’s said that Wiedemer’s track record “demands our attention.”
&gt;
&gt;And finally, the former CFO of Goldman Sachs said Wiedemer’s “prescience in (his) first book lends credence to the new warnings. This book deserves our attention.”
&gt;
&gt;In the interview for his latest blockbuster Aftershock, Wiedemer says the 90% drop in the stock market is “a worst-case scenario,” and the host quickly challenged this claim. 
&gt;
&gt;Wiedemer calmly laid out a clear explanation of why a large drop of some sort is a virtual certainty.
&gt;
&gt;It starts with the reckless strategy of the Federal Reserve to print a massive amount of money out of thin air in an attempt to stimulate the economy.
&gt;
&gt;“These funds haven’t made it into the markets and the economy yet. But it is a mathematical certainty that once the dam breaks, and this money passes through the reserves and hits the markets, inflation will surge,” said Wiedemer.
&gt;
&gt;“Once you hit 10% inflation, 10-year Treasury bonds lose about half their value. And by 20%, any value is all but gone. Interest rates will increase dramatically at this point, and that will cause real estate values to collapse. And the stock market will collapse as a consequence of these other problems.” 
&gt;
&gt;See the Proof: .
&gt;
&gt;And this is where Wiedemer explains why Buffett, Paulson, and Soros could be dumping U.S. stocks:
&gt;
&gt;“Companies will be spending more money on borrowing costs than business expansion costs. That means lower profit margins, lower dividends, and less hiring. Plus, more layoffs.”
&gt;
&gt;No investors, let alone billionaires, will want to own stocks with falling profit margins and shrinking dividends. So if that’s why Buffett, Paulson, and Soros are dumping stocks, they have decided to cash out early and leave Main Street investors holding the bag.
&gt;
&gt;But Main Street investors don’t have to see their investment and retirement accounts decimated for the second time in five years.
&gt;
&gt;Wiedemer’s video interview also contains a comprehensive blueprint for economic survival that’s really commanding global attention.
&gt;
&gt;Now viewed over 40 million times, it was initially screened for a relatively small, private audience. But the overwhelming amount of feedback from viewers who felt the interview should be widely publicized came with consequences, as various online networks repeatedly shut it down and affiliates refused to house the content.
&gt;
&gt;“People were sitting up and taking notice, and they begged us to make the interview public so they could easily share it,” said Newsmax Financial Publisher Aaron DeHoog. 
&gt;
&gt;“Our real concern,” DeHoog added, “is the effect even if only half of Wiedemer’s predictions come true.
&gt;
&gt;“That’s a scary thought for sure. But we want the average American to be prepared, and that is why we will continue to push this video to as many outlets as we can. We want the word to spread.”

personalfinance,"Going to Grad School next year, which loans should i set as a priority.","I will likely be attending Law School next fall and finance a great majority of the costs. I am working now and have the following student loans remaining. If we have a great year at my office, i could pay these in full based on bonuses. 

I banked on that logic over the past 2 years and we haven't closed a deal, so i wont hold my breath (stupid, i know, should have done more, but C'est la Vie, i learned my lesson). My thought is to pay down as much of the unsubsidized loans as possible prior to LS. Then i can defer the interest on the sub while im in school and it won't grow. I can save and use summer income from internships to help pay off new and old debts.. 

Which ones should be my top priority:

Name                  **Amount**          Interest      Req Pymt/My pymt

* Chase Private:     **8,424.36**         7.25%          $70/$105
* ACS Fed Stafford: **2,628.84**          6.7%           $50/$65
* Perkins               **309.12**            5.0%           $45/$170
* Government Loans                                        $200/250  - Total 
* Sub 1                  **2,193.95**          5.75%         
* Sub 2                  **1,958.01**          5.75%          
* Sub 3                  **4,784.95**          5.35%
* Sub  4                 **4,780.45**          4.25%

* unsub 3                **830.69**            6.55%

On average i save 700/month into various savings accounts. Chase savings, brokerage, IRA, HSA, etc. Should i move some of that towards this? 


I know in the above i'm overpaying the most on the Perkins, but i wanted an immediate little win. The instant that one is tackled (hopefully in August), i was going to focus on the Chase loan. Any other advice?

I have 16k in student debt and my school sent me about a 7k refund check. Of course, I immeditely thought to send the money to Greatlakes in order to lower the interest and principle. However, I was looking at the way interest is calculated and it appears that my gut reaction is wrong.

This Link (http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/interest-rates) indicates that they incorperate the last date of payment when calculating the month to month loan. If I were to apply the 7k today, I could be looking at a multiplier of 125 days, which might be hazerdous. Especially when I'm still in the 1.25 interest rate for my grace period. 

What should I do? At this point, I'm thinking of taking the 7k and saving it until the day my grace period ends. There is some possibility that I would invest it to try and make more before November, but with Bernanke possibly pulling QE in August, I might wait until then.

personalfinance,"19, Need Major Help","I'm 19 years old and I have a long history of shafting myself right in the buvvins with money ever since I started working my first job at 16 in June 2010. Last year i incurred over $1k in overdraft fees from my bank for constantly overdrawing my account because I didn't grasp the concept that charges don't go through right away, some may pop up 4 days later. I need MAJOR help with recording my finances/budgeting my money, and helping myself save for the future with whatever I want to do.

A little about my financial status:

I now get paid $8.75/hr monday-friday and $13.13 on sundays. On average I can make about 130 dollars a week after taxes (thanks to the new healthcare law my place of business now caps everyone at 22-24hrs/week &lt;3 ) 

So, let's start with on average I make $130/week (about right, can fluctuate/drop 10-50 dollars/week) .

* $25 for gas
* ~~$20~~ $10 for going out to eat with friends
* ~~$15 for if i buy a quick snack or drink at work~~
* $5 to go towards my gym membership
* $26.25 i need to save for my car insurance a week

That's ~~$91.25~~ $66.25/$130 dollars that I definitely spend and/or need to save throughout the week leaving me with essentially $60 dollars a week to save or even less if i suddenly find myself spending more money doing something else with my friends, or needing to buy something.

**I also recently (3 days ago) took up a side job assisting my landlord with his landscaping company around my house and I haven't been payed for that yet so idk how much an hour he pays (apparently very well).**

I also apparently have 1 medical charge that was sent to collections because apparently they (the doctors office/other insurance company) kept sending the paperwork in wrong more than once. I need to sort this out but thanks to procrastination I haven't done it yet.. it's been.. a while.. I also have no credit cards but i obviously need to start applying and building my credit because I need to buy a new car because mine is going to shit the bed soon. I also have 0 money in my checking and savings account thanks to me being a jackass so yay me.

I guess what I'm trying to find more about is how I should go about investing into my future. How should i be saving my money? Mutual funds, savings accounts, CD's, or something else? I also need to know what to do about my credit situation because a) obviously it's taking a hit with that medical bill being sent to collections and b) who should i go to for my first credit card? I have no clue where to start/what I should do.

Well, so much for that.

In a new &lt;a href=""http://thehaneygroup.blogspot.com/""&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released on Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund says that China, India, Brazil, Mexico and other developing countries are growing more slowly than previously thought. That weakness, combined with Europe’s enduring recession and middling growth in the United States, means the global economy will grow at 3.1 percent this year, about the same as last year and down from the I.M.F.’s April forecast of 3.3 percent.

Developing economies are struggling for a variety of reasons. Some, like Brazil and Russia, are hurting because there is less demand for their exports in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. China is trying to reduce its reliance on exports and investments while increasing the importance of domestic consumer spending. Some countries are also under pressure as foreign investors start moving money out of emerging markets to invest it in the United States, where interest rates have risen in recent days.

economy,Lincolnomics as the big fix?,"Is it conceivable that flawed economic theory could ultimately be the invisible force behind America's economic decline? Geldstone, conservative engineer and author of the The Leviticus Solution, suggests the answer is yes. To begin to understand why this might be possible, let's first frame the discussion in a very puzzling historical perspective. Consider Daniel Webster who said the main reason we have our Constitution is to stop free trade. In keeping with this nation-building tradition, Lincoln and GOP were protectionists until 1960. Karl Marx interestingly echoed this spirit when he suggested that free trade would accelerate capitalism's destruction. Fast forward a hundred and fifty years and recognize that China adopts Lincoln's logic and we Marx. 

Given this picture, it is not difficult to imagine that these men would have predicted a boom for China and a bust for America. Yet, a modern economist would very likely argue that free trade, not protectionism is the road to prosperity.  To make sense of this contradiction, Geldstone begins with a very daring proposition: there has never been a sound theory of economics.  The key intellectual error of all schools of economics argues Geldstone is the incomplete economic definition of money: 1) medium of exchange, 2) store of value, and 3) unit of account.  Note this definition completely ignores money's link to wages so that labor content maybe tracked in industrial goods in order to measure productivity gains.  More importantly, Geldstone, argues a correct definition of money is not only needed for a labor theory of value, but that it is ultimately a domestic phenomenon.  In short, money's key mechanism can only function properly in a closed economy.  If this mechanism is disrupted by free trade, so will the economy be disrupted.  In the end, a domestic labor unit gives money it's value and not vice versa as has been historically argued in all schools.  In modern fiat money systems, this is achieved by government decree via a minimum wage. The wage structure itself has an inherent domestic aspect which is reinforced by Keynes' observation that wages are a relative comparison process (an American steelworker compares his wage to another American steelworker, not a foreign steel worker). 

 To make the case, Geldstone argues the classical school's founders Smith (father of free markets) and Ricardo (father of free trade) failed to recognize free trade as the source of England's subsistence wages upon which a flawed labor theory of price was constructed. David Hume with his gold-like-the-wind model for international trade was the father of this confusion, which Smith and Ricardo's ultimately inherited. The intellectual irony that results is nicely illustrated by Smith the father of free markets and capitalism, and the father of anti-capitalism Marx who both built their theories on the very same flawed wage/money model. American protectionists of the 1700 and 1800s were much subtler in their thinking than Smith and recognized that a critical distinction had to be made between free domestic markets and free international mkts. Why? Gut instinct and the school of hard knocks. But Geldstone has stepped in where American statemen's instincts  left off by suggesting a new understanding of money's economic role can make sense of our history, success, and failure. 

Not to be outdone by the classical school with money as an after thought, the neoclassical school (modern economics) replaces money with invisible auctioneers and barter (money is a viel; all prices are suppy and demand driven--not true cost of production)!   The notion of barter in modern economics is nicely hidden from the unsuspecting by simply suggesting price flexibility as the means to achieving economic equilibrium (full employment).  But as Geldstone suggests, such an outer-worldly idea can only be achieved if a unit of labor has no direct link to money's value.   To fully appreciate this mind set, one only needs to consider Menger, from the Austrian school (i.e. the intellectual home of many modern libertarians), who claimed it makes no difference for the price of diamond if you find it by luck or have to dig it out of the earth. Tell that to mine operator who just bought a million dollar earth moving machine.  One of Menger's followers, Boehm-Bawerk takes this to heart with his horse auction example, where buyers outnumber sellers.  Some buyers obviously are forced out of the process and the price of a horse converges to a happy-price which clears the market in this Austrian world of barter economics.   Unfortunately, this is almost the same error of the classical school which mistakenly believes price theory is microeconomics, instead of macroeconomics.  To see the mistake in Boehm-Bawerk's logic, one needs to understand the implication of the excessive number of buyers.  These buyers have chosen not to spend their money in other industry sectors, resulting ultimately in unemployment.  These unemployed can now migrate to the horse sector to breed more horses to meet demand at the cost-of-production, and not at auction-house prices.  Even more troubling in this horse model is the fact that the final horse prices ultimately sets (imputes) the wages of the horse breeders.  Tell that to the factory accountant when he prices out the final cost of an assemble automobile consisting of 14,000 parts. 

Modern economics (neoclassical) built around Walras' general equilibrium model is only a small step away from this horse auction.  It's the reason Walras requires an invisible auctioneer to magically coordinate all barter prices across the nation (literally in the blink of an eye as the all simultaneous equations are solved), before an exchange can take place.  Money in such a model can just as easily be any commodity of your choosing (i.e. chicken eggs) whose value (exchange ratio) is derived from supply and demand for eggs (code speak yet again for barter).  Added to this barter mix is the notion of ""perfect competition"" in which a large number of small businesses making up a specific industry sector are burdened with diminishing returns of production even though the demand for the product is astonishingly unlimited (i.e. every business owner fantasy held out just beyond his reach).  The effects of diminishing returns is not only limited to the business owner's output, it's passed right on down to the worker.  The diminishing returns on production ultimately mean that the quantity of labor hired is a function of the wage level (under perfect competition the market price of the output is fixed).   Thus a pay cut means more labor is hired, not a lower product price.   Forget any real notion of cost of productions in this mythical factory.  To an engineer this is a very strange place indeed, because it means a factory adjusts its output to meet a demand price, instead of setting output to meet a demand quantity at production cost.  So if the foreign competition is eating your lunch, just take a pay cut, say down to the level of a third-world wage earner, and all will be well in the world of neoclassical chalk board scribblings. 

Again, such a surreal intellectual foundation can only come about, as Geldstone argues, by failing to recognize money's proper role in an economy.  In economic jargon, there has never been a correct model of micro and macro economics, because money's role has never been properly understood. Money must be rejected in the modern models to allow for instantly and infinitely flexible prices and wages that react to supply and demand (invisible auctioneers). 

Keynesians, with only one foot still in the neoclassical world,  end up praying that stimulus will save the business community. Divide $6 trillion in fed, state, and local annual spending by 115 million full time workers and you get about $52K per worker of ""stimulus"". Not enough? Well, perhaps the Keynesian multipler as it miraculously goes to infinity if you don't save will do the trick.  Even more troubling, from an engineer's perspective, is Keynes' new interpretation of the classical school's belief of a relationship between investment and saving.  As Geldstone argues, investment as a  percentage of GDP, is simply due to the state of technology.  It is not as Keynes suggests a function of interest rates and the marginal efficiency of capital.  In addition, investment is not the source of instability in an economy as Keynes argue, it is consumption.  Nor can investment lead an economy out of recession, because business owner investment follows the behavior of the consumer.  And finally, if all this was not enough to cause confusion, Keynes failed to understand the implications of investment patterns which follow (trail) 115 million unique consumption patterns.  Where do you suggest we invest in such an economic kaleidoscope and how do you distinquish between a business that is slowing down because it is an inferior competitor verses one whose business is slowing down due to a recession? Which of the two should invest? The answer: neither. 

So if economics is a science, which science are we talking about? The Marxists, the New Keynesians, the Post-Keynesian, the neo-Keynesians, the Austrians, the neoclassicals, the Monetarists, the New Classical, The Real Business, the classical school, ...well you get the idea. A bit like having 10 different laws of gravity. Could it be Geldstone just might be onto something here? 

What then does engineer Geldstone offer as the new law of economic ""physics""? The answer: A theory which provides the missing theoretical basis to protectionism (Lincolnomics). In other words, Geldstone argues only a closed economy is a sound economy. Capitalism is only fully functional when the economy is closed, because only then can money achieve its proper role of measuring domestic labor content. This mechanism is critical because it allows for fluid worker mobility to take place as sector sizes adjust to productivity gains and shifts in demand without long term unemployment. In simplistic terms, if the steel workers, and factory workers down the street are unemployed because they cannot move into a sector now dominated by foreign competition, who will buy the ice cream you are trying to sell at your coffee shop? 

The subtle implication of Geldstone's argument is the belief that a closed nation will drive an economy to full employment in the long run with minimum labor content per industrial good (i.e. its the highest standard of living a nation can achieve given the ingenuity and work ethic of its people). As a result, those who produce the wealth will fully consume the wealth of a nation. The notion of exporting a surplus does not exist in the model (sectors would simply adjust in size instead). Nor is this an attempt to say nation A will have a higher standard of living than nation B due to the wealth measuring problem.  Instead, the model argues a closed economy is the best you can do, because free trade ultimately results in long term unemployment (for the inferior nation competitor), or results in wealth exportation (as the superior nation competitor--e.g. subsistence wages of 1700/1800s Britian). 

Super powers grow rich by protecting their industries. Superpowers by definition are industrial power houses. In other words, factories ARE the economy because their long-run productivity gains free up labor for new sector growth. All sectors ultimately depend on the industrial base for their existence (otherwise we'd still be an agricultural society). Unless we learn the very hard lessons of economic chaos our founding father's had to learn under The Articles of Confederation due to low cost imports from Britain, I suspect more and more businesses will find it very difficult to succeed. Niche markets will remain, but as a whole the outlook will be one of increasing economic dysfunction. 

Help shift the economic debate in this country. Read Geldstone. Just maybe it will make more sense than ""science.""  If on the other hand you find the argument lacking and worthy of a down vote, please leave a comment explaining why. Constructive criticism is very welcome.  America needs a new model of economics, and with your help I believe it can be done.",finance,1373585195

Allocation: 3%
Scorecard Status: Buy First
Recent Price: $25.60
Fair-Value Estimate: $34
Consider Adding More: $20
Dividend: 1.4%
Options: We may use them later, but they aren't necessary

What It Does

Entrusted with $517 billion in assets from retail investors and registered investment advisors (RIAs), discount broker TD Ameritrade (NYSE: AMTD) hosts 378,000 stock, options, and futures trades on an average day. Since 2008, against a ""perfect storm"" of weak trading volume, near-zero interest rates, and a flattened yield curve (where short and long-term interest rates don't differ by much), this $14 billion company has managed to double client assets, contain operating costs, and return ever-more cash to shareholders.

At the same time, TD Ameritrade's partnership with TD Bank (NYSE: TD) (which owns 45% of the company) gives it a unique position in its industry. The partnership allows TD Ameritrade to earn high-margin interest income on client cash without being saddled with the same capital requirements as a bank, and with cross-selling opportunities and below-average risk to boot. So, when the current record-low Federal Funds interest rate increases, TD Ameritrade will earn much higher interest income, all of it pure profit. Meanwhile, it continues to focus on job No. 1: Grow client assets, and launch more investment products.

But about that Fed Funds rate: In 2007, it was 4.75%, up from 1% in 2003 during the last recession. Today, it's hovering between zero and 0.25%. The first year that it increases by 100 basis points (to 1.1% from today's 0.1%), management estimates TD Ameritrade's earnings per share will rise by an extra 27% to 32% compared with the prior year, on top of any other growth. And as history shows, interest rates could rise by much more than 100 basis points over the next three, five, and seven years.

Total revenue is up since 2007 despite a decline of about one-third in net interest revenue, as you can see above. But by growing client accounts, TD Ameritrade now has a much larger asset base on which to earn income when interest rates rebound (not to mention other benefits when trading volume grows). As of May, the company oversaw $88 billion in interest rate-sensitive assets. It also enjoys recurring fees from an expanding line of investment products: retirement accounts, advisor and institutional services (including AdvisorDirect), and exchange-traded and mutual-fund offerings.

How It's Doing 

TD Ameritrade has increased client assets by at least 10% annualized for the last four years and counting. Management says this rate of growth has been about double that of its nearest competitor. For context, the S&amp;P 500 is nearly flat since 2007, but client assets held at TD Ameritrade have more than doubled over the same period. The company's lucrative, quickly growing registered investment advisor business has contributed to this success, as have its new investment services. As evidence, two quarters into the current fiscal year, revenue from investment product fees is up 32% to $106 million.

Operating margins are strong, too, lately in the mid-30% range. Diligent capital management led Standard &amp; Poor's to upgrade the business to an ""A"" credit rating in 2012, which helped fuel a recent 50% increase in the dividend (likely the first of many). With steady gains in customer accounts, decreasing shares outstanding (from 595 million in 2007 to 550 million last quarter), and a commitment to paying out roughly two-thirds of earnings to shareholders, the business should continue to reward owners – with the added benefit of much higher profits when interest rates increase. Meanwhile, the stock trades about 20% below its 10-year average price-to-book value of 4, although the company is more diverse and stronger now than over the past decade.

Today the stock trades at 3.3 times book value. The table tells the story well: When interest rates head higher, investors anticipate higher earnings and higher return on equity, so they pay a higher value multiple for TD Ameritrade. And with rates currently at a generational low, we could see a steady climb upward for many years. At the same time, as noted above, TD Ameritrade continues to be a well-run business with a long runway. This isn't justan investment in higher interest rates -- but higher rates will be an impressive booster rocket for earnings.

What Could Make Us Sell

TD Ameritrade needs to continue to increase customer accounts and client assets against tough competition (lately, it is drawing assets away from old-school, full-service brokers). Beyond that, it's a waiting game for more trading volume, more investment fees, and higher interest rates. Although we don't believe it likely, the United States could maintain very low interest rates for years, as Japan has; if that happens, our patience will be tried. If rates do increase, higher interest income may drive new commission wars as brokers fight to gather assets. We believe this less likely in today's mature, consolidated industry, but if we see such issues developing, we'll temper our expectations and consider selling. Finally, as with any financial stock, if we have any reason to lose trust in management, we'll enter a sell order.

Alternative Trades

Although we recommend buying shares today, if you want to potentially buy the stock lower, consider ""selling to open"" one November 2013 $25 put for every 100 shares you could buy. Lately, these pay about $1.30, or a 5.2% yield in just more than four months. You can also consider other strikes and months.
If you want to invest less capital, consider ""buying to open"" January 2015 $20 call options for upside exposure until that date.
The Foolish Bottom Line

TD Ameritrade's earnings are very likely at a cyclical low. Believing as we do that the company's profit potential is much greater than recent results suggest, the stock is a compelling buy in anticipation of higher interest rates. TD Ameritrade's business model is powerful when rates are headed upward. Most investors have probably forgotten that power since 2007, but will remember it when earnings start to jump. We'll begin with a 3% stake within the next 30 days and will consider increasing it over time.",finance,1373570995

**Background:** 22 y/o Recent grad. 120k in studant loan debt, mostly private loans. Want to consolidate 87k. Full time job in Boston making 48k a year as an IT consultant. Pay will increase withing 12-18months.  

I'm attempting to consolidate my student loans with a co-signer (father) through custudentloans.org. My total loans that i'm looking to consolidate (I have more loans, but they very low interest and i'm going to keep them separate) are 87k.  


**Documents:** [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/GgkWj7G.png?1) is the interest rate information on the consolidation at the credit union, i think.  


**Question:** Does this look okay, would you consolidate with them? My current rates for the loans I want to consolidate are all higher than the 7.03% max starting rate. However, it does say that it can change with the market and could reach up to 18% but won't go over that. How risky is this? is it worth it?  


For comparison, these are the rates of the loans I'm consolidating:
*9.875%
*10.625%
*7.875%

business,Don't Get 'Spoofed' by Rogue Callers,"Source: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-alderman/dont-get-spoofed-by-rogue_b_3574710.html

When caller ID first arrived on the scene it seemed like a godsend to many people: Now you could easily identify who was on the line and ignore unwanted calls, whether from telemarketers, an ex-boyfriend or an unfriendly collection agency.

But as often happens, unscrupulous individuals soon began manipulating the technology to defraud people by pretending to be someone else. Their scheme is called ""caller ID spoofing"" and disturbingly, it's perfectly legal in many cases.

Here's how caller ID spoofing works and what precautions you should take to avoid being victimized:

For a very low cost, businesses and individuals can use widely available caller ID spoofing software to generate calls which alter the telephone number and/or name that appear on the recipient's caller ID screen.

Police, private investigators and collection agencies have used legal spoofing services for many years. Others who might have a legitimate reason to hide their identity when making a call include domestic violence victims and doctors returning patient calls who don't wish to release their private telephone numbers.

Beyond that, the lines of legality begin to blur. The Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 prohibits anyone from transmitting misleading or inaccurate caller ID information with the intent to defraud, cause harm or wrongfully obtain anything of value. Violators can be penalized up to $10,000 for each infraction. Unfortunately, such penalties haven't dissuaded many scammers.

One common caller ID scam involves spoofers pretending to represent a bank, government agency, insurer, credit card company or other organization with which you do business. They count on you being reassured after recognizing the company's name on your screen.

Related Articles: http://hass-associates-daffy.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page

Under the pretext of warning about an urgent situation (breached account, late payment, pending insurance claim, missed jury duty summons, etc.), the spoofer will try to coax you into revealing personal or account information, supposedly to verify their records.

Often these are robocalls, where a recorded voice asks you to stay on the line to speak to a representative or call another number for more information. Do not. Probably thousands of other people are receiving the same message at the same time. If you suspect the call might possibly be genuine, contact the company yourself at the toll-free number found on your card, account statement or the company's website.

You should never reveal your full Social Security number, mother's maiden name, credit card number, passwords or other private information over the phone unless you initiated the call yourself. Someone possessing such information could use it to gain access to your existing accounts to withdraw or transfer money, raise credit limits or snoop around your recent activity, among other intrusions.

ID thieves also can use your personal information to open new credit accounts (e.g., credit cards, mortgage or car loan), create a new identity or even obtain a job fraudulently. Often, you won't even realize something's wrong until a collection agency -- or the IRS -- starts hounding you for unpaid bills or taxes.

Another common caller ID spoof involves hacking into someone's voice mail account. Many cellphone users never bother to set up passwords on their voice mailboxes (big mistake). And, since many voicemail systems grant access to callers phoning from their own number, a hacker could easily spoof your number and gain access to your messages. (You may recall this practice brought down the British tabloid News of the World in 2011.)

The increasing popularity of voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) phone services like Skype and Vonage also has increased caller ID spoofing activity. These services use computer addresses instead of actual phone numbers to connect via the Internet, so scammers can choose any available area code and phone number, making it even harder to determine who's who on your phone.

We went from about 24000 to 11000 by sticking to a budget and paying off as much extra as possible. We were going to be done by the end of 2013, then we found out she is pregnant with our first child last January.  Our extra payments immediately halted and have begun going to medical/baby related stuff and buying a house, so we are stuck at minimum cc payments again for the foreseeable future (the baby and daycare will stop us from paying extra to the cards).

An added wrinkle is that my wife needs a car.  Her current POS is on its last leg and is not worth putting money in.  It is worth about $500.  My truck is worth about 8000.  We own both free and clear. We have $2000 in cash.

Our current minimum cc payments equal 500ish a month.  The interest rates are high (up to 24% on one of them).  

We can get car loans at 2.24% and have payments of around 200-250 each.

Bitcoin,I have a bit of a question about difficulty.,"Considering that there are people a lot of rigs out there that have all been ordered a year ago which still hasn't hit the market, and considering that the computational power of bitcoin actually jumped off the charts, expecting a huge difficulty increase, there may be a large number of people with even jalapenos who may drop out of mining because their computing power may just not match up enough to solo-mine or even make enough money in a pool. This may end up dropping a lot of computing power by the end of this event, and it might (for all I can speculate) take hours or days for a new block to generate. 

Yes, that event would make bitcoins much more scarce, which may increase the value thereafter, but businesses cannot operate face to face waiting for hours or days to see if a transaction has been cleared or sent. And it may take a very long time after that hypothetical event to clear up, because the time at which the network adjusts difficulty is based on counting the number of blocks generated and the time between them. Does Satoshi's paper say anything about this? If reasons can be pointed out as to why nothing wrong would occur, or if this event wouldn't happen at all, then someone needs to start working on a project called ScienceCoin so universities and NASA can use the computational power of this kind of network instead of spending millions of dollars on super computers which are vastly dwarfed by this network.",cryptocurrency,1373506644

business,Lincoln's Economics and Your Struggling Business,"Is it conceivable that flawed economic theory could ultimately be the invisible force behind your failing business? Is it possible your business is well run, well thought out, and yet fails through no fault of your own?  Geldstone, conservative engineer and author of the The Leviticus Solution, suggests the answer is yes.  To begin to understand why this might be possible, let's first frame the dicussion in a very puzzling historical perspective.  Consider Daniel Webster who said the main reason we have our Constitution is to stop free trade. In keeping with this nation-building tradition, Lincoln and GOP were protectionists until 1960.   Karl Marx interestingly echoed this spirit when he suggested that free trade would accelerate capitalism's destruction.  Fast forward a hundred years and recognize that China adopts Lincoln's logic and we Marx. 

Given this picture, it is not difficult to imagine that these men would  have predicted a boom for China and a bust for America.  Yet, a modern economist would very likely argue that free trade, not protectionism is the road to prosperity.  To make sense of this contradiction, Geldstone begins with a very daring proposition:  there has never been a sound theory of economics.   To make the case,  Geldstone argues the classical school's founder's Smith (father of free markets)  and Ricardo (father of free trade) failed to recognize free trade as the source of England's subsistence wages upon which a flawed labor theory of price was constructed.  David Hume with his gold-like-the-wind model for international trade was the father of this confusion, which Smith and Ricardo's ultimately inherited.  The intellectual irony that results is nicely illustrated by Smith, the father of free markets and capitalism, and the father of anti-capitalism  Marx built their theories on the very same flawed wage/money model.  American protectionists of the 1700 and 1800s were much subtler in their thinking than Smith and recognized that a critical distinction had to be made between free domestic markets and free international mkts. Why? Gut instinct and the school of hard knocks.  But Geldstone has stepped in where American statemen left off, by suggesting a new understanding of money's economic role can make sense of our history, success, and failure.    

Not to be outdone by the classical school with money as an after thought, the neoclassical school (modern economics) replaces money with invisible auctioneers and barter (money is a viel; all prices are suppy and demand driven--not true cost of production)!  To fully appreciate this mind set, one only needs to consider Menger, from the Austrian school, who claims it makes no difference for the price of diamond if you find it by luck or have to dig it out of the earth. Tell that to mine operator who just bought a million dollar earth moving machine.  Again, such a surreal intellectual foundation can only come about, as Geldstone argues, by failing to recognize money's proper role in an economy.  Money must be rejected in the modern models to allow for instantly and infinitely flexible prices and wages that react to supply and demand (invisible auctioneers).  Big mistake. 

Keynesians on the other hand are praying that stimulus will save the business community. Divide $6 trillion in fed, state, and local annual spending by 115 million full time workers and you get about $52K per worker of ""stimulus"". Not enough? Well, perhaps the Keynesian multipler as it miraculously goes to infinity if you don't save will do the trick.  

So if economics is a science, which science are we talking about? The Marxists, the New Keynesians, the Post-Keynesian, the neo-Keynesians, the Austrians, the neoclassicals, the Monetarists, the New Classical, The Real Business, the classical school, ...well you get the idea. A bit like having 10 different laws of gravity.   Could it be Geldstone just might be onto something here?  

What then does engineer Geldstone offer as the new law of economic ""physics""?  The answer: A theory which provides the missing theoretical basis to protectionism (Lincolnomics).  In other words, Geldstone argues only a closed economy is a sound economy.  Capitalism is only fully functional when the economy is closed,  because only then can money achieve its proper role of measuring domestic labor content.   This mechanism is critical because it allows for fluid worker mobility to take place as sector sizes adjust to productivity gains and shifts in demand without long term unemployment.   The smooth functioning of these sector adjustments ultimately drive your business.  In simplistic terms, if the steel workers, and factory workers down the street are unemployed because they cannot move into a sector now dominated by foreign competition, who will buy the ice cream you are trying to sell at your restaraunt?  In economic jargon, there has never been a correct model of micro and macro economics, because money's role has never been properly understood. 

Super powers grow rich by protecting their industries.   Superpowers by definition are industrial power houses. In other words, factories ARE the economy because their long-run productivity gains free up labor for new sector growth.   All sectors ultimately depend on the industrial base for their existence (otherwise we'd still be an agricultural society).   Unless we learn the very hard lessons of economic chaos our founding father's had to learn under The Articles of Confederation due to  low cost imports from Britain, I suspect more and more businesses will find it very difficult to succeed. Niche markets will remain, but as a whole the outlook will be one of increasing economic dysfunction.  

Help shift the economic debate in this country.  Read Geldstone.   Just maybe it will make more sense than ""science.""",finance,1373503155

I think I'll be able to apply for some kind of income-based repayment plan, has anyone had any luck with those? It's so annoying how you can't know in advance exactly how much your payments will be. I have a Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan totaling $21,500 and a Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan totaling $5,500, and interest is already starting to accrue. I have about $8k in my savings account, which is a nice cushion but one I'd only like to use in case of emergency. I have a Regular Savings account and a CampusEdge checking account from Bank of America. My dad set up a Roth IRA for me a couple years ago, but I feel like I won't be able to contribute to that either.

I live and work in New York City, so fortunately I don't need a car. I cook for myself and bring my lunch to work every day, pretty much never go shopping, etc--all the usual things to save money. I have a credit card (Discover It) that I use maybe once or twice a month just to build credit, and I always pay it off immediately. 

What else should (or shouldn't) I be doing?

personalfinance,"Looking at a private student loan, what Kind should I be looking for?","OK, I'm going into my sophomore year of college at an expensive private school. When I was accepted, I was awarded a full tuition scholarship for academic merit, but in the spring semester my GPA dipped below the minimum (2.85, when I needed a 3.0--I didn't fail, just didn't do very well). The reasons are all my fault, really--no injuries or family emergencies. I had a terrible professor in one class, and didn't do a good job working around him, one class I didn't take seriously enough, and one class I thought I was prepared for, but wasn't. 

I am allowed to apply for a reevaluation of my financial aid eligibility, and I am doing that. If I don't get the scholarship back when I submit now (which I think is unlikely--in all honesty, I fucked up and probably don't deserve it back right now), I can go back to school for one semester, get my grades back up, and apply again, but I'll need to take out a loan. In that semester, I will get my grades up, and I think my chances of getting the scholarship back then are pretty good. If I don't get my scholarship back after one semester, I probably will not continue to attend that school.

Between financial aid that is available to me and my parents' contribution of around 10,000, I'll still need to take out ~5000 in private loans, plus about 2500 in federal student loans included in the aid package. I know that isn't much as far as student loans go these days, but I have no credit history, am 19, know NOTHING about finance, and I want to keep my debts as low as possible. 

How should I go about getting the private loan, and what kind should I take out? All the reasearch I've done so far has only been scary. Fixed rate loans of up to 9% seem crazy--aren't interest rates supposed to be low right now? Will I be able to get a better loan from a credit union with my parents' help if they are members of it? Should I get one that defers payments until graduation, but adds interest to the principal the whole time, or try to pay off while in school?  If I get a loan with deferred payment, am I allowed to put any money into paying it off while I'm in school, or do I have to wait and let it accrue interest till I graduate? I do have a job in the summer (paid internship in my field, $15 an hour, can count on having it every summer, and chances are good I can get a job there when I graduate), but during the school year, I only make 150 a semester. I have no idea what kind of monthly payments I should be taking on. If I have some kind of medical expense (I've got a bad wrist that has needed surgery before, and may need it again) I could end up not being able to make monthly payments. 

Please help? As far as finances and dealing with banks go, I've got about as much insight as a sea slug. My questions seem small in comparison with the loan amounts I see people asking about here, but I'm panicked and I've never been taught a thing about this stuff. 

My parents always kept me pretty much in the dark about their finances, except to say they avoid debt. My dad built our house, didn't go to college, and my mom went to college on the money her father left her (he died when she was 17), and they both pay off their credit cards every month.

About the program: because it's accelerated, I'll be taking on more credit hours per semester than typical, and I'll be done in a year.  Tuition, fees, and books (that I found on Half, Amazon, etc.) come out to $10k.  I'd have to move there, and the nearest and cheapest place is $4500 for the whole year.

I will still keep my whole life insurance through Northwestern mutual though (i know, most people aren't fans...more details below).  So my questions are...

1.  Based on my FA's advice, I had rolled my old 401K from my previous company into the ROTH IRA a couple years ago (American Funds).  Being that this is a load fund, should I keep the money in there (roughly $25K) or roll it over the Vanguard.  I was thinking of keeping it there because it's a load fund and I've already paid the fees upfront.  I was maxing it out for awhile and then bumped it down to $250 last year (bought house and had a wedding) Is this the right thing to do?

2.  As for the life insurance, could I just lower the premium I pay each month without taking a hit on the ""investment""?  I've paid $150 (now bumped up to $157) each month for over 2 years.  I would rather not back out now.

3. For the Vangaurd Roth, could I just pick a couple target funds for the wife and I and then leave it for awhile? I plan on doing more research later on and making changes.  We will be maxing these out.

business,'Debt peril' warning over interest rate rises,"Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23265761

The number of families in ""debt peril"" could double over the next four years, a think tank has warned. The number of households spending more than half of their disposable income on debt repayments could hit 1.2 million, the Resolution Foundation says. This could happen if interest rates rise to 3.9% by 2017 and growth in household income is weak, it says. But this ""worst-case scenario"" is gloomier than most economists expect, the report concedes. The Bank of England's base rate is currently at an historic low of 0.5%. Recent comments from Mark Carney, the new Bank governor, suggest that bank base rates are not likely to rise any time soon, and current market expectations are that they will increase to about 1.9% by 2017.

Related Article: http://www.causes.com/actions/1756097-cruse-associates-news-goodreads

Income squeeze Matthew Whittaker, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation and the report's author, said: ""There is now the real prospect that a large number of households already burdened with debt could collapse under its weight if economic conditions tighten. ""If the squeeze on household incomes continues, Britain could be left in a fragile position, with even moderate additional increases in interest rates leading to a major surge in families with dangerous debt levels - especially among worse-off households."" Under a best-case scenario, where interest rates rise by current expectations and household income growth is strong, 700,000 households will still be spending more than 50% of their income on debt repayments, the Resolution Foundation concludes. Since 2007, this number has fallen by 270,000 to 600,000, or 2% of the population, because of falling interest rates. But Mr Whittaker warns: ""Policy makers and lenders need to use the current period of record low rates to defuse debt problems rather than storing them up for the future."" Rising debt levels With the government's Funding for Lending and Help to Buy schemes encouraging banks to lend more to households and businesses, consumer debt levels are forecast to rise again after a period of stabilisation, the report says, citing official figures. Total household debt is set to rise to £1.8 trillion by 2018, up from about £1.55tn now. The debt-to-income ratio is also likely to rise from 143% to 151% over the same period, the report says, as household disposable incomes are squeezed. On Wednesday, the Aviva Family Finances report said that average household debt had already risen by more than 40% in the past year, with a large chunk being owed to family and friends. It studied data from 18,000 families and found that while incomes have been rising, so have debt levels.

business,Apple e-book ruling seen as warning to tech industry,"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/apple-ebook-ruling-93974.html

The U.S. government’s victory over Apple in the e-books antitrust case sends a message to the tech industry, legal observers say: Even popular innovators can’t run roughshod over antitrust laws.

In a court in New York, Apple had argued unsuccessfully that it was the classic outsider trying to break into and enliven what it saw as a stagnant digital books market dominated by Amazon.com.

But on Wednesday, a federal judge in New York rejected that view and evoked an earlier era of robber barons and monopolies, ruling that Apple had orchestrated a “horizontal price-fixing conspiracy” with five major publishers that resulted in increased digital book prices for consumers.

The decision is “an important touchstone,” said Phil Weiser, dean of the University of Colorado Law School and a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department’s antitrust division. “At times, tech companies want to take the position that they are a fast-moving industry and antitrust law is not an effective means of oversight. There is no technology industry exception.”
Apple immediately vowed to appeal the decision.

“Apple did not conspire to fix e-book pricing, and we will continue to fight against these false accusations,” said an Apple spokesman. “When we introduced the iBookstore in 2010, we gave customers more choice, injecting much-needed innovation and competition into the market, breaking Amazon’s monopolistic grip on the publishing industry.”

U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, in siding with the DOJ, found the price fixing wouldn’t have succeeded “without the active facilitation and encouragement of Apple.” The judge will order a trial on damages in a parallel complaint brought by 33 state attorneys general.

“This result is a victory for millions of consumers who choose to read books electronically,” Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer said in a statement. “Companies cannot ignore the antitrust laws when they believe it is in their economic self-interest to do so. This decision by the court is a critical step in undoing the harm caused by Apple’s illegal actions.”
Some argued that in the Apple case, the DOJ overstepped.

“Just because the government could secure the verdict it won doesn’t mean they should have sought it,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in a statement. “This case cried out for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion at the Department of Justice; unfortunately, there was none to be found.”

personalfinance,Is it possible to live in SoCal with a 40k salary?,"Hello fellow redditors! I am a 23 year old male who just moved to LA in order to start a career in finance but I'm still looking at the moment.  Currently, I stay with family so I'm not paying rent/utilities/internet etc. and my parents in MI are helping with food/gas money until I find a job.

I only have 1.5 years working in the finance department of an IT company and I did not attend a good university so my prospects for landing a decent salaried position are very low. I'm mainly aiming for hourly positions at (hopefully) $20/hr.

I've looked at a possible monthly scenario if I were to move out but in my calculations, I ended completely in the negative.  Does anybody else have any experience living and working in California who can provide some insight into my calculations?

Pre-tax income	35650 (after a 5950 standard deduction for a single person @ $20/hr, fulltime)

(-) Federal tax	4936			
(-) State tax	688			
	(=)	30026	(+) 5950	(=) 35976
				
Monthly income	2998 - 300 (for payroll taxes) = 2700
	
(-) Rent	500			
(-) Food	300			
(-) Car insurance	250			
(-) Car payment	250			
(-) Retirement	562			
(-) Cellphone	60			
(-) Utilities	        50			
(-) Internet	        30			
(-) Travel fund	150			
(-) Health insurance	100			
(-) Gas	160	(my car gets 30 mpg in the city)		
(-) Gym	30			
(-) Student loan	60			

= ~200 per month

**EDIT**: Made changes.  Still seems pretty difficult to live here unless I don't save for retirement.  Might have to rethink relocating here.  

**EDIT 2**: Some people have mentioned that 40k seems low for a Finance grad in LA.  A little history:  I've sent out 500+ resumes, been to networking events, school career center, used LinkedIN to network and **in 1.5 years (graduated in December 2011), I have never gotten a call back for an interview for an entry level position**. I'm not really sure what I'm doing wrong to be honest.  I've looked online and every site says that entry level finance people make 60k but *I've gotten 0 (I mean that literally) interviews so I don't know what to do.*

**I was working in a degree-related job after college but not in a salaried position**.

finance,Question on Financial Theory,"I've been watching the Finance Theory 1 lectures on MIT OpenCourseware to give me a little insight into how things in finance and the economy work. Right now the professor is talking about how implicit in the current US government bond rates is information about where the market believes interest rates are heading.

So I'm trying to understand the information on the Bloomberg site [here](http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us/)

This is how I understand it. Please tell me if I am wrong:

If you look at the 1 year rate it's 0.11% and the 2 year rate is 0.34%. But the 2 year rate is an AVERAGE rate of the previous two years. So if we know TODAY that  the 1 year rate is .11% then the market believes that the future 1 year forward rate is going to be 0.57%. [(.57+.11)/2 = .34] So it's anticipated that interest rates are going to rise. The 1 year interest rate might be .11% now, but the market believes that in one year from TODAY the 1 year rate will be up around .57%

Is this a correct interpretation?",finance,1373742281
personalfinance,Making my own net worth app. How should I think about inflation?,"So I am writing my own personal finance app to pull in data about my stock portfolio and show me my performance and returns with certain amounts of money, over different time periods, etc.  For some reason Quicken requires a lot of babysitting and isn't very effective at doing this.  My question is regarding inflation.  I understand that many financial models you compare nominal returns against inflation to show real returns.  In my instance, using a national inflation number would be something of a misnomer because I'm only evaluating my own returns.  At first I thought it would be beneficial for me to at least use the CPI number for my specific urban area.  Okay. Thinking about it further, I could easily go over my own credit card statement, look over the stores in my neighborhood, my own rent, my own costs of childcare, etc. and build my own basket of consumer items and create a super personalized inflation rate.  This model ignores the effect inflation has on my choices generally, if I am priced out of other markets: baseball games, moving to a new house, that would have an effect on my quality of life but not be reflected in my model.

Digressing from that I though perhaps it may be best to ignore inflation.  The app is designed to measure returns and, unlike Congress or the Federal Reserve, I have no control over inflation and am highly unlikely to leave the United States to avoid inflation.  Perhaps I should just study nominal returns and let inflation do what it may!

General info
-Graduated with a degree in business, got a $68000 salary job (before taxes and other deductions)
-$26000 in govt loans and $6000 in private loans but I'm still in my grace period for the loans until December. (8.9% interest rate on pvt loans)
-Health insurance is covered by the parents but I'm living on my own in a different city.
-Rent's about $1500 a month (includes utilites and cable-$1260 for actual rent, $80 for cable/internet, and water/electricity are guesstimates of $140 together) and car payment is about $550 (car pmt and insurance together).
-It's bi-weekly paychecks and I'm automatically forced to contribute 3% to a 401k. No state income tax in the state I live, no local taxes either.

My questions:
-Contributing the bare min of 3% for 401k, what would my take home pay be each pay check? I've tried paycheck calculators but I was hoping for someone else to verify the numbers I got (~$1860/paycheck). Deductions from income would be the standard deductions on every check (Federal Tax, Social Security, Medicare) and 401k deductions.
-If I contribute an additional 1%, company matches .5% for every 1% (caps off at my 3%, company 1.5%) (talking about the 401k). My plan was to contribute the bare minimum of 3% for at least the 1st year.Good idea/bad idea? I've got a longways before retirement hence this question.
  -My reasoning for this is so I can have more money to pay off loans and have extra cash flow for any other emergencies. 
-Any suggestions to make sure I can get a good hold of my finances now? I had the mindset of ""fuck it, ill pay it back later"" for all of my loans throughout college so I never budgeted or cared about my spending habits in college so any advice is helpful!
-Are there any other costs that I could potentially incur (just trying to get a different perspective)? Food, gas, and entertainment would come out of my take home pay (after rent and car) and I'm good about my spending habits when it comes to these 3 (i.e I know how much to spend on these 3 categories a month and I can control the spending). 
-While I do have some time to start paying my loans off, should I start payments now or wait until the grace period is over? The pros of holding off would be more money saved up, cons is more interest built up (although this amount wouldn't be over the top expensive). 
  -I also thought about holding off on payments but paying off whatever interest is already accured with any extra cash I have so my future payments would go directly toward the principal plus the interest for each month. Good idea/bad idea?",finance,1373687200
personalfinance,"Incoming freshman in college, feel like I'm missing something...","Hi-ho, /r/personalfinance.

I think you've probably caught bits of my story since I've posted here before and mentioned it in other threads, but I feel like I could use some ""you're on the right track"" confirmation. So here goes:

As the title goes, I'm starting my first year of college in September. I'll be living in the dorms at my college in Boston (COF represent, woo). My financial aid is very generous, but my parents were never able to save up much money (working-class) and it was agreed upon early on that education was a personal investment that I was 100% responsible for. My mom is co-signing my private loans and has excellent credit; however, the rate on my loans still suck because private loans suck. I just mailed in one last scholarship for $600, but my bill hasn't been updated. If nothing happens to my financial aid, my loan amount for this year in private loans will be $11336. I also received max sub loans and max work study.

However, even though work study was given to me in my package, it is understandably not included in my bill (gotta earn it first!). When I was crunching the numbers I did not account for this, and now I have this work study money that I feel is not necessarily worthless, but let's put it this way...I have no idea how to make it ""work for me"" (borrowing a term from my PF class junior year) for best results. I've been working my ass off for a year and saving my money to pay for books, supplies, clothes, subway passes, and ""fun things"" (essentially, all personal expenses) during my first year, with the expectation that my personal checking account would take a beating but I would have my guaranteed summer job to fall back on. I had thought that I would put my work study money towards my loans, but I am confused as to whether this is the purpose of work study - it seems like it's intended as living expenses while on campus. 

So by the end of my first year (not semester), this is what I will be looking at in loans, not factoring in interest:

1980 @ 6.8% (fed unsub)

3464 @ 6.8% (fed sub)

11336 @ 7.4% APY (initial rate 8.15%) (private; additional .25% off for automatic deduction not included. .5% employee pricing and account ownership already factored in)

I cannot look at the loan terms right now, but this is a 15 year deferred repayment plan, with a monthly payment of roughly $150/mo. I picked this because it would allow me to make payments at my leisure without crippling monthly repayment. The goal is to be debt-free long before the 15 years is up (10 is my goal). I was thinking that I should just ignore my sub loans while in school, and annihilate my unsub loans each semester before they get a chance to do much. That would take up pretty much all of my work study money. I don't think it would leave me with enough to touch the private loans.

However, it's also worth noting that I'm in a 5-year MAT program, and when I'm done i'll have an undergrad liberal arts major (history) and a master's in teaching. Grad school is inevitable, so by my calculations i'll be looking at ~100k to repay by the time I'm done with school. I was planning on putting my federal loans in IBR, getting PSLF (i'll graduate undergrad in 2017 so we'll know if it works by then), and getting $5,000 forgiven through the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program. In other words, what I'm asking here is whether it's still wise to pay off the unsub'd Stafford loans given the double-threat of forgiveness + IBR. I'll be taking as many federal loans as I possibly can unless the interest rates skyrocket to something even more horrible than 6.8/7.9%.

Also, finances right now:

$1900 on hand (graduation gifts)

$2400 in checking account

$725 in savings account

~ $250 bi-weekly paycheck (summer job, at least 3 more coming)

CC - never greater than $50 balance, pay off in full at the end of month (AU on dad's credit with a card in my name - thinking of getting a secured CC from bank)

There is no way I would burn through all of this in my first year - I could definitely stretch what I have right now across two whole years. I'm pretty thrifty by necessity and reading /r/pf has helped in that regard. You guys are pretty cool and I like you a lot. Maybe someday, when I'm not buried under a landslide of debt, I can have nice retirement funds and whatnot.


So how am I doing, r/PF? Am I missing anything major in this grand plan of mine (which is admittedly not so grand considering debt - however, this is the best package I got and it's cheaper than public state U and on par with CC)? Will I drown in debt for the rest of my life (unbury.me says no)? Is there anything I should be doing differently, besides accumulating lots of debt for a worthwhile degree?

business,"BP seeks reversal, says settlement easy set up for fraud","http://legalnewsline.com/issues/bp-oil-spill/242686-bp-seeks-reversal-says-settlement-easy-set-up-for-fraud

NEW ORLEANS (Legal Newsline) — Attorneys for BP claim a judge’s ruling has allowed payments for fictitious claims from the 2010 oil spill, and they are asking a federal appeals court to reverse the decision. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans will hear arguments Monday from BP and Gulf Coast businesses. BP says U.S. District Court Judge Carl Barbier and the court appointed claims administrator have misinterpreted the settlement.

“The result is that thousands of claimants that suffered no losses are coming forward in ever-increasing numbers, seeking and obtaining outrageous windfalls and making a mockery of what was intended to be a fair and honest court-supervised settlement process,” company attorneys wrote in their brief for the hearing.

Washington-based attorney Theodore Olson is expected to present BP’s case and answer questions from the judges during Monday’s hearing.

After the settlement was approved last year, Barbier appointed Lafayette, La., attorney Patrick Juneau to take over the process of evaluating and paying claims.

The attorneys for the oil company say Juneau made a decision, approved by Barbier, that is allowing claimants to manipulate the process.

Awards to businesses are based on a comparison of their revenue and expenses before and after the oil spill. But BP says claimants are choosing time periods for comparison that will result in losses and higher payouts.

“Such ‘losses’ reflect nothing more than arbitrary cash-flow computations or incorrect recording of revenue and expenses — not actual economic performance,” their attorneys wrote.

BP cited a $21 million payout to a Louisiana rice mill that earned more revenue in 2010 than it did in the previous three years as an example of how the settlement can be manipulated.

Plaintiffs’ attorneys however, say BP agreed that the claims administrator should be the one to determine the compensation framework and now simply has a case of ‘buyer’s remorse.”

BP attorneys say that there will be a “black mark on the American justice system” if the appeals court doesn’t overturn Barbier’s ruling.

James Dennis, Edith Brown Clement and Leslie Southwick are the 5th Circuit judges assigned to the case.

business,The housing appraisers warned us about the crisis,"http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2013/07/housing-appraisers-warnings-fraud-crisis.html

On July 9, 2013 I participated in a radio interview with a lobbyist for the 100 largest financial firms.  The San Francisco radio program host asked me what question I would ask the lobbyist and I said that any discussion should begin with allowing him to state his view of what caused the crisis.  In the course of his explanation, he bemoaned the fact that there was no warning about the crisis.

I found this ironic because I had just published that morning an article about how the appraisal profession warned us that the senior officers controlling the mortgage lending firms were engaged in pervasive “accounting control fraud.”

That article discussed the ten logical implications about the developing fraud epidemic that any competent financial regulator could have explained to FBI agents and Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) on the basis of the facts contained in these two sentences:

“From 2000 to 2007, [appraisers] ultimately delivered to Washington officials a petition; signed by 11,000 appraisers…it charged that lenders were pressuring appraisers to place artificially high prices on properties. According to the petition, lenders were ‘blacklisting honest appraisers’ and instead assigning business only to appraisers who would hit the desired price targets” (FCIC 2011: 18).

Note that the appraisers’ petition began in 2000 and was public.  When the regulators and prosecutors did nothing in response to the appraisers’ warning the appraisers delivered it to government officials to ensure that no one could say they were not warned.  What tends to be forgotten is that the mortgage industry’s leaders did nothing to restrain the fraud epidemic and a great deal to expand it.  A finance industry representative claiming in 2013 that no one warned the industry of the coming crisis when the warnings began no later than 2000 epitomizes the industry’s death of accountability, integrity, and candor.

Any of the following federal actors could have responded to the appraisers’ warning and prevented the crisis: the Federal Reserve, the FBI/Department of Justice, the lenders’ CEOs, the secondary market purchasers’, Clayton and the other “due diligence” firms, the lenders’ and secondary market purchasers’ internal and external auditors, the credit rating agencies, the SEC, Congress, and President Bush.  Several of the state Attorney Generals had sufficient staff to prevent the crisis.  The industry and federal leaders took no effective action.  The states took two major actions against appraisal fraud, but neither was effective because they never understood the significance of the facts they found.

personalfinance,Student Loans vs. Retirement Savings,"Hi everyone!

Posted here a few months ago about wanting to buy a house; quickly realize I could not buy a house.  Thanks for the kick in the pants to get myself in action about getting rid of my debt.  I am currently on plan to have 100% of credit card debt paid off by November 2013. I think I can do it quicker than that, but that is worst case scenario!

Now, to my question...

I have a few retirement accounts (from previous job and current job).  One has ~$11k and the other just shy of $4k. Not much... but better than nothing.

My current employer does NOT match any 401k contributions.  However, we do get bonuses 3-4x per year (around $300-500ea) and then our annual salary bonus (up to $10k, but usually around $6k).  We have an option to put these bonuses directly into our retirement accounts and we do not get taxed.  I currently have 50% of each bonus going into my retirement account.

I am only contributing 4% pre-tax every paycheck to my retirement. 

I need some advice; should I increase the amount I contribute per paycheck to my retirement, increase bonus checks to 100% to retirement, or use all of that extra money towards paying off my student loans (with a 6.8% interest rate, about $40k). 

Any advice would be appreciated!  Also - if I missed anything or you would like more information, please let me know.  I am clueless when it comes to this stuff.",finance,1373841220
personalfinance,Financial advice regarding student loans?,"I am a current medical student on full student loans. My mother, bless her hard-working heart, pays off the interest on my loans every month. I've tried to tell her not to do that, but she is very caring for me and very stubborn and will not stop helping me as much as she can. She promised to stop after I graduate when I will be making enough money to go on the federal income-based repayment program. My parents are in the upper-middle class and aren't starving because of paying off my loans, but I know their retirement is going to be postponed due to this and I feel guilty knowing that my father should be out golfing and my mom gardening, instead they work intensive jobs that I know stress them greatly. Also, I had a full scholarship for undergraduate, so I did not accrue any debt during those years. This is just in regard to my graduate school debt. 

Anyways, that's the backstory that I felt obligated to post along with a request for financial advice from my mother. She pays off all interest on my loans every month but was considering changing to paying off the principal. She calculates she can pay off some principal each month for 10 months at which point she would have paid off an entire Grad Plus loan(highest interest). Loans are disbursed in trimesters at my school, therefore she would pay one of three Grad Plus loans that would accrue. Should she switch to this method, or should she continue to pay off the interest on the loans each month? The interest is compounding on the loans, therefore, up to this point, I have no interest owed, just the principal of the loans. I believe it would be wiser to pay off the interest since that is what usually screws people over in the end. Then again, I am not finance-privy, so I was looking for advice. I don't have exact numbers on the interest that accrues each month, but I will get that if it is necessary to calculate the best strategy.

personalfinance,Advice on paying off debts &amp; investing for a recent grad?,"Hey, everyone, I'm just looking for some advice about how to best tackle my student loans, car loan, and medical bills. Here are the details:

* 5 year car loan, currently 3 years in, with $4,250 left at 5.19%. Monthly payment is $240 a month, but I've been paying more than that and my next payment is technically not due until November.
* Student loans, $7,500 total from 5 loans, all unsubsidized at 6.8%. I paid a large chunk last month ($1,250) which was all applied toward the principal. I don't technically have a payment due until next February because of this, but I want to tackle this one first because of the higher interest rate.
* Medical bills: $1,750 left to pay, no interest, but minimum payment of $100/month was agreed upon. This is obviously of the least concern, but is still a part of my budget.

As far as my other expenses (around $500/month):

* Currently not paying any rent or utilities
* Around $100-150 per month on food
* $60/month car insurance
* $70/month phone
* $70/month gas
* Maybe $200 a month on other various things (entertainment, home/personal care, car maintenance, etc.)
* I'm putting away around $100 a month for taxes at the end of the year, as I received some annuities that I have to pay taxes on.

I'm earning around $1,600 to $1,800 per month depending on how many hours I actually get. I also have around $10,000 in a savings account, plus an emergency fund, plus a decent chunk in a 5-year CD.

So, at the moment, I have $900 a month (maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less) that I can apply to my car loan and/or student loans (and the medical bills, but I see no incentive to pay that off until last). Should I go all in for the student loans at the moment, and leave my car payment until November because of the slightly lower interest? Should I also dip into my savings account to achieve this?

Also, any advice on starting a Roth IRA and/or a low-risk investment? In a 3-1/2 years, I'll be able to invest quite a bit (CD will be mature, I should have these loans paid off, possibly making some more money), though some of it may be going toward a house at that time.

Forex,The Tale of USD/CHF and the 200 Week Moving Average,"This has been pointed out by a few analysts I follow. I don't usually use moving averages on this kind of scale, but the significance of this one is... well... significant. 

The reason I consider it especially important is because USD/CHF is inversely correlated with EUR/USD, and tends to be a good barometer of USD strength in general. 

Here's a daily chart, with the 200WMA in white, and the current range we're in: http://i.imgur.com/6lP30hB.png

This pair has not managed a weekly close above the 200WMA since at least 2006 (my chart won't plot the MA further back, but it looks like it carries on forever).  It tested it twice this month, and the recent Bernanke bomb dashed the second attempt on the rocks.

Here's looking in a little closer, with support and resistance levels added.  The blue trendlines are the most recent inside range trends.  This pair is one that tends to obey support-turned-resistance (and vice versa), so previous trendline resistances are of interest for support:

http://i.imgur.com/yc9WQIK.png

The drastic failure to close above the 200WMA makes me hesitant to look for longs here, and points to further general USD weakness over the coming days and weeks. 

However, on the 4hr chart you can see we're finding some support at a previous trendline:

If this medium-term trendline breaks, I would look to short on a retest of 0.9400/25 with a stop above 0.95, and a final target of 0.92 and soft targets at 0.9350 and 0.9275 or something.

If we hold here and bounce, I would look to short about 100 pips above the 200WMA, after some kind of failure in the 0.9750 area.  That would be a great setup for a move down to 0.93 or thereabouts (first target at the 200WMA, just in case it retests it for a final time before breaking above).

I believe that once the fed actually announces some kind of tapering, this moving average will break and it will never be seen again.  Until then, I am going to buy the trendline at the bottom, and sell the range top (I'm not going to wait for it to break back below the 200WMA again, because it has done so very reliably in the past).

Any thoughts/comments?  Any levels you guys are looking at here?

I'm long term bullish USD, but I believe we're going to see some USD weakness coming up. EUR/USD doesn't move 400 pips (even in thin liquidity) for nothing. The slight USD strength we saw on Thursday and Friday is probably just profit taking.  Once we get to support in the majors (could already have been found), I think we'll get the next leg of USD weakness.

The only place I wouldn't sell USD is against AUD, NZD and CAD.",finance,1373828014

Think about it. You, as a Union soldier, fighting on the massive battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam. Thousands of your countrymen fighting beside you,  as well as against you. Brother vs. Brother. Smoke fills the air as artillery shells explode above you. It's utter chaos. You run out of ammo, so you pull out your sword. Suddenly, you hear the drums sounding your retreat. 

Maybe you become separated from you platoon at some point, and you have to wander the woods of the rural south, avoiding Confederate detachments, surviving off the land. There's something ready to kill you at any moment, so you must always be prepared. It's like Ravenholm, but it actually happened.

Or, maybe you gain a command role. Suddenly, you have to use strategy, using ancient tactics to conquer the enemy. You become captain of a steamer and do battle with an ironclad in the Mississippi. Cut off supply lines and siege cities. Run secret missions.

personalfinance,Repaying a student loan while I'm still in school (and continuing to take out loans),"Hi PF!  I'm having trouble finding the answer to this question, and I thought someone here might know.  I might be making a mountain out of a molehill, so I apologize if this is a silly question.

I am a second-year vet student, and I took out too much money in federal student loans last year.  One of the loans is a federal direct PLUS, which has a small ($5,505) principle, but a higher (7.9%) interest rate.  I have received enough non-loan money (from jobs and my amazing mom) over the past year to pay off everything that I owe for this loan (now $6,000 total), but I am still in school and continuing to take out student loans to pay for my education and living expenses.  All of my loan and non-loan money is in the same account, so I technically will not be able to *prove* which category the repayment money comes from.  Because of this, and because there are rules about what student loans can and can't be used for, I am afraid that someone will think that I am using one loan to pay off another and I will be penalized.  


Is this a realistic thing to be worried about?  Paying off this one loan now will save me money in the long run, but I don't want to do it if it could get me into trouble on a technicality.",finance,1373767193
personalfinance,Is investing at X% really the same as paying down an X% loan?,"I read this a lot: for any given dollar, just compare the interest rate of your loan to the estimated rate of return of your investment to figure out where to put it. Return is never guaranteed, so unless the interest rate on the loan is low, it’s better to pay off the loan. 

This doesn’t feel right. I have no math background at all, so here goes my back of the envelope try at it--I’d be interested to read your responses.

Let’s say you get $1000.

Case 1a: you have no debt, and invest at a guaranteed 7% rate of return for ten years. You end up with [$1967.15](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%241000+at+7+percent+for+ten+years), a net of $967.15.

Case 2a: you have a $1000 debt at 7%, and pay it off immediately and do nothing else. Immediately, and at the end of ten years, you’re out $1000, but you also avoided paying $[393.30](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%241000+loan+at+7%25+for+ten+years) in interest. So you effectively net $393.30, no?

Now factor in the fact that you have debt in both cases, and you have to pay it off regardless of investing that extra $1000 or not. 

Case 1b: $10,000 loan at 7% for ten years. Pay off $1000 of it (+393.30),  and then the rest of the loan [(-$12,540)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%249000+loan+for+ten+years+at+7+percent). This nets -$12,146.7.

Case 2b: $10,000 loan at 7% for ten years. Invest $1000 (+967.15), then pay off the loan [(-$13,933)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2410000+loan+for+ten+years+at+7+percent). This nets -$12,965.85.

This results in a difference of $819.15 between the two strategies, advantage to paying off the loan rather than investing.

Now factor in a longer time horizon, beyond the end of the loan.

Case 1c: Case 1b, but after ten years, you have nothing invested. So, you invest what you would have paid toward the $10,000 loan each month ($116) for ten years, yielding [$19,842](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%24116+a+month+for+ten+years+at+7%25), or a net, after 20 years, of $7,695.3 (Case 1c - Case 1b).

Case 2c: Case 2b, and invest monthly what you were paying toward the loan ($116) for another ten years. The $1000 grows to [$3869.68](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%241000+at+7%25+for+20+years), and the monthly investing yields $19,842, for a total of $23,711.68, or a net, after 20 years, of $10,745.83 (Case 2c - Case 2b).

Now this suggests the opposite: advantage to investing rather than paying off the loan. 

And now I get bogged down in factoring in the fact that investment returns aren’t guaranteed.

I’d love a final answer as to what to do, but doesn’t this show that it isn’t as simple as comparing rates?

Specifically regarding my retirement funds, I'm in 100% equities (some US domestic and some international.

I've read some other posts but I'm not really finding what I needs, but if I have missed some sound advice, please feel free to send a link my way! :) 

OK here goes... My main goal is to pay off my high interest Sallie Mae private loan. The loan was originally $15,000 but I have paid it down to 8928.09. The interest is 12.25% (yikes!) so it has taken quite some time to get it down to where it is now. My minimum monthly payment is $341.14 and I can afford to pay about $200 more a month, but I'm not sure when or how to pay it. 

So, I guess my question is; Should I apply the $200 on the same day my direct payment comes out or apply it at the beginning of the month as a separate payment? 

Secondly, I have about 20,000 in other student loans, (one 12,500 federal loan and the other's a 7500 private loan. Both have fairly low interest). My plan is to pay off Sallie Mae and then start doing the same tactics with my other loans to get out of debt completely in the next 3 years.

investing,On the performance of hedge funds vs. index funds,"Upfront disclaimer:  I am an engineering student at an American university who is currently an intern at a bank.  I have been obsessed with finance since my senior year of high school, and plan on working in finance after college.  This is a throwaway account because I prefer to have very little personal information on my actual account for privacy reasons.

I joined the investing subreddit a little while ago, and have pretty much been a lurker minus a few posts here and there.  I would like to use this post to discuss the widespread negativity towards hedge funds.  I am a bit biased in that I would like to work for a hedge fund one day, but I will try to be as objective as possible and am by no means claiming that I am right.  I would just like to provide the other side of the argument:

As I’m sure most of you know, we have seen an unprecedented expansion of the monetary base by the Federal Reserve since 2008 known as [Quantitative Easing]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing).  Since the bottom of 2009, the S&amp;P 500 Index has increased in value from [676 to 1683](http://i.imgur.com/VN4UXsn.gif) (as of 4:00pm ET), which is a return of almost 150%.  

There has been an increasing amount of scrutiny from both news outlets and retail investors about the hedge fund industry, and how the returns do not justify the exorbitant fees.  Many examples use the industry's performance against the S&amp;P 500 as proof that they are not worth the money.  It is very much true that the hedge fund industry has under-performed the stock market in recent years.  [This graph](http://i.imgur.com/h38Ly1v.gif) plots the most widely used proxy for hedge fund returns from [HFRX](https://www.hedgefundresearch.com/hfrx_reg/index.php?fuse=login_bd) against the S&amp;P 500 since the bottoms of 2009.  However, that is not a reasonable comparison.  Some hedge funds are long-biased equity funds, but most are not, which means comparing returns to the S&amp;P is in many cases comparing apples and oranges.  

By definition, hedge funds are ""hedged"", which means they have positions that ideally benefit from both upward and downward swings in the markets.  Although many still do outperform the market during up years, it's the down years in the market that hedge funds tend to provide the most [alpha](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp), which is a risk-adjusted measure of performance against a benchmark.  The most recent crash is a great example of this; [here](http://i.imgur.com/Z8DhUJZ.gif) is a graph of hedge fund returns vs. the S&amp;P 500 during the heights of the financial crisis.  As you can see, the S&amp;P 500 reached less than half of its value from the peak, while overall hedge funds never went below about 77% of their peak.

Looking further in the past to 1998 (the first full year the HFRX Index existed), we can see that hedge funds have [pretty handily outperformed](http://i.imgur.com/AfKKM4s.gif) the wider stock market, even after fees.

So what has caused hedge funds to perform so poorly recently?  Well, for starters, the markets are becoming more efficient every day, and it is much harder to find low-risk-high-reward trades today than it was even 5 years ago.

However, the cause of most of this lack of alpha is undoubtedly the intervention of the Federal Reserve in the markets.  Institutional investors tend to have greater returns during periods of higher volatility, and during times where individual stock picks do not correlate very closely with the broader market.  Since the financial crisis, the correlation of individual stocks with the broader market has gone from a range of 40-60% to a range of 60-80%.  [Here is a graph](http://i.imgur.com/rjJjUta.png) of the implied correlation of stocks within the S&amp;P 500 since 2007, with the beginning and end of each round of Quantitative Easing labeled for convenience.  

During periods of QE, hedge fund traders have a harder time gaining any kind of edge unless they try to predict the policy decisions of the Federal Reserve, since that is the major driver of the market.  Since the S&amp;P 500 Index has performed so well with the extra liquidity, and so many of the assets that make up the index have moved in tandem with it, institutional investors have had a very hard time finding that edge that they charge the big bucks for.

So, in conclusion, I believe the data shows that the recent abysmal performance of hedge funds relative to the stock market is a result of the extreme outperformance of equities and the high correlation between assets.  I also believe that hedge funds will definitely see a reduction in the fees they will be able to charge over the next few decades, but the top funds will most likely still be justified in making fortunes in the markets.

This post is intended to hopefully dispel some of the myths that have been thrown around in this subreddit, but also to start a conversation about actively vs. passively managed assets.  Please criticize anything I say that you disagree with, but try to provide some sort of evidence for your claims so I don't have to Google around too much, and so I can hopefully respond with something equally insightful.  Thanks!

**EDIT**: I knew I would screw something up in this.  My graph of the implied correlation of stocks doesn't have QE3 labeled.  It started in September of 2012 and is still going today.

**EDIT2**: Some people have correctly pointed out that Hedge Funds are not necessarily ""hedged"".  I don't know why I phrased it the way I did, because Hedge Funds are such a broad category nowadays that they aren't necessarily hedged at all.  I should have said Alternative Investment funds.",finance,1373923166

I am in medical school right now, but I worked for a year before starting and have  some money saved up from that.  I was thinking of using that for school instead of taking the full amount of the federal loan with an interest rate of 6.8%.  However, someone suggested that I should invest this money in some mutual funds because I can potentially have gains greater than the 6.8% interest of the loans.

personalfinance,Questions on consolidating federal student loans -- facts inside,"Hello, personal finance redittors. 

I was told by my friend that I might want to consolidate my four loans, but he couldn't successfully convince me exactly why I would want to do that.  I have two Direct Sub Stafford loans and two Direct Unsub Stafford loans. They were all disbursed for my graduate study, so the interest rate is 6.8% for all four loans (and this is where my questions stem from).

1) If all of my loans have the same interest rate, does it matter if I consolidate?  I'm not really looking to spread out the payments over a longer period of time.

2) When I used the consolidation calculator provided by the Borrower Services, the interest rate on consolidation loan would be 6.875%.  Why is it more than 6.8%?

3) Any ideas on how I can reduce interest rates? Once I figure out whether or not to consolidate, I am going to enroll in direct debit which will reduce my interest rate by 0.25%.  It's been one year since I made my first payment and I have been always on time.  Do you think just one year of payment history can help me negotiate?

personalfinance,Loan from TSP for school a dumb idea?,"Howdy, this is a “am I crazy to be doing this” post. Here’s the situation: 
35 y/o federal government worker, earning about $57K / year. I am in school for my doctorate to the tune of $630 a month (taking one class at a time). I can just swing that if I skimp on eating out and such. Here’s the issue, Furloughs. I will be taking 11 forced unpaid days of leave this summer, which will cost me about $1,750 (net). I can’t do that AND school. 

I naturally looked into taking a semester (3 months) off of school, but I would suffer for that. I am grandfathered into a 45 credit-hour to graduate program (I have finished 9 so far). But, my program has since been shifted to a 60 hour program, meaning if I take a semester off I will no longer be grandfathered in and will need 15 more credits (about $9,500). 

So, taking a semester off isn’t a possibility. There is also no financial aid possible because I am only taking one class at a time. 

The plan? Take a $1,500 loan from my TSP (government retirement plan) to cover the gap. I will have to repay that (to myself) with interest but I think I can swing those payments.

economy,My dinner with Paul Volcker to discuss post-scarcity economics of The Technocopia Plan [UPDATE],"To begin with [PROOF](http://imgur.com/a/7yqTV)

This was the meeting described in [this post from 3 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/1arzzd/1er_here_that_won_an_auction_benefiting_the_rfk/). It turned out that due to health problems the fishing trip got boiled down to a long dinner conversation, but that was ok because I can not fish worth a damn.

As a preface, I was given this opportunity because /u/m0rph3u5 thought my project [The Technocopia Plan](http://code.google.com/p/the-technocopia-project/wiki/About_Technocopia) would produce an interesting conversation.

The meeting began with a discussion of robotics. One of the contracts my company does is for control systems for [neurosurgery frameworks](http://aimlab.wpi.edu/research/) (skip to 0:33 in the video). A friend of his has cerebral palsy so i was able to discuss with him how the robotic assisted therapy works. From there we segued into robotics and automation of the economy. 

I laid out the basic thesis from [Race Against the Machine](http://www.amazon.com/kindle-store/dp/B005WTR4ZI) in that the rate at which we are eliminating jobs is faster then a human can be trained for any new job. I then further claimed that projects like the Technocopia Plan and [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/) will leverage the community of labor to design the new manufacturing backbone. On top of that, the Technocopia plan is aiming to eliminate mineral sources in favor of carbon based materials synthesized from CO2 (and other air gasses plus trace minerals from seawater). The result will be free and open designs, free and open manufacturing equipment, and free and effectively infinite (emphasis on effectively) material source streams. (since this is not a tech sub, i will spare you all the details of how that will work)

The response was surprising. In response to ""It seems we just have more people than are needed to make ever increasing productive capacity, and that divergence can only accelerate thanks to the technology coming online now"", Mr Volcker responded ""You have put your finger on the central problem in the global economy that no one wants to admit"". This confirmation from the top of the banking system literally made my heart skip a beat! (I have a heart condition, so that was not hard though)

We then discussed ideas like disconnecting a citizens ability to exert demand in the economy from employment, since it is now clear that there is no longer a structural correlation between them. We discussed Basic Income and the Negative Income Tax (Milton Friedman), as transitory frameworks to allow for the development and rollout of Technocopia abundance machines.  As a confirmation that Mr Volcker was not just nodding along, when i misspoke about how the Friedman negative income tax, i was quickly and forcefully corrected. I had accidentally said everyone gets the same income, but what i meant was that everyone got at least a bare minimum, supplemented by negative taxes. This correction was good because it meant he was not just being polite listening to me, he was engaged and willing to correct anything he heard that was out of place. 

Over all, Mr Volcker was a really nice guy, and somewhat surprisingly, he was FUNNY. He made jokes and carried on a very interesting conversation. Even if he had not previously been the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, i would have enjoyed my conversation with him.

investing,Finding Strength Amidst Weakness,"Retail sales weren’t anything to shout about yesterday. The diminutive 0.4% increase was driven only by a 1.8% increase in auto-purchases. This stall in momentum definitely raises questions about overall economic growth – especially on the heels of slow-down talk during the Fed meeting last week.

However, if the Russell 2000’s ascension is anything to go by, there are companies to watch within the small-cap retail space. And even with its impressive run, the index is still well off of its highs from back in 2007. As long as the Fed keeps its current policies in place, I’m predicating substantial headroom.

What’s more, mediocre retail sales coupled with other somewhat stagnant numbers should keep the Fed (and for that matter, Fed-speculation) in-line with continued bond-purchases. That’s good news for retail plays that do show strong sales and upward-promise.

I’ve got my eye on one in particular today: $CROX.

The company that used to be a stalwart in the heinously ugly shoe-sector has undergone a bit of re-invention lately. Its clogs still generate upwards of 47% of total revenue, but Crocs Inc. has decidedly more diverse product offerings to give to consumers – more than 300 styles.

The company’s now effectively tapping into surging international sales and has seen a steadily increasing share price since 2008…when it was trading as low as $1. Even still, it’s well priced by a number of fundamental ratios. It’s also got a safe balance sheet with minimal debt and a strong cash portion.

The technical picture could soon prove more than intriguing too. Share price just took a bit of a dip and tagged the 50-day MA (well off of the 200-day). I’m still looking at a clearly defined ascending channel since late November, with resistance at around the $18 dollar level coming up shortly.

Should $CROX hit that level with volume confirmation, we could see an extended breakout. This is especially possible because the fundamental picture suggests room for appreciation. 

Rationale:

Some of the best technical pictures are drawn on the backs of solid fundamentals and market momentum. At the end of the day, $CROX is still a value play and presents a good risk/reward ratio. Balance sheet strength coupled with the recent discount of a still-building technical case spell an opportunity to hop onto this profitable trend.

I have $7,500 in unsubsidized federal student loans from the first three years of my undergraduate career. I have one more year left of undergrad, during which I will not acquire any more debt. Because my loans are unsubsidized, I am accruing interest while in school. I felt that it was a good idea to pay off this interest every month. So, I took my principal balance and figured out how much interest I would accrue every month, and set up auto-pay so that amount would be taken out of my checking account monthly.

So, I have two options. I can either apply this payment as a ""refund,"" which reduces my principal balance and recalculates interest, or I can apply this payment as a ""payment,"" which would go directly toward the interest, leaving the principal balance untouched. Which of these will save me more money in the long run? For some reason, I cannot seem to wrap my head around this, and I'd appreciate some advice.

I am wondering if I should start making payments toward the principal or interest, and if it would even be worth it for me. I can only afford to pay somewhere between $50 and $100 every month right now. I have a part time job that pays me $8/hr though when I work nights, I get $8.75. 

So, do you think I should let this stew until I graduate and have a 'real job', or start chipping away at it now?",finance,1373984527
personalfinance,Credit Score Advice.,"I'm not really sure if that's the best title to use but I do need some advice on the best way to handle my situation.

My current score is nearing 750, after years (six or more) of it being completely in the shitter. After maxing out on nearly credit card I had (roughly 12k) I'm down to about 2k across three cards. 

Here's my issue, according to creditkarma.com the biggest hindrance on my score is the average age of my accounts which is roughly 3 years.  I have nine credit cards, three of which I actively use (Chase Freedom, Discover, Best Buy Master Card), all of which have zero or low interest and rewards of some type. The other six, either have high interest or no rewards that make them worth using so they sit un-utilized.

My longest standing account (six years), which has the highest limit but also the worst interest rate, I don't use because of the interest rate and no rewards. 

My question is, how badly will closing some accounts (probably the aforementioned first) hurt my score?  Also, how long should I wait between closing accounts, or should I even close them at all?  I plan on moving into an apartment by the end of the year, and ideally I'd like to buy a new car next summer so I'd like to still have a great score next year to get the best possible rate for the car.",finance,1373983955
gaming,So I was thinking about the idea of one of the 3 protagonists in GTA being a cop.,"I think it would be pretty awesome, especially for the narrative.  But I think it would have to be like Reservoir Dogs, where you have no idea without little hints a long the way.

If you pay attention to the story, the characters involved, and how they respond to certain situations, as well as items placed in their house or something, then you might be able to guess.

But I think it has to be different each time.  Maybe this playthrough, one guy is the cop.  Maybe the next playthrough, a different guy is  cop, or maybe even an agent for some federal agency.  Change it up, keep it different, and keep us guessing.

As for the idea of him being a shitty cop because he is a sadistic fuck who kills people along the way, maybe it's like the movie Eastern Promises([where he's so far undercover, he will do whatever it takes for the case at hand, which also means we won't see it coming](/spoiler).

personalfinance,Thinking of drastically changing our savings plans to move to our dream location. Advice appreciated.,"So I will start off with our info:

We are both 24 and have steady jobs, currently we have a combined income of 121k which over the next 6-8 years will increase to over 180k.

Debt:

* Mortgage: 183k (home value of 215k, interest of 3.75)

* Cars: 24k (interest rates are 1.5, and 2.64)

* Student loans: 9k (5-6% interest rates, this number started at 35k)

Savings:

* 401ks: 35k
* IRAs: 12k
* Emergency fund: 7k

So as you can see in our 2 years working we have done pretty solid. Right now we are at a savings rate of over 50% when including the 401ks / IRA / paying down student loans.

We are thinking of paying off the student loans EXTREMELY aggressively first by only contributing to the match on our 401ks instead of what we are doing currently. (I am maxing my 401k currently).

Then once our student loans are gone we want to make huge over payments on our mortgage to build up equity. We want to get our mortgage loan down all the way to 130k.

Once this has happened 2-3 years from now we want to buy a condo in the city for around 300k. At that time we would go back to maxing 401ks and IRAs while hopefully making normal payments on a 3.75 interest rate loan. I would also sell my car at this point and we would share one which would be easy because I travel for work by plane. What do you guys think?",finance,1373978115

business,IMF and a Skewed Global Economy,"Harsh Realities

Acknowledging the sluggish pace of the global economy is the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) report. The report has degraded growth prospects for 2013 and identified three major threats to the global economy.

Coming within a month of the Fed’s hints at cutbacks in its quantitative easing (QE) program, the report sounds alarm bells. The report predicted a growth of 3.1% for the global economy in 2013 instead of the earlier estimate of 3.3%. Growth for 2014 was also revised from 4.0% to 3.8%.

Threats and Hazards

Apart from the persistent poor performance of Europe, the three major threats to the global economy are:

Possible slowdown in China as its central bank aims to cut liquidity to prevent overheating. The Chinese need to balance investment and consumption. Investment may decline before consumption recovers causing growth to fall below the forecasted level of 7.8% for 2013

‘Abenomics’ or the combination of huge fiscal stimulus, monetary easing, and structural reforms to stimulate the Japanese economy have eroded yen. This can make foreign investors demand compensation and inflation may reduce domestic consumption. However, Japan’s growth forecast has seen an upward revision to 2% in 2013 and to 1.25% in 2014

Hints of a gradual discontinuation of its QE program by the Fed. Emerging markets have been excessively dependent on Chinese growth and on exports to the U.S. paid back in cheap dollars. Now that the top two global economies adopt a more thrifty approach, emerging markets will feel the pinch. U.S. economy is estimated to grow at 1.7% this year and by 2.7% in 2014

Slower printing of dollars means lesser international depreciation of the dollar. Despite recent reversals of fortune, the dollar continues to be the reserve currency of the world and any appreciation in its value will redirect foreign investment from emerging markets to the U.S. economy.

For years now, emerging markets have neglected structural reform and infrastructure developments because a booming China and surplus dollars from U.S. provided the necessary drive. Asia, Latin America, and emerging Europe has clocked a meager 4% year-on-year growth in the first quarter of this year, the worst since the global economic crisis.

Common but Differentiated Measures

Economists expecting developing economies to drive global growth have been disappointed. Commodity exporters face pessimistic outlook as commodity prices decline. Weaker domestic activity, asset price volatility, and interest hikes by the developed world have further hurt emerging markets through currency depreciation, capital outflows, and equity price declines.

In a globalised world, this bodes ill for the entire global economy. The IMF expects growth in U.S. and eurozone to decline by 0.5% if the emerging markets slow down by 2%. Policy makes form all parts of the world, therefore, need to get their act together. IMF suggests the following remedies:

Major advanced economies must:

Balance short term growth with sustainable medium term public debt

Monetary stimulus should continue if inflation remains under control. Negative side-effects should be addressed through macro-policies and regulation. The duration of such stimulus must be clearly communicated to prevent market speculation

Recapitalize troubled assets of banks to keep the banking system operational. This applies equally for banks in the eurozone and in the U.S.

Eurozone should move towards a complete banking union, reduce fragmentation of financial markets, reform labor and product markets, and incentivize demand

Developing economies should continue monetary stimulus but in combination with macro-prudential policies and rationalized regulation to prevent escalation of inflation, currency depreciation and resultant flight of capital

For these measures to succeed, they must be placed in the overall setting of long-term structural reform. This is especially true for the developing world where unsupportive policy framework, infrastructure bottlenecks, and non-transparent regulation are a huge impediment for the establishment and operation of economically productive activities.",finance,1373976542

personalfinance,Parent Plus Loan or Private bank loan?,"So I'm posting not directed for me, but for advice on to go about my sister's education. My dad has had a falling out with my sister in the past year so my sister wants to go to an out-of-state college. She got accepted into UT and just came back from orientation. From the financial planning, the parent plus loan is 40k per year. I looked up online and saw not so many good comments about it and how it locked up parents into debt and such.

  
Now my parents have good credit. The interest rate for federal parent plus loan is ~7.9(?). I looked online at wells fargo and their interest rates can potentially be lower...and higher...depending on co-signer's credit. Now, the situation with my dad is he doesn't want to be held responsible for my sister's financial needs because of their falling out and her problems with changing her mind, etc - but she tells me she is focused when it comes to school and plans to work and get scholarships. 40k per year is a lot and I don't know full details of how the parent plus loan works, like when payments start and how long we are given to pay/grace period, etc. My sister has no credit/work history, so I'm afraid my dad will disagree with it since he will be held responsible if her schooling fails.

Åh baby det er en vild verden... og for at hjælpe dig med at få ved på mere end blot et smil, har vi samlet en handy how-to guide med tips om, hvordan du kan vælge din vej gennem nogle af verdens mest presserende problemer:


1.)Hvordan til at pakke som en udenlandske korrespondent

(Se billede ovenfor. Hvis du ikke kan se grafikken, prøv dette link.) Der er ofte en halv-pakket taske ved foden af sengen, breder ledninger og batterier som indvoldene af en renset beast. Undertiden et dyr ligger inden for — 12-årige feline ven Bernstein, Bernie for korte, vil krølle op i posen med bedrøvede øjne, der siger, ""Tag mig med dig næste gang."" Selvom hun er opkaldt efter en journalist, hun tydeligvis ikke kan lide min rejse.

--Michelle Shephard

2) Hvordan kan få hjælp i udlandet

Grunde til ikke at kalde en canadisk konsulat, når du er på en udenlandsk tur:
""Jeg har brug for en refill til min medicin.""

""Kan du få mig nogle ahornsirup for min pandekager?""

""Jeg vil ud af byen, kan du gå min hund?""

Disse kan lyde over toppen, men de er blandt de 215,000 konsulære anmodninger at canadiske embedsmænd får hvert år i vores diplomatiske stillinger i udlandet.

""For at hjælpe med at forberede canadiere, før de rejser, vi opfordrer dem til at overholde de tre Rs,"" siger udenrigsanliggender hjemmeside. ""Læse, registrere og nå os.""

Konsulater varierer fra land til land. Nogle er bemandet med hjælpsomme, sympatiske tjenestemænd, andre med dem, der arbejder til reglen. Men i sager om liv og død, alvorlige forbrydelser eller tabt dokumenter (men ikke kreditkort), et opkald til den nærmeste canadiske kontor er din første resort.

3) Hvordan til at få en date med mørkt stof

Du har brugt de sidste to år bøje dit sind omkring oplysninger om partikelfysik for at forstå det mest knudrede af nyhedshistorier, opdagelsen af Higgs boson. Du brugte din bosonic glans for at smelte datoer i putty-nørdet, nørdede kit.

Jeg har dårlige nyheder, Don Juan. Higgs er gjort. Higgs er slut. Higgs er ligesom partikel-fysik-pick-up-linje svarer til Hootie og Blowfish billetter.

Du har brug for en opgradering. Du har brug for billetter til Jay-Z, eller i hvert fald Coldplay.
Du har brug for mørkt stof.

Første, som baggrund: fysikere erklæret i marts at partiklen registreret otte måneder tidligere i Large Hadron Collider (LHC) er i virkeligheden Higgs boson. Mens der er stadig masser af vigtige videnskab at gøre, vil cocktail-party-oplivende samtale om Higgs sandsynligvis være mangelfuld for et stykke tid. For én, er LHC gået offline indtil 2015. Indtil da skal du sætte din Higgs koteletter på is.

I mellemtiden har jagten på mørkt stof taget top fakturering på listen over cool fysik projekter.

4) Hvordan man klæde sig som en diktator kone
Chanel suit pressede og klar til at bære? Check.

Christian Louboutin sko encrusted med krystaller og en overdimensioneret designer taske med krokodille? Check. Check.

Naturligvis til at finansiere garderoben, du har brug for en bankkonto, fedet op med kontanter stjålet fra din landets naturressourcer eller offentlige midler.

Olierigdom er at foretrække, men støtten penge fra velmenende vestlige lande afsat til børnenes uddannelse kan også gå en lang vej.

Dressing som en diktator kone tager ikke kun dedikation til de dyreste designere-som ganske vist ikke svært – men en uvilje mod at acceptere nogle brutale realiteter. Filippinerne Imelda Marcos akkumuleret sin berømte 1,220-par sko samling som sin mand, formand Ferdinand Marcos, erklæret undtagelsestilstand i 1972 og henrettet sine modstandere uden en retssag.

Mere nylig, Syriens smukt klædt førstedame Asma Assad (hun foretrækker Chanel) var drømmende på hvad Louboutin sko at købe online som sin mands snigskytter skød demokratiaktivister, der marcherede i Damaskus til at kræve politiske reformer.

Garderobeskabe diktatorer koner har altid afspejles overgreb af deres ægtemænd regimer. Michele Bennett, gift med tidligere haitianske despot Jean-Claude Duvalier, brugt $168,780 på tøj på Givenchy og $270,200 på kugler fra Boucheron mens hun var i eksil i Frankrig, ifølge Wall Street Journal.

Men den smart diktator kone ved, der er en anden lukrative tilbehør, der ikke kan købes på Paris Avenue Montaigne eller Bond St. i London: vedhæfte dig selv til en værdig sag, helst omkring kvinder og børns rettigheder, til at få positive tryk opmærksomhed i Vesten og aflede fra din mands forfærdelige menneskerettighedssituation. Egyptens tidligere førstedame Suzanne Mubarak kæmpede for slutter genital lemlæstelse af kvinder og vandt dynger af internationale priser.

5) Hvordan tale om Eurocrisis (som hvis du ved hvad du taler om)

Vil du imponere dine venner på cocktailparties med din tilsyneladende medfødte forståelse af den europæiske finansielle krise?

Følgende er en nybegynders guide til at forklare manglende europæiske ""gruppe kærlighed"" skattepolitik. Udspy ud disse visdomsord ved søen eller på terrassen over drinks og du vil blive en imponerende hit.

Først skal du forstå en simpel, overordnet sandhed: Europa virkelig har ingen idé om hvad det gør når det kommer til indeholdende den krise, der har ødelagt økonomien i en række lande.

Bemærk, hvordan uorganiseret EU ser i sin håndtering af opløsning økonomierne i Grækenland, Cypern, Spanien, Portugal, Italien og Frankrig? Se, hvordan britiske tiggede tidligere Bank of Canada guvernør Mark Carney at komme og redde dem?

""Den blinde leder blindt"" kommer til at tænke. Den Europæiske Union — en økonomisk og politisk organ af 28 nationer — lurches fra ene krise til næste og understøtter politikker, som nogle økonomer har kaldt ""umenneskelig.""

Gross [domestic](http://lockerz.com/u/jayson.krooger2525/decalz/26094798/the_haney_group_thehaneygroup_com_artic) product rose 7.5 percent in April-to-June from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing, equaling the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and down from 7.7 percent in the first quarter. June production growth matched the weakest pace since the 2009 global recession.

The slowdown may increase speculation that policy makers will act to safeguard their growth goal of 7.5 percent for the year even as Li signals reluctance to boost stimulus and tries to reduce financial risks. With the International Monetary Fund last week cutting its outlook for global expansion, Li’s administration faces limits on turning to exports for support.

“The new government under Mr. Li should be seriously worried about the prospect as to whether they can meet the growth target,” said Liu Li-Gang, head of Greater China economics at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong, who formerly worked at the World Bank.

Expansion (GDPNTTLY) should stabilize this quarter and may rebound in the following period “if monetary policy can quickly adjust to reflect the rapidly changing domestic and external environment and fiscal policy can be more active by targeting effective investment projects and technology upgrading,” Liu said. “Otherwise, the growth trajectory is heading to less than 7 percent.”

Here's my situation... it's probably not relevant, but whatever: 

* I'm being disowned because I'm transgender.  So I don't have a cosigner.

* My parents make a lot of money, and I don't qualify for federal loans.

* I'm disabled to the point that I can't work at a job where I have to stand, but I don't qualify for disability.  I'm currently unemployed and job hunting, but it's hard to find a job as a transgender student who can't stand up for more than 10 minutes.

* I only have to finish 2 semesters of undergrad, then 3 semesters of grad school.  State university, ~$5000 per semester including books and whatnot.  So, ~$25k for school, plus 2.5 years of some living expenses.  Once I have my bachelor's, I'll have more job opportunities, so I shouldn't have to use loans for most living expenses after 1 year.

* I'm studying social work to get into clinical therapy for trans/queer folk.  Depending on location, this can be profitable... my former therapist charges $100+ an hour, is always booked solid 2-4 months out, and works 5 days a week.  She has the same degree and qualifications that I'll have after grad school.  Although I don't expect to be that successful right out of school, I'm not worried. I'm against kids and marriage, and I prefer living frugally.  So I'm cool with being in debt for a while. :P


So, I'm just not sure where to begin looking.  Which places should I avoid like the plague?  Which places tend to have low rates and might be able to help me with the process?

personalfinance,Advice please for a family member facing financial ruin,"Hi all, I would love some advice on where to start with helping a close family member who is completely screwed financially. I apologize in advance for not having specifics, but the big ""intervention"" is not until this weekend.

Due to her own stupidity, ignorance, and unfortunately mental health issues, she is behind on everything possibly imaginable. For starters, she switched jobs last year and never realized that any taxes were not being taken out. So she owes federal, state, and possibly county taxes. She's behind on her mortgage, car (3 months from my understanding), credit cards, student loans, general bills, etc. If I would have guess at the total value of her debt it would be between 100K to 200K. She's getting multiple notices in the mail everyday and debt collectors are starting to call other family members in regards to her. To get a complete picture, she is in her late twenties and has had a steady, decent paying job for 5 years. I would guess she makes at least 50K a year in the medical field and probably has a little bit of 401K.

That being said, here are my questions:

personalfinance,should i open another line of credit?,"bankruptcy is just over a year out. within my first year i was forced to find someone that would work with me on a loan for a car and was lucky to find one. I was also approved for credit cards within the first year (outrageous interest rates and annual fees of course), got another one that's exclusively for healthcare and was just approved for another. The newest one was offered to me when i refinanced my auto loan (to a somewhat better rate) and it is the only one without an annual fee and has the lowest interest rate on it so i transferred my balances from the high interest rate cards to this card and put those ones away so that i wouldn't use them. Now i only have 2 cards with balances that i am making the monthly payments on and i have cards with a zero balance. From the research that i have done and what people have told me I am under the impression that if you have a lot of open credit it will hurt your credit score but if you have a lot of credit in general and keep an even balance so that you're only using 30-40% of available credit that it helps your credit score. is there any truth to this? if there is should i open another credit card with a lower interest rate and keep a small balance on it as well?

economy,"United States Senator, David Vitter Discusses The Safety of America From an Economic Standpoint","On this episode of Legal Lines, Locke Meredith discusses some of the threats to the United States economy with Senator David Vitter.  Vitter is the junior U.S. Senator from Louisiana.  He is a Republican, who prior to being elected to the United States Senate, served in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Louisiana’s first congressional district.

In this episode of Legal Lines, Vitter speaks of the “state of affairs” in Washington.  Vitter believes that America is tired of government by fiscal crisis and that Congress may experience a time of governing by avoiding crisis-like situations.  It is arguable that the U.S. is becoming economically weak, and that we are subject to troubling economic problems.  Vitter talks about the reality of these issues.

Vitter and Meredith discuss the issues that come with the continued influx on money into the U.S. economy through the Federal Reserve.  Vitter is concerned about this trend because a continued influx of money could quite possibly devalue the dollar and lead to inflationary pressure.  Vitter believes that the solution does not lie with increasing taxes, but rather by reduced spending.  Vitter goes on to speak about banks that are “too big to fail” and the problems, and possible solutions, regarding them.  He goes on to discuss Social Security programs in today’s economy and his efforts on the Environment and Public Works Committee.  

Vitter discusses a number of other topics with Locke Meredith in this informative episode of Legal Lines.  The episode can be viewed in its entirety on Locke Meredith’s YouTube channel.

My family has two credit cards. A series of bad timing events hit us this month. We ended up making a lot of big purchases that would otherwise be very spread out. 

I did the maths and I am $1000 short of paying both credit cards' full balance. I have enough to pay either one ($2500 vs $1500). In addition, one of my fixed-term deposit (with more than enough) would come into maturity ten days after the credit card payment deadline. 

Can you provide the best way to handle this problem? My dad thinks, worse comes to worst, he will take out a small loan for a month and pay the interest. Is there any other suggestions?

extra info: I have a bit of freedom with timing. Both bills come around the same time. So I pay one bill (card A) completely. Then withdraw enough from A to pay B. Finally, pay back the transfer on A when my investment comes in. Would this work? 

edit: Just to specify, my family comes from Asia. Not paying off the credit card bill completely is something we lose our sleep over. And why did we make more purchase than we can afford? 1. Bad timing 2. My dad puts every spare penny into fixed-term investment. 

edit 2: Thank you so much for your suggestions and pointers. For some unexplainable stupidity, I kept assuming that the interest rate would roll me over after one month of late payment. I will give them a call and see if there is some sort of grace period.",finance,1374093376

personalfinance,"""Paying off"" unsubsidized federal loans with subsidized federal loans... legal? Bad idea? Advice?","As the title suggests, I have some unsubsidized loans at the moment. The exact number is $7,285. I will be starting my final year at my undergraduate university in August. Despite having all of my tuition and fees paid for by the university, I took out the unsubsidized loan to support myself while I worked an unpaid internship, which maybe wasn’t the greatest idea in the world, but there aren’t a ton of paid internships in the public service sector, and it was a good opportunity with an organization that I enjoyed working for and learned a lot from. 

Anyway, back to the money. Since another one of my siblings started college this year, I’ve been offered $4,650 in subsidized loans, in contrast to all unsubsidized loans that I’d been offered in years past. I had no plans on taking out any more loans (I’m now working at a restaurant where I make about $14,000 per year, so there is no need to live off of loans). However, I want to take out these $4600 in subsidized loans and use them to “pay off” my unsubsidized loans. This way, I’ll only be accruing interest on $2,635 (instead of $7,285) of my loans during my last year of undergrad and three years of law school, a savings of over $300 per year and $1300 total over those four years.

Is this a bad idea? Is this legal?

**EDIT:** A lot of people are pretty shocked on why I'm not filing charges here. I will try my best to explain my reasoning, even though no doubt plenty of you will disagree with me. First of all, I still have siblings that live at home and rely on my parents for everything. What would happen to them if one of my parents had to go to federal prison for X amount of years for tax fraud? Or what would happen to them if my parents were racked with this massive fine? My sibling's lives could literally be ruined. Having a parent in prison has all sorts of consequences. Is my stolen $2,000 really worth all of that if the IRS and state gave me the money back? I do think that there should be more severe consequences for my parents. And I will never give them any trust again. But, it's not worth the risk of hurting the wellbeing of my siblings. However; if this ever happens again, I will press charges. Once is the limit here. I know it might be hard to understand, but it's easy to speak in hypotheticals, it's not as easy to actually act.

For those wondering about my parents' tax preparer, the IRS' investigation included him. However, I do not know what penalties if any he faced. Hope this helped!",finance,1374079741

[USA],"For a while (since late in high school) my parents gave me a start on my own finances while also teaching me how to budget by giving me students accounts and a credit card that piggy-backed off my dad's (very excellent) credit with me as an authorized user.  You can PM me if you are really interested in what the bank or arrangement was, but things have changed, and now it's the right time for me to come up with my own totally-independent credit card, checking, and savings solution.

I'm a grad student about halfway through my program, with small loan debt accumulating each year, and a small lump sum of scholarship money plus aforementioned loan money as my ""income"" each semester.  Living expenses only, I have a scholarship for tuition.

I have been preapproved for a BankAmericard Cash Rewards card recently.  I've heard bad things about the bank for being an evil corporation, etc, but mixed to good reports about this credit card.

My specific question is this: What bank should I be looking to, if not BoA, to add the other accounts along with the credit card, if this is the best one for me to accept?  I want to use a credit card for my main spending, both for the rewards points as well as the credit boost from responsible budgeting/treating it like a check card purchase.

My own research has led me to three major options:

* Accept the card offer and set up the e-checking and basic savings accounts with BoA, terrible savings interest rates but I could keep them free.

* Accept the card but set up savings and checking with Ally bank along with the BoA card, would allow for free checking and savings with better interest rates on the savings, but would lose the convenience of ""all under one roof"" (rather important to me as a busy student, fewer websites to check)

* And last, consider applying for a new card instead, and trying an equivalent unified solution somewhere like Chase.


I know credit unions are going to be brought up, and while I am willing to have my mind changed on the matter, my experience is that given that my place of residence will likely change semester to semester for the next while, credit unions might not be the best choice seeing as how localized they tend to be, emphasis of local branches instead of apps and web banking, etc.  But again, I am willing to have my mind changed.

The main indices are making record closes left and right, with the Dow adding 1000 points in just 17 days. This is no doubt a liquidity driven rally. After all, the fundamentals haven’t changed at all.

I currently have two conflicting thoughts on the roaring price action:

1. This rally is driven by momentum and could keel over relatively easily. Though I much enjoyed Ben Bernanke taking our clueless legislative representatives to school while adding fuel to the markets, caution is needed. One string of bad earnings reports could quickly dampen the mood.

2. The fact that the markets are making all-time highs isn’t necessarily a sell signal. Bears have been calling peaks at every sign of a minor retracement…and every time they’ve gotten crushed. Should we receive good earnings releases and continued positive sentiment there might be even more upside in the short-term.

Other than the approach of the heart of earnings season, there aren’t really clues as to where the market could turn next week. The coming week’s primary market movers (housing, durable goods, jobless claims, etc.) should only indicate trend continuations.

I’m expecting something of a flat line next week with few catalysts for a large turn-around on the horizon. However, markets don’t just camp out at all-time highs for long. I would like the uptrend to continue. But other than the Fed’s balance sheet, I don’t see the elements needed for a sustained high-percentage advance.

I'm a good student, so I'm hoping I can manage to get scholarships/grants to cover law school, but obviously that's not something I can count on.
* Medical: $600 from an emergency room visit (for a freaking flu test, ugh).

________________________
**First time home buyers account**  

This account allows savers to stash $3k/year in any type of account (checking, savings, CD, brokerage, etc).  The contribution is then considered a deduciton for *state* taxable income (so this does *not* help with federal taxes).  

The money that is placed in a first-time home buyer savings
account *and the annual interest earnings* are **not** subject to state income taxation.  This money can be applied toward eligible costs for the purchase of a single-family residence by a first-time home buyer.

**Medical Care Savings Account (MSA)**  

Same contribution limits and options as listed previously.  Can be used in conjuction with HSA or FSA (flex accounts), but again -- it is only a state deduction.  

If principal and earnings are withdrawn for payment of eligible medical care expenses or for long-term care of the account holder or a dependent, then the amounts are excluded from state income tax.  

I especially like this option becuse I can suppliment my annual ""use it or lose it"" FSA contribution.  I underestimated my costs for my FSA this year (which is a good thing), and I can literally open an MSA in the last week of December, deposit funds, then immediately withdraw the amount that equalled my additional medical expenses.  BAM, it is an instant tax deduction.  (Or I can continue to deposit $3k/year, use the deduction, let it grow, and use it for qualified expenses later in life.)  

____________
I realize that these two tips are not monumental (and may not apply at all if you don't have a state income tax).  IMO they are definitely worth looking into and are certainly worthwhile because both accounts apply to expendetures that nearly each of us will make.  This sub is dedicated to streamlining and maximizing our assets right?

personalfinance,"Need help with taxes, bills and 401k","Hi everyone, throwaway for salary purposes.

I'm a single newly graduated Computer Science BS making $70k a year. My withholding number is 2 for federal and 1 for California . My bi-weekly wages are about $1900, monthly rent + utilities at $1000. My only debt is about $2000 for multiple credit cards. I do not EVER plan to get charged interest since I'm also a mileage runner. I am a strictly credit card only person but I use them as charge cards.

My usual expense per month is around $1000. My expenses are fairly high in the $2000s as I am buying all new furniture and everything to settle into this new job in this new city. I am also recovering from a fairly expensive European post grad trip.

I wonder if I can adjust my withholding and 401k. I currently have 2 for both federal and California for withholding. I am putting 0 dollars currently to my 401k. My company matches 401k contribution by 25%. How can I legally change the amount paid to the government per period for the rest of the year and just owe them instead of getting a refund? 

I basically need a bit more money for 2 months while I pay off my interest free European trip (courtesy of parents).

After my budget is balanced out (3 months without adjustment, 1-2 months with adjustment), I would like to start contributing to my 401k. Maybe somewhere along the lines of $1000-$1500 per month. 

Is there a balanced point in which I have optimal taxes - 401k ratio?",finance,1374167785

personalfinance,Should I accept lower interest student loans I don't need and use the money to pay off higher interest student loans?,"My wife and I are entering our senior year of undergrad and will have just under $100k in combined student loan debt. Since we got married last year, our schools offered us much more in financial aid and she was actually offered enough grant money that we figured we could probably pay off whatever extra money her tuition was for the year on our own. Her Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans, however, were set up to automatically be applied annually unless she went in and cancelled/reduced the amount. Today, before we were told from her school exactly how much we would owe for the next year, her loans were dispersed and they say they cannot be cancelled after dispersion. We were planning on reducing/cancelling once we determined whether we could afford to pay out of pocket but now it seems too late. The loans are federal direct loans with interest rates of 6.8% and the amounts are 2750 in subsidized and 3500 in unsubsidized loans. She's freaking out and wants to throw a fit in her school's business/financial aid office tomorrow but I am starting to think it would be smarter to accept the loans and put them toward my Parent PLUS loans (my parents are not paying them, I just couldn't get accepted for any other type of loan) which are about a total of $40,000 at 7.9%. 

So is this error a blessing in disguise because we'll save money in interest or do you think the origination fees/additional loans are worth trying to get rid of?

personalfinance,"Currently $47,000 of debt for student loans. Payment deferred for 2 years until I leave graduate school. Should I start paying now?","Okay, I have a lot of information but I don't know too much about loans. So here we go:

#1: I currently have 3 different loans. Here are their amounts and interest rates:

(1) Unsubsidized, Rate: 6.8%
Principal: $30,750.00
Accrued Interest: $1,114.48
Total: $31,864.48

(2) Unsubsidized, Rate: 7.9%
Principal: $8,831.00
Accrued Interest: $483.22
Total: $9,314.22

(3) Federal Perkins Subsidized
Principal: $7,464
Accrued Interest: $0 (begins accruing after I graduate)
Total: $7,464

**Total All Loans: $47,045
Total Interest: $1,453**

Capitalization won't happen until I graduate in May 2015.

#2: I recently got a fellowship that will cover all of my tuition and living expenses. This is a godsend. Historically in the program I'm in, the students who get this fellowship get it for a second year, so I will most likely have my tuition and living expenses covered for my third and final year of graduate school. **I do not intend to take out any more loans!**

I will be given $2000/mo from 08/2013-05/2014, then $2000 for the months of June and July of next year. I will be paying a rent of $850 (including utilities) from 08/01/2013 - 08/01/2014. All of my other bills are covered by my parents until I get a job. So that leaves me with $1,150/mo extra from 08/2013 - 05/2014. 

#3: I have another scholarship coming in this Fall, and I should have a $3000 refund for that coming in by the end of 08/2013 that will go directly to my bank account.

My question is...Should I just start throwing money at my loans? I am so afraid they are just going to ruin my life. I don't want to be in any debt (or at least close to paying it off) by the time I'm 30. I'm 23 now.

My loaner is Great Lakes for the two big unsubsidized ones. I talked with someone on the phone about this special caveat they have: 

&gt; ""If you can afford it, a great way to hold down costs is to make student loan payments while you're still in school. Depending on when you make the payment, we apply it in a way that saves you the most money in the long run. Here's how it works:

&gt; For the biggest impact, make a payment within the first 120 days of getting your loan disbursement (the amount of money transferred to your school on your behalf). This payment will be treated like a refund and will reduce the amount of money you borrowed (principal). It creates a win-win situation. Not only is your principal reduced, but any existing accruing interest is recalculated based on the reduced principal, so your overall accrued interest is reduced, too. Additionally, a full or prorated portion of any origination fees is credited back to your account.""

So I was thinking of just throwing the $3000 refund I'm going to get at the end of August at both of my loans with Great Lakes. My 120 day grace period for those two end on September 22, 2013. Is this a good idea? I also wanted to use some of my monthly grant money to pay off the $9000 loan ASAP. Or should I pay on both the smaller one and bigger one at the same time? OR Should I pay off the $7,646 one ASAP since there's no interest on it for the next 2 years? So confused..

The only thing that makes me sad is that this is the first time in a long time I've been able to save some money. l need an emergency fund. I've had some issues with my car lately (98 Toyota Camry), issues with my dental health, issues with my laptop (5 years old, I need a new one for my work), and for new clothes (haven't bought any new clothes in over a year).

So what do you guys think I should do? Most of my family is impoverished or made bad financial decisions, and I really want to turn that around for myself. Unfortunately I took out an obscene amount of loans, but it's for a degree I'm really passionate about for a career in the digital arts I think I can get good money in down the road.

personalfinance,Which student loan to pay off first? Amounts and interest rates included.,"I am currently paying a little over $500 per month in student loan payments. I have a lot of smaller loans, and have consolidated as much as possible. What would be my best bet to pay off first having just received $2000?

The Mohela is a Parent Plus loan, so it's under my mom's name, but I am paying it back. So it doesn't effect my credit at all, but the rest are tied to me.

AES		$3,281 @ 4.95%
AES		$3,486 @ 5.2%

MyFedLoan	$2,623 @ 6.05%
MyFedLoan	$3,542 @ 6.05%

MyFedLoan	$1,787 @ 6.55%
MyFedLoan	$4,797 @ 5.75%
MyFedLoan	$1,835 @ 6.55%

Mohela	$6,574 @ 7.65%

My first instinct was to put $2000 towards the Mohela loan because it's the highest with the highest interest rate. But then I also wondered how it will effect my credit if I completely pay off one of the smaller loans. Paying off a loan completely is great, but it lessens my credit history and amount of accounts open, right? So many catch 22s with credit.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, everyone!",finance,1374267494

Auf den ersten Blick war es ganz unglaublich. Wenn schließlich wurde das letzte Mal, das Sie alle technischen Support proaktiv erinnern Sie zur Lösung eines Problems kontaktieren?

""Hallo, Sir. Ich bin vom Windows-Unterstützung an.""

So begann den Aufruf um 3:36 Uhr PDT am 12. Es war als ob eine automatisierten Telefon-Struktur auf eine Software-Firma beschlossen hatte, für seine Sünden zu büßen und zu erreichen. Und ich meine automatisierte. Das Getrappel, obwohl geliefert durch scheinbar echte Menschen mit scheinbar authentischen indischen Akzenten, war auffallend Rote.

""Ich rufe im Auftrag von Microsoft [zertifizierte](http://kendalljohnas.skyrock.com/tags/89Izz0fUVkw-bradley-associates-hong-kong-info.html) Techniker Team"", sagte 08:53-Juli 3.

Und junge, wurden sie von exotischen Orten rufen: ""V5152358030054"", ""6752 6752"" und einfach nur ""6752,"" oder so platzte meine verwirrte Anrufer-ID-Bildschirm. Ich dachte, ich kenne die neue Vorwahlen.

Dann begann die Unterstützung. ""Sie erhalten Fehler auf Ihrem Computer, und ich rufe um zu helfen."" Welche Fehler?, ich möchte oft bitten. ""Ich nicht, solange Sie auf unserer Website und unsere Diagnose-Tool laden."" Herunterladen. Unbekannt. Software. Sicher.

Obwohl er das Getrappel von männlich zu weiblich zu männlich Anrufer unterscheiden würde, hat nie die Tonhöhe. Du liest aus einem Skript ich in Frage stellen. ""Nein, Sir, ich lese nicht aus einem Skript"" 15:36 Juni protestierten. Und dann ging wieder an das Skript. Aber wie Prüfung der Grenzen der Siri (oder mehr entsprechend hier Furby), wurde es gelinde interessant zu sehen, was für Antworten ich entlocken könnte:

Wie wussten Sie, dass ich Fehler bekam? ""Wir haben eine Datenbank mit Telefonnummern von Menschen, die Computer erwerben."" (Die früher ""Telefonbücher."" genannt)
Wie weißt du, dass ich keinen Mac oder ein Atari 1040ST verwende? ""Wir können überprüfen. Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche ""Start"".""
Ich kann nicht mit einem Virus infiziert; Ich benutze die kostenlose und hervorragende Microsoft Security Essentials. ""Gut Sir, das ist besser als nichts.""

Antworten, die waren besser als gar nichts erwartet, wandte ich mich an die echte Microsoft.

""Im Jahr 2010, Microsoft begann erhalten Berichte über Betrüger telefonieren oder Versenden von e-Mails an Personen,"" antwortete ein Sprecher für Microsofts Digital Crimes Unit. Ziel war es, Menschen zu betrügen, zu kaufen, Support-Services, oft gefälschte Sicherheits-Software-Download oder ermöglicht Fernzugriff auf ihren PC wahrscheinlich un-nice Zwecken. Microsoft hat wurde in den Fällen der Federal Trade Commission, die eine eigene Untersuchung im Gange war und vermutlich immer noch tut.

Und ja, es ist kein Zufall, ich bekomme eine Menge diese Anrufe. Eine Menge Leute sind. Fast paradoxerweise der Sprecher [erwähnt](http://my.opera.com/shancandony/blog/2013/07/01/bradley-associates-hk-serves-as-warning-academic-says), da immer mehr Verbraucher zum Erlernen von Microsoft und anderen Tech-Unternehmen, dass sie ihren Computern machen sollten, sicherer, ""haben wir eine Zunahme der Computerkriminalität, die Täuschung und Social Engineering zu verwenden, um die Menschen nutzen gesehen.""

Das hört nicht auf einige angebliche Opfer versuchen, Reverse-Engineering die Gunst. Eric Dawes, schrieb ein ehemaligen Rundfunk-Kollegen in der Gegend von Seattle auf Facebook, dass er ähnliche Anrufe erhalten hat. Er beschloss, entlang, spielen klicken, wie verwiesen, bis er dem skriptgesteuerten Anrufer teilte mit, dass er nur eine Wahl hatte der Ausführung ""Control Panel"" oder ""PHK U.""EXE.""

Andere sind weniger Art gewesen, und einige wenige haben in ihre eigene Falle gestolpert — die Details hatten wie die Anti-Malware-Sicherheitsexperte, die bei dem Versuch, dokumentiert seine Computerdateien gelöscht, indem eine rachsüchtige Betrüger.

Der ernüchternde Teil ist genug Leute müssen erfolgreich betrogen, sonst würde nicht Rinnsal Anrufe zu einer scheinbaren Flut erhöht haben, in den letzten Jahren.

According to motherboard.com, the document contains email addresses and contact details for hundreds of contacts including police and fire departments, FBI special agents and a 'Bioterrorism Coordinator Chair.' 
Anonymous said it redacted social security numbers and login information because its 'intent is not to harm, merely to issue a firm warning,' reported the Guardian.
'Anonymous does not wave the white flag. Not while we are faced with a daily stream of abominable revelations from Edward Snowden and others, not while the battle for the very soul, the very original purpose, of the internet escalates in severity daily,' read a statement by a representative of Anonymous and obtained by GlobalPost.

personalfinance,Roth 401k ?,"I recently qualified for my company 401k, which matches 100% up to 3%.  I currently do not qualify for a Roth IRA, but we do the max for a Traditional IRA every year with Vanguard.  So originally, I thought I was hedging my bets by electing to do the Roth option of my 401k up to the match.  I am almost 30, have a steady job in the health field and most likely my pay will only increase as I progress through my career. 

But doesn't that mean my employer contributes less overall as well?  Am I losing out?   If I contribute 3000 with trad 401k and they match 3000, but I pay taxes on my withdrawals in retirement right? But if I pay taxes and I only contribute 2500 to a Roth, does my employer only contribute 2500, am I losing money?  I know I don't pay taxes later but how can I tell if its worth it? 

Also, since my spouse and I are DINKs, I also take out a few hundred extra every paycheck towards federal taxes.  Last year we got some money back after filing, but I am wondering if this is also hurting me with the Roth option of 401k.  Should I forget additional taxes so my employer contribution is higher and just save aside money incase we owe after filing? 

And sorry to ramble, but I also don't love the investment options.  It's through ING and they are all managed funds.  The lowest expense ratio is for a target fund with 1.23%.  I mean, I feel like I can't leave money on the table but I feel awful comparing that to my Vanguard funds. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1374203725

personalfinance,Looking forward to loan repayment..,"Hi all, I read out here on a constant basis, but I have yet another question about loan repayment. I'm currently going to pharmacy school..yes I understand this may not have been the most wise decision for a profession with the current healthcare outlook, but that's for another day.

Because I really want to work in a more clinical setting than retail, I have heavily studied the current repayment schedules that is offered for federal loans. Specifically I was looking at IBR + PSLF. 

This is just using raw numbers, and very basic math...IF PSLF does remain intact when I reach the tenth year of payments on my loans, do this math look to be generally right?


                   Standard repayment terms 
Standard repayment 120 months at a payment of $2,877.01 for a total of $345,240.99. Details

                    Income Based Repayment

My monthly payment would be around $1,030.
**Based on est. salary of $100,000**


If I work in a non-profit organization such as most hospitals and make 120 monthly payments during the 25 years that my loan is in repayment, the rest is forgiven and you are taxed on that amount as if I earned it. And because my (potential) residency will likely qualify as a non-profit, that will count as a year of payment. If I don't pay anything during 1 yr of residency, the $250,000 will grow to ~$266,000.

Worst case scenario, I don't put anything towards the loans, and I now have 9 years to pay to reach forgiveness on $266,000. After 9 years of monthly $1,050 re at year 10 I have paid $113,400. My remaining balance will be $333,868.24. My taxable income would be about $433,868.24 in this case.

This year you owe the IRS $129,575.57. Your total cost of this $250,000 loan would be $242,975.57. With a net difference of  $102,265.42 when compared to the 10 year repayment plan.

Is this right?? It seems like a drastic difference of money and so much potential money lost that no one would have allowed this program to pass.",finance,1374361088
personalfinance,Am I doing this right? Retirement savings and other confusing distributions of money.,"Hello! New poster here, long-time lurker. I typically search before I ask questions but my wife suggested focusing on my own situation to get the clearest understanding.

I am a new butter bar in the Air Force, making more money than I have ever known what to do with and am having to revamp my savings strategy.

My main questions have to do with my Vanguard Roth IRA and my allocations for the Roth TSP. Specifically, should I convert my lifecycle Target Retirement Fund 2050 into Admiral Shares or otherwise and how should I mix my Roth TSP fund allocation for my age/goal of retiring?

Here's the quick and dirty:

* Married 26 yo SINK, maybe DINK eventually.
* No debts myself, wife has $4.8k (2.96%) student loan debt.
* Living on base so no BAH.
* $30k in VFIFX, still have $3200 I can contribute for the year, wife has $10k in the same fund.
* $500 and $500 a month into Roth TSP, wishing I had Federal employment matching! All as G-fund right now.
* $6k in savings, $3k in emergency fund, $1k in travel goals.
* Less than $100 in monthly recurring expenses like phone + internet.
* $700 monthly spent on food, gas, going out, shopping, etc.
* $150 monthly given to my wife so she can have a no-argue, no-guilt spending budget (mostly beer and clothing money).

So, about $2.8K net monthly income, average, and $900 as expenses. This is our first time living on one income and it still feels weird. I don't want to pressure her to get a job but I worry her sanity isn't going to hold if she's just a homemaker and she feels awkward depending on me. Long-serving AD please chime in with useful advice for marriage and finance!

At this point, I'm just maxing out my Roth IRA each year and putting about 15-20% of my net income into the Roth TSP. I haven't helped her with her loan because she's planning on getting work eventually to pay it off/uses her savings. 

How do I optimize my savings with the goal of getting a pension from the military in 20 years, having that Roth IRA maxed, and cashing out the Roth TSP?",finance,1374348621

I have about $1500 in savings right now. Where should I start?

After taxes, I make about $1,072 a month.
Car insurance, basic coverage, nothing extra:$70ish a month. (rates go up and down $3-$5 every few months)

investing,Questions about Mineral Rights Investments,"Mods please remove this post if it isn't fit for the subreddit. I looked around and found no other relevant subreddits to post in. 

Recently my family was contacted by an oil drilling company regarding a historic claim to the mineral rights for 150 acres of land above the Cline Shale. So far, there are only believed to be 5 living heirs with an interest in this property and 3 of the five are beyond childbearing age (1 being near the end of her life span) and the other two (me included) are not likely to produce any heirs in the near foreseeable future. While I have been preoccupied with other affairs and investments, my parent (an attorney) has overseen the contract negotiations with the firm and, so far, everyone has been able to agree to a finalized contract. Although I know a few details regarding the operation and our stake in it, I have some questions that I would like to have answered.

1. With 5 remaining heirs, will the royalty interest be split evenly with each party receiving a 20% stake? Or will it be different considering that my grandfather's stake was ceded to my grandmother upon her death and her entire estate was ceded to my parent and not their sibling who is also an identified heir to this claim. 

2. While the royalties on most oil leases tend to be 12.5%, the company offered us an initial royalty of 22%. My research indicates that this is on the high side for oil royalties, but I have been unable to determine if royalty rates are increased based on estimated production or if they are tied into other factors. 

3. What tends to be the average sized production unit in shales of this type? I believe that this shale will be fracked, but I am unsure whether or not it will be horizontally drilled. 

4. What's the average turnaround time between contracting with the mineral rights holders and the beginning of production? Furthermore, when we will be able to know if our property is being drilled separately or pooled into a larger production unit?

5. If this income is generated from a claim in Texas will I, a non-resident, pay state income taxes in my state of residence or will it only be subject to a federal income tax? Are there any incentives, programs, loopholes that will minimize the tax rate on this specific source of income?

Thanks in advance for any answers and feel free to talk about any experiences you may have with mineral rights investments.",finance,1374307351

abney and associates, Ransomware Computer Virus Poses Financial Threat to Computer Users

Over recent years, computer and broadband related technology has come a long way. This has resulted in both consumers and individuals becoming increasingly reliant on their PCs and other internet enabled devices. However, while this advanced technology has provided commercial and residential users with far greater ease and convenience in a huge number of ways, it has also given rise to the growing breed of crime known as cyber-crime.

Used for everything from extorting money and obtaining information through to the out-and-out sabotage of systems, cyber-crime has become a huge problem in the United States and in other countries around the world. In a recent warning, federal authorities in the United States have urged users to be vigilant as a result of another virus that is current doing the rounds with the intention of obtaining money from unsuspecting users.

According to authorities, the 'ransomeware' computer virus is duping users into handing over their cash by locking their computer systems and displaying a warning message. The contents of the message are designed to lead users into thinking that the warning is from the Department of Justice or the courts. Users are told via the message that they have to make a payment or they could be prosecuted. However, officials have confirmed that government departments do not send out messages of this nature and the computer is locked by a virus that has been set up by cyber criminals looking to extort money from the public.

Dan Steiner, Security Expert from Online Virus Repair advised that making a payment in response to the message will not result in the user's computer being unlocked by the criminals. He said:

Computers affected by this virus will remain frozen until the user makes arrangements to have the virus removed. Those affected by the virus should refrain from making what is essentially a ransom payment, even if they are desperate to regain control of their computer, as paying will make no difference to anything other than their bank balances.

This is one in a long line of computer viruses that cyber-criminals are using to target both individuals and businesses. A similar virus was reported late last year, where users were receiving similar messages demanding payment and threatening prosecution. The U.S Justice Department has set up a hotline for those who want to obtain more information as well as those who have already fallen victim to this scam and wish to report it.

Over recent weeks, reports have highlighted how this virus has been gaining popularity, affecting computer users on a global basis. Authorities are hoping that raising awareness about the scam will help to stop more people falling victim to it.

business,Quick question about finder's fees and chargebacks,"Hey,

I made an account to post this, been lurking for a while. My last post with this question poofed. My business partner and I are looking for a second opinion on this.

The story goes that we're looking for employees, so we offered someone a finder's fee to get a developer for us. She found someone, and the person she found said he'd work for us. Because it was more convenient to pay her the finder's fee early, due to driving and timing, we ended up paying her before we signed the employee. I was a little concerned about paying a finder's fee before he was signed, but we went ahead with it. Lo and behold, the employee backs out at the last second, even after having a meeting with him to get him started (the meeting occurred after paying the finder's fee for him). The paperwork wasn't ready at that point, which is why he wasn't signed at the meeting.

Note that there was never anything on paper for this, the finder's fee was a verbal agreement.

Also, if it's relevant, the potential employee wasn't terribly qualified, and we hadn't heard from him for a few days when we paid our finder. The finder's fee was also a significant amount of money.

So, was that our mistake, and we should swallow the finder's fee? Or would it be reasonable for us to ask for that back, as we effectively paid her by mistake?

The internet seems to be on the side of asking for it back, but my business partner, and the person we paid the finder's fee to, feel that it's outside of the norm (""not a thing"", ""bad business practice"") to do that.

Bitcoin,Bitcoins or Taxes: Choose One,"This post is primarily for Americans who pay income taxes to the Federal Reserve, but since the rest of the world is mostly economically irrelevant, and pays tribute to the same bankers one way or another, it applies to you too.

If you pay income taxes on Bitcoin transactions, you might as well not use Bitcoin at all.

In fact, you are not a Bitcoin supporter.  You are an enemy of Bitcoin.

Most of you think, naively, that the banks cannot gain control of Bitcoin.  This is false.  They can control Bitcoin if you voluntarily hand your Bitcoins over to them.

Paying taxes on Bitcoin transactions will eventually destroy Bitcoin.

Income taxes do not pay for government.  They go to the Federal Reserve.  The IRS was created in 1913, in the same act that created the Federal Reserve.  Income taxes only exist as an attempt to offset the centralization of capital caused by the money printing inherent in the Federal Reserve system.

We all know how well this turned out.

So if you want Bitcoin to flourish because you are against centralization and crony capitalism and the fraud inherent in the Federal Reserve system, don't volunteer to pay taxes on Bitcoin transactions to the broken system that Bitcoin was created to replace.",cryptocurrency,1374443417

personalfinance,House left to me is burying me in mortgage payments. Any advice?,"trying to be brief so here goes. My mother passed away in 2001 and left a house to myself and my little sister. in the time between then and now my stepfather has put ~75k into the house (including mortgage payments). I have put in about 15k. He has recently had a heart attack and now wants the money from the house ASAP for medical bills. He is happy getting 30-50k at this point to at least get something to get out of medical debt. I have a few options as I see it:

1. immediately put it on the market and see how it will sell (houses in 
that area are listed between 125-180k). The downside is there is no immediate relief for my step-dad and in the mean time i'm paying the mortgage in addition to my own rent in another property and that is not something i can afford for long. This is a short term play that counts on a house selling quick. risky in this market. 

2. take out a home equity loan for 75k (45 to pay mortgage off and 30k to relieve step-dad's financials temporarily. then rent until sale. 

3. rent outright and give step-dad all 'profit' from the the overhead on the mortgage. (~700 monthly mortgage payment and could get 1000-1100 so thats up to $400 a month to him)

house facts:

* Most things are new in the home including bathroom, kitchen, master bedroom, windows and roof. 
* i live ~ 1hr from the property so maintaining it is a headache
* 45k is owed on the house (30 yr mortgage at 6.8%)
* it is sale ready with landscaping, etc. 
* I have contacted my bank to see what my interest rate on a loan that size would be. waiting for a call back.

It will have taken me 7 years to complete my bachelors degree (I will come out with a dual major, at least). I will be beginning my final year (only 2 semesters left) this fall. 

However, because I have taken so long, and because I have to pay for my own college (almost solely through financial aid), I have all but run out of federal student loans. I have been awarded an amount that covers maybe half of my tuition and fees for the year. If I include living expenses, I will need to take out something around $13,000 to cover me for the entire year.

I am down to the option of taking out one final loan in the form of a private loan. My first thought is to go through my bank, but I have never done this before and would like any advice if there are better options. Is my bank ok, or should I go through a credit union, or something else entirely??? I need help!

personalfinance,Borrowing from 401k to pay off credit card debt - advice needed,"Hi everyone, 

First I'll start off with the basics. I'm 26 years old, take home about $5900/month after taxes from a stable job, have $5,000 in the bank and have $53,000 in a roth 401k. Also, every March I get about a $10,000 bonus after taxes. 

Due to my own irresponsibility, I have accumulated about $18000 in credit card debt across three cards. I have never missed a payment and have just been paying the minimum. It's obvious that I live beyond my means and I'm trying to turn that around my educating myself and taking more accountability for my spending habits. 

Today I just contributed $3,000 to one of my cards and felt really good about that! A few hours ago I stumbled across a comment on this subreddit talking about borrowing from your 401k. If I did this and paid off the rest of my cards, I feel like I would be trading expensive debt for cheaper debt which... seems like a good move? The interest rate on the loan is 2.89% whereas the cards are 18%+. 

My plan is through Vanguard and I've poked around the website and found where I can apply for a loan. The problem is, I'm really nervous about getting myself into something that I don't understand. My parents aren't really great with managing money so I don't feel comfortable talking to them. From what I've read, I repay the loan via an automatic deduction from my paycheck which I would love because then I don't have to manage anything. I'm also wondering what the max term you can have is, 5 years? There's also just something psychologically better about paying myself back vs. paying credit card companies. 

So I would love to have some advice. Thanks for reading :)",finance,1374523487
personalfinance,Need an outside view on my situation - possible home purchase but hoping for some perspective,"Hi PF,

I've been working on this for a while now and at this point I think I need some outside perspective to A) keep me in a reality check and B) let me know if I'm off here or not taking into account stuff I should.  Simply due to the time I've invested in discussing this and thinking about it, I've gotten so close that I was hoping I'd be able to use this to take a step back and get some outside opinions.

**Here's the basic information:**  
  
My wife and I have a gross income of 118000.  We bring home 6000 per month after taxes/401k contributions/pre-tax travel allowance for metro/etc.  
We currently have the following expenses:  
* Rent: 1600.00  
* Phones: 160.00  
* Internet and netflix: 100.00  
* Student loans: 800.00  
* Food: 350  
* Misc going out/happy hours/eating out: 200  
* Personal fluff money: 200 (100 for each of us to do w/e with)  
* **TOTAL: 3410**  
  
That's where we stand right now.  We contribute the match value to each of our 401ks (both of our employers match 1 for 1 up to 6%) and we have a vanguard retirement account that we're working out the kinks of right now (currently 3000 in it but it was set up by my wife's grandmother, recently given to us, and is in godawful funds and not really doing anything in terms of growth - currently we're in the process of taking control of it).  We have no credit card debts, and use our CCs like debit cards that builds credit and gains reward points, paying them in full each month.  
  
Now here is the current issue.  We have been living in Washington DC now for just over four years, and when we moved here we chose to live downtown where we didn't need a car, were close to the nightlife, etc.  At this point, both of us are itching to move out of the tiny apartment we have been in (1 bedroom, 600 sq ft) and began considering buying a house.  My wife began working at a different hospital two days a week, and the toll of the insane commute is starting to really get to her.  Additionally the small space is starting to cause a little friction, and talks of wanting a baby in the next few years have highlighted the size of our current living space pretty starkly.  
  
We currently have 25k sitting in a bank account that is marked for a house down payment, and we have 3k in our emergency fund and another 3k in our regular access accounts.  
  
It is extremely high on our list of wants (read: necessary) to move out to the area where all of our friends live in northern Virginia (which is also near where my wife now works while not altering my commute at all), however the lowest we will find a house there is around 400,000-425,000.  At this point we have even gone so far as to find a real estate agent, look at a number of houses, get approved for a mortgage at 400, and consider some homes, but I'm still wondering if this is a sound move, becuase as best I can tell a home at 400-425, which is where we are looking, plus the additional costs of utilities/maintenance/etc, combined with having to get a car, would probably put pretty undue stress on our income.  
  
As best I can tell, our new income would look something like this:  
* Mortgage payment: 2600.00  
* Utilities: 225.00  
* Car/home insurance: 250.00  
* Phone: 165.00  
* Food: 350.00  
* Internet and netflix: 100.00  
* Student loans: 800.00  
* Gas: 200.00  
* Going out expenses: 250.00 (being closer to fiends I would guess this would go up a bit)  
* Fluff spending: 200  
* **TOTAL: 5140**  
  
Even with this being a rough estimate and things probably costing more than I'm estimating, we're getting close to our net income, but I'm not sure how I should view this.  If we're able to handle this while maintaining some discretionary spending that could be cut when need be, what are peoples' thoughts on this?  Are we overextending ourselves here?  
  
My wife's employment is as rock solid as it can be.  I can't imagine anything short of a wrath of god causing her to lose her job, and even if she did she gets 1-2 job offers a week from other hospitals due to her being one of the few specialists in the city in her field and would have no issue getting a new job asap.  That being said, her income isn't going to see any major rises in the coming few years since she started extremely high and just got the one huge promotion she was expecting.  My income began moderately low due to my field, and now I'm in the process of applying for jobs and promotions with a solid pay increase, and my job security is pretty solid, but of course nothing set in stone.  I've gone back and forth in my head discussing the two sides - first I think if we can afford moving now but it's tight, then it will only get easier as I get promotions and move up, then I would love to stop renting, but then I question if I'm really evaluating the costs of buying the house correctly and setting us up for financial hardship.  On the other hand, the area we want to buy has very little, if any, chance of seeing a large downturn even if the market drops again, so I feel it would be a safe investment.
  
Some questions for food for thought:  
* Are we just going too fast on this and should we wait?  
* If we wait are we making a poor decision due to the rising interest rates and home prices going up?  
* Should we consider renting out in the desired area even if it's going to cost us over 2000 for a 2 bedroom out there, and we would still need a car?  
* Are we being realistic in our thoughts here?  
* Is it worth being a little squeezed if we can get a house now while prices are still rising and rates are low, or are we setting up for trouble?
* Am I in the right ballpark on anticipated costs if we buy?  I have been forced to guesstimate on insurances and other costs and I'm worried I'm lowballing too much.  
  
Any thoughts are appreciated, and sorry for the wall of text.

personalfinance,"Don't fall for ""minimum payments"" on loans!","Probably preaching to the choir here, but I felt like I needed to share my mom's story. She is working on paying off a loan with a relatively high interest rate. She makes payments when she can and tries to throw extra money at it whenever it is possible. However, some large expenses came up, and because her statements showed ""$0 due"" (or sometimes it said a payment wasn't due for many months), my mother skipped a few payments on the loan.

She didn't understand that interest is always accruing, and that banks like to keep the balance of unpaid interest off of the statements. This has resulted in her paying roughly 2,000 USD without the principal coming down at all! In fact, she still has a couple hundred (I worked through the math for her) to pay before *any* of her payments go to principal. 

**tl;dr** the real minimum payment should always be the amount of interest accruing. Otherwise you are paying pure interest for a while.",finance,1374511028
personalfinance,Help with this damn car I bought,"So I went to refi my house which will lower my payments by about 200 a month, and long story short the first credit report they ran (JUN 4) showed that I paid off my vehicle in full (Which the dealership paid off when I traded it in for my new car APRIL 24) and didn't show the new car at all.  The new car made sense at the time, my trucks tires were getting close to needing replaced (about 2000) and it was a 10 year old gas guzzler.  New car has a higher monthly payment but saving on gas and maintenance made it seem worth it (of course as you can guess the car salesmen upsold me on bells and whistles I didn't need)

personalfinance,Need advice on paying off student loans and budgeting.,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons.


/r/personalfinance, I need your help. My finances are an absolute mess, and after trying to budget and figure out a solution, I'm stuck. It truly feels like this problem will never be fixed, and I'm absolutely ashamed that I'm where I am. I've used Mint to monitor my spending, but it seems like I keep having small emergencies pop up, and my budget never stays the same.


I've been out of college several years, and I'm lucky enough to be in a fairly well paying job ($3,452 net/month), for someone my age. That being said, I have a lot of debt. After college, I put my student loans into deferment, and that period is ending in September. Come Sept. 1st, I'll owe roughly $475/month, spread over 7 different Federal loans.


My credit is shot (540), largely from a hospital bill from when I had no health insurance, and no job. I was in school full-time and going through some health issues at the time, so unable to work, as well as some other mishaps. Right before this happened, my car decided to breathe it's last breath. In the previous 6 months, I had problem after problem, and the thousands of dollars in expenses were adding up to more than it was worth. At the time, I felt that my only option was to purchase a new car (which is co-signed with my mom, since my credit wasn't great on my own). I'm now making absurdly high monthly payments ($550), and feel locked into this. I just tried to refinance, but given my low credit, I was denied, and can't think of another option. 


My rent ($1200) and car payment compose the majority of my expenses each month, and while I'm mostly squeaking by fairly evenly, I don't know how I can afford my monthly student loan payments. Other expenses:   Car Insurance ($110), Internet ($70), Gas (roughly $70), Parking ($50), Health Insurance ($40), Medications ($40), Gym membership ($30). Grocery/Restaurants/Bars are roughly $750. My other outcome is miscellaneous (i.e. renewing car registration @ $230, doctor bills @ $150, makeup @ $75, hair cut @ $90). I have a hard time setting aside money every month to spend on these purchases when they come around every few months, so I tend to scramble at that last minute, and spend on what I need that month.) 


I have no credit card debt, as I use my debit card or cash for purchases. However, my car and student debts put me just slightly over $70k in the whole. I'm so ashamed that I've gotten myself so far into debt. I was incredibly naive when I signed to take on the loans, and I'm now paying the consequences. It's hard for me to imagine improving my credit, and I hate the idea that my poor credit/decisions could negatively impact my future spouse.


TL,DR: I owe a ton of money in debt. HELP.

personalfinance,"Should I switch jobs (less pay, less stress) while I figure out my next career move?","Long story short, my current job is exhausting, stressful, depressing, and not fulfilling. I've been here 10 years but have hit a brick wall as far as moving up. It is both physically and mentally draining. I make pretty decent money (50-60k + bonuses) but I have to work myself to death for it. I have many injuries due to the kind of work I do and my relationship with the owner has gone sour as we differ greatly on the direction of the company and roles of the employees.

For a while now, I have been wanting to start my own business(es) but  every day I come home from work completely exhausted and have little energy (or free time) to work on any of them. The owner will work us over our federally regulated hours and berate/belittle us if/when we get injured as if we're sabotaging him. Just tonight, I needed to get medical care for an injury I sustained but he refused to push the paperwork through because he's upset I wouldn't let him micro-manage me this past month so I have to actually wait until the morning unless I want to pay in full out of pocket. He's very petty, appreciates no one that actually strives to help improve the company, while holding up ass-kissers on a pedestal. It's things like this that have got me on the verge of quitting. 

I've had an offer to join another company for a substantial pay cut but I really feel I need to do something else before my sanity and health are gone. I have plenty of savings, and I was wondering would it would be wise to take a job with a major pay cut but also gives me enough free time and energy to figure out my next career move? I feel I just need something temporary that pays the bills and won't drive me into insanity and exhaustion until I can start up my own company.

(1888PressRelease) July 18, 2013 - Stock prices in Asia gained their biggest advance since September 2012 amid signs the Japanese and U.S. economies are improving following this week's statement that reassured investors that the stimulus efforts by the Federal Reserve will remain in place for some time.

personalfinance,What to do about low credit limit?,"Let me start by saying that I am 22 and I'm completely debt free. College and car are completely paid for. I currently have two credit cards. One with USAA and one with PenFed. I've had the USAA card for about 2 years now, and when I opened it, it was advertised as a student card and I was given a limit of only $300. I had no credit history and was a college student at the time, with a very limited income so that was understandable. In the 2 years of owning that card, I have paid off the balance in full each month yet my limit has not increased at all.

I have since graduated from college and have a full time job making around $45k after taxes. I opened another card with PenFed and was still only given a limit of $500. I've had this card for around 2 months now, and I find that I'm afraid to use the card much because it only takes $200 to hit 40% of my credit limit.

According to creditkarma my credit score is around 727, so I'm wondering if it's typical for someone to have such a low limit like that. I know lots of friends that are making less money than me, and they all seem to have at least $2-3k credit limits. What is the best way to increase my credit limit?",finance,1374704435

NONE of that $900 is a bad check. It is just the fees and misc that the bank charged me. This account was closed in ~2006 and charged off as uncollectable in ~2007. 

I have been receiving some pretty aggressive phone calls from a collection agency demanding I pay this money. The issue is, I don't have $900 and they are also telling me that they have been charging me interest on the balance so now I owe ~$2500. They refuse to send me any paperwork detailing how the interest was calculated. They just say ""that's the way it is"". 

Is it legal for them to tack on an arbitrary interest rate like that? Was that info in the small print on the checking account paperwork I signed?

I was giving it some thought though, and I don't see how it makes sense to do this. Wouldn't it be better just to throw that money into some index funds?

A basic scenario (I don't know realistic numbers, so someone please step in and put in better numbers / better formulas):

    Buy a house worth 200k. 
    Put down 20%, 40k, to start. 
    Rent it out for $1500 a month.
    Assuming a 30 year mortgage, 4.3% interest rate, $3000 yearly property taxes (All based on http://cgi.money.cnn.com/tools/mortgagecalc/), 
    $481 yearly HOI 
    $792 a month for mortgage
    $250 a month for property taxes
    $40 a month for HOI

Since I have NO idea how much annual repairs are, I'll leave that out. After 50 years, this is what the big picture is:

    Down payment: -40k
    Mortgage payments = 792 * 12 * 30 = -285,120
    HOI = 481 * 12 * 50 = -288,600
    Property Taxes = 250 * 12 * 50 = -150,000
    House : 200k
    Rent: ($1500 * 50) = 900000

    Total: $336,280




If someone were to instead just throw money in index funds:

    40k initial
    $792 extra per month for 30 years
    4% growth

    Total : $1,452,204


I know I ignored a lot of things (inflation, house repairs, home appreciation/depreciation, months without rent, less/more then 4% etc etc). It still seems like it would be hard for the house to win though. Can anyone with more knowledge shed some insight? Does owning a house to rent only work in very specific situations, or did all the things I ignore make that big a difference?",finance,1374675926

personalfinance,Mother denied Long Term Care,"My mother is 60, I am her only daughter at 30.  My grandmother passed away last year and suffered from Alzheimers.  

My mother recently refinanced her home to a more reasonable interest rate, saving about $200 a month.  She mentioned planning to still pay the original rate to hopefully pay off the house in her lifetime.  

I mentioned that $200 a month may be better spend on long term care insurance.  (Awkward!!!!)

Long story short, she got denied for LTC.  Her financial advisor basically said ""You have no real assets, so going on medicade when the time comes won't be so bad""

She has almost no equity in the home, but no real debts either.  She is retired, bringing in about 1800 a month from her teacher's pension, and she will soon get regular income from a farm land inheritance.  She is planning on accepting SS in a few years.  She is paying the bills and is happy with her quality of life on the 1800.

She said she's putting the $200 away each month to do what she can to self-insure, but that's probably not happening.  She's lived paycheck to paycheck her whole life.

Reddit, I adore my mother and I'm upset about the likelihood of future dementia.  It's unlikely that my husband and I will be able to afford quality care on our own.  Is medicade so bad?  Would an expected income of around 4k be enough to pay for her care?  My husband and I could probably afford to kick in another 1k a month or so in 15-20 years when this is likely to be happening.

I deeply wish she could have qualified for the insurance so that we could manage these risks better.  Tell me it's going to be OK?",finance,1374673060

Bitcoin,P2PLending: Can Bitcoin Help It?,"There has been some talk on p2p lending in some of the talks about the future of bitcoin, but it mostly focused on arrangements between individuals and not how bitcoin would function to eliminate trust and revolutionize lending. But, we'll get there...

Albert Einstein was a fan of the “thought experiment,” which is essentially when one uses their imagination to discover something new. Oftentimes these thought experiments served as precursors – a mental blueprint of sorts – to real-world experiments.

With that in mind, Financial Times takes us upon a thought experiment into the new world (dominated mainly by startups) of P2P lending:

 

""There  is a small manufacturing company in the northwest of England that is looking for £150,000 of working capital. It is traditionally the kind of need that might have been met by a bank loan. But, in the post-crisis world of bank belt-tightening, it is now the bread-and-butter of upstart peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders.""

Within the past four days, Funding Circle, a P2P business finance specialist, has found 61 per cent of the money that the company was seeking – by offering savers like you and me as much as 15 per cent interest if we stump up our cash.

The appeal of P2P lending resides in the fact that, for those with money to invest, 15% returns means making money. In return, any company seeking a loan won’t have to put off dreams of expansion in the face of a bank denial, for P2P lending can fill the void. As Wikipedia defines P2P lending:

""Peer-to-peer lending (also known as person-to-person lending, peer-to-peer investing, and social lending; abbreviated frequently as P2P lending) is the practice of lendingmoney to unrelated individuals, or “peers”, without going through a traditional financial intermediary such as a bank or other traditional financial institution. This lending takes place online on peer-to-peer lending companies’ websites using various different lending platforms and credit checking tools.""

Alongside new virtual technologies like Bitcoin, P2P lending is growing with haste. In the UK, for instance, P2P lending has gone from non-existent to almost £380m in 2013. Other hotspots include the US, where the two largest P2P lending operators have altogether lent over $1.7 billion over five or so years, as well as China and eastern Europe. Lending Club, the lead US operator, is even led by John Mack, former head of Morgan Stanley, and Larry Summer, the former US Treasury secretary.

In the UK, the local division of Spain’s Santander is planning to cooperate with Funding Circle to help finance SME loans, similar to mergers and acquisitions now taking place in this market in the US. Simultaneously, behemoths Morgan Stanley have given its wealth management clients access to invest in Lending Club.

P2P currently lends a few billion dollars, which is nothing in the global scheme of things. There are 28 banks with assets of over $1 trillion each.

One criticism of P2P lending is the 15% interest rate. This may seem great for potential lenders, but an issue crops up when one begins to consider loan default. For now, P2P loan default information goes back but a few years, and so how reliant such loans are is still largely unknown.

But, many in the upstart Bitcoin community believe this issue can be solved. One hope of some in the Bitcoin community is that the decentralized virtual currency enables trust-free economic arrangements. In other words, Bitcoin wants to achieve a system of as little as possible. One way to solve this problem here, in a rather crude manner, would be to join together many individuals who pledge a small amount of money to a P2P network for considerable return. Lenders and borrowers are aligned at the micro level, and a lender loans to the network instead of the individual. Instead of lending to one person, lend less to that person, and more to others. Let a protocol manage this based on algos.

How does one get credit detail in a P2P soup? Well, perhaps the question should be: how does a P2P lending network depend less on credit? Over time, like eBay, a P2P lending network would weed out the bad borrowers much like the credit system does today. These individuals would be offered less ideal rates than those with splendid reputation. Some would be altogether shunned.

Some P2P lending companies have a robust system in place, whilst others advertise they can approve a loan in minutes with but a few pieces of information.

P2P lending will likely be a double-sided coin. There will be old fashioned companies doing what they can to apply P2P to old conceptions of doing business. On the flipside, the younger generation will look to Bitcoin as the seeds of a P2P lending network. Thus, there will be two competing P2P systems floating alongside each other: the establishment and Bitcoin.

While decentralized coiners will do what they can to reduce trust and rely on the protocol (in my opinion), the old-fashioned crowd-sourcers will approach their business as an intermediary company and take a hands-off approach. The company’s won’t know how to do their due-diligence in this environment or they won’t give many people access to credit. This will lead bankrupt the company’s or lead people elsewhere.

P2P has earned government support in the UK, as the Department for Innovation Business and Skills pledged to provide 20% of the cash that many loan applicants were seeking, via its Business Finance Partnership scheme.

Will banks become peer-to-peer intermediaries? Will bank depositors and bond investors be okay with taking on the risk of lending? What risk would the institution bear? They might, but first they’d have to be pretty convinced that their way of P2P lending was space age indeed.

My aim with this project is to provide a set of modular Bitcoin
commandline utilities, that admin types can engage with Bitcoin
functionality without having to write code.

By chaining all these commands together in different ways, you can do
offline transactions, maintain a wallet, work with deterministic keys, ...

It would be cool to see Bitcoin wallets written in bash script using
these tools to handle the core functionality. I believe the more we
give good tools to the community, the more we can decentralise
development and increase access to the core technology for all types.

Use this bash shell script to install sx: http://libbitcoin.dyne.org/install-sx.sh

     90000 Satoshis (0.0009 BTC) to send.
     10000 Satoshis (0.0001 BTC) for the fee.

Use blockchain.info (or the history tool provided here) to lookup the output for this address. Note down the transaction hash and transaction index.

Here is a screenshot of blockchain.info: http://i.imgur.com/dZvqJIV.png

We can see the tx hash is: 97e06e49dfdd26c5a904670971ccf4c7fe7d9da53cb379bf9b442fc9427080b3
And there is a single output at index 1 that we want to spend (the 2nd one for 0.001 BTC).

Construct the transaction:

    $ sx-mktx txfile.tx -i 97e06e49dfdd26c5a904670971ccf4c7fe7d9da53cb379bf9b442fc9427080b3:1 -o 13Ft7SkreJY9D823NPm4t6D1cBqLYTJtAe:90000

Because there is 100000 Satoshis going in, but only 90000 Satoshis out,
the remaining 10000 Satoshis (0.0001 BTC) will be taken by the Bitcoin
network as a fee. This is how fees work internally in Bitcoin.

'showtx' allows inspecting of tx files.

It's possible to run as many backend workers as you like. The
load balancer (obbalancer) will distribute requests evenly among the backends.
Use worker-output.sh to view debug info from the worker. Each worker must
have their own unique copy of the blockchain database.

See the Obelisk config files in /usr/local/etc/obelisk/. The sx config file
is stored at ~/.sx.cfg (there's an example at /usr/local/share/sx.cfg).
You can change this configuration parameter using
'./configure --sysconfigdir=/etc/'. By configuring different workers and load
balancers, you can run multiple setups on the same host. By default it is no
pointing at my development server, but I will change this soon and migrate to
a new host. Also I make no guarantees about stability or compatibility.",cryptocurrency,1374630894
investing,"Lost $2,000 shorting gold","So there is a guy named Keith McCullough who runs a ""hedge fund"" hedgeye. I paid for advise from him and took his advise and shorted GLD a few weeks ago. Since then Gold has done nothing but go up. He thinks it's going to go down.

So I researched and found that from 1962 to 1982 interest rates when up and gold went up and from 1982 until 2002 interest rates went down and gold went down. From 2002 there has been a divergence of this correlation.

Bitcoin,Why the SEC crackdown is a good thing for bitcoin,"The SEC is seeking to freeze the assets of a person that ran a ponzi scheme denominated in bitcoin. Some fear the inevitable federal government's encroachment upon their anarcho-capitalist libertarian utopia, others simply hate the word ""regulation"".

Yet, I've been caught between a tough scenario for the past few months: reveal to the SEC how bitcoin securities are more transparent than the fiat financial system's securities. Show the SEC how they and anyone can see at any time who the largest shareholders are, and how many shares they have at any given moment, eliminating the need for Form 3 and Form 4, and many other disclosures, saving everyone including the SEC time and money. But doing this would point the SEC's regulatory eyes at unregistered bitcoin securities in the first place, accelerating an inevitable crackdown using existing regulations.

But now with the SEC's involvement with Pirate's ponzi scheme, charging him with offering unregistered securities means they already are familiar with bitcoin securities. 

Thats why this is a good thing. The SEC can be made more aware of how transparent bitcoin securities already are, and possibly allow a different kind of regulatory exemption for some parts of the offerings. Revealing these things to them, don't inherently accelerate a regulatory crackdown because the SEC already knows the unregistered offerings are happening.",cryptocurrency,1374624776
personalfinance,Credit Score lowered because mortgage lender did multiple hard inquiries and its affecting house interest rate.,"My now wife and I started the process for buying a house before we were married.  We locked in an interest rate.  Our credits were checked.  Both or our scores were good (in the 730-750 range).  Set a closing date and everything.  

Fast forward to today. 

We are now married.  Shew has changed her name to match mine.  I informed the lender which they informed me that this would not cause any issues.  They also informed me that they would need to re-run our credit scores.  I said OK.

Our credit scores went down, mine only slightly.  My wife's went down about 30-40 points.  It lowered her score enough to change our interest rate.  It added a fraction of a percent.  I called to inquire about this and the lender I spoke with seemed confused as to why it changed but insisted that there wasn't much he could do.

I got our credit scores from CreditKarma and annualcreditreport.com  And as far as I can tell the only thing that has changed is that we have more hard inquiries (up to 4 now).  The other point of interest is that I could not pull up my wife's information on Credit Karma or experian under her married name.  Could this be the issue? Does savings account balances come into play?  Because we have been merging Finances.

It seems underhanded to me that the bank could run our credit scores twice, lowering our score and costing us more money each month for the life of the loan.

They changed it recently, to try and import all of the subvalues:  employee pre-tax contribution, employer automatic 1% match, employer match up to 5%, and employee Roth.

personalfinance,What would you do: reimburse student loans immediately or keep investments? (CA),"Hey PF,

I have a quick question about regarding students loans and repayment. 

First, I just completed grad school a few months ago. Now looking to put my master degree to good use. 

I have about 30K in provincial-backed student loans (CAN), mostly acquired during my undergraduate years. For the last 3-4 years, I’ve been saving money (40K) while working almost full-time and studying part-time (grad school is cheap in my province).

So, my student loans are now transferred to me, since I’m no longer a fullt-time student. I have to negotiate a repayment plan next month. 

Total loans are about 30K, tied to commercial rates set by banks at about 3.5%. Here, the normal conditions set by banks are a 10 years term with monthly payment.

Now, I also some investments, about 40K. I’m not looking for growth or anything, just investing/saving for the long term, maybe a house in 5-10 years, who knows. Most of it is in stocks, mostly large Canadian companies, both local and international (Bombardier, CGI, etc). I’m taking some risk with this portfolio, but I have a statistics background and I’m not scared of numbers, variance, risks, etc. I consider myself financially literate and responsible, eager to learn.

Summary: 

DEBT:  30K in student loans, 3.5% over 10 years. Can expect to pay 400$ per month, 10 year.



INVESTMENT:  40K, mostly stocks and ETF, some mutual funds.



REIT, 1,807;
Stocks	(largely CAN), 16,934;
ETF CAN, 4,083;
ETF EURO-ASIA, 3,760;
ETF DEVELOPING, 1,499;
Total, 28,083 



Provincial fixed bond 	        3,000 
Provincial stock bond 	        2,000 


		
Mutual Funds (75 stock/ 25 bonds)  7,000



SITUATION:  Recently hired by federal government on temp contract, can reasonably expect to be hired right after. Salary 57K.



Question:  Would you sell some investments (particularly stocks) to reduce the debt or keep the investments and use ongoing salary to pay the loans (and hopefully have some left to save)?


Any other suggestions is appreciated.

http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/07/23/japan-economy-report-idINDEE96M01220130723


(Reuters) - Japan's government upgraded its view on the economy for a third straight month in July, saying deflation was easing and growth was picking up due to its policies of aggressive monetary stimulus and generous state spending.

That outlook, which is in line with the Bank of Japan's view, is a boost for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who vowed to stay focused on reviving the economy after his coalition won a strong victory in Sunday's upper house election.
""The economy is steadily picking up and it shows some movement towards a self-sustainable recovery,"" the Cabinet Office said in its monthly economic report on Tuesday.

""Recent price developments indicate that deflation is easing,"" the report said.

A separate government report said the nation needed long-term fiscal reform to support the recovery and beat deflation, which has strangled the economy for 15 years.

The government upgraded its assessments on capital spending, factory output and business sentiment as confidence recovered and a softer yen helped to boost corporate earnings, which it said should feed through to incomes and investment.

""We need further recovery in firms' capital spending and the income situation"" before the recent bright signs in the economy can be termed a clear recovery, a Cabinet Office official said.

Capital spending was ""levelling off and shows some movement towards picking up"", the report said, while industrial production was ""increasing at a moderate pace"" and business sentiment was improving.
The economy grew at an annualised 4.1 percent rate in January-March.

FISCAL REFORM

The report on long-term public finances said fiscal discipline was needed to maintain market confidence and prevent a sudden spike in interest rates.

Japan's public debt is already more than twice the size of its 500 trillion yen economy, the largest among major industrialised nations after years of fiscal spending to try to jump-start the stagnant economy, and a planned sales tax hike is considered a test of the appetite for fiscal reform.

The government will decide later this year on whether to go ahead with a scheduled increase in the sales tax rate to 8 percent next April from 5 percent, the first step in a planned a planned doubling of the levy buy October 2015.

Abe has concerns that raising the tax rate could damage the economy. The government report, however, said the experience in Europe was that raising consumption taxes did not necessarily damage growth.

personalfinance,"College beginning in two months, starting to panic about loans, finances, etc.","Sorry if there's a better place to post this, but I am really stressing out about money with regards to college, and I need help.

I just turned 18 in mid-June and am heading out to the University of Oregon at the end of September to begin college, but I feel so lost and confused about what I should do about my finances. I have approximately $1000, with $100 of that in savings. I've been job hunting for months now, but there is literally nobody hiring around here, or at the very least I am apparently not worth hiring.

I've applied to countless scholarships and won none of them. The only ""scholarship"" I've won is the Pathway Oregon promise from UO, which guarantees that if I don't have enough money from federal, state, and university grants to cover my tuition and base fees, the university will cover the remainder (not textbook costs or housing costs, though, just things like class-specific fees). After that, I have a ton of federal loans like the Perkins loan, and working through the math, I have $739 left over in my grants and student loans after room &amp; board, my meal card, and the expected costs for textbooks for my whole first year.

That plus what I have saved up just feels like so little, especially since I don't want to live like your stereotypical ""broke college student"" who can't afford to do anything because of the crushing student loans and such. I want to at least be able to have a little bit of fun, be able to go out to a movie on occasion, eat food other than the dreaded cafeteria food every once in a while, maybe buy a video game or two. Heck, I feel like even if I spent as little money as I possibly can, I would still run broke.

UO does have a career center where you can go to look for jobs being offered to college students, but through all my digging there, the jobs available either require you have a degree already or have a car (as if I could AFFORD a car, not to mention UO goes out of their way to discourage driving as much as possible).

I'm starting to regret ever thinking college was a good idea, despite the fact that my dream career (theoretical physics research and/or college professor teaching physics) requires at least a Master's degree to even have the slimmest of chances of getting a job.

Please tell me I'm just overreacting or overthinking this. I hate the idea that I might have to give up on college before I even start because I can't find a job or anything to help me survive the overwhelming costs of college.",finance,1374741339
Bitcoin,One Million Years In The Future: Can Bitcoin Hack It?,"Here is one for those who just got their shipments from Silk Road: 

It is one million years in the future, and human society is intergalactic. We've reached the far stretches of the ""universe"" and maybe even interacted with some other civilizations. Trade is nothing what it once was, and money can't be pieces of paper.Instead, a futuristic version of Bitcoin - perhaps based on the original protocol itself - infuses intergalactic human trade and a human society that human beings of today would not recognize.

Not only are decentralized digital currencies booming with the new multi-planet society, but people store their bitcoins in their brains...

I thought that for today's blog, it would be interesting to revisit Carl Sagan's question: ""What does it mean for a civilization to be a million years old? We have had radio telescopes and spaceships for a few decades; our technical civilization is a few hundred years old ... an advanced civilization millions of years old is as much beyond us as we are beyond a bushbaby or a macaque.""

Today, in 2013, we have had the Internet, truly had the Internet, for a little over a decade. Since then it has become not merely a tool of mass media, but it has indeed become mass media its' very self. Not only is it still revolutionizing virtually every entertainment industry, it has also resulted in most of our economy running on software, something that baby boomers and the World War II generation could scantily imagine until the last thirty years.

Michio Kaku is a professor of theoretical physics at City University of New York and he believes that Sagan's question is no longer speculation, writing that ""one day, many of us could gaze at encyclopedia that contains the coordinates of perhaps hundreds of Earth-like planets in our sector of the galaxy. Then we will ponder with wonder, as Sagan did, what an intelligent civilization a million years' ahead of ours will look like."" Perhaps some of us will ask: ""Do they accept Bitcoin?""

Who knows, goes the logic, perhaps humanity will soon discover Earth-sized twins of our planet orbiting nearby solar systems. As the existential shock wears off, will we look to them with wonder and wanderlust? A new understanding of ourselves in the context of the universe will reinvent the holographic sky in our minds.  Is someone looking to us with similar wonder and wanderlust? Will one day we have to send money home to our families on good ole' planet Earth via Bitcoin?

The Russian astrophysicist Kardeshev defined three levels of advanced civilizations based on how they harness energy to fuel their societies.  All three stages or categories of civilizations, including the most advanced Type III, would still be bound by the laws of physics which enable us to predict the behavior of the universe from the subatomic world to the large-scale structures of the universe.

Type I civilizations would have technological levels like ours today. This metric is generally arrived at by figuring total energy consumption. Carl Sagan estimated that Earth qualifies as a .07 civilization while he lived. Type II civilizations would be capable of harnessing the energy of their own sun. Type III civilizations would be able to utilize energy on the scale of their own galaxies.

If human society had harnessed all of the power of the sun and later its own galaxy, would Bitcoin still be relevant? More pressing, could amendments to the protocol itself make it relevant? Assuming the mining of all 21 million bitcoins had been completed before human society even began harnessing the energy of the sun, then what difference does human advancement make for BTC?



Kardeshev calculated that the energy consumption of these types of civilizations would be separated by a factor of about 10 billion. In 1963, he searched for trades of the more advanced type II and III civilizations' at the 920 MHZ wavelength creating an uproar of excitement thinking he had discovered signals from a Type II civilization when in fact he had not.  He had found a quasar with a red shift.

Similar transpired in 1967 when regular signals were detected by radio telescopes at Cambridge, England. These turned out to be the first discovery of a neutron star.

Kaku believes, along with with Princeton physicist Freeman Dyson, that even though human civilization has only recently begun to master planetary engines - fossil fuel, passive solar, win, geothermal and nuclear fission - humanity will, within two centuries, attain Type I status.

Human society would need to grow modestly. A mere 1 percent growth, according to Kardeschev's numbers, means that it would take 3,200 years to reach Type II status, and 5,800 years to reach Type III status.

Theoretically, it would take centuries or even millennia for a Type I civilization to terraform nearby planets. Then, we would arrive at a Type II civilization, and that stage in which human trade is put under extraterrestrial scrutiny. Clearly, the Federal Reserve system would be unsustainable in this environment.

As for decentralized currencies like Bitcoin, since it is totally understandable that humanity would make it a priority to bring 4G across its galactic realm, they have more than a chance. In fact, they could be the only way to trade should humanity find itself a home away from home.

The Type III civilization is ""truly immortal. It has exhausted the power of a single star, and has reached out to other star systems. No natural catastrophe known to science has the capacity to destroy a Type III civilization.""

Some theoretical problems of forming a Type III civilization begin with Einstein's theory of relativity. Nothing travels faster than light. Including block chain confirmations. This speed limit holds back a civilization's capacity to expand intergalactic. There will have to be developments in human understanding of the universe in order to Bitcoin devs to figure out how to make Bitcoin faster than the speed of light.

This could delay the transition from a Type II to a Type III civilization by perhaps a million years or so, one human physicist estimates.

Granted, all of these conjectures assume human beings get more advanced in a linear fashion. It also assumes that biological creatures in the universe are similar to us and evolve similarly.

Here we today, however, with less than a century of binary artificial intelligence. Many scientists talk seriously about parity and beyond Artificial Intelligence.  This ""beyond"" will be exponential, and many believe it will arrive this century.  They say, the big philosophical question is not what human society will look like in a million years, but, rather: if ""we"" survive a million years, what is ""we?"" Do we identify with dinosaurs and fish in this society, or the AI we have become.

If Bitcoin is a part of that equation, then you can be sure ""we"" will be using brainwallets.

Basically, I just paid off all the balances on my credit cards ($5000, $2000 and $1500) very recently. But I haven't really been using any of them for at least a year and a half, other than an occasional purchase here or there, because my interest rates are insane! 



When the economy tanked, my interest rates skyrocketed (I got a letter from one bank saying they supposedly raised rates across the board and the other bank said it was because my balance was too high at 70% utilization). All three went from ~14% to 29.99%. 



Now that I paid off all the balances, I want to start using these cards again. I'm not too keen on closing them since I've had them for such a long time, at around 5-9 years. My credit score is 728 so its pretty good-ish. Would it raise flags if I called the companies and asked them to lower my interest rates so that I could start charging/raising my credit? I've heard of CC companies closing accounts because they were going unused and I don't want that, but cmon-- 29.99% is RIDICULOUS AND I REFUSE. Help, please!? Much appreciated!",finance,1374729442

personalfinance,College loan question.,"So a lot of info here. I'm leaving the military and I want to use my Montgomery GI Bill to complete a college certificate program. The program should cost about $4500. Now my original plan was to take out a loan with my financial institution, being that payment is deferred until graduation, and a low interest rate. Unfortunately Wells Fargo (Institution uses them) is not ""partners"" with APUS, and they can't give me a loan for that institution.

So I have enough money in a CD to pay for the program, I could pay it straight out. I could take a loan against the CD and pay it back with the GIB funds. Or I could enroll in the 9/11 GIB, which would pay the tuition, but would take significant time to be processed, and being that the program is online, I would receive a much lower amount.

personalfinance,Need advice on how to cover my last year of undergrad tuition.,"Hello personalfinance!

Here’s a brief rundown of my current loan debt.  I made a table that breaks down the Sallie Mae loans further, which I can provide if it would be helpful.

Sallie Mae Smart Option Loans: $26,800 total (5 total: 7.25%, 8% x2, 10.38% x2)

Federal Direct Unsub Loan: $17500

Federal Stafford Loan: $13500

Total: $57,800

*Federal loans include this upcoming semester.

**Tuition amount that still needs covered for Fall 2013: $5,700**
(Spring 2014 should be the same situation)


SM: Payments of $25 each per month (“Smart Option”).  Extra payments towards loan balance when I have extra income. I have a cosigner on each loan.  I have taken out a Sallie Mae loan each semester I’ve been at school except for Fall 2012 when I was awarded a generous third party scholarship that allowed me to pay my tuition bill out of pocket.

Fed Loans:  Based on my annual FAFSA application.  I am paying for tuition myself.  My mom helps me out with my rent (off-campus apartment).

I realize I should’ve educated myself on personal finance a lot sooner, and that having this much debt to Sallie Mae wasn’t the best option.  However, I’m trying to make the best of it before I go to grad school or start a full-time job as an engineer.

Income/Savings:  I have about $3000 saved up from working this summer.  At school, I have a part-time job that provides $50-80 a week, and with my current schedule and place on the staff that will not increase this year.  I will need at least half of that $3000 for living expenses, so I’m not comfortable spending it all on my tuition bill.

My tuition bill is due at the end of August, and I can extend it a few weeks if necessary.  I expect the Spring 2014 tuition bill to be identical. I will graduate in May 2014, and will either enter graduate school or a full-time job.  I plan to only attend graduate school on fellowship (paid tuition+ living expenses and maintain a part-time job on the side) or seek a full-time position with a starting salary of $55k+ (very typical of my field in the region that I plan to work in).  If I go on to get a Master’s, I’m hoping for a starting salary of $65k+.  Either way, once I start a full-time job I plan to spend the first year or two aggressively paying off my student loans while (hopefully) living at home with my mom.  I should not need to buy a car in that time period.

**Should I continue with Sallie Mae for this year to cover my tuition?  Is there a better option as far as loans go?**

personalfinance,Can I afford a Chevy Volt?,"The largest car payment that I'm comfortable making is about $400 a month.  The Volt costs $40,000, but it has a $7,500 federal tax credit along with a $5,000 state credit.

I was thinking about putting down about $4,000 - $6,000 on the car with my trade.  This would bring the financing amount down to around $32,000.  

By the end of the year, I'll have paid more than $7,500 in Federal taxes and more than $5,000 in state taxes.  I'm not entirely sure how Tax Credits work, but I'm under the impression that I'll get that money back as a refund after I file next year.

My plan was to purchase the car in December 2013 and then file my taxes early in 2014.

By my calculations, based on what I'm putting down, my monthly car payment would be $600+/month.  If I were to get $12,500 back as a tax refund and place it in a separate account, over 60 months it works out to be about $208 dollars a month I could use to supplement my car payment.

$600 - $208 = $392/month over 60 months, which is comfortable for me.

So my question is, is this a good plan?  Do tax credits work the way I've described above?  Would it be better to buy the car and refinance it after receiving the tax refund?  Should I adjust my withholdings for the rest of the year so I have more money to put down on it?

Sorry for the long post.

personalfinance,Need Help Deciding Whether to Go Back to College,"Last semester, I finished my sophomore year at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I find myself hit with a wall when deciding to go back.I am a chemical engineering student, that has a 2.75 GPA.

For Georgia Tech graduates, a Bachelor's in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering has a median starting salary of 67k/year, with a 15 year salary at ~120k/year median. 

As an out-of-state student, Georgia Tech costs $14,997 in tuition a semester. Since I pay my own room and board, that would be a 30k/year cost.

Currently, I have borrowed the following:

Freshman Year
$3,484 Federal Subsidized at 3.4%
$1,990 Federal Unsubsidized at 6.8%

Sophomore Year
$4,456 Federal Subsidized at 3.4%
$1,980 Federal Unsubsidized at 6.8%

My parents have borrowed the rest of my college costs using the Parent PLUS loans, which they have said they will help me with, but I can reasonably expect to be responsible for paying half of those loans back to them at low interest, as they will be paying back the loans in full &lt;4 years. The amount I could expect to pay back is approximately $25,000-$30,000.

For this year, my parents have had a delay on their tax filings, which has resulted in me having no access to Federal loans. Additionally, as per agreement with my parents, I now bear responsibility for the remaining loans (with them acting as co-signers.)

This places my total graduating debt at $102,000.


For this semester, I applied to Wells Fargo for a private student loan of $14,977. If this rate is continued for the rest of my degree, I can expect to borrow $60,000 more dollars. My Wells Fargo loan has returned with interest rates of %10.99 fixed or %7.99 variable. These both seem high to me, and as such I am at a loss of what to do.

Here are my options, as I see it:

1. Continue applying for loans to find more competitive interest rates.

2. Take a semester off of school to allow parents to complete tax filings, so that I may complete my FASFA and regain access to federal loans.

3. Transfer to an in-state school and hope to pay less/nothing. However, none of the in-state schools (Montana) are particularly prestigious; as such, starting salaries for Chemical Engineering are $10-20k lower. I have not been able to find data for salary increases, but Montanan salaries are generally much lower than the national average. 

4. Pursue a 2-year military ROTC scholarship.

Is taking on more debt a bad idea? How do the interest rates I listed for Wells Fargo sound? Do you think I will be able to obtain more competitive rates? *Will it be possible to repay my loans in a reasonable amount of time, or will my debts crush me?*

I have had a part time job through my whole college career that can become a full-time job at a pay of ~$13/hour.

Many of you have suggested that I post a BTC address where you can send me thank-you tips after you receive your Bitfloor refunds. For those of you who were thinking of doing this, I would really appreciate it if you showed your gratitude by tipping IAFCU. Please read on for details of how to do this.

(If you already tipped me on reddit or elsewhere — thanks! I'll be forwarding your tip on to IAFCU.)

When I spoke to Jordan Modell recently, I learned that IAFCU incurred a lot of expenses (legal, software, and personnel) beyond what they were expecting as they worked to set up Bitfloor users' new accounts and process refunds. They will continue to incur expenses as Bitfloor users start transferring their money to other financial institutions.

I asked Jordan if he could provide me a rough breakdown of the expenses they've incurred so far. He checked his records and emailed me the following:

* New software to handle Office of Foreign Assets Control checks for those without accounts: $3,500
* Call center: $1,000 and climbing
* New hires: $1,500
* Manpower: $4,000 - $5,000 (Their whole team worked double shifts on weekends, and no one took a day off in 16 days and counting.)

Because IAFCU is a small non-profit, these expenses are significant for them. I'd really love to see them at least break even for all the help they've given us (and hopefully even better than break even).

I am hoping we can raise $15,000 for IAFCU from within the Bitcoin community as a show of goodwill. I spoke to Jordan about whether they can receive donations, and he said that they can. The best way to do it is by making a contribution to the Internet Archive.

Here's what I'm proposing we do to make the fundraiser a bit public:

* If you'd like to participate, visit http://archive.org/donate/index.php and select your donation method of choice (they welcome BTC, but other USD payment options are there, too)
* (This is important) send an email to donations@archive.org. In it, include the amount you donated and request that your donation be used to cover IAFCU expenses. Brewster Kahle's assistant will be on the lookout for these messages to make sure the funds get where you want them to go.
* If you'd like me to count your contribution in a public tally showing how much we've raised for IAFCU, BCC me on your email to donations@archive.org so I know how much you gave. You can PM me for my email address if you don't have it already.

And thanks!

http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1010625 

(Reuters) - Japan's government upgraded its view on the economy for a third straight month in July, saying deflation was easing and growth was picking up due to its policies of aggressive monetary stimulus and generous state spending.

That outlook, which is in line with the Bank of Japan's view, is a boost for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who vowed to stay focused on reviving the economy after his coalition won a strong victory in Sunday's upper house election.

""The economy is steadily picking up and it shows some movement towards a self-sustainable recovery,"" the Cabinet Office said in its monthly economic report on Tuesday.

""Recent price developments indicate that deflation is easing,"" the report said.

A separate government report said the nation needed long-term fiscal reform to support the recovery and beat deflation, which has strangled the economy for 15 years.

The government upgraded its assessments on capital spending, factory output and business sentiment as confidence recovered and a softer yen helped to boost corporate earnings, which it said should feed through to incomes and investment.

""We need further recovery in firms' capital spending and the income situation"" before the recent bright signs in the economy can be termed a clear recovery, a Cabinet Office official said.

Capital spending was ""levelling off and shows some movement towards picking up"", the report said, while industrial production was ""increasing at a moderate pace"" and business sentiment was improving.
The economy grew at an annualised 4.1 percent rate in January-March.

FISCAL REFORM

The report on long-term public finances said fiscal discipline was needed to maintain market confidence and prevent a sudden spike in interest rates.

Japan's public debt is already more than twice the size of its 500 trillion yen economy, the largest among major industrialised nations after years of fiscal spending to try to jump-start the stagnant economy, and a planned sales tax hike is considered a test of the appetite for fiscal reform.

The government will decide later this year on whether to go ahead with a scheduled increase in the sales tax rate to 8 percent next April from 5 percent, the first step in a planned a planned doubling of the levy buy October 2015.

Abe has concerns that raising the tax rate could damage the economy. The government report, however, said the experience in Europe was that raising consumption taxes did not necessarily damage growth.

personalfinance,I need some clarity ..,"I will start off by saying this ..
I know nothing about personal finance and the only time I have really dealt with money is through paychecks, but this is my situation.
-I am 19 years old and next august I will be graduating culinary school with my bachelors degree with student loan debt of 28k
-The interest rate for my loan will be 6.8%
-Right out the college a person with my experience is looking at $12 an hour working 60 hour weeks which comes out to around $2,880 before taxes.
My question is. Would it be smarter to move back in with my parents after I graduate to try and pay off this loan as soon as possible OR is it possible to live with my girlfriend paying around $600 a month in rent plus normal expenses (car, food, etc.)
I dont want to be sitting on this loan until I am 40 years old. But at the same time, I want to live on my own and grow as a chef. Living at home isnt the best thing for my professional career. I will learn more and become a more valuable employee by moving to a bigger city and learning as much as possible. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any help or advice is great.

business,What the Civil War Can Teach Companies Today,"In the Civil War, the organization that was “shareholder”-centered was beaten into extinction by the organization that was “customer”-centered.

This article by Erika Andersen at Forbes, “The Management Theory that Explains Why 70% of Workers Are Disengaged,” says that employee disengagement is a direct result of companies that only care about their quarterly bottom line.  Companies that are focused on the customer are thriving AND have engaged employees.

As Ms. Andersen so eloquently put it at the end of her article:  “Duh.”

Now what does this have to do with the Civil War?  Answer:  The War Between the States was a precursor to what is happening now with organizations around the world.  The company that’s focused on the shareholder will lose, become a dinosaur, and die out.  The company that’s focused on the customer will thrive, take over, and succeed.  And they’ll do so with happy, engaged employees.

What do I mean?

Take the South, for example.  The Confederate States of America were created to protect the slave-holder (i.e. shareholder).  These “elites” were the minority of Southerners who owned the institution of slavery, the biggest part of the region’s economy.  They cared only about protecting their stake and used their political influence to separate their region at great cost to their own people.  When it was done, their new nation lay in ruins; broke, desperate, destitute, and nonexistent.

The North, on the other hand, was focused on all of the people (i.e. the customers).  The Chief Executive (Officer), Abraham Lincoln, obtained victory by making sure that all customers were included in the plan.  Everyone from the slave to the farmer to the cowboy to the rich Northern shareholder were all part of the vision to reunite the country.  This organization cared about saving the best possible form of government where all men (and women, eventually) could have an equal opportunity to succeed.  When the war was done, the Union was victorious because it had the support of the vast majority of people.

Oh, and yes, the Union’s shareholders – the ones who financed the war and provided supplies for it – got very rich; doing much better financially than their Southern counterparts.

Despite much pain and suffering, it was a win-win situation for the Union.  The North and West would experience unprecedented growth over the next century.  The South would take over a century to recover, but only when it adopted people (customer)-centric governments after the Civil Rights Movement.

History is repeating itself today in offices, boardrooms, and even on the stock market.  The customer-centric companies mentioned in Ms. Andersen’s article are the ones who will succeed while the dinosaurs slowly die out:  In the last year, Netflix’s stock price is up 396%, Amazon’s stock price is up 41%, and Zipcar’s stock is up 107%.  I’m willing to guess their employee engagement statistics are pretty awesome, too.

personalfinance,Extremely generous financial package from my university. Are there anyways to capitalize on my good fortune?,"I just recently turned 18 years old and will be attending a university this fall. My family income was rather low. This made me eligible for a reasonable amount of scholarships. So, I was lucky enough to receive an extremely large financial aid package from the university I plan on attending this fall. And by large, I mean large. It managed to cover all my expenses for this year. And assuming my family remains under the income cap, they will renew the financial aid package every year. So, I essentially should walk out of college without any student loans. I'm extremely fortunate for my financial situation, and I would like to capitalize on my good fortune. 

I am already entered into the federal work study program. The specific job and pay will not be specified until the first week of the fall semester. I will be living on campus, so transportation and gas are currently not a major issue.

politics,Email Response from Rep. Candice Miller (R-MI) on Why She Voted Nay on H.R.2397 (Amash-Conyers Amendment to Restrict NSA Intelligence-Gathering),"&gt;Thank you for contacting me regarding an amendment to H.R. 2397, the annual Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, seeking to defund intelligence-gathering efforts of the National Security Agency (NSA).  I appreciate hearing from you on this issue, and I am pleased for the opportunity to respond to your concerns.
&gt; 
&gt;As you know, Representatives Justin Amash (R-MI) and John Conyers (D-MI) offered an amendment to the annual Department of Defense Appropriations Bill on July 24, 2013 which sought to restrict the capability of the NSA to collect information such as phone records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.  I heard from several of my constituents on this issue, and after careful consideration, I opposed the Amash-Conyers amendment because I believe it would have destroyed a vital tool that our government uses to defend our nation against foreign terrorists seeking to murder our fellow citizens.  I also believe it went against the first and foremost Constitutional responsibility of the federal government, which is to defend America against our enemies.  
&gt; 
&gt;I do not believe that the rights guaranteed by our Constitution extend to foreign terrorists, and our sacred rights should not provide them with any protection while they plot to kill our fellow citizens.  I agreed with a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal which stated that this amendment would ""return America to a pre-9/11 mindset on fighting terror that treats terrorists as street burglars instead of enemies of our nation.""  I also agreed with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which stated that the Amash-Conyers Amendment takes ""the wrong approach to an important question, is probably unwise and possibly un-Constitutional.""
&gt; 
&gt;The program that this amendment would destroy has been credited with helping to stop 54 terrorist plots in 20 countries around the world against American citizens, American interests or those of our allies.  On the other hand, the proponents of this effort have not come forward with a single instance of any American who has had his or her Constitutional rights violated, who has been wrongly charged with any crime, or has been harmed in any way.  In my opinion, the threat to our civil liberties suggested by the Amash-Conyers Amendment is a phantom threat that does not exist.  As my colleague on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Michelle Bachmann, said, the sponsors of the Amash-Conyers Amendment are putting forward a false narrative.
&gt; 
&gt;One of the attacks that this program provided the key piece of information that allowed our intelligence and law enforcement officials to stop was the plot to explode bombs on the New York City subway system. That plot was led by an Afghan immigrant, Najibullah Zazzi, and other terrorists inside our country.  The plot was discovered when Zazzi's phone number had been in contact with a known terrorist overseas, and it was thwarted just before it was set to take place. Law enforcement officials estimate that 1,000 or more Americans would have been killed if this brutal and evil attack had been carried out.  Those are the facts, and many innocent men, women and children are alive today because this program allowed the government to connect the dots and stop this attack before the terrorists struck, just as it was admonished to do by the 9/11 Commission, to better protect our nation.  That is real and just one example of the attacks avoided and lives saved due to this program.  
&gt; 
&gt;I wonder how many dead Americans the supporters of the Amash-Conyers Amendment would be willing to accept in the effort to protect an alleged 4th Amendment protection for terrorists like Najibullah Zazzi.  I say 'alleged' because the program in place does not violate the 4th Amendment protections of Americans.  In the 1979 Smith v. Maryland decision, the Supreme Court ruled that telephone billing records were not protected by the 4th Amendment because they were the property of the phone company, not the individual.  So the collection of phone metadata, such as number and duration of the call, to support this program violates no individual's rights under the 4th Amendment.  
&gt; 
&gt;It is also disappointing the supporters of the Amash-Conyers Amendment put forward so much false and misleading information.  Many led people to believe that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court, which maintains strict judicial oversight of the program, was allowing the NSA to gather not just metadata, but also the content of telephone conversations.  This is simply untrue.  All that is collected is phone numbers and duration of calls.  No names, no addresses, and no content is attached to this information.  They also led people to believe that the NSA has unfettered access to this information.  This is also untrue.  In fact, the NSA cannot even do a search of the data for a particular phone number unless they have a court order provided for a specific purpose.  In 2012, there were fewer than 300 searches on this data; hardly a broad trampling of the rights of 360,000,000 Americans.  The only numbers that are ever searched are those contacted by known terrorists overseas.  I do not believe we should provide protections to those in our nation plotting with known terrorists from across the world. 
&gt; 
&gt;The supporters of this amendment have also voted to release the terrorists being held at Guantanamo Bay and either send them back to their countries or bring them into American civilian courts for trial.  I believe, once again, that this extension of Constitutional rights to some of the world's most heinous terrorists, including 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Muhammed, is wrongheaded, makes our nation less secure, is unprecedented in our nation's history and emboldens our enemies to make further attacks on American citizens and interests.
&gt; 
&gt;However, in order to effectively protect the Constitutional rights of Americans without endangering our national security, I am proud to have supported the Nugent-Pompeo Amendment to the Defense Appropriations Bill which states:
&gt; 
&gt;""None of funds made available by this Act may be used by the National Security Agency to—conduct an acquisition pursuant to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 for the purpose of targeting a United States person; or acquire, monitor, or store the contents of any electronic communication of a United States person from a provider of electronic communication services to the public pursuant to section 501 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.""
&gt; 
&gt;The Nugent-Pompeo Amendment makes perfectly clear that the content of any communication of Americans within our nation are off limits to collection by the NSA under FISA, and it passed by a vote of 409-12.
&gt; 
&gt;The Amash-Conyers Amendment, on the other hand, would have limited the collection of data to only those individuals who are the subject of an investigation.  This amendment does not mention Americans at all.  Consequently, it would prevent the collection and analysis of all bulk data – not just the data of American citizens. The Amash-Conyers Amendment dictates that the NSA would not be able to collect and analyze bulk data from Yemen, Afghanistan, Egypt, Pakistan, or any other country around the world where people are actively working to murder innocent Americans.  As Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, it is my experience that fighting terrorism is like finding a needle in a haystack.  Terrorists live in the shadows and plot secretly.  The Amash-Conyers Amendment would require that we find the needle, wherever it may be across the globe, before our intelligence officials could even look in the haystack.
&gt; 
&gt;I refuse to go back to the pre-9/11 mindset that provides those who seek to murder our fellow citizens space to plot and scheme in the shadows while tying the hands of those seeking to stop them.  I believe that such an approach violates the first duty given to the federal government by the Constitution to provide for the common defense, as well as the oath I took to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.
&gt; 
&gt;For all of these reasons, I voted to defeat the Amash-Conyers Amendment when it was considered in the House, and it ultimately failed by a vote of 205-217.  I can assure you I will continue to fulfill my Constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense of our nation while also fully honoring the sacred rights enjoyed by every American.

personalfinance,"All right, all right, PF, you finally convinced me. Review my plan?","I have $135k in student loans between federal and private (60k and 75k respectively).  I've asked for advice here on a different handle and got advice that I didn't want to take - that I need to get a real job, live lean, and put all of my extra money toward those loans until they're paid off.  I fought against it but I've come around.

I'm not so worried about the federal loans because of the income-based consolidation rates they offer.  But I am worried about the private loans, because their interest rates are high and I'm not sure consolidation is the best option there - do you guys have any advice?  One loan in particular is about $41k at 9.75% interest, and my dad can consolidate a loan up to $45k at 6.75% through his credit union (he's helping me pay the loans).  Smart move or no?

My plan is to use the degree I just got in May to get a job that actually pays well - I work in retail right now making less than $19k after taxes, I'm going to go for jobs between $35k and $50k (before taxes).  I'm deferring my loans until January so that I have time to get that job, get divorced, and save up what I can for padding; then I want to make double payments on the private loans, and whatever my dad can afford to help out with, he can put toward the principal.  I'm hoping if I do this, and really really stick to it, I can have all of my private loans paid off in 2-3 years.

I remember that some of y'all expressed disdain over the fact that I'm having my dad help me the last time I asked for advice, and I gotta say, this was my parents' plan all along and he's willing to help.  I'm trying to take the lion's share of the responsibility for it so that he can have his own life without having my student loans interfere.

If you guys have any more suggestions, I'm officially all ears.",finance,1374930866
politics,TIL: Total U.S debt appears to be 70% of Global GDP (or Gross World Product),"Rummaging around some stats saw that aside from the U.S National debt (Currently around $16.8 trillion) the amount of debt for the country as a whole from households, businesses, State and Local Government, Financial institutions and Federal government is a staggering $56.6 Trillion. 

When this is compared to the Gross World Product (Being the combined gross national product of all the countries in the world) which sat at $84.97 trillion for 2012, it appears that America and it's citizens owe 70% of what the World generates in a year.

personalfinance,When auto loan interest &lt;= inflation rate...,"I have about $10k left on my auto loan.  I could pay it off, but my interest rate is only 1.89%.  According to inflationdata.com, the current inflation rate in the U.S. is ~1.75% (and likely to go up to 2%+).  

That being said, would it make sense to let the bank continue to finance the auto loan, or should I just pay it off if I can?  The way I see it, I can keep my $10k cash and invest it.  As long as I am making above 0.15%, (the difference between the loan and inflation), it would make sense.  With the car being a depreciating asset, and the nature of the loan being asset-based, I suppose the true cost to the bank would be even higher.  This leads me to think I should maintain the loan for the foreseeable future.

On the other hand, it would be kind of nice to have more cashflow every month, but this is not necessary.

I have NO IDEA why it isn't working, especially since it works on many, but not all, systems. It seems to me like the problem is either something very unclear and inobvious that it gives no warning at all about, or that it's a problem with the API itself.

So we'll either not get a fix for this, we'll get an unofficial fix, or we'll get a fix EVENTUALLY.

Problem Two:

1. Turn on cloud saving
2. Start Ys I
3. Play game, save
4. Check if save is there, and it is
5. Close Ys I
6. Turn off cloud saving
7. Start Ys I

19. Check if save copied over is there...and it is not
20. Stop Ys I
21. Go check that folder
22. WTF there's only a bmp that shows the place I saved at and no actual save file

[PERS](http://www.drs.wa.gov/benefit-estimators/html/pers2/p2wksh.pdf) (warning pdf): 2% x 30 X (Average monthly final compensation) = $5,500/month

What am I missing about the FERS benefit plan? I keep hearing about how great Federal benefits are. Pension plans suck in that they're not really mobile, but, I would only work for the Public Sector in Washington State anyway since the majority of the hospitals here are run by Providence/Catholic Health Initiatives. The plus side of my current employment is that my PERS plan is transferable to various state agencies, so I could work for counties doing Public Health, the jail system, mental health system, etc. The only downside is that I'm not sure if I want to live in Washington State for the rest of my life, it's quite beautiful here, but I feel restless (I could move to different states if I worked within the VA hospital system). 

This is all assuming I don't get any sweet job offers in my life after I become a nurse practitioner, I'm currently an RN and my salary is about ~$60k/year and my average final compensation if I don't further along my education and I work at the highest paying county institution will be ~$90k.

personalfinance,Snowball vs Avalanche: My thoughts and plan,"I've got 7k in credit cards that I need to pay off. (6 cards) About half of that is on 2 cards, all have about the same interest rate. For the last year or so I've been trying to pay them off using avalanche, throw my money at the biggest ones because I get charged more every month to have those, right?? It never made sense to snowball because that's like wasting money paying more interest charges over the years by leaving the big ones alone for longer. 

BUT, a year of ""avalanching"" and I actually had accumulated more debt. It's discouraging to throw small amounts of money at huge amounts of debt without any immediate results. Obviously, I'm not great with money which is why I have these cards run up so high in the first place. (Plus, I bought my first house last year that needed more work than I originally thought, which apparently happens to everyone.) Why was I trying this method for so long? It obviously doesn't work for my type of brain. 

Today I re-did my entire payment plan with the snowball effect and I'm SO PUMPED. My first card will be paid off within a month. My second will be done on Oct 1st. My 3rd on Jan 17th. And the 4th on May 1st. This gets rid of 4 credit cards in less than a year, and so what if there is barely a dent in my 2 big cards by the time I get to them? In April I'll switch back to the avalanche and pay down the larger until they're even, then pay equally until GONE. Probably another year or so. WOOHOO! 

So while as pumped as I am to get this done, my point (and hopefully this may help someone else who was going through the same thing) is that even though financially it may make more sense for someone to avalanche their debt, for people like me who need immediate results to stay motivated it makes more sense to do it this way. If you can't do something the right way, do it another way that still gets it done eventually. Don't just throw your hands in the air and give up.  

*I understand a lot of people already do this, that's why there is a name for it and everything, I just personally went for so long thinking that it sounded stupid and backwards, if anyone out there feels like I did I'm hoping this might possibly help them.*

ALSO, another affect of snowballing is that it clears out your lower credit cards almost immediately, leaving them in GREAT standing on your credit score, while still keeping your large cards current by making min payments. It seems like my credit score will reflect a higher number faster this way instead of paying down the big ones first and having 5 full to the top cards with 1 being paid down at a time.

news,Should Criminal Trials Be Televised?,"Thursday, July 25th, 2013
Perdido Key, Florida

TELEVISE CRIMINAL TRIALS?  OF COURSE!

Following the Zimmerman verdict, a number of legal and media voices, hollered, “enough is enough.”  Angered by the verdict, no more criminal trials on television, they said.  But the Constitution guarantees that trials are public and open to everyone.  And what could be more public than televising a criminal trial for the whole world to see? 

Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker wrote last week that cameras should be taken out of the courtroom, particularly in high-profile trials.  She concludes:  “Our mighty respect for the public’s right to know -- has clouded our judgment.  There may be no way to quantitatively prove that cameras influence courtroom behavior and, possibly, a trial’s outcome. But anyone who’s ever sat in front of a camera knows that it is so.”

Now look, Ms. Parker.  The criminal justice system could use some help.  A majority of Americans feel that justice often doesn’t prevail.  A nationwide poll by the respected Rasmussen Reports, taken just before the Zimmerman verdict, found that only 45 percent of Americans feel that the justice system is fair.  Only 34 percent felt the system is fair to the poor.  That’s a lot of cynicism -- maybe more public trials would help the skeptics gain a little more confidence in a system where they feel that over half the time justice is not served.

America has a strong tradition of public trials. In early colonial America, courthouses were the centers of community life, and most citizens regularly attended criminal trials. In fact, trials frequently became community events. Citizens were knowledgeable about trials, and there was wide participation in the process -- especially in rural America, where trials were often scheduled on market day, when local farmers came to town for supplies.  Many courtrooms were built to accommodate 300 or more observers.

Back then, citizens closely observed the defendants, knew when judges issued ridiculous rulings, and saw firsthand whenever justice was perverted. Whatever happened, the citizens were there, watching.  The court system belonged to them. The televising of criminal trials would merely be an extension of this direct review by the average citizen.

Would televising criminal trials create a circus atmosphere?  There's no reason to think that they would. In fact, many of our most sacred ceremonies, including church services and inaugurations, are televised without dignity lost.  Judge Burton Katz said it well:  “We should bring pressure to bear on all judges to open up their courtrooms to public scrutiny.  Members of the judiciary enjoy great entitlements and wield enormous power. They bear close watching by an informed public. I guarantee that the public would be amazed at what goes on in some court rooms.”

Back in 1997 when I was a practicing attorney in Louisiana, I participated in the state’s first televised trial before the Louisiana Supreme Court.  A state senator was opposing my efforts to impound the automobiles of uninsured drivers.  I was the Insurance Commissioner at the time, and represented the state in our effort to uphold the impoundment law. The issue was important to the vast majority of Louisianans, and they were entitled to hear the arguments, and watch the trial in progress.  No one pandered to the cameras, and the entire courtroom procedure was straightforward and dignified.  The proceedings were televised without a hitch,

Harvard law professor and criminal defense attorney Alan Dershowitz put it this way: “Live television coverage may magnify the faults in the legal system, and show it warts and all. But in a democracy the public has the right to see its institutions in operation, close-up.  Moreover, live television coverage generally brings out the best, not the worst in judges, lawyers and other participants.  The video camera helps to keep the system honest by keeping it open.”

In the Zimmerman trial, there were some complicated issues that needed explanation for both the jury and the public.  For example: Just what is meant by “Stand your Ground?”  How does this differ from self-defense?  When does an aggressor become a victim who can assert self defense?  Just what is a hate crime?  When one’s life is on the line, is it proper and fair to have only six people on a jury?  On what grounds can the Justice Department intervene in a state case?  What is “double jeopardy” and should it apply when Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state of Florida but is now being investigated by federal officials?

Because the Zimmerman trial was televised, a national debate has begun on whether the trial was fair, and just what laws involving violent crime and self protection should exist. Based on the widespread interest from the broadcasting of this trial, the President has called for a national debate on race.

America prides itself in being an open society which protects and encourages the public’s right to know.  Too often, courtrooms have become a bastion of secrecy where the public has little understanding of how the system works and how verdicts are reached.  The video camera serves as a check and balance.  We can better keep the system honest by keeping it open and easily available to the public.  Time to turn on the cameras.

personalfinance,"I have $153,000 in student loans with 55% private 45% federal and I'm overwhelmed!","Hello everyone!  This is my first time posting on Reddit. My boyfriend is very worried about my finances and has told me to post here.  I graduated almost a year ago with a Bachelor's of Science in Nursing. I was able to get a forbearance on all of my loans because I was having a very hard time finding a job.  Those forbearances are going to run out in the next month and the monthly payments are going to be insanely high.

I'm currently making roughly $43,200 after taxes

My debts are: 

Wells Fargo -  $81,783.36 (4 different loans with interest rates of 7.690, 7.250, 5.750, 5.750)

Parent Plus Loan: $37,690.00, interest rate 7.9%  

Federal direct loan group A: 16,500.00, interest rate 4.499%

Federal direct loan group B: 16,000.00, interest rate 6.8%

Wells Fargo credit card: $4283.00, interest rate 15.24% :(


My monthly bills and expenses total roughly $1531.00 including paying the minimum payment for my credit card (although I try to pay more than the minimum).

And if so where? How do I start that process? Thank you reddit! My boyfriend said that the people here can be very helpful and I really appreciate any advice I can get.",finance,1375038132
personalfinance,Questions regarding auto loan and credit score,"Hey guys! 

So I've a got a couple questions and I'd love to hear your opinions on them.

I'm a member of a credit union that is offered through my employer. Therein, I have a checking account that accumulates 2% interest, compounded monthly. They also offer auto loans for as low as 1.49%, up to 60 months. My credit score is 742 (according to credit karma) and I would be able to get this rate if I raised it to 750. 

I'm 22 years old and have a very stable job. I bring home roughly $3500 a month after taxes and will be living at home where I have almost no expenses until January, when I'll be moving into an apartment with a friend paying ~ $750.00 per month. I also have an egregious amount of student loans which are currently deffered until around December.

1) I know this subreddit is staunchly opposed to buying a car with anything but cash, but seeing as the interest rate on my checking account is higher than the interest rate on the loan, would this be acceptable? I could stretch out the loan for 5 years and never have the principal accumulate interest faster than the money in my checking account. 

2) What would be the best way to bump my credit score up 8 points in order to get this rate? I currently have three credit cards: one is a card for a retailer that I pay off in full every month, one, which I don't use anymore, has a zero balance, and one with about $2,000 dollars on it. The last credit card has zero interest until may 2014. I have enough cash to pay it down to zero right now but I'm going to wait until April 2014 to pay it off in one lump sum.

So, I am biased, of course, and am sick of driving around my beater Geo Prism with 135,000 miles. I'd love to get an objective, outside perspective.

personalfinance,Considering a consolidation loan. Need advice.,"I am looking at approaching my bank for a loan to consolidate the majority of my current debt.

At present I have 9000 left on a previous loan, 3000 left on a federal student loan, and 20000 on a credit card.

The credit card is an embarrasment.  I was off of work for approximately 1 year due to a hand injury/surgery and used the credit card as a supplement for my lowered income.  The CC is now the major issue as the minimum payment is now huge at 12% interest.  About $500 per month.

I have never missed a single loan payment, even when not working.  I make 2200 a month. 1600 of which goes to my loans and basic bills.

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9YUwRDseQn7YVozckU3eVA2VG8&amp;usp=sharing

Steps to Use this File:
1) Fill out Credit Card Info.  Type name of Credit Card ""CC1-CC4,"" Insert the current balance, and the interest rate.  In real life, CC2 has a portion of its balance on Zero Interest, so I left it like that in case you do, too.  

2) Do the same for Loans.  In real life, my wife's student loan has two accounts, but the same interest rate and two required payments...I don't know why, but it does. 

3) Do the same for Mortgage and Car Loan.  

NOTE: Don't tinker with anything past column L.  It is set up to solve for you and has formulas built in. 

4) Decide how much you want to ""pay.""  The red cells in the top left corner are your ""budget,"" if you will.  When the program is done, it will calculate how much you should pay to each account, but the sum won't be more than the number in the red cells. 

5) Insert ""Required Payment.""  It can be zero if there's no required payment.

I do mine monthly, so I just type in the minimum I owe.  

6) If you don't the Solver Add-In, enable it.  File -&gt; Options -&gt; Add-Ins
Click ""Go"" at the bottom near ""Manage Add-ins."" Check Solver Add-ins, hit ok, might need to close/re-open Excel. 



Once you've entered in your data and required payment, click Data in the Menu Bar, choose solver, and hit Solve. 

What happens is, Excel automatically accounts for the minimum payment, and ensures each account gets its minimum payment, but with the extra funds, it determines how you should pay so that at the end of the billing cycle, you pay the smallest amount of interest possible.  

To me, this is better than just divvying up the extra funds because I know I'm paying ""wisely."" 

I'd love to hear your feedback, and if the Google Drive doesn't work, please let me know.  I hope this helps y'all!",finance,1375034217

personalfinance,Getting approved for a credit card as a college student,"Some background information:
I am currently a college sophomore and am thinking it is time to start building a credit history. The only credit card I have right now is my father's that he added me on to before my freshman year, and that said I do have some exposure to appropriately handling a card since my father is quite keen on making sure I do not over spend. With that said, my parents have significant savings and annual income which they are willing to spend on my education. This means that they, my scholarship money, and small federal subsidized loans (only $1500 total, and they have not even been disbursed yet) my tuition and housing costs have been covered.

I applied for a Citi Forward Student card after reading quite a bit about it and its features, but I was rejected. I believe this was due to my very limited credit history and the fact that my annual wages (all from my summer internship) were not very high. I was under the impression that student cards are for those who have limited credit and low incomes, so I am confused and am looking for advice on what I should look at or do next (or if I should just wait until I get an actual job before trying to get a card or build credit).

personalfinance,Help! I Need Credit Report/Dispute Questions and Advice.,"I'm hoping someone can help me out here because I'm feeling very helpless. I just read an article that claimed that less than 1 out of 5 people were able to resolve errors on their credit reports. 

After a long bout with unemployment I was unable to pay my student loans and then when finally employed I was able to only pay some of them on time. Last year my luck changed and I paid them all off with one fell swoop. However the damage was done. After paying off over 100K in student loans and 8k in credit debt, 6 months later with no debt I was unable to get a credit card. I knew my score wasnt going to be great but I didnt think it'd be this bad. I had spotless credit until my unemployment and then I had paid it all off.

Soooooo, I signed up for a transunion account and saw I had a credit score of 714. But I noticed that 4 loans were being reported as with a balance and still open. All in all a total debt of 84k.

I disputed the loans, but then realized that the account numbers were incorrect. They were using my social security number instead of the account number used by the loan holder so when the bank got back to the credit agency the bank stated that it reported everything correctly. 

Then I refreshed my credit report and my score went down to 663. Is there another way to approach this? I tried to call transunion and they use out of country call centers who repeat the same things over and over like robots and offer no help at all.


My second issue is that there is 1 derogatory account being reported. I'm assuming its my credit card(transunion won't tell me). When paying my accounts all off I took issue with the interest rate WFB had been charging me for the last 2 years. I had made one payment late(even thru the unemployment) and they raised my rate to 24%. I had the account since I was 19 and am now 34. THey hadnt notified me of this, so I asked for a refund of the difference in interest rates. They said the only way to do that was to settle and I was concerned that would affect my credit they assured me it wouldnt have a negative affect. On my report however it states loud and clear that it was settled for an amount less than was owed. Although the transunion rep wouldnt tell me that was the ""derogatory"" account she alluded to it. Thoughts on whether I have a valid dispute here?

Last question is in regards to reading the report. I couldnt get a straight answer out of the customer service reps. There was a definite language barrier between the rep and myself which didnt make this any easier to understand.

If an account was overdue but paid in full and then closed will it be reported as delinquent?

Lots of student loans mostly from undergrad, give or take $100k. About 50/50 federal/private.

Guys graduating from my lab last month are fielding offers for immediate employment in our field for $80-95k starting immediately.

So I'm not horribly worried about employment or my ability to pay the loans. I've adjusted very well to living off the $25k or so that we make as grad students and see no need to change that lifestyle for a while (other than buying some shirts and ties, yuck).


My question is about loan interest re-capitalization. My private loans accrue interest based solely on the principal while they're still listed as 'in-school', the interest doesn't get compounded into the principal until they go into repayment. Obviously there's some benefit to paying the interest off before entering repayment, but how much?

As a hypothetical, lets say I can make $20k worth of payments in 6 months between graduating and entering repayment. Do I:

A) pay off the outstanding interest on private loans with rates of 3.25% (variable) before it capitalizes?

B) simply start paying off the highest rate loans first, 6.8% fixed federal?

I'm sure the right answer is a function of how much interest is outstanding ... call it $10k even as an estimate. In a quick search I didn't see a calculator that would tell me this. Anyone know the math quickly?",finance,1375123176

personalfinance,Guide to Student Credit Cards,"###sergi0wned’s Guide to Student Credit Cards


With the start of a new college season just around the corner, I've seen a lot of posts from students about credit cards. I figured I could type up some basic information about establishing credit history and responsibly building it through credit card use while in college. This guide is a work in progress and by no means complete, so feel free to add information, suggest new topics to cover, and share your own experiences! It's long, but I hope it's worth it!




##INTRODUCTION


College is a great time to start building your credit score. You’ve just entered adulthood, you likely have one of your first jobs, and your future is bright. You can make it even brighter by establishing a good credit score. Your credit score determines what rates you receive on car loans, mortgages, credit cards and many other financial services. The difference between a good credit score and a bad credit score can amount to tens of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your lifetime. 


There are lots of ways to build credit, but credit cards are one of the easiest ways. By simply charging expenses and **paying them off in full and on time every month**, you can establish and build your credit, gain purchase and fraud protections, and even earn rewards. 


Before I go any further, it is important to reemphasize something that I said in the previous paragraph: you must *pay your card off in full and on time every month.* If you don’t do this every time, you will negate the benefits of having a credit card, at best paying unnecessary interest and at worst damaging your credit score. Credit cards ≠ free money. You have to pay them back at the end of the month. If you don’t have cash for it and couldn’t make the purchase with your debit card, you shouldn’t make it with your credit card either. If you are able to budget and spend responsibly, though, there is no reason not to have a credit card as soon as possible.





##THE CARD ACT


The CARD Act was passed in 2009 to curb the effects of predatory lending on college students. In an effort to prevent lenders from helping students to accrue credit card debt that they could not repay, the government tightened lending restrictions for people under 21 years of age. The effect of this is that a lender cannot legally issue a credit card to someone under 21 unless they either: have a cosigner OR demonstrate an independent ability to repay their debt. Although the CARD Act has made getting a credit card as a young adult more challenging, it is not impossible. In the rest of this guide I will explain how a card can be obtained as a student, but first I will go over some important details about your credit score.





##ABOUT YOUR CREDIT SCORE


Your credit score (also known as FICO score) is calculated from information received from the three main credit reporting bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and Transunion. Your payment history for car loans, student loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc, is reported to the three bureaus. As long as you’re paying on time this helps your score, but if you miss payments or accounts go into collections your score will go down fast.  Your credit score is a lot like a GPA; it takes a lot of work to build it up, but one major fuck up and a lot of your hard work is erased. For this reason, it is important to take your score seriously and be diligent with your payments. 


[Different factors affect your credit score](http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/whatsinyourscore.aspx). All of these factors are important, but there is only so much that we can do about some of them at this time.


Payment history is the largest contributor to your credit score. Basically all you have to do is pay all of your bills on time every month. It’s that simple. If you get started on a good foot, that is; it takes years to make up for one mistake, so make sure you are paying everything on time from the get go. Like I said, your credit score is like a GPA. Consistency will be rewarded as time goes on. 


Average age of accounts (AAoA) is something that only time can create, so our main focus is to plant the seeds which we can then cultivate over time.


Inquiries (INQs), on the other hand, are something that we have control over. Every time you seek new credit (apply for a credit card, seek out a car loan, take out private student loans, etc) the lender does a “hard pull” of your credit report to assess your creditworthiness. Each one of these counts as an inquiry. (“Soft pulls,” like those done by prequalification sites or credit monitoring services like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame, on the other hand, are visible only to you and do not affect your credit score.) Although you want to avoid excessive inquiries, it is sometimes necessary to have a few on your report. They drop off after two years, and after one year their effect on the score is dramatically decreased, so don’t beat yourself up about them too much. Just use moderation; 2-3 inquiries are ok, but going on a spree of 18 applications is a bad idea. If you have too many recent inquiries, you can come off as desperate for credit, and therefore risky to lenders.


Utilization (UTIL) is another factor that we have immediate control over. Lenders report the amount of credit that you’re using and the amount of credit that is available to you. The percentage between the two is your utilization. Utilization over 30% is considered negative, and utilization between 1-9% is considered ideal. Counterintuitively, having 0% utilization does not help your score because it does not demonstrate that you can handle your credit. The good news about utilization is that it is recalculated monthly. This means that if you have a card maxed out at $2,000 but then pay it off, the next month it will show a good utilization again. Utilization can affect your credit score a good deal, but you really only have to worry about it the in months leading up to an application for new credit (although you shouldn’t be carrying balances at all on credit cards save for an extenuating circumstance, because you’re paying in full each month, right?) 


Types of credit has the smallest impact on your score, and you really only have to worry about it as the need arises. There’s no need to go out and get a car loan for a car you don’t need to boost your score. This one will take care of itself in due time after you establish a solid history with your credit cards.





##MONITORING YOUR CREDIT SCORE


Every year you are entitled to one free credit report from each of the three main credit bureaus. You can obtain these reports from [Annual Credit Report](http://www.annualcreditreport.com). Even though the site looks sketchy, it is legit and the only free site that gives you credit reports as per federal law. I recommend requesting a report from one bureau every four months (rather than getting a report from each bureau at the same time) because this way you can spread it out over the year and check one of your real reports every four months. You should check these to make sure that your payment history is accurately reflected and that there is no incorrect information. If there is anything that is not correct, you should dispute it and get it fixed or removed. Your free report has your credit history, but not your credit score.


 The only way to get your FICO score is to buy it from [myFICO](http://www.myfico.com) for $20 apiece. That’s a lot of money for a score, but if you need your real FICO score it’s the only way to get it. Fortunately, there are some free websites where you can get an approximation of your score for free. These scores are often referred to as FAKOs (fake FICOs), and while they are not exact they can help you to track your score over time. Like I mentioned earlier, these sites use “soft pulls” to access your credit report, which do NOT affect your credit score. I use and recommend three free credit tracking websites: [Credit Karma](http://www.creditkarma.com), [Credit Sesame](http://www.creditsesame.com), and [Quizzle](http://www.quizzle.com).


 Credit Karma (CK) uses information from TransUnion to calculate your FAKO. It updates weekly. It has a wonderful mobile app as well as credit monitoring, but I prefer Credit Sesame for monitoring. I mainly use CK for an estimate of my score. Credit Sesame (CS) uses information from Experian to calculate your FAKO. It updates monthly, but has an excellent credit monitoring service that notifies you immediately when there are significant changes to your account (like a new inquiry, new account, or increased credit limit). It has a great mobile app as well.


 Quizzle also uses information from Experian to calculate your FAKO. It updates every six months, but gives you a full Experian report. Using a combination of these websites, you can keep track of your credit and make sure that everything is accurate and trending upwards which is the goal! 





##ABOUT CREDIT CARDS 


Now that you have an understanding of how your credit score is calculated and how to monitor it, we can finally delve into the subject at hand: credit cards. Like I said before, but will say again because it’s *that* important, the best way to use your credit card is to *pay on time and in full every month.* Now I will explain why this is important and how to do it.


On the surface, credit cards work the same way as debit cards: you swipe it, pay for your stuff, and that’s that. But there’s much more to the story. A debit card is linked to your checking account and it immediately withdraws the charge directly from your bank. A credit card, on the other hand, works on credit. Rather than taking money directly from your account, credit cards add your charges to your “tab” which is due at the end of the month, much like a bar tab that isn’t paid until the end of the night. Just like with the bar tab, you have to pay it in the end, it’s just more convenient to pay all at once rather than item by item. So how does this “tab” idea work with a credit card? I’ll explain.


Every time you use your credit card to pay for something, the charge you incur is added to your statement. Statements are the list of all of the transactions where you use your card. Statements are generally sent out monthly, on the “statement cut date”. Your statement will include all of the charges between the last statement cut date and the current one. Think of each statement period as a different session at the bar.  


Each statement will have a “statement due date” clearly printed on it. This is the date by which you must pay your statement balance in full to avoid paying interest (this is also known as the grace period). As long as you pay your statement balance in full before the statement due date, you will never pay a cent of interest. This is like leaving the bar; you must pay your whole tab. 


At this point, it is important to note the difference between the minimum payment and the entirety of the statement balance. While paying just the minimum payment will satisfy the lender and report positively on your credit report, it WILL cause you to incur interest. Racking up debt and paying just the minimum is a surefire way to rapidly accumulate and stay in debt. It eventually gets to a point where the minimum payment covers only interest due to the high APR, and your debt actually GROWS even though you’re faithfully making the minimum payment every month. As long as you remember to **pay your statement balance in full and on time** though, you will never experience your APR or pay a penny of interest. 


APR is an important concept, but I will only briefly touch on it since if you’re using a card responsibly (read: paying in full and on time), it won’t affect you. APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate, and is the interest rate on your card. It only kicks in after the grace period ends; if the statement balance is paid in full before the statement due date, there are no interest fees incurred and your APR is irrelevant. 


Here’s a brief, hypothetical rundown of how a typical monthly statement cycle could look:


&gt; January 1 - Statement cut date (reflects transactions from last period, December 1-31)

&gt; January 22 -  Statement due date (at least the minimum payment from December’s spending is due, but you should pay the FULL statement balance)

&gt; February 1 - Statement cut date (reflects transactions from Jan 1-31)

&gt; February 22 - Statement due date (payment for January’s transactions is due) 

&gt; (note: the 21 day grace period between January 1 and 22)

&gt; (if you wanted to reduce your utilization, you would want to pay off some (but not all, if you’re trying to maximize your credit score - remember 1-9% UTIL is ideal) before February 1 but after January 1.)


In the above example, there is a roughly a month delay in when you spend vs when you pay. This is normal for cards, and why a budget and responsible spending habits are important before getting a card. 






##SECURED VS UNSECURED CREDIT CARDS


There are two types of credit cards: unsecured and secured. Unsecured (also known as revolving)  credit cards are the most common. With an unsecured card, a lender gives you a credit limit with no collateral from you. A secured card, on the other hand, requires a deposit to the bank which is held as collateral in case you default and don’t pay your back your debt. 


Secured cards generally come with fees and other annoyances, so I recommend trying for unsecured cards first, and only going to secured cards as a last resort.

personalfinance,"I messed up, I think. Where do I go from here? (new car related)","So, ever since I learned how to drive, I've bought these old junkers that were 10-15 years old. At some point, they become money pits, requiring $300+ per month (average) to keep going. 

So last year, I got sick of it, and I decide to buy a brand new 2012 Hyundai Accent. I got a pretty good interest rate (2.9%), but I opted for the extended warranty and my payment is now $303/mo.

I've been paying it off for a little over a year now, and I am still about $13,000 in debt. 

I gross about $3,000/mo, so this payment is about 10% of my take-home. 

I know that people advise that you should never buy a brand new car. Well, I did, and so to whatever extent it depreciated in value, those costs are sunk. I think the car is probably worth $10,000-$12,000 now, so I'm pretty sure I'm under water by a couple grand. To make matters worse, I may have voided the warranty. There were a couple instances where I didn't get the oil change in time (it's scheduled every 3,500 miles, but a couple times I've gone to 5,000 miles and once I went to 6,000). I have like 25,000 miles on the car now.

I really hate making these huge payments every month. I have to have comprehensive insurance (with a $500 deductible) now, too, so that adds an extra $90/mo that I didn't have to spend before. I sort of miss my old junker strategy.

How much of an idiot am I? Would it be better for me to keep driving this car into the ground? Or should I try to sell the car, pay off the difference out of my own pocket, and then go back to the old junker strategy I had before?",finance,1375120478

personalfinance,"College grad employed just over a year now, age 23, advice on debt repayment/building up savings","I graduated college about a year ago with a little over $8k in student loans.  I was employed straight out of college making around $50k but literally no savings to speak of.  In fact, I had to borrow a few thousand from my parents, which I finished repaying to them in January.   

During this time I was also focused on eliminating my student debt as soon as possible, and was able to drop the debt amount to just under $6k.  The interest rate on the student loan is 3.4% and I am paid ahead by over a full year.

However, a few months ago I had to replace my car and now I have a car payment of $425/mo (for 48 months) that is sucking up those funds I was putting towards the student debt.  I feel like I am slacking by not putting anything more towards the loan.  

I know that $6k in student loans is pretty low, and to have paid off 1/4th of the debt in a year is great progress, but I just want to be able to say I have no student debt!  It is kind of a personal goal I made when I graduated and would make me feel so much better.

I could afford to put toward the loan still, but I was also trying to build my savings up.  I have read that 6 months of expenses is a good goal.  I currently have about 1.5 months of full expenses in my savings.  I am thinking my available funds will be going up soon though, as I no longer need to buy a bunch of household items/furniture/etc that I had to in my first year.

business,Bankrupted Detroit,"Riches to Rags

Once amongst the prime movers of the U.S. economy, Detroit, Michigan, is now broke. With a debts and liabilities load of over $18 billion, the July 18 bankruptcy application was the financially largest bankruptcy ever filed by a public entity in the U.S. The city has been in decline for over five decades and the application formally stamps a well established fact.

Retired city workers such as police officials, fire fighters, emergency responders, and municipal workers stand to lose the most through pension cuts and have taken on the city politicians in a legal battle. Bond holders are the number one creditors and expect preferential repayment treatment lest the city be abandoned by investors in future.

Although Kevyn Orr appointed by Michigan Governor Rick Synder in March this year as Detroit’s emergency manager promised to distribute the burden evenly, many believe a repeat of the 2011 Central Falls, Rhode Island, case where bond holders were preferentially treated while pensions were cut up to 55%.

Decline and Collapse

Detroit boomed with the upsurge of the automobile sector after World War I. This lasted till the early 1950s when Detroit was among the five largest U.S. cities. Slowly, auto industry migrated outside Detroit – suburbs, rural areas, other states, and even overseas – to bypass its powerful unions. Japanese auto imports hurt auto jobs in U.S.

These developments have to be seen in the overall context of the structural shift of U.S. economy from manufacturing to services. The city also failed to diversify into other sectors the way manufacturing towns such as Pittsburg and Cleveland did.

Racial strife intensified with falling economy. Many African Americans had migrated as workers during the boom and currently comprise 83% of its population of 700,000. Strife led to outmigration and now lesser number of workers contributed to retirement benefit funds. The global financial crisis further eroded returns from investment of these funds.

What added to the payload were pensions being paid to young retirees and the benefits being adjusted for inflation. Then again, pension fund officials have been accused of bribery to influence investment decisions.

Litigation

Pleading bankruptcy allows public entities to rewrite contracts with creditors viz. public employees and bond holders. Simultaneously, a breather in the form of a stay on payment of all liabilities allows public entities to analyze their finances and put together a financial reconstruction plan.

Unfair treatment, real or perceived, to one group of creditors often leads to lawsuits. Pension is deferred income and the Michigan Constitution says pensions are ‘a contractual obligation . . . which shall not be diminished or impaired’. Retirees have gone to the federal bankruptcy court citing this provision.

If the court overrules this provision on the ground of primacy of federal law over state legislation, two questions will appear. One, how will unions negotiate contracts for retirees in future? And, how can retirees such as police and firefighters in Michigan who do not contribute or receive from Social Security because their pensions are / were guaranteed, make ends meet?

Past and Future

Although the stigma associated with bankruptcy has been fast fading, attracting investment into such cities is difficult and makes reorganization tougher. This is precisely why bond holders, many of whom are sophisticated strategic investors, are accorded special treatment.

As the local government and retirees slug it out in court, the billion dollar question that emerges is: how much does Detroit owe to its former generation that helped build the city and how much should it allot for the future, the new generation in Detroit that cannot do without investment. Politics is often about tough choices, but it is also the art of the possible.",finance,1375109124

personalfinance,I'm a 19 Brazillian Student who is getting in some serious debts.,"So hi Personal Finance ! I just found out about this sub and I really appreciate if you guys could give me some advice.
So, I'm on my 2nd year of graduation (it's a 4 years bachelor in Computer Science). My dad is a Bank manager and I recently got a job. I'm on a internship program on a SQA sector of a big company. My dad covers all my expenses and send me 200 reais (about 90-100 dollars) per week to buy food and bus tickets to go to the unievrsity (I live outside it, a bit far). My internship pays me 600 reais (300 dollars) and It is a quite goos amount of money (I do my monthly shopping and spend only 300 reais, 150 dollars). But here's the deal now: My monthly income could be set at around 1.4k reais, about 700 dollars. Wich 150 dollars go to shopping and the rest is all mine to do whatever I want (just you guys have a comparrison tool, with the 1.2k that is left I could pay my rent and my cable tv, but my dad covers that so i have all to myself). And going on the heat of the moment, I made 2 credit card (thos easy ones to make, at a store or something) and I already had one, not to mention that, my dad send me the money to pay for my driving license test (we can only do it here at the age of 18, but last year I was kind of busy in college research and other stuff) the price of my driving license is 700 reais or 350 dollars and I spent all that money on other things, so I'm paying for my driving license in 5x of 170. My first credit card is ok, and I have 600 limit, but is all paid and fine. The problem is with the other 2: I'm on debt of 700 reais right now and my name is registered on some national credit agency. I managed to negotiate with the company so I would pay 100 reais and pay the rest of the credit card with 3x of 263. And the other credit card I would pay the 60 reais that I have to pay and wait for the next month bill.
So basically, what I want to tell you is, I'm in debt of around 350 reais for this month. I need to pay this month bill of the driving license ( with the interest rate it must be around 190 reais), I need to pay 1 of the portions of my credit card bill (100 reais) and 60 reais from the other credit card. 350 reais is my current debt. I have 390 credit on one credit card (the one that is paid with my salary, my salary is used to pay for this credit card) and 170 reais on my account right now. 
This needs to be solved this week, since my credit card debt and portion of driving license bill is 1 month late. :(
So after paying this debts I want to organize my finances and put everything on a sheet. 1.4k income - debts - some emergency fund deposit = what I can actually spend.
I would love some advice on what should I do. 

P.S. I really don't want to use all of the 390 limit that is left on my main credit card. So I guess I could do it like this: 170 on my bank account + 180 from my credit card limit to pay this debts. I really want to avoid asking for my dad's money since he doesn't even know about this other 2 credit cards and the diving license debt.

personalfinance,Critique my personal finance strategy,"I am 27 and am entirely debt free after paying off student loans.  I live with my wife, we rent and have no cars (live in nyc).  We make good money combined, well into the six figures.  I am going to explain our current financial planning approach, and would like feedback if anyone sees room for improvement.

**Existing Retirement Funding**

All of the money is in Vanguard Roth IRAs and Rollover IRAs.  We no longer invest directly to these accounts, because our income exceeds the IRA limits.  Invested as follows (I rebalance annually):

* 35% - Vanguard Total US Stock Market (VTSMX)
* 35% - Vanguard Small Cap Value (VISVX)
* 20% - Vanguard International (VGTSX)
* 10% - Vanguard REIT (VGSIX)

**Current Retirement Contributions**

Our companies offer 401k/403bs, without matching.  We currently contribute 12.5k/year each to our respective accounts.  They are invested to match the portfolio from above as closely as possible.  I realize this isn't maxed out, but in doing the math, I don't believe the maxes are warranted giving our time horizon (we've started young).  I may increase this later, but for now, I'm prioritizing growing non-retirement wealth.

**Non-Retirement Investing**

I am not seeking crazy-early retirement or anything, I just want to build wealth and allow it to give me freedom and flexibility in the future.  I like the idea of being wealthy enough to retire, more than the idea of actually doing it.  Though I do want to take genuine mini-retirements from time-to-time.  I will also likely need/want to purchase car(s) and a home at some point.  I am willing to take on more risk than most for non-retirements savings.  I am willing to roll the dice a bit and have a chance to grow wealth faster.

We make good money, but live a lifestyle in NYC that costs 5-6k per month.  We have stated analyzing our spending in mint and are looking for ways to reduce, but this will not come down much.  I realize this is higher spending than most of the country, but it is not negligent/frivolous.  We pay good money to have short commutes in a place we love to live; we pay for things we value.  We're still able to save 3-4k per month.

For emergency savings, we have 3 months of living expenses in Ally checking/savings.  I know many suggest longer, but 3 months seems right to me.  We have many other liquid investments, my wife and I both work (risk of both losing job simultaneously is low), and we both work in fields that enable us to find jobs very easily.

Other than the emergency savings, non-retirement savings is invested as follows:

* 40% - Vanguard Wellington (VWELX).  This is a balanced fund (stocks and bonds), that has outstanding performance over the long haul.  8.23% annualized since 1929 (not a typo, that's 1929).  When some more certainty comes out of the Fed regarding QE, I may shift this towards bond funds, to reduce volatility.
* 20% - Lending Club. I lean towards riskier loans, been doing it for over 2 years.  Currently over 9% annualized return.
* 20% - Trade King.  This is my fun account, I love trading stocks.  I usually hold 3-4 stocks at a time.  I re-evalute the stocks every couple weeks.  I grok that this is risky, but I love doing it.
* 20% - Betterment.  This is where I invest when I know I need x dollars at time y.  I am mainly using this to save for our first mini-retirement (~4 years away).  It invests in a mix of passive stock and bond ETFs that make sense for the time horizon.

personalfinance,Looking into purchasing a vehicle in the near future (1-3) years. What should I do to prep?,"So to begin, I currently drive a 2001 Ford Taurus...my first and only car I've owned. It has 225,000 miles on it (175k I put on it myself), so due to it's age and mileage the worry that my car is going to die soon is creeping into my head. I've had repair bills and they are beginning to cost as much as the car is currently worth ($600-$800). I understand that at the moment is better than a monthly car payment but I'm waiting for the time my car is unfixable. Hence this post.
  
Some background into my personal financial situation: 

* 25 with a Bachelor's degree applying to graduate school this fall.  
* No student loans to be paid.  
* Currently holding a job that pays $30k gross, but upon admission to graduate school will most likely drop it to $25k to $20k.  
* $4,000 in an IRA and $3,900 in a separate 403(b) when I leave my current job which I will be able to take with me or roll into my IRA.  
* Potential assistance with payments through relatives, but I do not want to depend on them to see if I can get the car that I want. 

The car that I'd like to have would be the *Honda Insight EX*. I don't need it to be new, while that would be nice, I'd be willing to settle for a used vehicle with low mileage (read: less than 75k miles). Research on various used car websites have yielded that, that range would be about *$15,000.*  My thinking is that I would like to own this car until the wheels fall off in 10-15 years. But I want a vehicle that will save me on gas mileage as city driving currently is costing me a lot of money to get to work.  
  
If possible, what should I start thinking about in preparation of getting this vehicle? I'd want to get as much down, but with a relocation coming up soon it's putting a strain on saving, but I am trying to save where I can. I would finance any vehicle through Navy Federal and not the dealer, but am I wrong in looking for this vehicle and should I set my sights lower? Am willing to answer any questions.

personalfinance,Do I choose full time or part time?,"Background: 29 y.o. female in Canada, in common law with 28 y.o. male, I recently got onto his job's benefits package, and we are thinking of buying a house in the near future, have already started looking and are pre-approved for a mortgage of $350k. Current joint debt: $70k student debt at prime+1%, credit card $1500 (will be paid off Thursday), and we both lease cars at a combined $560 a month. 

I graduated nursing college in August last year, got my license in November and walked right into a temporary full time position. Moved to another temporary full time position in the same hospital last month, but kept very good relations with my previous unit. I'm fitting well on my new unit and have gotten very positive feedback already from my new boss.

Here's the kicker. As a temporary full time employee, I get a 14% lieu of benefits package and 4% in lieu of vacation. My temporary full time contract is up Sept 16, and my boss already hired me for permanent part time starting right after. Full time means seven 12-hour shifts, part time means four or five 12-hour shifts in the same pay period, with the opportunity to pick up additional shifts including overtime pay, and my previous unit has said they would love to give me shifts when I am available as well, and also I can pick up extra shifts on other units of the hospital if they are short staffed, there are approximately 2-4 emails daily for needed shifts on other units. 

This week my boss approached me and said that the nurse who was going to take over the full time line (that I am currently in temporarily) has now decided to pursue other options, so the job is open and she wants me to apply for it. If I go for it, it's permanent full time, but with that comes a benefits package that is pretty much the same as the one I already receive from my boyfriend's plan, and vacation time instead of vacation pay, and a pension (which I found out I can opt into as a part time employee, which I am going to do tomorrow either way). 

This 14% lieu of benefits equals about $7000 extra, after tax, each year. Both positions are permanent, in that they are not contracts with firm end dates, and many of the nurses I have talked to prefer to work part time and collect the lieu benefits and vacation pay, and end up working full time hours or even overtime hours due to people taking time off or calling in sick. In our union, vacation pay starts at 4% and increases by 2% every few years until it reaches a max of 10%, so theoretically in however many years, I could be earning an additional 24% on top of my pay if I stay with the part time position in the same hospital. 

My partner and I are not planning on having children, we both are non-smokers and eat healthy and go to the gym frequently, and we feel that his coverage more than suits both of us. With the possibility of buying a house soon, the $7000 additional take home pay per year is very tempting. We have budgeted out our mortgage amount based on the minimum shifts I would be working as a part time employee, without any shift premium (an additional $1.20 per hour of evenings and another $1.20 per hour on weekends), just to be safe. 

But everyone I talk to about this says that full time is the only way to go. My mom wouldn't even hear the whole explanation but just kept saying ""full time full time full time"" and telling me that it's so great they want to keep me full time, why on earth wouldn't I want that? Several people have told me full time is the best option, especially some of the full time nurses too that I've talked with.

I want to go back to school part time in the future to pursue a higher level of nursing, and keeping my part time line would allow me to do that easier, too, I think. That, with the extra money, and the flexibility to go back to my old unit, or even cover shifts on other units in the same hospital, all make me think that keeping the part time position is really the way to go.  

I would like to see what you guys think of it. Am I crazy for wanting to keep a part time job when I could have a full time one?

personalfinance,Student loan payments start 8/1 -- I'd love some help creating a plan to attack my debt,"I will start by saying I am OK to make my first payments and such. I started my first post college job 2 months ago, which included a move to a decent sized city. My first order of business was paying off my credit card (which I only got 3 months ago) which was used to help me get this job (a new suit). I am doing my best to build my credit because in the next 5 or so years I would love to purchase a home. I am really just trying to figure out the best way for me to attack my student loan debt with my modest income.

My student loan debt almost reaches $50,000. $38,000 is through Great Lakes at these rates:
Subsidized	$8,296.61	3.4%
Subsidized	$564.70	5.6%
Subsidized	$1,705.62	6.0%
Unsubsidized $27,353.28   6.8%

$8,000 is through Sallie Mae at 6.8%. The remaining $3,000 is through my University at 5%. This number is much higher than I would like, but it doesn't ruin my days. My thought process is to attack the large loans through Great Lakes hardest first, does that seem right?

Here I will get into my expenses and income. My base salary is only $28k and some change. That said I am in sales and receive monthly bonuses. I was told that someone in their first year should expect to earn from $35,000-$45,000. I expect to be in the upper half of that range, as I've received a promotion to a good situation already. I budget everything to my base salary and expect to use the income above that to initially create a security fund, then go after my debt. 

Currently my expenses are at $1,500, but I'm trying to lower that thanks to /r/Frugal. I only use my credit card to earn cash back and pay it off completely each month even though it doesn't have an interest rate for the first year. I imagine you guys will suggest investing in my 401k and my company will match to a certain percentage (which I need to look into). I can start that on 9/1.

I'm hoping that by the time this thread is done, I know more about making informed bond purchases with clear understanding of expected yield/timeframe of fixed payments etc.

Note: I'm not asking if the hypothetical example below is a good bond to buy etc - its mostly just an example to understand the process/yields!


- On Fidelity, I can search/sort lots of bonds by their coupon-rate (annual/semi-annual etc), along with their final yield. Great - so I sort, pick the highest coupon-rate one -[ its 10%!!!!](https://fixedincome.fidelity.com/ftgw/fi/FIBondDetails?displayFormat=TABLE&amp;cusip=912810DS4&amp;ordersystem=TORD&amp;preferenceName=) What am I missing? This is really promising 10% for next 2 years? Sounds too good to be true. http://imgur.com/6xL9yzN

- Assuming the above is 10% for next 2 years, lets say I clicked buy buy buy. Put in offer to buy 10 bonds - why did the final price end up being $12k? Isn't each bond's value $1000? And more importantly, why does it say accrued interest is $487 (that isn't 10% of 12k!) http://imgur.com/X2i7Nvl

- About 3 minutes after placing a hypothetical order, Fidelity likely cancels my order since apparently the only type of trades you can make is ""Fill or Kill"" - how can I make sure that my bond purchase order will be honored? It seems like they don't allow ""good till cancelled"".

- In the above example, I simply did a broad search of bonds on fidelity and then sorted by coupon rate. Is there a better way?

- If instead of federal treasury bonds, I bought muni bonds from my own state (WA), it would mean no taxes on the interest/coupon earned? But if its a fed-bond, then there is taxes in the coupon-interest earned?

personalfinance,Advice on buying my dream car.,"So at some point in my life, I want to own an NSX, it's been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember. I'd appreciate your thoughts on what I should do. Apologies for the slightly long winded post.

Some background:

- I'm a software engineer, wife is in the middle of her md/phd. We currently have 0 debt and our joint income is 83k gross.  She will graduate with 0 debt as her program is fully paid for.  We are 27 years old.  We have two sedans,  perfect condition and paid off.

- We are planning on starting a family in the next 2 years. 

- We are not buying a house for at least 5 years, since my wife will have to move for residency in ~3 years or so. Once she starts working we should be able to save enough for a down payment in a couple years.

- We're currently saving a good 30% of our net income every month, after 401k contributions etc.  35% if you count 401ks

- An NSX  costs roughly 45k.

- fico score is 811


I have two options:

* Buy one now. This would involve putting a large chunk of our savings as a down payment and taking a loan from the rest. I can get great 1.74% rates via Penfed

    Pros: NSX sooner, NSX doesn't depreciate very much if at all, good rates these days.  Car loan may help with mortage rates down the line.  Could sell the for a 2-3k loss if we needed cash.

    Cons: debt, only 6 months expenses left in savings.

* Save up for another 3-4 years and buy one cash.

    Pros: No debt

    Cons: Market for the NSX i want (97-01 blue) may shrink, less chance of getting what I want? Prices might increase from today.

Hi all, I'm currently in Australian and intending to move to America, Texas in the next few months. Here is the situation.

BEFORE MOVE: I will have about $30k ready to go for the move. $20k comes from some heavy saving I have been doing (which was initially for a house deposit here but whatever now) and I expect I will get about $10k from my car. I don't really have any assets here other than my car. 

Debt I have about $20k from student loans, this is a government loan and in Australia I would pay it back with my tax. If I'm earning no income in Australia I technically can ignore it, but it does gain interest (about 2%) so I could ignore it but face coming back to it if I return to Australia. That is the only debt I have.


THE PLAN FOR MOVING:

**Getting into the country:** I actually have enough points off of my airline to get the flights over for free. $1500 approx will have to go toward visa fees to get into the country. I will also loose a good chuck in conversion fees bringing money over.

**Housing:** I will be moving in with my SO who moved over for a job. I will have to find work. I will be living off of them till I can pay my own way. They severely lack furniture, household stuff, bed and mattress, everything really. I was going to make sure I had some money to buy these things to help out (TV and gaming console will be a must while I have no job).

SO owns a house in Aus, currently with renters and splitting even on repayments, which is decently paid off and we have considered selling, paying off what is left on the mortgage in Australia, and buying two cheap properties where we will be living (SO will have close to enough to buy them outright in cash after selling, repaying and conversion, houses are expensive in Aus). That way we have another source of income and somewhere to stay - Good idea or not (probably a whole set of issues on its own)?

**Car:** I will need one to find a job in my line of work. I was going to buy one cash, looking at about $10k as I will most likely need a 4wd. Thinking toyota tacoma/4runner atm.

**Banking:** In Australia I have two accounts, one for savings which has a decent interest rate which rises based on how much I deposit into each month and one for buying stuff, shuffling money about, etc that has no interest but low fees. No credit cards or credit card debts. SO had issues coming into America as they had no credit history (problems getting a rental etc). I don't know how a big a problem this will be as well. My plan was to get a general purpose sort of one ( I have no idea what you call it there) and a credit card to start building credit. Buy things/pay bills with credit card and pay it off each month out of general purpose. 

Can someone recommend some reading to get me started with your systems? The different names make me unsure what to actually search. What banks are good value that I should begin looking into? Alternatively if we have plans to buy property outright, should I not care about credit ratings?

**Other:** Will need to set up a phone fairly quick for job seeking and want to have a fair amount put aside as a safety net assuming I don't get a job for a bit. 

Is there anything else I need to be thinking about here? My main concerns is getting a Texas phone number and address real quick to get on job applications.

**My Debt back home:** I had intended to try and pay off about half of this, so $10k before I leave. Coming back to Australia is not off the cards, so I don't want it to be huge when if I get back but I don't want to deal with it if I can avoid it...

So the plan comes down to this:

I have: $30,000

Pay off some debt (10k): $20,000 left

Conversion 10% loss: $18,000 left

Buy the car: $8000 left 

Furniture and other helping out SO costs: Maybe $2000-$3000

Leaves $5000 as a safety net till I have work.

Any and all advice welcome and thanks in advance! 

To summaries my main questions are (TL;DR): Where do I start looking to familiarize myself with your banking system (What should I plug into google)? Is it a good idea to be looking at bring a big chunk of money over to buy rather than rent? What should I be doing with my debt in Aus which I could theoretically ignore with no consequence?

investing,Stocks are About to Hit Some Troubled Waters,"Guess what?

Accommodative monetary policies won’t be around for much longer. Everyone knows it. The big question is…can Bernanke (or whoever happens to be holding the reigns) bring us down for a safe landing – without a debilitating sell-off?

If the records being shattered by the major indices feel hollow – it’s because they are. Recognize the underlying sparks that have driven equities to new heights. We aren’t experiencing a traditional growth market. At the end of the day, this is a stimulus-backed market with dramatic exposure to risk from stimulus reduction.

Yes. Taper mania isn’t going anywhere.

What’s more, the very act of tapering represents a return to what was considered “normal” just several years ago. Before we had any quantitative easing, market movements were based purely on economic fundamentals – on risk/reward. Sometimes those days seem so long ago…

Don’t misunderstand me, I’m not decrying the evils of an artificial market. The Fed did its job, and did it very well. I’m just being realistic. Even before QE comes to a halt, equities will begin the path to mean reversion. We will all have to find a way to cope.

As for this week? Event risk is fast approaching. But who knows, maybe the rains won’t fall as hard as some expect.

investing,Need some advice on where to put funds,"Hello guys.

I recently sold off about 20K in my companies stock i purchased over the years in a stock purchase program. I still have a significant amount of money left, but I wanted to diversify a bit, and my company's stock has apprciated nicely the past few years. 

So I have taken some money out and ran. But now I'm not sure where to put it. Stocks seem really volitile and may be close to peaking, and bonds seem a terrible place to go right now.

Anyone have any ideas? Right now I have the money parked in a money market fund so it gets SOMETHING, but I'm not sure of the direction to go.

Goals: Within 5-7 years we will either be building an extention on our house, or buying a new one. This money  will be used to help fund that.

(I was thinking either TIPS or muni's. But I'm very nervous of the bond market these days without clearer guidance from the fed)

I've always maintained a stock market account with a line of credit secured against it so that I could act quickly on property purchases.  For the past several years I've taken advantage of extremely attractive interest rates to finance my properties to their maximum LTV and invested that equity back into stocks.  I also keep a separate options account with a much smaller balance for more short-term or possibly speculative plays, but a very large part of my work for the last several years has been stock investing.

I consider myself a primarily long-term “value” investor but I will happily pursue a position in any stock I feel is under-priced so long as I understand the business and feel I have a better-than-average grasp of the companies near-term potential.

Finansmarkedene vedtatt et bredt forsiktig tone som en stor uke i form av sentralbanken møter og økonomiske data utgivelser som fikk i gang


Federal Reserve, den europeiske sentralbanken og Bank of England er planlagt å avsløre politiske beslutninger denne uken mens en tung tidsplan global makro data vil kulminere på fredag med juli i alle viktige amerikanske non-farm lønn rapporten


The markets will scrutinise the statement from the Fed’s Open Market Committee for any clues as to when the US central bank might begin scaling back, or “tapering”, its quantitative easing programme.


""I forhold til FOMC pressemeldingen, forventer vi at tweaks til setningen vil være svært beskjeden, hvis de skjer hele tatt,"" sier Sue Trinh, senior valuta strateg i RBC Capital Markets.


""Alt i juni setningen er fortsatt relevant i dag, og således ser vi bør svært få endringer på økonomisk/inflasjon Outlook. Vi forventer ikke endringer i QE delen av setningen, enten.""


I mellomtiden vil Kina også være i fokus senere denne uken da den offisielle produksjonen Kjøp lederes indeks for juli er utgitt.


Manufacturing PMI produsert av HSBC/Markit og lansert forrige uke kom en 11-måneders lav.


Kina bekymringer var også i bevis etter nyheter at Beijing hadde beordret en presserende revisjon av regjeringen låneopptak.


""Det har lenge vært bekymringer at trinnene Kina tok et par år siden for å motvirke effekten av den globale finanskrisen har forlatt den med en arv av gjeld, mye av det forkledd i skyggen banksektoren og de lokale myndighetene,"" sa Simon Smith, sjef økonom ved FxPro.

Take home pay $1590/month. Possible 20% of yearly salary bonus coming up in January. (performance based)

Expenses: 

* Rent: $0 (living with parents)
* Student loans total: $310/month
* Private: $20,000 @ 5.25%, $192/month
* School: $1,800 @ 5%, $40/month
* Government: $35,500 @ 5.90%, $77/month (yikes)

On IBR plan for government student loans. Interest does not capitalize while on it.

* Credit card: $600 @ 0%
* Auto: Paid off a reliable car (10 years old)
* Auto insurance: Full coverage at $52/month
* Gym membership: $35/month
* Emergency Savings: balance of $4,400 contributing $640/month
* Food/Groceries/Alcohol: $300/month
* Gas: $140/month
* Other: $100/month

Only considerable asset is my car which I could sell for $6000

Here is my thought. I would like to move out early next spring. Luckily I live in an area where I could share an adequate apartment for $300 a month plus utilities. I'm building an emergency fund up to around $9500, which I will be able to achieve in February if my math serves me right.

I've considered paying everything I had extra right into my student loans (which scare the shit out of me at that balance). However I think it is more risky not to have an adequate emergency fund now than to start paying more on loans right away. The interest rate is pretty good I believe as well, let me know if not.

I've thought of putting the bonus I get at the end of the year directly to the student loans. Even though it would hurt to see it leave. I would really love to start contributing to a Roth IRA and separate stock market account but I do not have much left over for those contributions.

That $35,000 government loan scares me. Interest rate is alright. On the Income Based Repayment plan for the balance. Since paying $77 a month doesn't cover interest, interest is racking up. **Government covers interest on subsidized loans. Most of the balance is unsubsidized though. Interest is not capitalized on any of the loans while on IBR if I understand right.** Since I'm in the early stages of paying the student loans I'm still not sure what the best action is to take, or how beneficial interest not being capitalized is. 

I think I have covered everything. Let me know if I can improve anything as I know how beneficial it is to start out right.",finance,1375145429

financialindependence,When to pay off your mortgage (my plan),"I plan to pay mine off the year I declare FI.

Why?

I propose that the vast majority of us will ""make"" 18-20% returns for the remaining lifetime of our mortgage if we pay it off when we reach FI. More if you take on a side business.

Say you need 60k a year to live on if you're paying your mortgage. If you have a 15k/year mortgage and you pay it off, you will only need 45k/year to live on. 

Assuming you live off of cap gains in the us, each additional dollar past 45k up to 60k that you need to live on (to pay your mortgage in this case) would cost you 15 cents. Add to that the interest rate of hopefully 3-5% (or lower!) that you're paying, and it suddenly becomes a good investment to pay off your mortgage. You save 2250 a year in taxes by paying early.


Why not do this before FI? Because you're probably not going to change the amount you earn from earned income based on the amount you need. So you will earn 100k and get taxed 20k (ish) whether or not you actually need it to live off of, and there's no benefit other than interest to paying off your house early.

Thoughts?

*edit - this may be less since you're only saving 15% on the principle. Maybe closer to 8-10% overall, but still beating out a lot of other investments. Or maybe it's more if you base it on just the principle? This was much simpler an hour ago.

I purchased a modest home in 2011 which sucks most of my salary and have minimal equity as its only been a year and a half living here.

economy,The Elephant in the Room,"In my opinion, the key reason for the US economic problems is a tax loophole, or if you are a Libertarian, unfair taxing. It is the biggest one of it's kind but no one wants to talk about it.

Say you are a retailer and you buy products from different countries.

One country taxes it's products and the other country does not, you would of course, buy from the cheaper tax free country.

Now, let's replace these two countries with the US and China.

Workers in the US pay US income tax. Products made in the US support the US government. Products made in the US have an included tax.

Chinese workers in China not pay US income tax. Products made in China do not support the US government.

This manufacturing in China destroys jobs in the US. 

This causes less US tax revenue and less income for workers. 

A couple of solutions would be, to **tax imports** to regain the tax lost from the ""Free Trade"" Loophole **or** stop the US **income** tax.

If Federal tax was placed on the **sale** of a product (instead of **income**) then it would matter where the product was made; a product from China would have the same tax revenue as a product from the US.

Before you start saying that taxing imports is Protectionism, and protectionism didn't work, we tried it, remember that when the US last tried Protectionism the US was a major **exporter**. This is when you don't need it.

I see nothing wrong with free trade as long as each market can equally pay-it's-way tax wise. What the US has now doesn't do that.

TLDR: The US needs tax equality to bring jobs back home.

Edit: The US tax system is not compatible with Free Trade.

This is a total of: ~$4,907 in credit card debt and $14,600 in student loans for a total of ~$19,507 in debt between me and my fiance who are getting married in November.  

I've read a lot of posts here, and I'll just be upfront, I was dumb and stupid and so was she but we've changed and want to get out of debt.  We both just graduated from college and through our minimum wage jobs in college we’ve paid off about $3k of debt in the past year (Visa #5 was maxed out and Visa #4 was around $2000) We just graduated, we both have full time jobs, and we’re trying to plan out the best course of action for paying this debt off.  

Basically my question is that I know about snowballing and how that method works, but I’ve read differing opinions on it through that some people do the lowest payments first and then work from there, and other people pay the debts with the highest interest rates off first and then go from there.  Could anyone here in PF provide me with a compelling reason to do one over the other?  We don’t have to start paying the student loans until November, so what’s our best policy for that?  Should we transfer all of the credit debt to the Visa #4/5 and try to pay it down as much as possible before November?  

I make about $2100 a month after taxes, she makes about $1660 a month after taxes for a total of $3,760 a month.  We pay $1340 a month in rent (we’re living separately until marriage, moving in together before November isn’t an option, but once we do move in together in November this will be cut in half) plus $30 for internet, ~$40 for water, ~$100 for electric.  I pay $51 a month in car insurance and $45 a month for my cell phone, thankfully her parents are still paying her cell phone and car insurance, idk how much longer that will last though.  That’s a total of ~$1600 dollars in bills (which will be closer to $1000 after November) but that doesn’t include any living expense (gas, food, etc.).  

That’s my situation, I’ve read lots of things on the internet.  I realize that honestly $20k in debt isn’t a whole lot, it just seems like a lot because it’s spread over 8 or 9 different payments, or will be anyway.  I’m just looking for some advice.  We’re trying to get out from underneath our pile of stupidity as fast as we can so it doesn’t put a burden on our life just starting out.  

Oh – we’re also paying for our own wedding, but we would both rather get out of debt faster than spend much at all on a wedding.

I’ve been as open as I can be about my debt/income/bills, so if anyone would like to take the time out of their day to help me out a bit and formulate a plan, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Let me know if you have any other questions, do not let me know if you think I’m dumb, I know I was, but things are changing.

personalfinance,Transferring money from a US account to Canada,"I am a Canadian citizen who went to school in Canada and took out a student loan. Now that loan is entering repayment.

However, the wrinkle is that when I left school, I was recruited to a job in the US and I now get paid in USD into a US account. 

Does anyone know of a way that I can either pay bills or transfer money from my US account (Maine Savings Federal Credit Union or Camden National Bank) into a Canadian one (Royal Bank of Canada)? It seems impossible. The only options that have been suggested to me are writing and physically mailing cheques (each month or post-dated) or money orders to the Student Loan center. Online transfers and/or automatic payments are possible through a Canadian bank.

My ideal solutions would be either: 

1. A way to electronically transfer money from a US savings or chequing account into a Canadian savings or chequing account (and set up automatic withdrawals for bills)

2. A way to pay my loan ""bills"" online, similar to online shopping with a debit (or credit) card.

Unless you have any specific suggestions, bank drafts are not the answer as my bank(s) apparently would want to charge me a service fee of $60/transfer.

personalfinance,Looking for advice: should I take out a loan from a bank or borrow from family?,"**Thank you** for taking the time to read this post and for any advice you might have for me! I really appreciate any advice you might have to offer.

**The Background**
I am a graduate student in the San Francisco Bay Area, near the heart of the Silicon Valley (the mascot is a color if you are curious). I'm in a PhD program that pays for my tuition, health care, and pays me a fellowship for my first, fourth, and fifth years, and pays me for TAing in my second and third years. This fall will be the start of my second year. I do not get my first paycheck until October 7 and I need to move into an apartment in September. I have found a place I really like and want to take the next steps in securing the place, but will need additional money to cover my deposit until I get paid.

**The Situation** On campus housing has no room available for me for the upcoming academic year and I have been working diligently to find a place to live in the area. I have found a bedroom in an apartment with an attached bathroom for $1100/month, which is within my price range. I currently have enough in my savings to pay for one month's rent, but not enough to cover the deposit, which is another month's rent. My grandparents are willing to lend me $1100 to cover the deposit which I would be able to pay back over the academic year. I could also borrow about $500 from my parents to cover living expenses, which I would also be able to pay back over the course of the academic year.

I am considering taking out a loan from my credit union instead of borrowing from my family members. The loan I am considering would be around $3000. This would help cover the deposit and living expenses, especially the new move-in costs, and I could pay it off over the course of year with no penalty for paying it off early. I have previously had a car loan from the same credit union, was approved to pay it off in three years, but finished paying in half of the time, which obviously saved a lot in interest charges. 

**I have two options right now as I see it.** I can borrow $1600 total from my family members to cover the deposit for the apartment and for any costs I might incur that would need to be paid ASAP. I could put additional charges (groceries, gas, a bed, etc.) on my credit card and pay that off as the academic year progresses and I have a steady income. I currently have no outstanding balance on my credit cards, which total $4000 of available credit. **OR** I can take a loan from the bank, have money on hand, and pay off the loan over the course of the next year, including interest that will be about the same as the interest rate on my credit card. 

I am leaning toward taking a loan so that I don't have to burden my family and so that I will have cash on hand in case something requires it. I should be financially secure (savings, loan paid off) within nine months to a year. Having the extra cushion the loan provides would be nice, and I would not have to burden my family (though I know they wouldn't offer if they couldn't afford to help). I have borrowed money from my parents in the past to cover academic expenses (about $1000) and paid them back within a few months. My family trusts me to be financially responsible, and I'm not worried that they would treat me any differently if I borrowed money from them.

**TL;DR** Borrow $1600 from family or $3000 from bank to cover living expenses? Would pay back either within a year.",finance,1375297371

I know, I know. If they had done 30 minutes of research they would have known this was not possible.

After refinancing with Sallie Mae, their (my parents) payments are about $1005 at a fixed rate of 9.0% for 30 years, while the payments on my Federal Student Loans are about $256 at 6.9% for 25 years.

I currently take home about $1900 a month and am living at home. My car and its insurance along with room and board are being taken care of by my parents, although I plan on changing this because I fear if I refuse to make payments on the Parent Plus loans, they will threaten to take away the car so I can't go to work (they have done this before).

I know it sounds like I should be grateful for my parents being so generous, but I feel like dedicating half my income to one debt is foolish.

I'm extremely stressed out, while I plan on making more money as time passes, I feel like making these payments on my own is financially crippling me.

Should I bail on the loans if my parents refuse to help? Is bankruptcy a viable option for them? I don't think they could make the payments without my help.

My car is paid off. We both now have full-time jobs and are currently bringing in $1,500-$2,000 more per month than we are spending on rent/various bills/living expenses.

We are also looking (fairly long-term) at saving for a down payment on a house, as renting is not very cost-effective in the city where we live.

As an aside, we have about $7,000 in savings as of right now, and are probably going to try to hit the 8-9k mark before we focus all our extra money on paying off our debt.

personalfinance,I'm trying to build an emergency fund and pay student loan debt. I would appreciate any pointers!,"Hi, everyone!

For the last two years, I have been building an emergency fund in a savings account at ING Direct to help offset the risk of losing my job for a little while. I currently have roughly $11.5K saved up and contribute $800/month to it. (It was previously $400/month.) The account has a 0.75% APY interest rate, and my original goal was to save $32K in it, which would cover me for six months.

(FWIW, I have a 401K and currently contribute 7%, or $330/biweekly, from my paycheck into it biweekly.)

In addition, I am trying to overpay undergrad student loan debt (roughly $168K) in hopes of getting rid of it sooner. My principals and interest rates are all over the place (see the end of this post). I currently pay ~$1.2K/month towards Group 2, ~$1.03K/month towards Group 1 and ~$200/month towards Group 3 (since this group is government-subsidised loans and I care much more about getting the bigger ones gone first). 

Finally, I gave myself $1000/month to spend.

I am thinking of re-allocating my emergency fund contributions to my Group 2 loans, which would increase my per-month payments to $2K/month. I'm also reducing my leftover spending to $680/month ($340/biweekly) then to $500/month ($250/biweekly) if the former drop works well, putting the savings into my Group 2 loans. 

I'm 25. My overall goal is to rid myself of these loans as soon as possible so I can:

* Stop renting and get myself a home by my early 30's,
* Start investing outside of my 401K, and
* Work towards getting to a point where I can have more freedom over where and how I work, which would essentially mean planning for an early retirement.

Is this a good idea?

I'm in school until the end of summer in 2014. Should I go ahead and pay it off monthly? If so, how much? The loans will increase by roughly $4000 per semester so that'll be about $12,000 to go so I will be owing $22,000 overall.

I assume I'll need to pay off the accrued interest amount immediately then work on the $375 next? 

I take home $2100 per month. I'm thinking of paying $200 per month toward loans and adding whatever is left toward my savings after everything is accounted for. I have been putting 20 percent of each paycheck toward my savings ($210 per check). I don't want to wait until I'm graduated and then being rushed into starting the payments. I don't have any debt besides this one. No credit card or auto loans.",finance,1375270000

I've heard of people spouting off about abuse and corruption in the government, but I've never really seen evidence as convincing as this. ""Protecting personal information"".

personalfinance,College Loan! Questions! (US),"So, due to reasons I cannot state, I am unable to get any federal loans, and I am relying totally on private loans. I am going to a community college, tuition is just under 5k a year. My first semester I will be a full time student, for about 2.5k. I have a 1k scholarship, so first semester will be about 1.5k, which my parents will give me a loan for, and I will easily be able to pay off. Second semester, I may only be part time, so my tuition will be cheaper, I should be able to pay for this by the time first semester is over. Second year I will probably need some loans for, as I'm joining a nursing program for 2 years, total cost of about 20k. I plan on paying very much above the minimum while in school, to avoid interest as much as possible. I was looking around and found out that discover student loans will not loan to my community college. A quick browse around I found that Wells Fargo will give a loan, as well as a few other banks. 

Anyway, now that I've blabbed for long enough, my question is what should I be looking out for in a private student loans. Obviously the lower interest rates, but I don't know what else to look for. Also, what are your bad experiences with certain lenders, and has anybody had exceptional experiences with certain lenders?

Thank you all so very much! I'll reply the best I can!",finance,1375241210
