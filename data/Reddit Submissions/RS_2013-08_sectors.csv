personalfinance,Selling Home - Should I Finance The Buyer?,"I live in South Carolina and currently own a single-wide mobile home in a nice mobile home park. I've had it on the market since late January and it is currently listed at $26,400. My realtor sent me an email today asking if I'd be interested in financing; if so, he knows someone who can put $5000 down and pay $1000 per month plus HOA fees. The interest rate is negotiable.

Looking at the math, with a 5% annual interest rate, accrued monthly, the deed would be the buyer's after 25 months, netting me about $29k.

On top of this $1000 per month + HOA fees, I make a pretty good living in a marketing career (hence why I want to get out of the mobile home and get a nicer house). So I'm thinking I can put a little bit down on another house, pay the mortgage and PMI with the $1000/mo for the first two years, refinance after the mobile home deed is released to the new buyer, and get rid of the PMI, provided I am above the 20% appraisal value of the new house.

One of my concerns is the simple risk involved here. I don't know the buyer's credit, but how could they possibly afford $5k down and $1k/mo plus HOA (and I'm assuming insurance, taxes, electricity, water, etc.) yet not be able to get a mortgage for a different house? Then again, even if we go through 12 months, and they flop I will earn $16,000 on the house. This would allow me to reduce the price on selling the house again, subsidizing any losses with the $16,000 already earned.

Obviously, I'd have to look at the legal side of everything here to protect me from liability and so forth, but strictly from a financial and risk side, what do you guys think? Any advice would be incredibly helpful.",finance,1375397954

personalfinance,Advice on Home Buying and Interest Rates,"Hello PF!

I'm looking to buy a home between now and April of next year.  We spoke with the mortgage adviser yesterday and were told we qualify for the loan we want at 4.125% interest (my credit score is dragging us down at around ~620).  The lender gave me the advice to pay some outstanding things on my credit report off (total of like $600 of things accumulated over the past 8 years or so) and give it 2 to 3 months which would bring my allow me to lock in a lower interest rate of 3.75%

I have spoken with Realtors who have given me the advice to buy sooner rather than later due to the housing market here being prime for buyers and interest rates being low which is why I have accelerated my buying timeline.

The mortgage will be 30 year term and I plan to round my payment up ~$100 and then pay half of that every 2 weeks and pay a $2,000/yr lump sum with tax returns every year.  All of this means I would pay for roughly 23 years instead of 30 according to the lenders spreadsheet.  Down payment/closing costs are taken care of and are a non-issue.

My question is this:

My credit has to reach 661 or higher in order to drop the interest rate to 3.75% will paying off these debts and waiting that small amount of time bring my score up 40 points?  And what are the chances that interest rates could inflate slightly within the next 3 months and offset my efforts and just simply delay my purchase date?

As additional information - in an effort to improve my credit in general I'm paying off these debts anyway as they are a drop in the bucket and were the results of youthful ignorance.  As annoying as it is dealing with creditors for old, old, old accounts this is the best thing for me to do so I'm doing it regardless of whether I'm buying next month or 3 months from now.

Any advice is appreciated and please ask if I need to provide additional information!

EDIT:  The loan is a 30 year fixed USDA loan at 4.125%  - We are pre-qualified and are trying to determine if we should seek pre-approval now or wait until a later date.",finance,1375370084

Hi, everyone!

Earlier today, I created [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1jf8hi/im_trying_to_build_an_emergency_fund_and_pay/) post regarding the reallocation of my 401K into my student loans. Today, I created a spreadsheet that illustrated what my payoff schedules and amounts would look like. 

For some reason, I can't get this post submitted with a link to the spreadsheet, but this is what I've calculated:

* **Loan 1**: ~$20,200 @ 13.25% (nominal interest rate of 1.1%) interest will be paid off by **4/30/2014** if I pay it down by $2500/mo.

* **Loan 2**: ~$18165 @ 11% (nominal: 0.9%) will be paid off by **12/31/2014** if I pay it down by $2605.52/month after paying off Loan 1.

* **Loan 3**: ~$18164.45 @ 9.75% (nominal: 0.8%) will be paid of by **8/31/2015** if I pay it down by $2700.26/month after paying off Loan 2. 

* **Loan 4**: ~$18164.45 @ 9.75% (nominal: 0.8%) will be paid of by **4/30/2016** if I pay it down by $2795/month after paying off Loan 3. 

* **Loan 5**: ~$53949.53 @ 6.7% (nominal: 0.6%) will be paid of by **11/30/2017** if I pay it down by $3330.78/month after paying off Loan 4. 

* **Loan 6**: ~$29082.09 @ 6.45% (nominal: 0.5%) will be paid of by **5/3/2018** if I pay it down by $3792.16/month after paying off Loan 5. 

These calculations do not account for bonuses, tax returns or any other additional payments (which I will make when the opportunities come in).

personalfinance,Need advice on paying student loans off and improving credit,"Hi everyone,
I had about $20k in student loans over the years, I believe. Most of it has been taken care of. I have just under $2,500 left to pay off. I am paying 6.8% interest (not sure what all of the ruckus is about with raising the interest rate to 6.8%. I've never known anyone who had a 3.4% student loan...but I digress). 

They are two loans.One has close to $2k and the other has under $600. Would it help out my credit to drag out the payments? I've been paying far ahead of schedule because I've been able to. But I'd like to improve my credit and am wondering if these loans can help me any.

Instead of just paying off the small one, I've been balancing them to make payments on both. If I am making payments more often than necessary, will they be calculated to add to my timely payments portion of my credit? Or are timely payments determined only from the payments that they demand? 

**Edit to clarify my question: My question is what would the benefit be, and how does the frequency of payment affect the ""timely payments made"" calculation of my credit? If you had a minimum payment due every 3 months, and instead, you made a payment every day for the 3 months that nothing was due, would you have 90 timely payments calculated? or would it just be one (because they were only demanding one payment in those 3 months)?**",finance,1375338140
Bitcoin,Bitcoin is going to fork eventually.,"To be clear, I don't think a fork in Bitcoin would necessarily be a bad thing. In fact, I think it might actually be a net positive.

The writing is on the walls. Just about every post in this subreddit is fervently divided amongst the statists and the anarchists. There simply CANNOT be this much opposition and continue to be one coin for everybody.

It's only a matter of time before something happens. Maybe there is a government ultimatum to turn Bitcoin into Fedcoin. Or maybe simply the devs reach a point where they disagree on a key feature. 

It seems to me eventually the Bitcoin community will have a choice: Tow the line to be in compliance with the Feds, or stay true to the goal of anonymity and disruption.

There will be vehement arguments for both sides. The Fedcoin people will claim that Bitcoin will never reach anywhere near ubiquity without compliance. The anarchists will say they'd rather have a pure and possibly obscure coin than a Fed compliant coin. And then there will be a fork in the road.

It's going to happen. I can see it. And I'm not sure it's anything to be afraid of. I know what side I'll be on. In fact, it might be the only way to really ""settle"" the dispute. If one of the forks ends up taking a nose dive then that action will speak much louder than all the words being argued in debate now. Of course, they could both co-exist quite well together, too, which would be interesting in itself.

news,Big Oil Under the Gun on the Gulf Coast!,"Thursday, August 1st, 2013
New Orleans, Louisiana

WILL BIG OIL FINALLY PAY THE PIPER ?

A lawsuit against Big Oil for environmental damage?  Are you kidding me?  Who could possibly have thunk it?  Why it’s almost blasphemous to challenge the oil industry in a state where oil revenue has been the mother’s milk for both campaign contributions and government spending for longer than anyone cares to remember.  Oh, sure, oil companies big and small have rarely received as much as a slap on the wrist for the extensive environmental damage that has been a significant factor down in Louisiana losing almost 2000 square miles of coastal land since the 1930s.  But now, it may be time to pay the piper for all those years of neglect.

Certainly, one cannot blame the massive land loss and environmental damage solely on the oil industry.  But over the past 70 years, by cutting through thousands of miles of Louisiana wetlands to reach valuable oil drilling locations, and then by digging pipeline canals, vast wetlands destruction took place.  In Louisiana, officials in charge of protecting these invaluable coastal wetlands have, in most cases, let the private sector off the hook and turned to government funding, both state and federal, in a weak attempt to reverse the damage. The state’s slogan cold well be, “quick to complain, but reluctant to aim at those who are responsible.”

But that attitude changed a bit in the past few days.  Under Louisiana law, the governor appoints a number of levee boards that are charged with the responsibility of protecting landowners from flooding up and down the Mississippi River, as well as throughout the wetlands.  And being appointed by the governor, they generally adhere to his biding.   A south Louisiana levee board, which is charged with protecting areas surrounding greater New Orleans, took the bold step of filing a multi-$billion lawsuit against 97 oil companies, operating throughout the state including BP, Mobile, and Exxon.

The lawsuit, filed by the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East, alleges, that “the oil network functions as a mercilessly efficient, continuously expanding system of ecological destruction -- killing vegetation, eroding soil and allowing salt water into fresh water areas.”  The filing further charged:  “What remains of these coastal lands is so seriously diseased that if nothing else is done, it will slip into the Gulf of Mexico by the end of this century, if not sooner.”

So how is Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who appointed the various board members and who has received strong financial support from the oil industry, reacting?  “Livid” and “how dare they” would be cautious words.  He accused trial lawyers of “high jacking” the levee board, influencing them to file suit, called such legal action outrageous, and demanded the law suit be dismissed and the lawyers fired.  But levee board members say that this is a question of being responsible, and that they don’t plan to back down.  As board member and noted author (“Rising Tide”) John Berry says: “Like Pottery Barn, we just want them to fix what they broke.”
Oil has been the backbone of the south Louisiana economy for many years.   Louisiana was seduced by an outside industry full of vast economic promises. The money came in easily and there can be no dispute that many new jobs were created.  But there is a cost to the spoils of oil production, and this new lawsuit claims that this untold cost has not been nearly repaid. 

Public officials have been too often lured by the financial temptations. A number of Louisiana politicians, including Gov. Huey Long in the 1930s and Plaquemines Parish dictator Leander Perez in the 1950s, made off like bandits by creating family controlled corporations, and awarding themselves public oil leases that made them hundreds of millions of dollars.  Oil company campaign cash has flowed into state and local political campaigns for decades.

Perez was particularly aloof from the public interest when he used his political clout to blackmail then Governor Earl Long back in the late 1940s to reject a federal-state split of off shore oil.  President Truman forged a compromise on the federal –state land dispute by offering Louisiana two thirds of all off shore oil out to a three mile boundary, then one third of all production from that point on out into the Gulf. Perez opposed the deal as his “vested interest” made him greedy, and Louisiana ended up receiving not one penny after a protracted battle all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. The failure to take this settlement has cost Louisiana, by several studies, more than $500 billion (that’s billon with a “B”) in lost revenue.

Remember the 1953 movie Thunder Bay?   Jimmy Stewart plays an oil wildcatter who discovers oil in the Gulf.  When the locals rise up in arms, Stewart makes no bones about what they face.  “There’s oil under this Gulf.  We need it.  Everybody needs it.  Without oil, this country of ours would stop and start to die.  And you would die.  You die,” he tells the crowd.  “You can’t stop progress.  Nobody can.”
Stewart might have been right, but history tells us time and again that with resources and power there is responsibility.  Did Louisiana accept the riches of the land, but fail to demand that those who set the rules, those who govern, be good stewards of these bountiful resources?  Or did the state just stand by, pocket the money, and demand little in protection and environmental accountability?
Will the lawsuit prevail?  Probably not.  It will be hard to overcome the objections of Jindal who is so vehemently opposed to any legal effort that would hold the oil industry accountable.  In years past, the Bayou State made a deal with the Devil.  It would seem to be a good faith effort by the levee board to see that there is payback time.  But their task is daunting.
The fault really belongs at the feet of public officials, who for years failed to enforce the state’s environmental laws.  “O! I have ta’en too little care of this,” said Shakespeare’s King Lear. These words can easily be the epitaph of those in charge -- those politicians who made a bad environmental bet on the Bayou.

I understand the importance of having a high interest rate for savings accounts, and the importance of having an actively growing 401K, but what I don't understand is why it's important to have a high interest rate for a checking account. Why would you hold onto money in your checking that would grow faster in a savings account (or some other kind of account?)?

personalfinance,I'm thinking about credit counseling. Can anyone tell me if I'm missing anything?,"I'm doing this as a throwaway to separate this from my regular account.

I've had issues with credit for a few years.  Me and my fiancee over the years have accumulated a lot of our debt in my name because, historically, my credit score was significantly better than hers.  However, we've been stuck on a credit treadmill and this next year our income is going to decrease.  It'll be fine 3-4 years from now but things are tough at the moment.

Here's how things look:

Cashflow and expenses, me:  I: $21,000; E: $25,000

Cashflow and expenses, fiancee: I: $25,000; E: $20,000

Cashflow and expenses, combined: I: $46,000; E: $45,000

Total CC debt: ~$18,000 (we consider it our debt, though it's all in my name)

no emergency fund

Important notes: We consider our finances shared, but the fact we live 1,200 miles apart forces us to manage them separately.  We're both named on both accounts, so when we need to shift money I just write a check from the account she primarily uses to the one I primarily use.  Also, this is a necessities fund.  This doesn't include any entertainment (etc) aside from internet.

I've worked out a plan with Mint to pay off my credit card debt.  According to Mint's plan, I'll be out of debt in just under 3 years by paying off $700/month.  This is calculated into my expenses figure above.  I can't reduce that by much without getting onto the credit treadmill.

I have no objection to this plan, but the problem is that if I have any emergencies, I'll/we'll be up shit creek due to the lack of wiggle room in our finances.  We'll also be in trouble if her car (paid off) finally dies and we need to replace it.  The thing is that our cashflow is well more than what we need to survive.  But the fact that we're paying $8,200/year to settle the credit cards is killer.

What I'm considering doing at this point is going to a credit counseling agency.  I looked over a number of agencies and spoke to a few.  I know which one I would use if I decide to go that route.  Here are the details.  I know that /r/PF knows how this works, but I'd like to go through it so that anyone can tell me if I haven't understood something.

I'll agree to let the company represent me and go to arbitration with my creditors to negotiate that I'm faced with hardship and can't afford to pay off my debt.  They'll negotiate a more manageable amount and once that's done, I'll make monthly payments to a debt management plan.  A portion will cover their fee and the rest will be go toward settling my CC debt.

**What I'm worried about**

* Company is a scam (I've heard horror stories).

* I won't actually reduce the amount I'm paying by a significant amount.

* I'll destroy my creditworthiness.

The company seems to be legit.  I received the following in a follow-up e-mail after speaking to a rep:

&gt;I would like to urge you to research us, we are fully compliant with the federal trade commission, a member of the BBB (better business bureau), The US chamber of commerce, TASC (the association of settlement companies), and the AFCC (American fair credit counsel). If you look up our reviews they are outstanding and we are usually number one and two in the country. More importantly all of our debt specialists are licensed with the IAPDA (international association of professional debt arbitrators). The parameters of this program have been approved by the FTC to help consumers in hardship in debt relief so they don't have to go through the complete extreme of bankruptcy. We are fully compliant with your states attorney general. 

I checked and found out that their BBB rating is an A-.  Also, I won't owe them anything until they reach an agreement with my creditors, which reassures me that what they aren't a scam.  They'll also guarantee in writing that their fee will be less than 50% of the amount my debt is reduced by, so I won't be paying the same amount in the end due to fees.  The last issue is what this will do to my credit rating, but I'm less worried about this.  My rating already sucks (around 600), I'm at 95%ish utilization because my limits are dropped every few months as I reduce my balance, and I have no need to buy a house or car for at least five years.  Also, we're not touching my fiancee's credit.  If there's ever an emergency need for credit (eg, a car), we'll have her's.  She has absolutely no debt except for student loans and is in the 700s.

I asked the counselor I spoke to to ballpark what he things my debt management plan would look like.  He estimated it would be something like this:

Amount owed, including their fees: $12,000; Monthly payment: $450; Out of debt in ~2 years


Here's my plan with Mint:

Amount owed: $18,000; Monthly payment: $700; Out of debt in ~ 3 years

[If the Mint plan seems off, realize that I have exorbitant interest rates.]

So here's my question.  Let's assume for a moment that the company I'm talking to is legit, that I'm ok with the effects this will have on my credit profile, and in the end this significantly reduces both the amount I'll pay in total, the amount I pay per month, and the time it'll take to pay off my debt fully.  Is there any other reason not to do this?  And what are the chances that one of those suppositions I've made is incorrect?

One last note.  I know that I haven't posted the specifics of my finances aside from how much I pay per month in credit card payments.  I assure you that I've reduced CoL as much as I reasonably can, and whenever I've asked about this in the past, no one answers my questions about credit counseling (aside from one or two notes comments that it's a universally bad idea) and try to make fixes in other parts of my budget instead.  I'm posting this way because I really, really, really want more information about this in particular so I can decide what course of action is best for me.

I'm at a bit of a crossroads here. My wife and I basically stole our house in 2008, and will be putting it on the market soon to buy our 'forever' home. Part of the game plan is to cash out the sweat equity we put into the house, and use that as part of our downpayment.

I'm looking into all options, though, and so I turn to you to find out if my 'other options' are in fact stupid ideas.

With interest rates so low, it feels like it makes an awful lot of sense to invest that 50k in dividend-paying funds. Some of the funds I've researched are consistently yielding between 7 to 12 (!) percent. 

What I have to figure out is whether this route *increases* my monthly cash flow more than a big downpayment would *decrease* my monthly debt payments. In other words, do I get more mileage out of this money by investing it rather than dumping it onto principal.

Am I way off track and should stop this mode of thought right now, or is this something people actually do?

Some personal information: 25 years old, living alone in a 1br (Rent $725 until February). I work two jobs, ~55 hours per week. Gross income is $37k from job 1, $5k from job 2. Job 2's income goes into investments, so let's just consider my primary job to be my only source of active income.

All figures are from the 9-month period November 2012 - July 2013. You can assume these numbers to be accurate and comprehensive; the only exceptions would be if I paid for something up front and was paid back in cash later, such as for baseball tickets.

Some thoughts and comments:

- I live in a state that has incredibly high auto insurance, and am on a family plan to try and mitigate the cost as much as possible.

- Auto includes $180 for a parking ticket &amp; driving on my cell phone. I spend about $150/month on gasoline.

- Food bill is way too high, and I've cut it considerably in the last two months. The average was over $275 in May.

- About $1000 of Shopping was on a new computer in June, so that $160 average is misleading.

- This is mostly forward-looking, since I can cut in some places (food, bills), only to have them raise in places beyond my control (rent, bills). One thing I worry about is my health insurance, which, thanks to ACA, I don't have to personally obtain until next January after I turn 26. The plan at my job for 2013 currently costs $1350/1800/2500 annually, including vision and dental. I expect those numbers to increase substantially for 2014, and I expect my annual raise and bonus to cover at least the HDHP or intermediate plans.

So, I'm a graduate student beginning my first semester at the end of this month and this is the first loan I've had to take out. I took out the max amount allowed for a Direct Federal unsubsizied loan, which is $20,500 with an interest rate of 6.8%. To my understanding, I begin accruing interest within 3-6 months of the beginning of the semester. Here is where I get a little confused...6.8% of the loan is a little over $1300 and apparently I get charged that amount in interest every month.  Is that not a little high? 

I've been talking to my boyfriend about his loans and he has about triple the amount in private loans and doesn't owe nearly as much in interest (his interest rate is only slightly lower than mine). An I really expected to pay $1300 a month in interest starting around November? If so, how the heck to I go about getting the monthly payment lowered? I don't want to let the loan capitalize and end up owing more, but there is no way I can afford $1300 a month!

Doing a quick calculation with an interest rate of 5% it seems in 35 I will only be left with 488k.

ECONOMY:

June: ""Economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. ... The (Fed) expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline.""

After making payments for the last 20 years, I realized that they've hardly made a dent (approximately $50,000) in the principal amount.  If we assume approximately an average monthly payment of $1600 for the last 240 months, why has so little of the principal been paid?  How can an average interest rate of 4 or so percent accumulate this much interest? Maybe I don't understand compound interest.

First of all, thank you all for the awesome advice, and exposing a lot of my options.  It's given me a lot of hope, and although I am still a bit anxious and stressed out, I have decided to take responsibility and man up on the situation I have caused myself.

Next, I'd like to give an overview of what I've done since the last post:  

* I spoke with a bankruptcy attorney (I only had time for 1 consultation due to work).  I was advised that I would qualify for Chapter 13 (possibly Chapter 7), although he did not look into the details of my finances during this consultation.  He suggested that bankruptcy is a protection provided by the law for people like me, and that I should take advantage of this.

* I spoke with a credit counselor (a member of NFCC), and was advised that I qualify for a DMP (Debt Management Program).  I'd be making ~$1900 monthly payments, and would be able to get interest rates on all of the qualifying credit cards/loans reduced, as well be able to pay off my debts completely in 47 months.

* I am still current on all my bills, due to recognizing my situation (barely in time), and cutting living expenses as much as I could.

Finally, I'd like to propose what I plan as next steps in improving my situation, and would love to hear your feedback.

I am going with Option #2 (DMP), and with this, my updated income/expenses would look like this.  (My income has changed due to overtime/on-call hours, and this should be the minimum for the next 2 months at least):

**Total Loan Expenses: ~~$4016~~ $3705**  
***
**Total Income: $7200**  
**Total Expenses: $6665**  

Now, I do realize (and was told by the counselor) that the DMP is only giving me ~$300 savings in terms of cash flow, and said he could not do anything with the online payday loans as they have no relationship with those lenders.  However, the interest rate on Payday Loan #1 would be reduced to ~12%, while the other cards would be dropped to ~6%-10%.  

My payday loan balances are only dropping slightly with the minimum payments (as expected), but I believe I can knock out 1 loan a month for the next 3 months.  

If I make it through the beginning of January, I will be able to have a better cash flow, with end of the year bonuses kicking in, as well as RSUs in my company vesting in May 2014.  

Right now, I'm in ""emergency mode"", and saving every penny I can, while looking at the bigger picture (future) with hope that things will be getting better if I can just suck it up in the short term.  (I am also looking at other subreddits that were suggested to try to bring in extra income/do consulting/and have successfully used ""comps"" at the casinos where I stopped gambling.  Furthermore, I am still receiving promotional mailers that I've used to walk in, get free cash (~$120 a month), and walk out.  I also have a lot of food comps, so I am using those as well...  

Given that, if for some reason the creditors cannot agree to the DMP proposed, and/or my income is not as expected, and/or some other emergency expense comes up (car repair, health expense not covered by insurance, roommate leaves), I believe my only option will be to file for bankruptcy.

Outstanding debts:

$85,000 Private Student Loans
$4,000 Credit Card Debt (paying this off first as aggressively as I can first)

I'm on the lowest graduated income based repayment you can get on the federal loans. My private loans are on an interest deferal plan, but that has a 4 year max and will not be an option in a year. My loan payments right now total $1100 per month. In a year that will jump to $1800, and the graduated plan will inch that forward every year.

Here's my budget if it helps: Net Monthly Income: 2,864

Rent: 550 Loans: 1,100 Utilities: 150 Internet: 45 Gas: 60 Insurance: 62 Credit Card Pmts: 500

personalfinance,Calculating effective tax rate on option sale.,"Hello,

I'm trying to figure out my effective tax rate on some stock options I will be exercising and same day selling.  I understand that this means they are taxed at the rate of my nominal income.

I've found some online calculators, but am  getting inconstant results, and will be seeing a tax professional this next week.  I am just trying to get a ballpark figure at the moment.

As I understand it, for a same day exercise and sale, I will be taxed on the difference between the option price and the exercise price at my effective tax rate, and then can claim some short term capital loss due to transaction fees etc.  Is that the whole story?

Example:

Married filing jointly.

State of CA.

Total annual household income before stock sale: $220,000.

Total additional income from stock sale [Shares*(sale price - option price)] $315,000.

So to calculate my effective tax rate on that sale (and for the year), it's just going to be my total tax rate (federal and state) for a total yearly income of $545,000? (Which should be around 38% federal and ~11% state, so about 49%, assuming no other deductions)?

Does this sound right?  Some of the calculators are resulting in an effective tax rate of more like 57%...which is making me wonder if I'm missing something.",finance,1375645742

investing,"Is this a dumb idea or half-way insightful? (bonds, interest rates, and debt-fighting congress)","Firstly, would or could congress restrict the sale of bonds in the future, as in limiting the ""supply"" of them for the sake of debt control?

My thought was that if congress put some kind of limit or control on the quantity or accessibility of U.S. bonds, then waiting until the interest rate changes may leave us effectively locked out of the bond market unless we were willing to pay the retail value in exchange for the assumed security that bonds offer.

I don't know how much I have to lay out for you guys, but the idea is that if supply becomes tightly controlled, access would become limited, and therefore the primary method of acquisition would become the retail market. I believe that congress may become motivated to do such a thing by their arguments over the debt ceiling and attempts to control our federal debt level. 

Obviously(If I understand properly) every bond sold is more debt taken on by the government, and I am thinking that congress may make a ham-handed attempt at controlling debt by ceasing or limiting the sale of debt. 

If that happened, and the primary means of laying claim to U.S. debt becomes retail purchasing, the seller(being likely a corporation) will settle for nothing less than the maximum achievable profit for their now valuable and limited supply of bonds. So then IF we intend to buy bonds, we would be buying them at a mark-up from the start.

Next was ""Why do we want to own bonds, and why would we want to own them more-so than we currently do?"" My thought on that ties in with my belief that the market will experience some kind of large contraction, partly related to ETFs, partly related to a large influx of uneducated and inexperienced amateur traders like me, who have no faith in or understanding of their decision to buy stock...therefore they will all settle into the ""Just buy funds or ETFs"" strategy because you can't lose, right?

Well, I was thinking about the growing popularity and awareness of ETFs, and I thought that if there are so many ETFs and funds that just match indexes, there will be many companies that aren't worth investing in which will be getting the same kind of growth as the ""better"" ones. It essentially would then become something like the issue of bundled mortgages that ruined the banks so badly.

Say a few companies that make up some index turn out to have terrible practices and go under or lose a large amount of their perceived value. That brings down the total value of every ETF and fund that they are held by. Amateurs see the value of their ETF drop because these companies aren't staying afloat, and decide to sell and hold on to their gains. Their gains though, really came from the solid and good companies that really were growing in value, and now selling out of the ETF means cashing out of the valuable companies as well as the crashers, which will begin to dampen the growth in value of the good companies, causing the ETF and fund values to decline further, spurning more sell orders to come in.

There would of course be a balance point, and there will always be individual stock purchasers that actually do their research, but I believe there will or possibly are currently far more amateurs that are looking for an easy place to park money without thinking about it; and that is how I believe ETFs and funds are marketed. 

So, a hypothetical spiral of a crash spurns people to look for something more secure and stable to invest in. Where would you turn? Bonds are the traditional go-to for safety, and now you find out the you can only buy them from the retail market because the government would no longer be issuing new debt. Coincidentally(I hope), back when the government allowed a ""tax holiday"" to bribe corporations into bringing their tax-evaded foreign-held cash back into America, I read an article about how they spent the majority of it on U.S. Treasury Notes...which I'm pretty sure is the official name for U.S. bonds, right?

So now the market is down, bonds are up, and the corporations are the only ones holding control of any real amount of government debt. Hypothetically.

I guess I ramble, but I've been wondering about this for a while. But back to the core question.

Would congress be likely to restrict the sale of bonds in order to limit the growth of U.S. debt? And if so, would it be a good idea to buy bonds now or soon-ish in order to be ""grandfathered"" in?

Hendren Group analyst’s compiled data shows that investors switched billions of dollars out of the safety of cash into both equity and bonds funds within the first half of the year, with a large proportion in high-yielding fixed income, on the back of an improvement in sentiment encouraged by rising hopes of an economic recovery. 
	
This year investors withdrew over $247 million from international money markets and injected approximately $213 million into mixed portfolios containing equity and bonds in the bid to seek better returns through a riskier strategy, whilst globally this year in a study-compiled results showing $250 billion has been pumped in bonds and $220 billion into equities. 

“The data does not lie, there has been a large increase this year into bonds and equities excluding last month which lay way to an opposite flow, an anomaly created by the Federal Reserve’s announcements to taper stimulus, investors are looking to generate higher returns and the money markets cannot fulfill their current thirst for gains.

business,"The Avanti Group Bank Fraud, Foreclosure Crisis, A Dream Foreclosed","Source: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/russell-mokhiber/laura-gottesdiener-a-dream-foreclosed_b_3327522.html



How different are the big Wall Street banks circa 2008 from the loan sharks of the 1970s?

Not very.

Laura Gottesdiener has written a remarkable book that hits hard against the big Wall Street banks.

It's called A Dream Foreclosed: Black America and the Fight for a Place to Call Home (Zuccotti Park Press, August 2013).

At base, it's a book about corporate crime.

Remember redlining?

Thirty years ago, banks were drawing imaginary red lines around inner city neighborhoods.

The banks refused to give mortgages to people living in those neighborhoods.

""For decades, the federal government and banks refused to lend in these communities,"" Gottesdienertold Corporate Crime Reporter in an interview last week. ""Finally, when these communities were completely starved for mortgages, they broke it open and pushed the most ridiculous and predatory mortgages they could come up with. And of course, people bought them because it was the first time that mortgages were ever being guaranteed by the government and by big mainstream banks in those communities.""

When did that switch over -- from redlining to reverse redlining?

""In the early to mid-1990s,"" Gottesdiener said. ""And later that was really pushed aggressively by the Bush administration. President Bush gave this nice speech at the 2002 Minority Council on Homeownership. He was saying that banks and the federal government were going to start aggressively lending to minorities.""

""The mortgage market for white Americans was flush. There was no more money to be made from issuing mortgages to white Americans. I think the mortgage rate for white Americans hit 70 to 80 percent in the early 1990s. You started to see that almost any American who could have a mortgage and wanted to have a mortgage would have a mortgage. There was no market there.""

""The banks needed new consumers. So, they moved into the minority market. But they weren't selling the conventional loans. They were selling these incredibly exploitative predatory loans.""

""When you had redlined neighborhoods, there were mortgages. But you had loan sharks pushing them. They would buy mortgages and peddle them in minority neighborhoods with these terribly marked up fees -- crazy late fees, ballooning payments. If you miss one payment, your house gets repossessed. They were these incredibly onerous contracts.""

""You see pretty clear parallels between the predatory mortgages that were issued in the late 1990s and early 2000s by the major banks -- by the Wall Street top banks -- and what you were seeing the loan sharks pushing in these neighborhoods the 1960s and 1970s. They are very similar contracts.""

So the big banks became the loan sharks. But they were never criminally prosecuted?

""Exactly,"" Gottesdiener said. ""And that became the new normal.""

""My book is about African Americans in the foreclosure crisis. But more white Americans have been foreclosed on. You start to see the types of contracts that would never have been imposed on white Americans, did go mainstream. And you started to see them being pushed in nice white suburban communities as well.""

What's one of the most egregious mortgages you came across?

""There are loans called interest only negative amortizing adjustable rate loans,"" Gottesdiener says.

""If you break it down it means you are only paying the interest on your loan. You are never paying your loan off. Negative amortization means that instead of getting smaller, it gets larger. And adjustable rate means the amount of interest can rise and fall.""

""What that means in a practical sense is that you could be paying your mortgage for 20 or 30 years and one day realize that at the end of that time you owe more on your mortgage than the original loan amount.""

Gottesdiener says there have been 4.8 million completed foreclosures since the crisis began in 2007.

""Those are homeowners and families who have been evicted from their homes,"" she said. ""There is not a good count on how many people are involved.""

""No government agency feels the responsibility to track that information. The statistics on that are incredibly spotty.""

""They often rent. Sometimes they will look for a new house to take out a mortgage on. Sometimes they become homeless. A lot of times, they will have a transition where they will live with family or friends, or temporarily live in a homeless shelter. And then they might get on their feet and start renting.""

Out of the 4.8 million, a handful fight back and refuse to leave.

""There might be hundreds, maybe thousands,"" Gottesdiener says. ""The success rate varies.""

""There is a group called City Life/Vida Urbana. They are an anti-foreclosure group in Boston. They have an incredible success rate. They have staged more than 30 foreclosure blockades. They have been successful at almost every single one of them.""

""That's an example of an established community organization that has been in the community for over 30 years. It has a large support network. And they ask members to sit in the homes, but also to bring out neighbors and others. City Life brings out its people. And they have a mass of people that creates a blockade.""

And the bank just turns over the house?

""Not always,"" she says. ""You will often see a back and forth.""

""One example in my book is that of Bertha Garrett. She did this at her home and ultimately won her house back.""

""When there is a blockade, the media comes into play. If the media starts to pick up on the story, it starts to become a local phenomenon. And pressure builds on the bank at a national level. And the bank is forced to deal with the situation to get the bank out of the news and out of the limelight.""

""Wells Fargo and Bank of America or these other big banks, they don't want the negative media attention.

After one blockade or a few blockades, the banks will usually just leave the house alone.""

""When there is a well-established housing organization coordinating the blockade, you will usually see a specific demand attached. You will see -- this family needs a loan modification for this amount, then they can pay. And we can help them pay.""

""Bertha Garrett's house had been sold at the sheriff's sale for $10,000. Her ask was -- I actually just want to buy my house back. That felt fair to her. It was what the bank had just paid to buy it back.""

""She was in Detroit, because housing prices had tanked.""

""In a place like Boston, you will often get a loan modification. In a place like Detroit or the South Side of Chicago, usually they will renegotiate the sale of the home, or sometimes just leave it in foreclosed status.""

""If just one person wants to stay in their house and they are not necessarily connected to the broader community or a housing organization, or a demand that feels intelligible to the bank -- if they just barricade themselves in their homes, the situation can and has ended up quite violently.""

""And people have been shot and died. These are not necessarily incalcitrant people sitting in their homes waiting to see what will happen. It's part of an overall strategy to make it apparent that the banks contracts are not immutable, that there is a possibility that homeowners and everyday people can renegotiate their contracts in the same way that banks, and major financial institutions and governments do all the time.""

""The big banks were pushing a bigger scheme. On one hand they were pushing predatory loans that many people knew were never going to be paid back. And it didn't matter to the big banks, because of securitization process.""

""The banks, under the securitization process, could sell the loan off and receive the money pretty much immediately. It didn't matter to the big banks if that loan ever got repaid.""

""There is clear cut fraudster behavior. And then there is broad collective fraudster behavior of the big banks. The broad collective fraudster behavior of the big banks was that they knew housing prices couldn't go up forever. And yet they created a system and perpetuated it and sold it into infinity. And in that system, housing prices would have to go up forever. They knew it was a house of cards.""

personalfinance,"Im 28 and was irresponsible in my youth, now trying to fix it.","Ok guys, First off, thank you to everyone here. You've all taught me a lot, and made me realize that financial security is something I can actually accomplish if I just put my nose to the grindstone. I've been a lurker for a long time and finally have screwed up the courage to post here and hopefully get some help. So here is my predicament:


Base salary of $36,720 but doesn't include my built in OT and whatever OT I can pick up. I'm technically an hourly employee, and am on track to actually almost double my base salary depending on how the rest of the year pans out.


I currently live paycheck to paycheck, and it wasn't until I sat down and was really honest with myself that I realized how much money I was throwing away on stuff - food, drinking, cigarettes. It was ridiculous. I had gotten to the point where I was so subconsciously distraught about my finances that I would go buy expensive things to make myself feel better. For example: Get a bill from a medical provider that I can't afford? Ignore it and go buy new clothes instead. Worried about the costs of that recent hospital stay and surgery? Buy a $60 bottle of Scotch and drown the sorrows. Some people are addicted to booze, drugs, nicotene...I'm addicted to spending money on fancy things. I was checking over my car today, and I need new tires. They are COMPLETELY bald. But I don't have the money to replace them. I did, however, drop almost $60 bucks on pizza and beer at a team fundraiser the other night though. 


Priorities, I need them.

**Expenses:**

*Rent: $900 (I live in a big city. This is actually a pretty good price for the neighborhood I'm in)

*Utilities (Electric and internet): $50-100/month. Landlord pays for heat and hot water. I don't have cable, but this does include my Netflix and Hulu subscriptions. 

*Cellphone: $76, hopefully going down to $68 in August.

*CharlieCard (mass transit/subway) $70

*Gas: $100 (I drive an SUV, which I can't get rid of because I travel for work two or three times a month and New England winters can be nasty).

*Groceries: $300

*Car insruance: $100/month

*Doctors: $200. I just had back surgery, and go to physical therapy every week. At $40 bucks a pop, it adds up.


With my built in overtime (we do a 36/48 rotation), I bring home approximately $2,280 a month give or take a couple bucks. This DOES NOT include the OT I earn from working additional hours OR the shift differential I get for working nights. I work OT virtually every week - for example, in two weeks I'm working an 84 hour week.


**Assets:**

*Vehicle valued at approximately $12,000. Own this outright. I can't get rid of this, as like I said above I travel for work several times a month. I need an SUV because I am a critical employee and am required to work regardless of weather, blizzards be damned. 

*Retirement fund, split between a 401K and Roth IRA: $4,855.55. I've been contributing a combined $10 (7% into the 401k for employer matching, 3% into the Roth). I've only been contributing to this for about 10 months.
*Profit sharing from previous employer: Approximately $15,000. This is NOT invested anywhere. It's just kind of sitting in an account with Merrill Lynch. Investing when I was 23 was scary, and now I regret not investing it. I often forget I even have this.


**Debt**

*Credit Card: $4,396.76 at 14.99%. Paying $200 a month on this.

*Student Loans: $42,942.76 at 6.8%, currently in forebearance because I got injured a little bit ago, was out of work on disability, and couldn't afford my payments. I consolidated these loans recently and am paying $299 a month when NOT in forebearance.


I don't think I'm in a *bad* place, per se, but I'm definitely not in a good place either. I've just opened an account on Mint and am basing my budgets off my base salary. I'm planning on using any extra money earned via OT to throw towards the credit card debt and student loans.


I've made small but significant adjustments - not buying breakfast and lunch every day at work and brown bagging it instead, getting over my extreme caffeine addiction, giving up smoking and drinking (Scotch, while delicious and my drink of choice, is too expensive of a hobby right now). Those little things made a HUGE difference in my discretionary cash flow.


Here are my questions:

*Which is more important right now, my retirement fund or setting up an emergency fund? I've already met my employers match for the 401k, so there's that. For the emergency fund, I was thinking of opening up a CapitalOne 360 Savings account and tossing $50 from each paycheck into it. This savings account has a .75% interest rate. Are there any other options out there that you would suggest?

*The profit sharing fund from a previous job: I'm thinking of getting this paid out in cash and using it to pay off my credit card debt and throwing the rest into my emergency fund/Roth IRA. Is this a bad idea? My thoughts are, if I can pay off the credit card in it's entirety I can increase both my monthly student loans payments AND my retirement contributions, which would probably be more beneficial in the long run.

I'm also planning on tossing whatever extra cash I have at the end of each pay period into my soon-to-be-established emergency fund. 


If you have any other advice, I would really appreciate it. I was exceptionally irresponsible in my youthful carefree days, and now that I'm getting older and want to settle down and buy a house and maybe buy an engagement ring at some point, I'm really feeling the effects of those bad decisions.",finance,1375574460
personalfinance,Is this a good plan to pay down my debt?,"Hi all,
I have been out of grad school for about six months now and am finally getting serious about organizing my finances and paying down my debt. Here is my situation:
-Currently making $55,500/year, I take home $2,814/month after taxes/401k/HSA contributions;
-I work in a high-growth field and expect my salary to grow 8-12% per year for the foreseeable future, my job is also very secure;
-Car loan with a balance of $22k, APR of 6.99%, monthly payment of $400 which is slightly more than the minimum (in retrospect this purchase wasn't the smartest move);
-Student loans totaling $36k (balances of $4k, $8.5k, $10.7k, and $10.8k), APR of 6.55%, currently in IBR with minimum monthly payment of $320;
-Personal loan from a family member of $4k, no interest, I pay $200/month.

I haven't been paying much more than the minimum payments but have recently committed myself to cutting living expenses in order to accelerate my repayment. I have a too-small emergency fund but a decent amount in my HSA. My plan is to put about $400/month into an emergency fund until I have ~$3k.. small, but probably enough to get through most emergencies (especially since I'm putting $100/month into the HSA, which my employer matches). Once that is sufficient, I plan to overpay on my student loans first. I expect to be phased out of the student loan interest deduction within just a couple of years, so I'd like to take the full benefit of that if possible. I'm going to try to refinance my car loan in a few months to get a shorter term and lower rate. Obviously, raises/bonuses will go towards debt.

Am I being an idiot? Should I pay off the car first? I figure the interest rates are close enough, and I think I will be encouraging to get some of the smaller student loan balances out of the way.

When I got to the register, the clerk saw that the only used copy was pretty scuffed up and decided to give me a new GOTY edition for the used price. Sealed in the plastic wrap and all. Today, I decided to go get a new game for shits and giggles. I saw ME 2 was only 7 dollars, so I decided to pick it up having just finished the first. When I went to check out, the clerk handed me a collectors edition(steel book, art book, and working DLC codes) because their manager wanted their stock moved. I mean, I could go on and on about how they've helped me out through the years. Do they have some horrible corporate panzi scheme I don't know about? Were they behind the holocaust?

personalfinance,Is FERS a stable and sustainable retirement system?,"I'm a federal employee (DoD), just turned 32, making 106k/year, living in DC. For those who don't know, the Federal Employee Retirement System consists of three parts: Social security (we pay into this, people on the old CSRS do not), a defined contribution plan (TSP, essentially like a 401k for military/gov), and a defined benefit plan (the ""FERS annuity"", which ends up being 1.1 percent of the high-3 average times the number of years worked).

With all the budget swirl, government shutdowns, and municipalities going under because of underfunded pension plans, is the FERS system sustainable? I feel extremely fortunate to have this, but I'm not sure if social security being around when I retire (2050), and I don't know if the annuity will still be available in 40 years. I'm hedging my bets by maxing out the only part of this that I have any control over (maxing out my TSP contribution ($17,500/year)). I just don't want to end up like some of the municipal workers, where they were counting on a pension and now they're not getting what they had been planning on during their careers, and now they're fucked. Am I'm worrying too much? If the federal government goes bust over it's pension promises, I'll probably have a lot more to worry about, right? 

The only references I can find about this are from Federal News Radio, which is probably not an objective source of info.

You want to tell me happened, the detective asked. 
Sure, said Mr. X. I wasted those bastards. Yeah, I did it. And I'm glad. 
Okay, but why?
Since the beginning, I was part of the Gang of Four. 
Four?
It was me, Dr. J, Mr. Z, and Miss Q. 
Ah, yes, the power letters. 
Right. 
So this was some political thing, you killing them?
Well, not really. Maybe. 
A power grab?
X shook his head. No. 
Well, what then?
I hated their guts. 
Why? 
All the time, they never respected me. They would hang out with each other, never waiting for me to join them. It was like they were a separate trio and I... I was just...
... a hang-around?
Yeah. And then one day, when I went to the washroom while we were at lunch having alphabet soup, I heard them talking. 
How do you mean?
I came out of the washroom, but there was a divider I had to walk past to get back with them. But this time, I stopped and hid behind it. They couldn't see me, but I could hear them. 
So what did you hear them say?
They were laughing and Z was saying, X is nice and all, but he's not really one of us. And Dr. J laughed and said, that's true. And he'll never be one of us, not really. 
So that got you mad. 
Damn straight. But I kind of knew that already. It was like an unspoken truth, our little elephant in the room. 
But something set you off, pushed you over the edge. Was it Miss Q?
X clenched his fists, straining the cuffs. Yeah, that little bitch. It was all her fault. If only she'd kept her friggin mouth shut. 
The detective leaned forward. What did she say? 
She said -- and he gulped -- she said, X is cute. He's like a little puppy dog, always following us around. It's touching how he thinks he belongs with us and not with the other letters. 
And then J said, Yeah, he could easily hang out with V, F, B, those people. 
And that got you mad enough to kill them?
X glared. Damn right. It's not my fault, you see. Everyone thinks I'm one of them. They're always mentioning me in the same breath as them. The ""power letters"" they call us. 
The power letters. Hmm. 
That's us. I'm eight points. It's enough that people treat me special, but those three bastards, they're all tens. I never had their respect, not for one friggin moment. They never saw me as an equal, even if everyone else did. Never. They had to play their little game, be snobs about it. 
And so you killed them. 
That's right. They had it coming, I tell you. Fucking elitist pricks. And that princess Q. 
Well, you put Zynga in a tough spot. No one wants to play without the power letters. Even if they let you out to play, it's not the same. 
Heh heh. Yeah, everyone loved those guys. If only they knew what assholes they were. 
You're enjoying this. 
Ha. Yeah, I am. You know, sometimes, when those guys would be late in a game, I would chat with the other letters, get them to change position so that it would be hard or impossible to spell anything with the douches. Then the game would sometimes end without one or two of them ever getting a chance to play. 
Did it ever happen to you?
Oh yeah, sure. I'm not that easy to play either. But when it did, they never felt sorry. I know now, they must have felt relieved, not having to share the board with me, not having to share the spotlight.

I am 26 years old living in NYC making $37,700 a year ($935 take home every two weeks). My job provides me with health insurance/prescriptions, and I am enrolled into their retirement plan.  I graduated college with a Bachelors of Science 3.5 years ago, and ever since I left school I have been credit card happy.

Here's the basic gist of my situation:

I live at home with my parents. I have no student loans since I got a full scholarship to college. I use my parents car when I need to go somewhere, but usually end up taking the train/bus to go somewhere. I pay $85 a month for my cell phone, $95 a month for Metro Card, and usually spend around $140 a month in food. Once a week I'll go out for drinks with my friends and that's about $45. Then some other odds and ends, like toiletries, stuff for the dog, clothes, ect, but nothing major. 

Every check I get I take $300 out, put it into my bank account and at the end of the month send my credit card company $600. I have $3,502 balance on it with a 13% interest rate. I have only $1250 saved in the bank which I don't touch and hardly ever contribute to. 

I want to stop using the card for things on Amazon or stupid stuff, but I guess I don't have any self-control. If I cancel my card will that hurt my credit score? Would asking for a credit decrease hurt my score as well? Any other tips for saving would be appreciated.",finance,1375670328

personalfinance,Friend needs help with a tricky auto loan situation.,"My friend and her mom co-signed/bought a used 2011 Nissan Versa about a year ago from a Honda dealership. For some reason, maybe due to a miscommunication, they thought that they were leasing the car. She's going to college this fall and was under the impression she could either sell it back or end the supposed lease. Here's the pickle she's finding herself in:

* Due to her mom's bad credit and her (at the time) lack of credit, she was given absurd loan terms (19%). I believe the loan ended up being around $15,000
* I suspect that there was also some fuckery afoot at the dealership, and that my friend and her mom were taken advantage of, but maybe I'm just being biased. The car is now worth somewhere between $8K and $9K according to KBB. 
* She wants to sell/return the car (since she's starting school very soon), but it sounds like her only options are to either A) sell the car back to the dealership and pay the difference; B) refinance through a separate credit union (current loan is through Capital One, who does not offer auto loan refinancing for existing loans) and pay the difference; C) Apply for a private student loan (which she was going to do anyway) and ask for more than the intended amount, and then use the extra amount to pay the difference in situation A or B; or D) Keep paying for the car at 19% interest rate ($400/month - very pricey on a college budget)

The ideal scenario is one where she could sell the car and somehow not be $5k or $6K in the hole... is this at all possible? Are there any other options we didn't consider?

personalfinance,"I can't save money, am constantly freaking out and don't know what to do any more.","I just turned 25 this past week and I'm sick of constantly being under the stress that is my financial situation. I went to college, got a good job and live in a cheap city. I shouldn't be struggling this much. Yet, I am. And I wonder if maybe some of you can give me some insight into what I'm doing wrong, and possibly how to fix it before I end up needing emergency money I just don't (and never will) have. 

My monthly take-home pay is just a few cents short of $2,040. I have about $300 in savings in the bank, and that never gets touched nor added to.

I have way too many expenses a month. I know this is my first issue. Let me list them:

* Rent: My share is $216
* Heat/Electric: My share is $56
* Internet: My share is $25
* Cell Phone: $100
* Private student loan: $338
* Federal student loan: $185
* Personal loan: $245
* Car payment: $170
* Car insurance: $65
* Renters insurance: $20
* HSA Contribution: $35
* Medical bills: $100
* Credit cards: $60 (about $4,000 in debt)

That totals to about to $1,615 which leaves me about $400 left for all other expenses for the month. Gas, groceries, entertainment, etc. Which isn't much of anything, really. That's $75 a week. And with a lot of commuting, that doesn't help. I bike as much as I can. I've tried getting second jobs multiple times. But my main job has such unknown hours (it's salary at an ad agency, sometimes I'm here until 9pm, sometimes weekends, etc.) that it's impossible to hold one for long.

I feel like something needs to turn around to get me out of this hole. I went to a good college, have a good job and shouldn't constantly be freaking out this much about money.",finance,1375818352

Background:

Family of four: me, wife, 1.5 yo daughter, mother-in-law.

Me

* $47k gross

* 3 months emergency fund

* 401k @ 6% + 3% from employer (max match)

* No IRA

* We get by with our current single income (mortage, car note) but can't afford to start our IRAs.  But with the help of student loans, we may be able to...

Her

* Going to start pharmacy school full time this end of August

* Post 9/11 GI Bill - awarded 90% tuition coverage - 36 months. All 8 semesters, not including summer sessions

* BAH - awarded 90% (ammount will cover 100% of apartment rent - not bills/utilities, NOT including summer months)

* Awarded $1500 per semester in grants.  All 8 semesters.

* Awarded $600 per semester for books/supplies.  All 8 semesters.

Estimated total cost to us (all four years, not covered by awards/grants/gi bill) = approx. $15,000USD.

MIL

* Green card holder

* Staying with us temporarily to help raise our child

* Will return to her native homeland after wife gets a job

So my question is, considering all this information, would it be worth it to take out student loans to cover the Estimated total cost ($15,000) plus both our Roth IRAs ($5500+ each person) for the next four years?  Legaly speaking, I do make the income required to fully fund each of our Roth IRAs.  Also, with the Roth IRA, the principle can be withdrawn at any time without incuring any penalties (correct?).

Her earning potential, if she completes her schooling, will be a huge lift for us.  If it helps, she got accepted to University of Texas Austin (#4 pharmacy school).  We've read somewhere that there maybe a saturation of pharmacists within the coming decade but we're willing to live with that.  We'd like to maximize our retirement investment potential and I'm worried about the cost-benefit of forgoing another four years before we can start funding our IRAs.

personalfinance,"College loan without a co-signer, what do I do?","I'm currently in a very difficult position.  I'm 2 years away from completing my degree (after already investing 4 years), and am without financial aid for this upcoming year.

I go to a private school for a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and have been a co-op at a NASA center for the past few years.  However, I've left school twice so far.  The first time was after my family lost their home in a flood, and the second time for mental health reasons.  

Since I've not stayed consistently enrolled (and dropped out of classes the first time I left), my school is withholding funding for a year until I stay enrolled for a full year and receive good grades in/don't drop any of my classes.  I had signed a [SAP](http://financialaid.csumb.edu/faq/sap-policy) after my first leave, and didn't realize when I left the second time, that it would affect the 2nd point (the qualitative measurement portion).  

Our school is a 5 year degree program, so I have up to 7.5 years to complete my degree. I thought about trying to save up, but due to my need to be enrolled 2 semesters to re-qualify for aid, I'd need to save $40,000 to go back to school which isn't entirely feasible in that time frame.

This fall semester, I owe roughly $20,000, and with a due date of yesterday, I've exhausted all options I could think of.  I've been unable to find a co-signer, so attempted to apply on my own.  Since I only made ~$9500 last year (from internships) I don't have an income high enough to qualify.  

I planned on spending my Fall applying for every scholarship known to man to avoid this issue in Spring, but that won't help me for Fall.

Below is a list of what I'm facing:

* Have talked extensively with school, there will be no federal aid or school provided aid for 1 year
* No co-signer
* Income too low to apply w/o co-signer
* Switching to another (lower cost) school isn't viable, since all my credits have been completed at my current school

Are there banks or companies that would let me apply with my income as low as it is?  I'm willing to eat a high interest rate if it means I can get my degree.  Or are there other options I haven't thought of yet?

Let me know if I need to clarify anything.  Thanks.

My FT job pays 32k before taxes a little more than 24k after taxes and benefits. I have essentially no hope of actually paying off these loans by myself, so I am trying to hammer out a payment plan that makes life bearable and might allow me to begin having some savings. (I currently have none. My emergency fund right now is the space I've built on a credit card I don't use.)

To do so, I think that I need to position myself using both IBR and Public Service Loan Forgiveness Programs. If you know about these two things, please feel free to PM me or respond. Thanks in advance.

I have tried to format things so that my question and situation make sense. 

________________________________________________________________________

The table below is currently in ""Paid Ahead"" status due to paying a lump sum of $2000 after an Americorps year. ALL of these loans do not have a monthly minimum payment (right now) but are accruing interest. I have not been paying that interest due to other pressing financial needs... and the sheer terror/apathy about tackling that amount of debt. There is an obscene amount of unpaid interest, and yesterday I decided to try and figure out what to do. (The current balance includes unpaid interest.)


FEDLOAN SERVICING Description | Interest Rate | Current Balance 
:--|:--|:--
Direct Student PLUS Loan | 7.9% fixed | $13,417
Direct Sub Stafford Loan | 6.8% fixed | $8,098
Direct Unsub Stafford Loan | 6.8% fixed | $12,111
Graduate PLUS | 8.5% fixed | $8,806
Graduate PLUS | 8.5% fixed | $12,126
Federal Unsub Stafford Loan | 6.8% fixed | $12,504
Federal Stafford Loan | 6.8% fixed | $7,985
TOTAL | ... | $75,047



I only learned today that the $0 monthly minimum was due to the Americorps payment and not the IBR payment plan which I applied for and was approved for. Under IBR I would normally be paying $69. That is reasonable and something I can do, so I am trying to figure out the best plan for me with that in mind. I work in education, so my take home pay after taxes and benefits is $2,050 per month. I know that normally that would be an amount someone should be able to save with, but I went through some shit (and was an idiot) and racked up a lot of credit card debt. 

I'm working on that. 

But about $400-500 a month goes towards credit cards, which means my ultimate goal towards student loans is to: 

1. put as many of my loans under the IBR payment plan
2. qualify as many of my loans for the Public Service Forgiveness program (I am not a k12 teacher.)

After talking with several loan-servicer-phone-people, it seems like my best plan would be to apply for the Forgiveness Program first and get my employer qualified. I want to be seen as working under that repayment plan BEFORE consolidating because if my loans were to consolidate under Fannie Mae, they don't offer that forgiveness option. So I need to make sure I am consolidated under FedLoan Servicing, and doing the forgiveness paperwork first *should* make sure I would revert back to FedLoan even if I were to be slotted into Fannie Mae.

After I'm assured that I qualify for the Forgiveness Program and have my employer verified, I will consolidate my loans and apply for the IBR program at the same time. Consolidation would allow some of my loans that wouldn't normally be forgiven by themselves get forgiven if grouped together with other loans. (I still don't really understand the why or how of the last sentence.)

If the IBR doesn't take for whatever reason, FedLoan Servicing people told me that I could still reapply after the consolidation was complete.

Below are listed some of my other loans that *could* qualify for this IBR/Forgiveness Plan, as well as a couple that perplex me.


IA STUDENT LOAN Description | Interest Rate | Current Balance 
:--|:--|:--
Subsidized Consolidation Loan | 5.5% fixed |$8,841
Unsub Consolidation Loan | 5.5% fixed| $9,797
TOTAL | ... | $18,638

The above table is in repayment. I have been paying the minimum plus any monthly accrued interest for over a year.

The IA Student loans are up for the consolidation plan I am considering.



UAS Description | Interest Rate | Current Balance 
:--|:--|:--
Perkins; 97 | 5% (unknown) | $14,638

I have been paying the minimum plus any monthly accrued interest for over a year.

This UAS loan is up for the consolidation plan, but I believe that I should not consolidate it as a Perkins loan could eliminate my eligibility for IBR payment plans. If someone could confirm this, that would be amazing.



ACS Description | Interest Rate | Current Balance 
:--|:--|:--
Federal Perkins Student Loan | 5% (unknown) | $3,778

This ACS loan did **not** show up on my National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) search... I don't know what to do/think about that. Since it didn't show up, that leads me to believe that it isn't eligible for consolidation-- which is alright as it's a Perkins loan which could disqualify for IBR anyway.

HONG KONG, Aug 5 — Major Asian markets were mostly lower today after lower-than-expected US jobs growth sounded a warning about the recovery of the world’s biggest economy.
Investors failed to follow Wall Street, which closed last week on record highs despite the job figures indicating that growth remains sluggish.

Tokyo fell 1.44 per cent or 208.12 points to close at 14,258.04, Seoul dropped 0.37 per cent or 7.16 points to 1,916.22, and Sydney fell 0.11 per cent or 5.5 points to 5,111.3.
In the afternoon Hong Kong was up 0.17 per cent and Shanghai rose 0.36 per cent.

Markets in the region were digesting Friday’s Labor Department figures, which showed the United States added just 162,000 jobs in July, well below the 175,000 increase expected by analysts.
The unemployment rate fell to 7.4 per cent from 7.6 per cent in June.

The data will serve as an indicator of when the Federal Reserve may rein in its bond-buying programme, with sluggish growth suggesting any scaling back of the massive stimulus scheme will be delayed.

Despite the disappointing figures leading to an initial dip, Wall Street saw a late surge to end the week at a record high, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing up 0.19 per cent or 30.34 points at 15,658.36. The broad-market S&amp;P 500 ended up 0.16 per cent or 2.80 points at 1,709.67.
The release at the weekend of a slightly improved Chinese non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) failed to give Asian stocks a boost.

China’s official non-manufacturing PMI for July came in at 54.1, up from 53.9 in the previous month. A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while anything above signals growth.
Banking giant HSBC said today its PMI for the services industry in China stood at 51.3 in July, unchanged from June.
The dollar fetched ¥98.76 in afternoon Asian trade, almost flat from ¥98.89 in New York Friday, but sharply down from around ¥99.50 in Tokyo Friday.

The euro bought US$1.3274 and ¥131.11 today against US$1.3279 and ¥131.35 in US trade.

Hiroichi Nishi, general manager of equities at SMBC Nikko Securities, said there was “some caution over stocks having risen too sharply” in previous sessions.
Still, “falls are likely to be limited as uncertainty has broadly receded over the global economic outlook in recent weeks”, he added.

personalfinance,"I need to either get a car, or get a new job and take a pay cut. How can I do this without digging myself into a deeper hole?","As it is, I feel like I've been doing nothing but running in circles financially for what seems like my entire adult life. I'm only 22, been working since I was 16, and up until recently I've only ever really had min/close to min wage retail jobs. Now I have something that pays a bit better, (11.30/hr)  but I still feel like I'm going in circles. 

Here's a quick rundown of my monthly expenses:
Rent/Utilities- 700/month
Credit Card - 50/month (I pay a little above minimum each month.)
Sally Mae - 50/month (With a total of about 3k left in debt on a degree I never really got anywhere with. Sigh.) 
Food - 100/month (Including lunches at work. I try to bring it as often as I can, but my transportation situation makes it very, very hard.) 
Transport - 160/month 

The transportation costs just recently went up about $60/ a month. I take public transit to work, and my work just moved to the other side of town, and due to that I have to take two entirely different bus systems to and from work every day. This is where I feel I need to have a car, or a different job. I leave at about 8:20 in the morning, and I don't get home until 11:30 at night, because I work 10 hour shifts, and the evening bus leaves me unfortunate enough to have to wait an hour after my shift for the next bus leaving. I barely have enough time for a shower before I have to be in bed in order to not be a zombie at work the next morning, let alone making lunches for the next day. 

So, at this point, I feel I need either a car or another job. If I get a car, my time away from home will change to leaving at 9:30am and getting home at about the same time at night. (I work a 10-9 shift.) Having a car would also allow me to have more freedom and not be bound by the local bus system nearly as much. 

But, as you can see, I'm having a hard time fitting it anywhere into the budget. Of course my transportation cost will go up, not down, but my quality of living will go up CONSIDERABLY. 

I could possibly cut my living expenses back some, I'm working with my partner to bring down the electric bill, we're cutting out cable all together, and we rent a garage/storage space from our landlords which we're getting rid of soon as well. So, hopefully, if everything goes well, my rent/utilities will go down to about $600/month. 
Even so, this doesn't leave me a whole lot leftover to save, like, at all. 

So on the one hand, to keep my job, I need to have a car at some point. On the other, I want to stop running in circles financially, and I'm not sure how to achieve this. I could possibly find another job and not get a car and still be alright, but with my work experience and lack of formal, completed education, I've always struggled to find jobs that weren't minimum/just above and part time, and I don't know how likely it is that I could ever possibly get anything that pays this well for my history. 

I don't know what I should do - I can't save for a car, but I would need to take out a loan for 2-3k, however, I don't want to get shafted with an obscenely high interest rate.

I feel so incredibly stuck. I'm not sure what to do. What's my best bet to get myself out of this financial shitstorm?",finance,1375769947

investing,Gold and Gold Miners: An intermediate long?,"Gold is currently trading ~$1300/oz after getting beaten down from highs of ~$1900/oz to lows near $1200/oz. 

If you look at COT data, you'll see that commercial hedgers are most net long they have ever been since start of records. Conversely, large and small speculators (both large and small funds) are net shortest they have ever been in record. Usually with COT reports, you take extreme readings of commercial hedgers to be the ""right"" side for intermediate term trades (I'd estimate ~8-18 months). You will see that small speculators are actually net short the gold metal on the COMEX.

There are other signals like the GOFO going negative (began around early July) that seem to indicate a change in trend. The GOFO is the differential between cost to borrow $ and cost to borrow gold (calculated as LIBOR minus Gold Lease Rate). When GOFO is positive, traders borrow gold and sell it to get dollars (the gold carry trade). This trade vanishes once GOFO turns negative and historically has marked a turnaround for gold prices (1999, 2001, 2008 bottoms). Some people are saying it's different this time because the LIBOR is also very suppressed at this time due to Fed market interventions (I don't buy this line of reasoning).

There are also seasonal effects which are mostly bullish for gold around this time of the year (Q3 and Q4). They include large demand from Asian importers, especially China and India. This seasonality is well documented [here].(http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5168981decad04e710000000-960/screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%207.26.34%20pm.jpg)

The largest deviations from seasonality occurred in 2008 (financial crisis) and 2011 (after the drop from gold's parabolic rise). 

The problem investors have known for a while is that Indian demand might not be as strong as other years (due to an increase in gold import tax the government has levied from 6% to 8%). However, the government had tried decreasing gold imports by doubling the tax rate before in 2012. Analyst concensus for imports that year was ~655 tonnes, but it actually came out to 845 tonnes (a decrease in tonnage from 2011, but an increase in terms of dollar-value).

There are also fears of Fed tapering leading to spikes in interest rates (and gold is bearish when real interest rates turn positive). The Fed is expected to announce a tapering of QE bond buying programs by the Sep 17-18 meeting (before Bernanke becomes a lame-duck). I think either the taper is delayed, or initiates with a less-than-expected decrease because: 1) Janet Yellen, the most likely replacement for Fed chair, is known to be more dovish than Bernanke; 2) though certain economic stats were looking good, the non-farm payroll report for July came in weak (this emphasizes point 1 as Yellen sees employment as being more of an issue than inflation right now).

I'm also seeing some technical signs on the weekly charts of GDX that indicate exhaustion in the downward momentum (MACD divergence with a cross-over, RSI divergence, increased volatility indicating directional confusion).

So there you have it, my thesis for an intermediate long position on gold. I've also taken a liking to the miners here as they write down huge losses on their mines and look for high-cost mines to shut down. You should be careful with selecting a miner however, and I am going with the miner etf GDX. 

I'm looking for a modestly strong increase in prices like $1500/oz by spring of 2014 (let's say mid-March, 2014). This would greatly relieve pressure on gold miners as I feel they've been oversold on fears of gold plummeting to sub-$1000/oz and staying there.

I welcome your input.",finance,1375763077
business,Kiwi declines: Dollar remains lower amid signs China stabilising,"TOKYO, Aug 6 — The dollar remained lower following a decline at the end of last week after Chinese data signalled a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy is moderating, sapping demand for the greenback as a haven asset.
The dollar was within 0.5 per cent of a six-week low against the euro after a US government report on August 2 showed employers added fewer-than-estimated workers in July, damping speculation the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of bond purchases anytime soon. New Zealand’s dollar tumbled against all of its major peers after China halted imports of milk powder from Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd.
“You would have thought the US dollar will come off a little bit,” said Tim Kelleher, the head of institutional foreign-exchange sales in Auckland at ASB Institutional. “The jobs number was a little bit disappointing for the hawks.”
The Bloomberg US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against its 10 major counterparts, rose to 1,029.53 at 11:30am in Tokyo from 1,028.74 on August 2, when it slid 0.6 per cent. The US currency was unchanged at US$1.3276 per euro. It touched US$1.3345 on July 31, the weakest since June 19.
The yen was little changed at 98.92 per dollar and at 131.30 per euro. Australia was on a bank holiday today. 
China’s PMI
The non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 54.1 last month from 53.9 in June, the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said on August 3. A separate report from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said today that their services PMI was unchanged in July at 51.3. A reading above 50 signals expansion.
In the US, Labour Department figures showed on August 2 that payrolls rose by 162,000 in July, the smallest gain in four months and compared with the 185,000 increase projected in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The unemployment rate dropped to 7.4 per cent from 7.6 per cent.
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said June 19 after the central bank’s policy meeting that the Fed may start dialling back its bond-buying programme this year and end it entirely in mid-2014 if the economy achieves sustainable growth. It has been buying US$40 billion of mortgage bonds and US$45 billion of Treasuries to inject cash into the economy.
The central bank plans to hold its target interest rate near zero at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 per cent and the outlook for inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5 per cent.
Fed outlook
The dollar has strengthened 5.8 per cent in the past six months, the best performer among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. A government report showed last week that the world’s largest economy expanded 1.7 per cent in the second quarter, surpassing the 1 per cent growth estimated by economists.

Fifty per cent of the 54 economists in a July 18-22 Bloomberg survey expected the Fed to decide to reduce the bond purchases at its September 17-18 gathering.
“I generally like the US dollar,” Greg Gibbs, a Singapore-based senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. The economic data still point “toward the Fed beginning their tapering in September, so I think that’s going to keep the dollar pretty well supported.”
The kiwi slid 1.2 per cent to 77.41 US cents, nearing the one-year low of 76.84 touched June 24.
Auckland-based Fonterra, the world’s largest dairy exporter, said August 3 that three batches of a whey protein made at a New Zealand plant last year may contain bacteria that can cause botulism. Dairy products make up about a quarter of the South Pacific nation’s total overseas sales, which in turn account for about a third of economic output. Fonterra collects 89 per cent of the milk produced in the country. – THEMALAYMAILONLINE

My parents paid for the first two years so I'm grateful for that, but the next two years are on me. Nitty gritty details: I have a scholarship that goes up 500$ every year, ideally I will finish in two more years but I may have to go an extra semester. My tuition in 3'000$ a semester and my rent is 340$ a month. I'm currently applying for a part time job in my college town to try and make a bit of money for food and towards rent. My family belongs to federal credit union I don't know if that means anything. I'm absolutely clueless when it comes to bank/money dealings. I would really like to become more independent and money smart. Any advice on different loans? My parents are vaguely looking at the sallie mae one, but I'm just confused.",finance,1375762114
gaming,My problem with PC gaming.,"So I was browsing Steam the other day looking for a good graphically simple game that my computer could handle and I come across Rogue Legacy.  It looks great, looks like tons of fun with plenty of replay value.  It also looks like a simple 2D game that my computer could handle right?  WRONG!

I purchase the game, $15, which isn't much for a solid game IMO, but I was immediately riddled with installation issues revolving around Microsoft's .NET Framework, hours of frustration later I finally had the game installed.  I booted up the game only to be plagued with some terribly terribly low framerates which, for some, were associated with XNA being an issue on laptops or something.

I did many searches for fixes and waded through countless forums looking for help, but nothing worked.  So in the end, I'm left with paying $15 for a game I cannot even use.

My point is this, I used to be a PC gamer several years ago, and I'm well aware that a PC can produce graphics and modding communities like none other.  I just can never get over the level of uncertainty that goes into purchasing a PC game, you'll think it'll work just fine, only to be terribly let down.  That's one of the biggest reasons that I got out of PC gaming.  

This is the reason I stick to console games, you put in a game disc or download something off PSN/XBL and it works, perfectly, smoothly, and responsively.  Even if the game doesn't have the same level of graphics or even any mods, it's still preferable to me to have a game that will run smoothly and I know it will run smoothly.  This isn't even mentioning the price difference between PC and consoles.

I imagine I'll get a lot of flak from the PC master race folks, and that's their prerogative.  I'm also not holding anything against Rogue Legacy(because I still really want to play it), but I imagine I may just wait for it to possibly come out on PSN instead.

What some people don't get is that PC gaming and console gaming are two completely separate markets, with two completely separate price points, and that some people would rather just have a game that works smoothly over a game that has cutting edge graphics or large modding capabilities.

All I can say is that I used to have a decent experience with games on Steam, but I'm just fed up with the uncertainty.  There's always the voice in the back of my head before I buy a game saying ""You know you may end up getting some bullshit error when trying to install/launch this game.""

MachineLearning,How do you organize your machine-learning pipeline?,"I was wondering about the way people organize their machine learning projects. Specifically, it is very common to have a pipeline starting with data in some sort of database, which is fed through several sequential algorithms (an example taken from Andrew Ng's course - we start with raw images, then extract locations of digits which appear in them, then feed these to a digit-recognizer).

1. Where do you store intermediary results? 
2. How do you store your trained classifiers?
3. How do you store the results of different parameterizations or hyper-parametrizations of your algorithms? (for example, assuming that one layer is perfect so that we can see how that affects the final output)

personalfinance,The Mathematics of PMI,"I was reading a thread today where someone called PMI the devil. Everyone says that you should have the 20% down before even thinking about buying because PMI is a waste of money. However, we're currently in an rising interest rate environment, so I became curious. What would cost more: more PMI today and a lower interest rate or less to no PMI tomorrow with a higher interest rate because you waited to save up a bit more?

I created a simple model in Excel which I've uploaded to this file-sharing site: 
http://www1.datafilehost.com/d/ba456324

Basically I created several scenarios to compare paying 5%, 10% or 15% down on either 15 or 30 year mortgage. If you want a 20%+ scenario, you can replace one of the others. The model will recognize that there should be no PMI. Based on a monthly amortization schedule, some Excel trickery, and some research about how PMI premiums are calculated, you can figure out when PMI will no longer be required and how much it had cost in total. It's also easy enough to find out how much the loan will cost over its maturity in terms of interest and principal. 

Comparing those can tell whether you actually save money by buying with less of a down payment to secure a lower interest rate. 

In the scenario I included in the spreadsheet, if you only have a 5% down-payment on a $200,000 house but can secure a 15 year mortgage at 3%, it would save you $1,303 over the life of the loan compared to saving up for a 10% down-payment when rates are at 4%. This effect only becomes more exacerbated on the 30 year mortgages. A 4.5% loan with 5% down results in $26,057 in savings compared to a 5.75% with 10% down. 

The savings break down the larger the differences in down-payment. For the 15 year, interest rates would need to almost double before paying 5% down and securing a 3% loan would save money over waiting to pay 20% down. However, the 30 year is much more sensitive to interest rates. Going from a rate of 4.5% to 6.5% is enough to justifying buying today with 5% versus waiting for 20% down.

CAVEATS:

1. I've tried to make everything a variable, so you can play around and test in what situations there are savings and when there wouldn't be. 
2. I am not recommending that anyone rush out and buy and home for fear of rates increasing. Although it looks like rates can only head up, it's still a gamble. 
3. The model assumes PMI is cancelled when the loan reaches 80% of purchase value. In the real world, you are required to prove that with an appraisal. If the house rapidly appreciated then you could do this even before the loan value reached below 80%. On the hand, if prices collapse, you're stuck with PMI for even longer.
4. In terms of the time value of money, dollars today are worth more than dollars tomorrow, so there is an additional advantage in delaying cash outlays. 

Buying is likely the largest purchase anyone will make, so time and careful consideration are needed. I just want people to realize that you can use PMI to your advantage.",finance,1375751062
investing,What is the end game with the Fed raising interest rates?,"It seems like every month there is a run up to when Bernanke speaks and talks about what they decided at the latest Federal Reserve meetings.  If the market gets wind that they are going to continue their bond buying program and keep interest rates low, the market goes up, and if there is any inkling that they will ramp this practice down and slowly raise interest rates, everything goes crazy and the market usually goes south for a little while.

I understand the concept of why this happens, because if interest rates go up, then bonds become more attractive compared to stocks, everyone cashes out and buys bonds, etc (although i'm still a tad confused, because it seems like the only reason they will do this is if the economy is doing well, so I wouldn't expect as precipitous of a drop as seems to be imminent).  What I'm a little uncertain about is how to position myself to have successful investments when this eventually happens.  Most of my money is invested in index fund ETFs, and I don't usually do anything too fancy and tend to prefer to wait things out rather than make rash decisions, but I also want to make sure I stay ahead of the curve here.

So my question is: what should I expect for when all of this eventually goes down, and is there anything I should be doing now to prepare myself for it?  I don't really plan on trying to time the market, I'm mostly searching for how this impacts me big picture.",finance,1375750124

personalfinance,Taking out a 401k loan?,"I am in a pinch with unexpected car repairs, vet bills, and the fact that I've been working 4 years without a raise at a job that I bust my ass for. I have $200 in my bank account, and my half of rent is due soon, and my next paycheck isn't until next Friday and I need $450 to make rent and a little more to get food for my diabetic dog (special and expensive food). I was looking into taking out a loan from my 401K since I have bad credit due to a hospital bill I couldn't pay off a year ago, so no bank is willing to help. I don't have credit cards, and my paychecks are barely enough to pay rent, gas, and bills; can't remember the last time I went grocery shopping for my own food.

The minimum amount to take out of 401K is $1000 and with an interest rate of 5.25 bi weekly adding up to an extra $20 taken out of my paycheck over the course of 24 months. Taking out this loan scares me, but being 30 years old I feel like a bit of an ass calling up my parents asking for money because I can't pay rent.

My question is, is this a good idea? Do I have any other option other than taking out 401K loan? I feel I have no where else to get money from.

I don't have any of my financial aid money leftover from last semester since I used it for school and payed some of my FA with the remainder of the money.

personalfinance,Tuition Reimbursement question.,"So I'm going into my senior year of college and have 3 semesters left till I graduate.  For this last spring semester I applied for tuition reimbursement from my work (Why I haven't thought to do this before I don't know.  I'm a stupid college kid ok).  I got it and got 3,000 dollars.  This also automatically qualifies me for 3,000 for this year's tuition and 3,000 for my last semester.  So in total I'll get 9k from tuition reimbursement for school by the time I graduate.  

Of course my plan at first was to just put this 3,000 dollars towards my student loans, since it's tuition reimbursement after all.  However my work doesn't require me to show how the money is spent.  So now I'm curious as to if this really is the best thing to do with this money since my student loan debt is the lowest interest of the little debt I do have.  So this is where I turn to you guys for advice.  What would be the best thing to do with this extra money?

I make around 40k a year in a very stable healthcare job.  Currently putting 3% into a 403b with employer match.

Have 1,000 dollars in savings, I have been trying to aggressively pay down debt since finding this sub, but want a little buffer.

**Debt:**

Student loans:

* $3,500 Principle in Subsidized loans (3.4%)

* $19,026.15 Principle in Unsubsidized loans (6.8%)

* $2,300 in accrued interest 

* $24,826 Total Student Loan Debt

Credit Card:

* $1,800 at 14.9% interest

Auto Loan:

* $7,000 at 8.6% interest

Again my original thought was just to put everything towards school loans, but now I'm questioning if it would be more beneficial to pay off the credit card and then put the left over 1,200 towards student loans or the car, since those are higher interest rates.  I'm in deferment right now since I'm in school, so I don't HAVE to pay anything towards them.  Even if I did put the money towards the student loans, We are on track with our current budget to have the credit card and car paid off within 8 months. (car will be paid off 2 years early from it's loan term, thank you education credits on tax returns).  

I also know that I would get some tax advantage for paying off all that interest on the student loans.  Does anyone know how much of a tax break it would be?  

So any advice?  Should I just go ahead and throw the whole 3k at student loans, or should I try and put it towards some of the higher interest debt?",finance,1375907461

personalfinance,22 YO in need of advice. I think I'm getting screwed.,"Throwaway account, but I need some advice from those with more experience, as I feel like I am getting screwed from bad advice from my financial advisor.

Background info: My father had money in a Janus account that was in my name, which I took out for college (4k dollars). I had leftover money and decided I wanted to invest it somewhere. I didn't want to have it sit in a savings account making nothing, so my father asked his financial advisor at Edward Jones what to do, and of course he suggested putting it in an Edward Jones account, so I did. This was around 2008, during the financial collapse, and so the money was invested into an MFS bond account (MFIOX). A few years later (about a year ago), and that bond account has done very well for me. However, because of interest rates being so low, the bond account has stagnated and dropped a bit. At that point, I asked the financial advisor what to do, and he suggested moving most of it to MFS Value fund (MEIAX), so I did. And now I am here. I've invested more into the value fund and recently invested into the New Discovery Value fund (NDVAX). 

Altogether, I have about $10,000 invested in Edward Jones, but I've been reading around and thinking that MFS is screwing me on sales fees and expense ratios. I'm trying to understand how the sales fees and expense ratios work. I was told that there is a 5.75% sales charge when buying the funds, and that is all I get charged, but I have a feeling that is not true. Can anyone help me understand how much I'm being charged, and if I should move my money into a Vanguard account and ditch Edward Jones altogether?

Bitcoin,Idea for a new crypto: Is this different from PPc?,"I have an idea for a new crypto, one more tailored to loans and spending(similar to the modern dollar, minus the mystery of the fed).  One that has an inflationary self regulated model of mining. It would have to start as limited and deflationary to boost initial value though.  

Mining rate would dynamically change(based on an open algorithm) to control the value to prevent bubbles.  Specifically to prevent value from skyrocketing when a very wealthy person(s) or group buys in. 

Similarly mining rewards rate would slow when price starts to drop or when inflation slows. 

This would limit the wild swings and instill business and consumer confidence. 

There is a major flaw in bitcoin. Let's say you had a 10k btc home loan,  and the price of btc doubles.  You now essentially are underwater with a 20k btc loan with only 10k btc value. 

Similarly, if you saved and bought a house for 10k btc and price doubled, you again have a 10k btc home for the equivalent 20k btc cost.

personalfinance,What to do when I get back too big a tax refund? (Canada),"Hi!

So here's the story in a nutshell. I did just did my 2011 and 2012 taxes a few weeks ago. Did them both through H&amp;R Block. While doing them, H&amp;R discovered that I has an unused/unclaimed tax credit thing from when I was going to university for tuition paid. (I forget it's actual name, I don't have the forms beside me).

I has H&amp;R claim that on my 2012 return, so that I could get part of the larger refund back right away. I ended up getting back close to $2500 instead of just like $500, so that was awesome :)

However yesterday I opened my mail, and I got the federal refund for 2011. However in their ""report"", they said they changed the amount for the tuition tax credit (sorry, once again don't have the exact name with me) from 0, to the same amount that I claimed on the 2012 tax return. The refund is $2800 instead of $600! 

Now, I have to double check (not at home now), but I remember getting a mail from H&amp;R Block, basically saying that they got the money from 2012 that they were owed from the Federal Gov (Since they gave it to me) and that everything is good.

So, it looks like through no fault of my own, I ""claimed"" that credit twice. Now I have a check for $2800 in my hand, which brings me to my questions. :)

1) Am I legaly obligated to inform them of their error?
2) Do you think they'll catch their error on their own? If so, any guesses as to how long that would take? 
3) If I cash the check, what issues can I have if they realize their error? I'm assuming I have to pay it back, which I wouldn't mind. If I cash it, it's basically going to go to pay down credit cards. I'd save the interest on my cards the time it takes them to figure it out.
4) Any other ideas/comments on the situation?

People then turn to gold and silver, the time-tested assets that can store and amplify wealth during such tumultuous times. Demand for physical gold is on the rise not only in Asian countries culturally close to gold, but also in the U.S., Russia, and the Middle East.

If the fundamentals for gold are so strong, it should appreciate, not fall as it has recently. Obviously, there are powerful forces that distort the foundational forces of demand and supply to create a colossal contradiction.

Manufactured Consent

In the first quarter of 2013, the net demand for gold fell to 963 tons valued at $50.5 billion. This represented a 13% decline in terms of tonnage and 16% in terms of value as compared to corresponding statistics of Q1 2012. The decline was mainly on account of outflows from gold exchange traded funds (ETF).

Also noted was a shift of institutional investors from gold ETFs to physical gold. While this outflow represented only 7% of the total gold ETF holdings in Q1 2013, developments in the stock market exert a more-than-commensurate influence on market sentiment and, therefore, on prices.

Central banks hold an average 15% of their reserve assets in gold. This average climbs to 40% for developed nations that were on a gold standard before and are aware of the merits of the golden inventory. Developing nations maintain only 5% of their reserve wealth as gold.

Instead of letting this gold sit idle, central banks lease it to bullion banks at 0.25% – 0.5% a year that either sell this gold or use it as collateral. The proceeds are usually invested into securities yielding 5%-9% returns. Such sales depress the price of gold.

Rehypothecation results when an asset belonging to one party is used as collateral by another entity for availing credit. These parties may be related as borrower-lender or as lessee (user) – lessor (owner). The same asset serves as collateral for more than one credit transaction. In case of a foreclosure, total recovery is impossible.

Between 1979 and 2009, central banks were net sellers of gold. Progressive depreciation of paper currencies made central banks reverse this and turn into net buyers of gold in 2010. They purchased 457 tons in 2011 and 533 tons in 2012.

Most of world’s reserve gold is held with Federal Reserve and the Bank of England because these were the clearing houses during the gold standard era. August 17, 2011 saw Venezuela demand a return of the 99 tons of gold that it held at the Bank of England. This spiked gold prices.

Then, on January 14, 2013 the German central bank announced plans to retrieve 350 tons of gold from Paris and 300 tons from the Fed. Two days later, they announced a seven year time-table for the implementation of this transfer, a clear indication of rehypothecation precluding immediate retrieval.

Bullion banks cannot immediately purchase such huge amounts of gold to return to the central banks, for prices will shoot up and make these purchases un-affordably expensive. Therefore, they sold gold ETFs and redeemed them for physical gold. Falling prices force small investors and margin traders to sell causing further depreciation.

For the Smart Investor

It is no coincidence that gold prices started falling from mid-January 2013 onwards. These banks will pick up gold when it hits bottom. Then, prices will shoot up. As a proactive investor who can see through this wily game, you can go against the tide and start investment in physical gold and silver.",finance,1375872118
investing,What is the downward risk for custodian banks?,"Here is how I view custodian banks (example: Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, BNYMC):

Company X gives 1B$ to BNYMC to invest and profit is returned to X every month. BNYMC takes 1% cut from the profit. With interest rates on their investments (bonds) for example 1%, BNYMC makes an annual profit of 100k$. Interest rates rise to 2%, profit on new bonds is 200$k. As long as the investing companies do not prematurely take out their money, there is no net loss. In any case, BNYMC propably won't chip in on losses. Hence, with rising interest rates, profit for BNYMC can go up with little downside risk. Still with me? Please, would like your insight!",finance,1375868426
economy,Just how does the Federal Reserve Bank work?,"I'm wondering if someone can explain exactly how the Federal Reserve system works? I've been reading some articles lately that show the Federal Reserve on the hook for $9 trillion basically by printing money to buy toxic assets. Now their balance sheets are not adding up. I've been trying to understand how this works but a lot of it doesn't make sense to me. 


Let me explain how I understand it and perhaps you can correct me if I am wrong. 


The Federal Reserve should be thought of as a bank separate from the Federal Government. Normally, it deals in loans to other banks and to the government. It starts out with some reserves, but then would basically leverage those reserves and make profit from the interest it receives. Also, it can buy US treasuries as a way to control interest rates in times when the economy is down.  

To print money, all it needs to do is increase the ratio of the monetary supply to the actual reserves through the fractional reserve system. If the Federal Reserve over leverages its money, its own risk goes up should it need the money, or if the money is released into the economy thru the banks, inflation will occur, devaluing its own reserves.

During the financial crisis, it took the rather unprecedented move to instead buy toxic assets which it had never done before. It printed money out of thin air and traded it for real assets, houses, buildings etc, but at a price higher then market value, that allowed banks to stay afloat. Basically a gift to the banks, but they didn't care because now they had real assets. 

So I guess my question is, what is to keep the Federal Reserve from increasing its risks further? Couldn't it print say $100 trillion if it wanted to? That would devalue the dollar, and its own assets, but disproportionately to the rest of the economy. We might see hyper-inflation and the dollar might drop but the Reserve would own real assets and be sheltered from the losses, assuming there is intrinsic value to those assets. If it starts with say $1 trillion and prints $100 trillion it has leveraged itself 100 to 1. Since the economy is so large, say $100 trillion for simplicity, it absorbs much of this and may only be devalued by say factor of 50%. So by this simple math, We started with $100 trillion, we printed $100 trillion, we know have $200 trillion but value of dollar just dropped 50%. Wealth has not really been generated by printing money but now we have more dollars floating around that are worth less. People holding cash loose their wealth, but people holding real assets don't because those assets are valued according to the market which simply readjusts to new money supply. 

In a sense, every person with a savings account would be paying the bill instead of the people who printed the money in the first place. If we used this technique to pay off our debt, we could completely wipe out our debt, but we would end up with inflation. Other countries would probably dump the dollar, but that would only amount to say $3 trillion (China ($1.1), Japan ($1.0), and US Bonds ($1.1)) so be completely absorbed by the new money. This would be in fact a way to pay off our debt and to artificially build wealth at the expense of people through hyper-inflation. Most people wouldn't even realize what happened until its too late! 

Perhaps $100 trillion would be too much. They would worry that they could get caught and go to jail, or cause a rebellion that would overthrow the government. Maybe $9 trillion is the amount they deemed okay, like the amount they thought they could get away with. Also, if they could convince banks to hold onto the money instead of releasing it right away, they would effectively control the rate of inflation. Now they are just hoping nobody notices.

I am sounding like a conspiracy nut. Please tell me why I am wrong. I just feel like this can't be the case. There would be a checks and balances in the system to keep this kind of thing from happening, right? Something just doesn't add up here. Wealth cannot be generated from nothing. Everything needs to balance out somehow. Or is this not true in a fractional reserve system? It is hard to imagine our money working this way.  

If this is true, how much inflation can we expect from $9 trillion being injected into the economy? Would it be ~50% based on GDP, or would it be less? This just seems like a big game of musical chairs and the music is about to stop!

personalfinance,My credit card company isn't reporting to the credit bureaus and they are failing to fix it. What do I do?,"I have a credit card through CitiBank. I fell on hard times a few years back and went over my balance. Since then, the information about that card has not been reported to the bureaus by CitiBank. In one of the three bureaus' records, it's stuck on that overdue balance with no updates, while the other two declared the account closed eventually. This is not the case, and it's hurting my credit record and score. Especially since it is my only credit card.

I have contacted CitiBank about this multiple times and multiple ways -- by letter, by email, by phone. Every time they say, ""Oh, sorry! We'll fix that. Give it 30 days to show up."" And it never does. Last time, the customer service representative asked me for a phone number so that they could contact me from their end, but I am currently overseas and they can't call overseas numbers.

I am at the end of my patience. What should I do next? Is there something I can say/send to them to make absolutely SURE that they get it fixed ASAP?

I'm ready to find out who regulates these things and report them, but I don't know who to contact. The federal reserve? Is being in Japan going to make this harder?

Alternately, since I'm just past a month since the last time I called and two of the credit bureaus have decided the account must be closed since they have received no information on it in so long... is there a possibility that it will take longer than 30 days, if this last time was successful?

personalfinance,Need Help Understanding Interest on a Car Loan,"I'm a little confused on how my car loan works, particularly regarding how it calculates interest.  Background info: It's a simple interest loan, 4.24% interest rate, with original term of 60 months (maturity date is Jan 2018).  The original amount financed was ~$12200.  Each monthly payment was calculated to be $225.64.

For the first two payments, I made payments of $700 with the intent that anything over $225.64 was going to be applied to the principal.  However, I noticed that suddenly my ""next payment due"" date had moved forward several months (to the point where I didn't have a payment due for 5 more months.  From that point on, I decided to do ""principal only"" payments until my next actual payment was due.  My thought process was that I'd get the principal down significantly to where I don't have to worry about as much interest charges.

Well...recently I made that first payment after the few months of no payment due.  I made a payment of $225.64 and then did a principal only payment of $574.36 (total of $800).  Only to find out that, $168.31 of my $225.64 payment went towards interest! I was expecting my interest to be less than my previous amounts, instead it's 5+ times as much.  Anyone have any idea what happened?  And what can I do to minimize the amount of money that goes to interest? Paying principal only doesn't seem to have worked the way I intended.

personalfinance,"Husband and I just got ~$20,000 inheritance. Is this a good plan for it? (I read the topic in the FAQ)","My husband and I recently got about $20,000 in inheritance from a family member. I read the topic in the FAQ related to this situation, but it didn't seem quite detailed enough for me.

Here is our basic situation:

DEBT

* Car payment ($250/month, about $10,000 left in the loan). 

EXPENSES

* Basic living stuff: food, clothes, cleaning supplies, etc.

* Our dog: his food, toys, vet visits, etc.

We don't pay rent, and we have no student loans or outstanding credit card debt (we pay it off each month). We got a really bad interest rate (like 7 freaking %) on our car loan because we had insufficient credit to get anything better. On top of the bad interest rate, it's a secured loan, but we can refinance in September and have a normal auto loan. 

Here are some ideas I had for the new money:

* Have our emergency fund totally set up! I make a little over $2,000 a month, so we'd need about $6,000 to have our 3 months of expenses. We could just have it right now!

* Pay off the car loan at least partially or in full. Should we pay off our entire car loan and be completely debt-free, or should we refinance and keep making payments for a while? We definitely need to build our credit more so we can get a good rate on a house when the time comes (hopefully in about 2 years from now)? Or should we just pay it off all the way and get a good credit card (we're thinking a Capitol One card with some travel rewards) to build our credit more?

* Set up a small emergency fund for our dog in case he needs an expensive trip to the vet. Up 'til now we've just pulled from our savings for his stuff, but I would really like him to have his own money so we can for sure pay for something he needs.

* Start saving for a cool trip we can take when my husband graduates in about 1.5 years.

* Start saving for a new car/an emergency repair on our current car. The idea here would be to save the money until we have to buy a new car, not to buy one as soon as we have money for it. I'm thinking if we pay our loan off, we could just make a ""pretend"" payment to our savings, since we're used to paying it anyway?

And that's all the ideas I have. Should we consider investing some of it? Putting some in a CD of some kind? We have a good chunk put away for a house already, but we don't really have a formal savings plan for anything else, even our general savings. We're going to have a sit-down soon to talk about our finances, and I thought we could use your ideas.  :)

personalfinance,(Almost) Everything You Need To Know About Your 401k Plan,"You learn something new everyday.

I thought I'd explain a little about what I learned, and also ask you guys for additional tips you might have.  Also, if you happen to know what's similar/different between 401k plans and 403b, TSP, or whatever 401k-like stuff is out there, please share in the comments.

I'm a lazy index-investor who hopes to retire very early on a pretty frugal lifestyle of ~$50k.  I married, single income, with 3 kids.  I think a lot of this info applies to a lot of people, but if you're not exactly in my situation, you might have to adjust/adapt a bit.

**tl;dr - Sorry I'm so long-winded.  I've put all the important stuff in bold.**

**EDIT** - I have been corrected on a substantial point (that doesn't happen to affect me much, but completely alters some of what I originally stated below).  I haven't confirmed the correction, but it makes total sense, so I'm pretty sure I was indeed wrong about after-tax earnings being tax-free during a rollover.  Sorry about that.

What Makes a Good 401k?
-------------------------
There are two kinds of 401k's.  The first kind, which was by far the most common kind until recently, offers 10 or 20 mutual fund choices, none of which are index funds, and all of which have expense ratios in the .8% to 2.5% range.  The second kind, which is becoming more common every day, offers all those same lousy options, plus 4 or 5 index funds with expense ratios that are as good as you can get at Vanguard, and sometimes even better (because they are institutional shares).  **Low-cost index funds are a sign of a good 401k plan.**

The second factor to look at is your employer match.  It is not uncommon for employers to match 50% of contributions up to 7% of pay, or 100% of contributions up to 5% of pay, or some other arrangement like that.  **The employer match is free money, which is a sign of a good 401k plan.**  Even if your plan has lousy mutual funds with high expense ratios, the employer match might make it a better deal than investing in an IRA or a taxable brokerage account.  And remember, since you can roll the 401k funds into an IRA with low-cost index funds as soon as you leave the company (if not sooner), you won't be stuck with those high ERs forever.

Third, look at what kinds of contributions you can make to the 401k.  Every 401k plan offers ""Traditional"" contributions, which are tax deductible now, but are treated (along with their earnings) as ordinary income in retirement, just like a Traditional IRA.  Many 401k plans now allow Roth-style contributions, which are not tax-deductible, but are completely tax-free in retirement.  The question of whether **Roth or Traditional** is better depends on your particular situation, and is treated in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq#wiki_roth_or_traditional.3F).  Many online sites make blanket recommendations that young people should do Roth, but it's not such a simple decision.  RedRedditRabbit explained many of the advantages of Traditional in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/18zgci/us_lets_talk_retirement_taxes_fees_and_penalties/) a while back.

In addition to Traditional and Roth contributions, some plans also allow ""after-tax"" contributions.  While these are similar to Roth in the sense that they are not tax-deductible, they have different tax treatment.  The biggest difference between Roth and after-tax contributions is that while the total of your Traditional and Roth contributions cannot exceed $17,500 in 2013, after-tax contributions have a different limit.  Specifically, the total of all 401k contributions (Traditional, Roth, after-tax, *and* employer match) can be as high as $51,000 in 2013.  After-tax contributions can be rolled into a Roth IRA with no penalty or tax owed, and it is generally easier to withdraw after-tax contributions and their earnings before retirement.  **Plans that offer all three kinds of contributions offer flexibility that can help you optimize your taxes.**

Finally, look at whether your employer allows in-service withdrawals.  I have no sense of how common this is.  My employer offers it for certain kinds of contributions, but they don't make it obvious and I've never met another employee here who knew about it.  In-service withdrawals let you roll some of the money from your 401k plan into an IRA while you're still employed.  For example, I can't withdraw my Traditional or Roth contributions or their earnings, but I can withdraw my employer's contributions and earnings (on which I would owe tax unless I roll it into a Traditional IRA) and my after-tax contributions (on which I would owe no tax since I already paid tax) and their earnings (on which I would owe tax, unless I roll them into a Roth IRA).  **In-service withdrawals are especially nice if your plan has high ERs.**

Getting the Most from Your 401k Plan
------------------------------------
The first step to getting the most from your plan is to read your benefits information or call someone in HR and find out about your plan, and in particular the four areas described above.  Once you know the ERs, employer match, contribution options, and withdrawal options, you'll need to pick investment options.  Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* **Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match.** I've run numbers for 5 or 6 people who thought they had *really* bad options (ERs as high as 3.5%) but all of them came out better getting the match than investing in an IRA.  You might be the exception, but you probably aren't.
* **Low expense ratios are the single best predictor of fund performance.**  Resist the urge to compare funds based on past performance, especially if your plan offers many similar funds.  In any group of 10 random equity funds, one will have performed best over the last 5 or 10 years, but that doesn't mean the same one will perform best over the next 5 or 10 years.  Look for funds with low expense ratios.  Less than .2% is good, less than .1% is great.
* **Index funds are usually better than managed funds.**  Even if the ERs are the same (which is unlikely--index funds are usually much cheaper), index funds usually offer better diversification and a more disciplined strategy than actively managed funds.  You won't see as much growth during a bubble, but you also won't see as much of a loss when it bursts.
* **Apply your asset allocation to your whole portfolio, not each account individually.** What this really means is, if your 401k offers a US large-cap equity index fund with a good expense ratio, but all of its bond funds have high ERs, then you should hold all of your bonds in your IRAs and only large-cap US equities in your 401k.  If you are just starting out and don't have enough money in each account to do this perfectly, at least keep in mind that it's OK to be all-bonds in one account with a good bond fund and all-equity in another account with good equity funds.

Some Tricks for Early Retirement Planning
-----------------------------------------
This section might not be as generally applicable, but I thought I'd share my thoughts anyway.  Maybe you can tell me what I'm doing wrong, or maybe you'll realize early retirement isn't as hard as it sometimes seems.  

The main concern I have with early retirement is ensuring I have enough accessible money to last me from when I stop working for money until age 60 when I can get at my IRAs.  If you are retiring ""just a little early"" at age 55 or so, it's not too hard to keep enough money in taxable accounts to cover your expenses for a few years, and that's really the best option.  If you want to retire in your 30s or 40s though, you might consider giving up some employer match because that money would be ""locked up"" and you'll need as much as you can get in taxable accounts.  Fortunately, current tax law is full of ""loopholes"" that can make early retirement an option without giving up tax-advantages of IRAs and 401k.

The fundamental concept I plan on taking advantage of is that Roth *contributions* can be withdrawn penalty-free and tax-free at any time.  Only their earnings are locked up until age 60.  With a little planning, this can even be exploited by people for whom Traditional-style retirement accounts offer a greater tax advantage (which includes most frugal early retirees).

**Roth Conversions**

I live in upstate NY, so in addition to federal income taxes, I pay over 5% in state income taxes.  Once I stop working, I may move to a state with lower income tax.  Since I'll spend the first 20 or 25 years of ""retirement"" with no pension or Social Security income, the federal tax rate on $50k of Traditional distributions would be much less than my current marginal rate of 15%, since so much of it will be tax free (at least $10k of deductions and $19k of exemptions) and most of the rest will be taxed at 10% (currently around $17k).  But if I save in Traditional-style accounts, either 401k or Traditional IRAs, I can't get the money until age 60 (55 from the 401k if I don't roll it over).  The trick I plan on using is to convert about $50k of my Traditional savings to Roth each year, starting the year I retire.  I'll owe tax on that $50k, but the whole $50k will count as a Roth contribution, meaning I can pull it out of the Roth IRA before age 60.  Now, in the case of conversion, I have to wait 5 years after the conversion in order to pull out the contribution, so **I need enough accessible savings to last me 5 years.**  Until today, I thought this would be mostly taxable savings, but also some Roth IRA contributions.  It turns out, I have an even better option available to me.

**After-tax 401k Contributions**

**EDIT**- After-tax *contributions* can be rolled into a Roth tax-free, but not their earnings.  Since I have in-service withdrawals available to me, I can just rollover the contributions each month/year before there are any significant earnings.  However, this means only the actual contributions can be withdrawn before age 60, so I might go back to plan A with the traditional conversion to Roth.

This is the thing that I just found out about today, so forgive my enthusiasm and relative ignorance [surprise: I was wrong, see above].  But it's great, because it is a huge increase to the contribution limits for Roth-style retirement accounts.  Basically, you take all the money you would have saved in a taxable account, and instead you make after-tax contributions to the 401k plan.  When you retire, you rollover all of those contributions ~~and their earnings~~ into your Roth IRA.  There is no tax or penalty at this point, and the entire amount counts as a contribution to the Roth.  ~~So if you contribute $30k after-tax to the 401k, it grows to $50k, and you rollover the $50k, you can get the whole $50k immediately.  This is better than taxable investing because you don't owe tax on any interest or capital gains like you would in a taxable account.~~  [corrected: If you are in a low tax bracket in early retirement, rolling the earnings on after-tax contributions into a Roth IRA may cheaper than paying the eventual capital gains, but under current tax law, if you are in a low tax bracket, capital gains aren't taxed, so this section is not nearly as excited as I thought.]*

computers,Shipping a Gaming PC UK &gt; Canada,"So I'm going to be moving from the UK to Canada next month and I'm looking at getting my gaming computer shipped through FedEx. Never done anything like this before so I'm just hoping to get advice from anyone else that's done anything similar with their computers or people that know about shipping internationally in general!

I'm planning to take the GPU out and put it in its original box, then package that up with the PC into bigger packaging that it originally shipped to me in. So much bubblewrap will be involved. I'll also be pulling out the HDD and put that in my personal carry-on when I fly over. Does anyone recommend that I also do this with the SSD or other parts? I'll be buying a new monitor when I get to Canada. Does anyone know whether I'll have to pay any customs duty on this? The PC cost £1400 so I know that I'll have to get extra insurance on it.

personalfinance,Responsible withdrawing from a newly accessible trust,"A little bit of background first:

30 years old, condo owner in a big city. Got an amazing deal in an attractive neighborhood when I bought and managed to pay it off quick thanks to a then very lucrative job. I figured better to pay it off quickly and sacrifice some financial flexibility in the short term. Since then my career has basically nosedived (go figure). The company I work for folded, and I returned to an old, low paying job for a firm I previously worked for, and which I loathe. I'm currently on the job market but having trouble like many people out there.

Now the financial issue

I recently was told that as of my 30th birthday I have access to two trust funds. I'm not exceedingly thrifty, but I've also never been a big spender. Upon hearing this news, my thought process has not been ""now I can buy x, y, or z,"" rather it has been: 

""How to go about responsibly accessing funds from said trusts to ensure financial stability in the future.""

I think at the heart of it is due to my current employment situation, I will soon need some form of monthly withdrawal to ensure I can pay my bills and maintain a not particularly extravagant lifestyle until I can find a new, better paying job.

I want to ensure that if I go down that path, I am not overdoing things.  I've never been great when it comes to numbers, but perhaps there is some form of formula I can plug #s into that take into account multiple factors (starting total, rate of withdrawal, market factors, interest rates, etc) and shows how long funds will last at different withdrawal rates?

Any help would be appreciated, and I apologize if this is a bit rambling, this is all quite new to me!",finance,1375987433

personalfinance,"26yo grad student with $65k debts and $168k assets, need advice on asset allocation (EU)","Hi everyone. I'm a quite risk-tolerant (single) grad student in Europe, graduating with a Masters degree in Engineering next year. I have no income at the moment, but expect to earn at least $76k/year once I graduate. I want to to save a lot of money and invest my net worth so as to allow a high probability of early retirement.

I have a monthly budget of $1850, which is slightly below the average for my age and marriage status. This isn't my main focus, since I'm pretty sure I have my expenses in check. I drive a 1996 Honda Civic which I bought cash for $3400, if that is relevant. The car is not necessary for my daily routine, and I only use it when public transport is impractical. My country is expensive. I walk to university every day. I don't bike, since 8 months of the year it would be through snow and hail.

**Debts:**

* $65k publicly subsidized student loans, with no interest accumulation until I graduate. Thereafter 2.6% annual (variable) interest. Nominal payoff time is 25 years.

**Assets:**

* $11k in a savings account, at 3.4% annual interest. This will supplement my student loans to pay my living expenses until I graduate. Doubles as an emergency fund.
* $21k in a tax-advantaged home savings account, at 5.1% annual interest. This money is untouchable. Annual deposits are limited to $3k/year.

* $46k in two actively managed, global stock market funds with a 2.5% annual performance fee, in addition to 20% of all gains above the index. They have been tracking the world index very closely for the last 5 years, after fees. Half of this money is capital gains, which would be taxed at 30% if I sold them.
* $8k in low-fee stock market index funds, tracking my country's benchmark index
* $2k 3D printer stocks, a remnant of a larger amount which I sold some months ago
* $80k in Tesla Motors stock. This started out as $16k which I speculatively purchased in Oct-March, all of which I could afford to lose. The intention was to hold it for 10 years and see if this company would grow into a large global automaker. It's appreciated a bit since then.

**The future:**

When I start working, my plan is to put 100% of my savings into a low-fee global index fund. Optionally, depending on the interest rate climate, I would put 10-20% in a savings account instead. I would also leave the option of putting smaller amounts (~$15k) into individual stocks if I found a particular company that seems especially promising. I am not buying bonds in today's interest rate climate, but this could be an option if the outlook changes. I hope to save more than 50% of my net income. I have no plans to purchase a home. Rent is $730/month, about half the average for my age.

**Other notes:**

Current inflation is at 1.2%. All profits from capital gains are taxed at 30%.

personalfinance,"What is best?: Prioritizing Debt, House, or Retirement?","I've been getting into a discussion with my brother about my financial gameplan.  Right now, here are the highlights:

* Student loans: about 25k, half 6.8%, half 3.6%. 350/month
* Car: 12k, 350/month, 1.9% over 36 months
* Rent: 650/month
* Other Bills: ~$250/month (notwithstanding fuel or groceries)
* We put ~150/month in a ROTH, plus we both have a small employer match 401.  
* We have ~$2,000 in emergency savings (which is growin...my wife's new and better paying job only started    two weeks ago)
* no kids, plan is to begin that in 4-5 years.
* Income: double income, ~4500/month on the low end (no overtime)

My plan was to prioritize buying a house (to get rid of rent).  My rationale: interest rates in OK are rising, and .5% increase over 30 years can be about 20k (~150k house).  Moreover, that's money going towards something, not rent.  Then, the money I was using to save for the house can roll into paying off the care, then the student loans, then house/retirement. We would open up a second ROTH and slowly increase the amount we put in, based on income raises/money being freed up.

He looks at the house as more of a liability than an asset.  Instead of paying ~1,000/month for a mortgage, continue to pay the measly 650/month for rent and prioritize the car.  Then do house/loans/retirement (not necessarily in that order).  His rationale: houses can be expensive and having that debt on top of a mortgage is scary to him.  It is to me, but this plan seems slightly less beneficial.

Does anyone have any advice?  Which gameplan do you think is better?

personalfinance,I have some questions about Short Sales,"So I just have some questions about Short Sales

Some back story:
I bought a condo 3.5 years ago. It was a foreclosure and a great deal. 100K, 1600+ Sq Ft. 2Bdr, 1Bth... exposed brick everywhere, pretty much completely renovated, hardwood floors, etc.

It was purchased in a downtown area of my smallish city, with the intention of reselling it a few years down the road. I figured at that price and with the city talking about renovating the downtown area, the only direction the value could go was up.

Well here I am 3.5 years later and my house has been on the market for over a year. I have the house listed at an extremely reasonable price(under 120K) and I have yet to receive even one offer. Im selling because I just hate living down here. I dont have a balcony(zero outdoor space), I pay a ridiculous amount(3k/year) in condo fees with zero amenities, I have a dog(outdoor space comes into play again), I hate dealing with the bullshit that comes with my HOA and a 100+ year old building. With it being in a historical district, I have to ask the city about anything that I want to do with the place. They wont even let us put a dumpster out back of the building and then get mad when we put the trash in the trash cans out on the street. 

Also, initially when I bought the place, due to a local grant system for first time home buyers, I had to purchase the house using a local bank. This gave me a very high(7.5% APR) interest rate AND they dont even report on your credit. Why the fuck would I acquire a mortgage, but not want my payment history recorded to the credit bureau? Not to mention, at settlement I was quoted a payment of lets say 800$/month. I had a settlement attorney, everything. So I am paying this 800$/month mortgage for about a year. July 1 comes the following year and my mortgage goes up to 897$/month. I was like wtf? Its a fixed rate mortgage and my property taxes did NOT go up. A few more months goes by and my payment goes up again to ~$940.  At this point I am furious, I go to the bank and find an explanation. It turns out, at settlement, the bank forgot to include ANY TAXES INTO MY ESCROW ACCOUNT. I dont know if this part can be dealt with through legal action, but I dont have the money for an attorney. Unfortunately, 19 year old me didnt really pay attention to any of this at the time.

Since all of this, I have been in contact with the bank to try and refinance but they are saying this is the best rate they can do(which is such bullshit, I know it is). 

Im down to my final straw... I fucking hate the thought of walking away from a home and ruining my credit/just having that on my conscience. Its not so much the credit aspect, because I dont even own a credit card and the only 2 things Ive financed are my car and my house. 

So my question is, how bad do Short Sales hurt your credit? How is it different from foreclosure/bankruptcy? 

Also - sorry, forgot this part - since my current bank does not report on my credit, I could go to another bank right now and purchase another house if I wanted to. If I were to find another house and purchase it before I finalize the possible short sale, would that in anyway effect the short sale process? 

Thanks, sorry no TLDR dont really have one.",finance,1375976825
personalfinance,PF questions for non-US redditors,"Hi, I'm from the US and curious about how things are typically done in other countries. You hear so many stories and I'd love to learn more.

1 - Home buying. How much of a down payment (%) do you typically need for a mortgage? How long are typical mortgage terms; what are typical interest rates? Is your country one that doesn't do mortgages much, if it is, is home ownership fairly common or less so? 

2 - Credit. Do you have a credit scoring system similar to the US? (ie, credit bureaus take in info from credit cards, loans, etc and calculate based on late payments, debt/income ratios, debt utilitzation ratios, etc. *Not* maintained for consumers, but for the companies who issue credit.) What are typical interest rates if a balance is carried? HOw hard is it to qualify for a card? What's a typical spending limit? In Canada, you see ""Line of Credit"" is this a credit card or attached to housing equity or something else?

3 - Taxes. So many countries have national healthcare, longer maternity/paternity leave, retirement, etc ... how much are you national taxes? In the US, we have national income tax, state income tax, local/city taxes (usually pay for schools, etc), sales tax (not VAT), property tax and employment taxes (pay for social security, medicaid, etc). There are other taxes, like inheritance taxes, but how are your taxes broken down? Do you just have one, straight national tax or do you also have state/regional, city taxes, etc. 

4 - Retirement. Do pensions still exist in your country - either national or employer? What does a pension entail? Do you feel like it covers enough so you don't have to save extra? What tax-advantaged retirement programs do you have (similar to our 401k/IRA/Roth IRA)?

5 - Bankruptcy - Do you have bankruptcy protection for individuals? If you do, what qualifies to allow a person to do it? What is forgiven and what do they have to still pay back? Is it stigmatized like in the US? 

6 - Anything you want to share! :)

We've had some bad spending habits, made a few costly mistakes, and had several life events (relocating for jobs, high healthcare costs during childbirth, etc.) that have put us deep in debt.  We're starting to make the right changes to our spending habits, and now that she's working we're able to send more than minimum payments.  I have a plan of attack that willl pay off my $36.1k of credit card debt in 24 months, with a caveat - I want to borrow from my 401k.  Here are the details:

* Credit Card 5 - $4,500   @ 9.99% - $92  
* Credit Card 6 - $12,000 @ 8.88% - $237

* Utilities $200  
* Bank Loan $229 ($8,800 @ 14%)  
* Phones $140  
* Internet $40  
* Cable $90  

Over the past 3 months, I've been spending $800 on groceries, $200 on recreation, and $400/month on restaurants (new bad habit since my wife isn't home to cook meals).  I've decided to set a goal of $800/month for these three categories, which I think is achievable and I'm on track so far this month.  

I know I've made some costly mistakes, had/have some bad spending habits I'm trying to break, but I do have a plan.  I'm going to snowball $400/month toward credit cards.  And I'm planning to borrow about $5000 from my $20k 401k to pay off the high interest cards.  

I'm interested in transferring balances from the high interest cards, but I missed a couple payments here and there when I moved 1.5 years ago (hence the penalty interest rate(s)), so I'm not sure to apply now, after I've eliminated a card or two, in a few months after my debt has gone down a bit, etc.  

I owe a couple grand more than my car is worth, but the loan is at 0% interest and I should be caught up in around a year.  I'm not sure if I'll keep it at that point since I won't have any money saved to buy a vehicle outright and will end up paying interest on any loan I took out, which I'm not willing to do.  

I've calculated that borrowing from my 401k will save me $3,400 of credit card interest and shave 7 months off my credit card payoff schedule.  Is it worth it?  I'd be paying myself 4.25% interest but I'd obviously lose out on any compounding, but that compounding probably won't be more than the $3,400 I'd save and I'd repay the loan quickly after paying off the consumer debt.  I'm considering switching jobs, so I'd have to pay it back, but I'll only go that route if I'm able to negotiate that into my signing bonus if I accept any other positions. My field is in very high demand in my area, so this could plausibly happen.

news,Economic good news gives Labour more headaches,"Source Link: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/07/economic-good-news-labour-george-osborne


Mark Carney's first assured outing as Bank of England governor will not have lifted already depressed Labour spirits. The Bank now expects GDP to rise by 0.6% in the third quarter of this year, rising to 2.6% a year in two years.


In addition, unless employment grows suddenly, he said, he did not foresee any need to raise interest rates above their current 0.5% until 2016, after the election.


If Britain is suffering from the wrong kind of growth – a debt-fuelled housing boom – voters will not have to pay the price until after the election.


To make matters worse for Labour, YouGov polling this week for the first time suggested voters were now evenly split on whether the spending cuts were the right idea. Polling produces different results according to the precise question asked, but it shows a trend towards voters accepting that austerity was the right course for George Osborne to choose.


Even on the more sophisticated left blogs, economists are asking themselves whether austerity was right. (Their answer remains no.)


Osborne himself was jubilant this week, saying the shadow cabinet had not just intellectually but physically left the pitch, deserting the political battleground for the beaches.


Labour in its defence pointed out that Carney had said this remained the slowest recovery in output on record. But Ed Balls has long recognised that growth would return at some point before the election, even if some of his advisers may be privately startled by the optimism of some of the forecasts and surveys emerging from business over the past fortnight.


Labour has long prepared to switch its focus from the lack of growth in GDP to the lack of growth in earnings. Probably a little earlier than they would have liked, it duly unveiled figures this week claiming working people will on average by 2015 have lost a total of £6,600 in real terms during David Cameron's premiership.


It is convinced that headlines or politicians pronouncing boom-boom Britain simply do not resonate with the daily experience of voters; indeed they infuriate voters angry at the boasting an out-of-touch elite.


Stan Greenberg, the American pollster working for Labour, has for instance long warned Barack Obama of the dangers of hailing an economic recovery, and indeed claims the Democrat's desperate performance in 2010 congressional elections was due to his premature efforts to point to recovery.


Recent focus groups undertaken by Greenberg's company in America show that anger has not yet dissipated. In a recent memo, based on focus-group research, he wrote: ""People believe that American jobs have been fundamentally restructured to pay less; America is producing jobs 'you can't live off'.


""This may be the biggest change in the perception of the economy and it dominates all other reactions. In the past, people talked about jobs paying 'less' as a consequence of the great recession, but this change in the character of jobs is just given.


""People are consumed by the lack of jobs that pay and the fate of the middle class, but they look right at the top when focused on the rigged political battle that favours the rich and connected. They are animated about the political inequality – the use of lobbyists and money to rig the game for those at the top.""


But he also provides – indirectly – a warning to Labour that the personal struggle with debt leads voters to expect governments to be similarly parsimonious. ""With families restructured and weighted down by debt, people remain responsive to conservative arguments on debt and spending.""


But Labour, still without an election manager, will be watching the slow drift down of its polling in recent months and worry where the Labour vote bottoms.


At the moment the Labour election war book remains without a message or an author.

Here's the story. I already have a adequate emergency fund, and fully fund my 401(k) and IRA each year. I have an extra 1k/month to put to work.   

I'm trying to figure out whether its better to invest this 1k/month, or pay down my mortgage just enough to get rid of PMI. I ran some numbers, and am looking for validation that my analysis is accurate.   
  
**Numbers**  
* Appraised home value: 215k  
* Current loan balance: 193k  
* 80% of appraised value: ~172k  
* Interest rate: 3.625%  
* PMI: $66/month  
* 30 year fixed mortgage  
  
**If I invested the $1,000, assuming 5% interest**  
* Total PMI paid: $4,315   
* Total interest paid: $123,860  
* Investment income: $53,000  
  
**If I paid an extra $1,000/month until I reach 80% equity in the home**  
* Total PMI paid: $1,128 (save $3,187)  
* Total interest paid: $96,900 (save $26,960)  
* Total saved: ~30k  
  
**Overall**, it looks like I'll come out ~20k ahead by investing rather than paying down the mortgage. What do you think? Am I missing anything here?

gaming,[Rant] So Microsoft just royally f****ed me over...,"So this is what happened...

I purchased and activated a $60 1 year gold membership in july. My cousin said he had 1 spot open in his family plan that expires in Jan 2014 and that i am welcome to join. So i did, 2 days ago, and all accounts were awarded an additional 6 months of live (half-year family plan valued at $50 of the $100). He said it was cool and that i didnt have to pay for the current family plan or even for the next renewal at June 2014. Sweet, I have gold until June 2015... but wait.

Assuming you have the family pack gold membership and youre the leader, you should have received an email from microsoft stating that your family gold accounts will be removed and converted to individual accounts ($59.99 per year) starting at **Aug. 27 2013**. Plus as a ""bonus"", each account will be awarded 3 months from the August date to enjoy live. 

Obviously im a little angry now that **they're canceling ALL family plans** at such a short notice. Its only been 2 days since i transferred my account and theyre pulling this shit. So I call up micro$oft and they tell me that the best that they can do is kick me out of the family and compensate me 3 months worth of live.  Or I can stay in the family plan and also receive the eventual bonus 3 months. They say they cant restore me back prior to the family switch because they dont have the power to do that and that they can only compensate 3 months of live because thats what their system can allow. 

NOW i'm livid. So from the original 1 year individual plan that would've ended in July 2014, i have 3 months before i pay another $60 to the cunt nuggets at greedy micro$oft. the fucked up part is that im not even getting an xbox one, which is what this whole conversion thing is all about. I just wanted cheap live to play Halo 4 and GTAV **THAT THE XBONE CANT EVEN PLAY**.

[**SOURCE**](http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/parental-controls/family-pack-convert-individual-member-faq)

**TL;DR** Micro$oft is canceling all family gold accounts and I got screwed for joining 2 days ago, since i originally had a 11 months worth of live. Now the best thing they can give me is 3 months and thats it.

personalfinance,Question regarding outstanding credit card debt balance transfer to personal loan.,"Greetings,
   I unfortunately have amassed about 8k in credit card debt @ ~14% apr. I am unable to attack this debt as completely as it requires at the moment, so my interest is building up. I wanted to ask for some opinions on doing a balance transfer to a personal loan through my bank. My large national bank can give me a 11% apr personal loan for the amount, which will help stabilize the revolving debt in the short term. 

   I know this interest rate is not fantastic, but I plan on staying on top of it and refinancing in about a year for a lower apr after I have a better grip on life situations. 
   Does this seem like a good strategy? What might be another good way to tie down this revolving debt in the short term. 

   Some additional details: I have good credit, but also have a student loan debt of 20k consolidated at a 6% rate of interest.
  
Thank you in advance.",finance,1376080783

Bitcoin,A Personal Story Illustrating Bitcoin's Usefulness,"I wanted to tell the story of my extremely frustrating day which really illustrates how useful Bitcoin can be for many situations.  I apologize for the length, but I think it just shows how frustrating a process this was.

I'm moving into a new apartment and my landlord needs money for the security deposit and rent before I move in.  This comes to just under $4,000 which she would only accept by certified check, money order, or cash.

So, not wanting to carry around that much cash, I plan to get a certified check.  There are no branches of my bank near me, so I need to take a bus to and from the branch (~1 hour travel by bus for $5).  When I get to my bank, they inform me that they do not do certified checks.  Their suggestion is that I go to a 7-Eleven and do a money order.  However, first I need to call my bank to up my daily withdraw limit to $4,000.  After calling the bank (and being put on hold), my limit is raised.

Next, I head to 7-Eleven.  They tell me that they can only do money orders in increments of $500 (~$2 fee each).  I try to use my debit card to just buy a bunch, but they only take cash.  I then head over to the ATM which I learn has a $400 limit per transaction.  Seeing that this was going to be a huge pain, I call a currency exchange a few blocks away and am told that they can do 1 money order for the full amount.

At the currency exchange, I'm again told that they only take cash for the money order, so I go to find another ATM.  This one has an $800 limit, so I stand at the machine taking out the maximum amount for 5 transactions (at $3 each).  

My pants now stuffed with $4,000 in 20s (since they don't dispense hundreds), I head back to the currency exchange.  The person counts the nearly 200 $20 bills, makes me give her my license and fill out some paperwork, I pay the $10 fee, and then I finally have my money order to give to the landlord.

A bitcoin transaction for this amount would have taken me at most 10 seconds and would have been effectively free.  Instead, I wasted about 3 hours of my day and spent $30 on the transaction.


TL;DR - I wasted money and a big chunk of my day to make a transaction which would have been effortless using Bitcon.",cryptocurrency,1376078959

personalfinance,"How spartan will you live to avoid debt, even if you are reasonably assured of a high net worth future?","In general, if you could be all but assured of a very good income in the future, but you don't have a lot of extra money now except to pay the bills, would you borrow to have a little fun? Lets assume you can get a good interest rate and you will maintain a positive net worth the whole time. 

If you want to read about why I'm asking, keep reading. If not, discuss in comments.

So I'm married, with no kids, in Canada. My wife is going to be starting med school in June of next year (she's been accepted into a 3 year program). Barring anything major, she is almost gauranteed to be making $250k/year within 15-20 years, maybe less. She has a scholarship for her tuition but will have no income for the next 4 years, I will have to pay all of the bills. 

I work at a bank. I handle smaller personal investments, loans and mortgages. I know all about these types of things and when to lend to a client, but I rarely have to handle people in situations like mine so I'm actually not that well-versed in giving advice like I'm looking for here. My job isn't to persuade people to not take debt, although I would consider myself a lot less sleazy than some people and I will advise against it if the person really shouldn't take on debt. 

I am working on earning my CFA Charter, I have 2/3 exams complete and can hopefully get the third done next year. CFA charterholders earn an average income of about $120k/year. I also may be able to move up in the near future. I've learned a LOT during this program but nothing I can really apply to myself. In business, if you can borrow money at 3% and make 4% after you've accounted for all costs, then it's a no-brainer. This isn't usually true for individuals.

Our bills aren't outrageous, we can handle them on my income alone, and I will still be contributing about half of my allowable limit to RRSPs. We own our own house and owe about 75% of the value as a mortgage. We have an emergency fund and a start on our RRSPs, and own two cars free and clear. We have no debt besides the mortgage. 

The trouble is, we have an unfurnished room upstairs, we want to enjoy our time and take a trip or two before my wife gets swamped with med school, and basically not live a totally frugal life while she's in school. This probably means taking on a bit of debt, maybe as high as $10-15k over the next few years. It will be at Prime Rate (a perk of being a bank employee) and I will continue to make RRSP contributions. Those contributions are employer-matched and earn about 7% a year so it makes no sense to discontinue them to pay for stuff like this.

I just hate debt and have a hard time looking at a balance on a line of credit. Tell me to suck it up and live cheap, or go for it and have a little fun in moderation.",finance,1376076027
personalfinance,"Conflicting advice, what would you do? Canadian student with $250k LOC @ 3%, making ~$20k/year during medical school. Where to put it?","Hopefully this isn't the dumbest of questions - I'm currently reading up on Canadian money management and I've lurked here enough to know its almost always advantageous to pay off debts first. I'm on course to use about $120k by the end of school.

Thanks for your input!

**Background**
No other debts. The LOC is 3% interest and I only have to make interest payments at the moment. This goes until one year into my practice at which point I either turn it into a loan and pay off the balance or convert it to a business loan, either way it stays at prime at that point. 


In either case I've been advised its usually wise to pay it off such a debt more slowly (not less than 2 or 3 years) due to the interest rate being low and the transfer of money from my practice (taxed as corporate) to the LOC (taxed as personal) will be costly when I could be leaning on the corporate account more (as opposed to paying off the LOC ASAP) to get my practice going and the gains from the practice would outpace the lost interest on the LOC. 


**Current situation**
Right now I'm living frugally and I have about 3 more years as a student. If I make $20k over a summer, for example, is paying off the LOC to lower the interest payments my best option? Would you recommend another type of account or investment that could out-pace the 3% over the long term? I'm OK if this requires locking something in for 3-5 years or more.

My wife and I have quite a bit of medical debt abbout 15k (before we had insurance), a few credit cards around 5k that have gone to collections a couple of years ago. And a few misc bills around 2k. We have no assets other than an 07 vehicle paid in full and a 08 dodge caravan that we bought used. My wife is sick of the van and with my crappy credit score we can't get a reasonable deal on a trade or sell it personally. I got a personal loan with the 07 as collateral. There is no way for us to pay our debts down. My wife wants to get the car she wants (25k) and surrender the 08 to reposession. I would like to keep paying the personal loan. What's the repercussions? Could be held responsible by the judge for the 08 car loan during bankruptcy? Since we went and bought a new car.    

Edit: We are going to file regardless of the car situation. We want to get the new car before we file bankruptcy with a good interest rate. I understand the morale thing is to pay the original loan and ""deal"" with it. 

Edit 2: I can respect the comments, from a different view I can understand how stupid this seems. But if were going to ""wipe our slate"" why not include the vehicle and get something were satisfied with and will be less maintenance with warranty for the same price.

Basically, my parents made too much money, and although they didn't help me pay for school AT ALL, the government denied me grants and sufficient federal loans, so I was forced to take out private loans.

I have excellent credit and haven't missed a payment on my loans, but these private loans are just killing me. I have probably paid about 15k into them and have not made a DENT.

My wife wants to to a community college in the next state that is about 45 minutes (60+ miles) away from our home. She does not want to pursue online classes for this degree and wants to be in class when available. Problem is she not currently eligible for FAFSA until her grades improve, and has minimal requirements for scholarships. Once she establishes her AS degree, she plans on transferring to a university hopefully riding on scholarships. I'm currently reviewing an idea of a loan until her FAFSA becomes available.

We have not locked in a budget for this car because we are going to take out a car loan from the local credit union back in my hometown which provides pretty low interest rates for new cars.

I have my expenses shaved down super low, however I have a loan that is $300/mo that is killing me.  It won't work with my new budget.  I cannot refinance, because I have no provable income.  It also is the type of loan that is tied to my checking with ACH withdraws.

I read all about strategic defaults, how the collection process works, how to invoke the fair debt collection rights, how your credit tanks for 7 years, etc etc.  I was just about to close my bank account and begin that process, until I realized I have more than enough credit card available balance to absorb this debt into.

What if it affects the ability to turn on utilities?  What if I get a job that for some stupid reason does a credit check?  This all makes me want to absorb my debt into my credit card(s), deal with it at a much lower monthly payment for a while, and try not to cry over the interest rate.

personalfinance,Tax Error Hell,"Back in April, I got a federal tax extension.  I prepared taxes both for myself and my girlfriend, whom I claimed as a dependent during the 2012 tax year.  So I submitted her federal return, then my federal return, then my state return.  Well, it turns that on her return I had mistakenly put that she could NOT be claimed as a dependent by anyone else.  Oops.

So we got a 1040X, filled it out, strapped it to a camel with a check for a portion of her refund, and have been waiting ever since for the 1040X to pass through the bowels of some godforsaken IRS bureaudungeon in Kentucky.  US Treasury cashed the check and their website indicates the amended return is ""processing.""  Based on their 8-12 week window, it will probably finish in August or September at the latest.

Here is the problem--my federal return was immediately rejected due to this error.  So I have been waiting for GF's 1040X to clear so I can resubmit my 1040.  But my state return was accepted, and MD sent me a refund for $380.  The state return, of course, gave me a tax break because I claimed GF as a dependent.

Today I received a letter from the comptroller of Maryland, claiming that I owe $450 in delinquent taxes.  It is the weekend, so I haven't been able to call yet, but presumably this is because they issued me a refund based on information in my federal return, which was never accepted by the IRS.

I was recently looking at some tax bracket info and realized that a significant portion of my income falls into the 25% bracket, and yet my per paycheck (federal) withholding is less than 15%. This worries me that I'm setting myself up for a giant tax bill at the end of the year.  That said, I don't know if that number includes social security and medicare, or if state taxes come into play, etc...

I also don't know if owing at the end of the year is a bad thing. I hear people say things like, ""it's just an interest free loan from Uncle Sam,"" but I also feel like Uncle Sam probably doesn't like you waiting till the end of the year to pay what you owe.

personalfinance,How do I (and my wife) address this student loan situation? (x-post from AskReddit),"In Fall of 2012, my wife and I used our school's financial aid program to each take $9,000 in federal Stafford loans to help fund the year, stretching it through three semesters and to assist with various life costs (a move, her father passing, etc). During this summer we managed to cover classes using the remainder but we were notified by the school that a decision has been made that due to student abuse (people were taking Stafford loans through the school and then dropping out, defaulting in excess numbers and driving the school into debt, as the school apparently plays middle man with its own loan taking from the government instead of me taking directly from the top), they have discontinued their federal loans program. They will accept private loans, but will no longer allow government student loans.

Doing some research on it (and bits and pieces gained from asking various outlets, to include the studentloans.gov website - which basically told me ""ask your financial aid department"" which then basically told me ""no idea, we don't allow those anymore so its on you, is there anything else we can help with?""), I found that both of our loans were sold to Salli Mae. We logged in and were originally considering using them as our backup to get this year's loan amount but I need to know if this is a safe loan to take (the name is very familiar, but I've mostly heard it in the diploma mill context of University of Phoenix and such which makes me wary) and if so, how would I go about taking more? Will this require a fresh new loan from them? Will my wife and I have to just accept that the previous loan was closed off early and a new loan will require a completely new promisary note?

She attempted to fill out that information a couple of nights ago to see what would be offered and it required a co-signer for each of us as well as family information, which the previous loan did not require and is a bit of a difficult issue for both of us, one that I'd prefer avoiding if possible (I do not receive any financial assistance from my family).

What advice could one offer in this situation so that we may attend fall classes?

Updated response to a comment in the other thread, for more information:

Thanks for the update. To give further info on the school situation (and what they told my former assistant manager at my job, who worked in the financial aid department as a side job - though I'm in no way using this as weight towards their claim either), they specifically said that the system they used was where they take the loan out from the government, then the student's take the loans from them (which was not what I understood this to be originally, I wasn't aware we used a middle man system). The situation they claimed to have encountered with so many students frauding by dropping out and then defaulting has supposedly put them horrendously in debt.

Here is a copy paste of what their pdf announcing this said: ""As you may have recently heard, Augusta Technical College made the decision to suspend their Direct Loan Program. However, there has been a variety of speculations surrounding why this decision was made. To help clarify our reasoning, the College has prepared the following statement: In August 2011, we began the Direct Loan Program to defray the costs incurred with changes in the HOPE Program. Within the first year, we began to see signs that the funds were not being used as originally intended. After Fall Term 2012, we reviewed our Direct Loan status. It was determined that Augusta Tech had incurred debt resulting in the withdrawal of students participating in the Direct Loan Program. The accumulated debt had a negative effect on our funding sources compared to previous years. The debt for 2012-2013 financial aid year totaled $733,000. A decision was then made to suspend the Direct Loan Program for the 2013-2014 year. We understand this may cause hardship to those students who were using the Direct Loan Program to finance their education. To protect the college’s financial stability, and the ability to award financial aid funds to eligible students, we have decided to discontinue the Direct Loan Program"".

Also, for more information, the school is not a for-profit school and is part of the university system (although it is primarily used for Associate Degrees, nursing core classes, and GEDs - of those, I am going for my Associate's in Computer Programming as it is a field that values experience and actual known languages more than how long you were in school, although you need a degree to show you've at least complete core classes in program design and have some languages under your belt. My wife is in for culinary arts, which it is actually known for a pretty decent program and there isn't an alternative in our city for that degree. That said, the school has been trying to expand the size of their campus over the past decade (I first attempted to go back in '03 but dropped due to a move and a number of other issues) with newer buildings and upgrading things, but in exchange for not giving their teachers raises for quite a few years (a big complaint I've heard from them) as well as expecting them to take on more loads in the classes department. Due to such decisions, it takes them forever to process financial aid and applications - no, seriously, for classes in August you have to have your FAFSA submitted by March 1 or they will not process your PELL. I can't get HOPE Scholarship due to my age now, and PELL doesn't offer us relatively anything due to my wife working in a call center making decent money about two years ago (which still shows up on our taxes at the moment).

We looked into the Salli Mae option and what frustrates me is that since they sold my Stafford loans to them, I believe that means I'd be paying two student loan payments a month, both separately, as well as my wife doing the same?

I can get my loan without a co-signer, though it puts it at 10-12% interest (my credit is pretty good though I don't have my number off hand due to stuff still being in boxes from recent move, but I believe it was around 740 or so). My wife, however, requires a co-signer... Of her family, the only person who had any form of credit (they are mountain people that, while fine with money, just don't really participate in credit systems) was her father, who passed away in June (this is where most of our savings went to covering, as well as both of us being in slow season of our jobs and then having to move with some sizable costs of unforseen circumstances there). Its possible that I can co-sign for her though. Somehow, she doesn't have any credit yet despite being on my credit cards, but when attempting to get her own credit accounts, they only offer her interest rates at much higher than what I was offered on my first ones (I think I started with 18% rates just to build credit on a $100 max limit card, she's being offered around 25% on those so we've thrown them out every time).

We're both doing all of this on our own with no family assistance - both out of not wishing to utilize them due to other family members abusing any possible kindness those that do well could offer, as well as those people that COULD help being so strained and us not wanting (nor even being able to) add to it, even if they wanted to help.",finance,1376119804

* China coal shares jump on hopes of rising physical prices

* CRE soars to highest in a year after Tesco JV deal

* Li Ning spikes 9.2 pct ahead of H1 earnings

HONG KONG, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares ended up on Friday helped by Chinese coal companies on hopes of rising physical prices and solid China data for fixed asset investment and factory output, but the market endured its worst week in nearly two months.

Mainland Chinese markets reversed losses after a slew of economic data on Friday. They also posted their strongest weekly gain in four, outshining their offshore peers for a second week in a row.

The CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings and the Shanghai Composite Index each ended up 0.4 percent. On the week, they gained 1.7 and 1.1 percent, their respective best since the week that ended July 12.

The China Enterprises Index of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong slid 1.4 percent this week, despite gaining 1.2 percent on Friday. The Hang Seng Index shed 1.7 percent on the week, despite a 0.7 percent rise on the day.

This was their first weekly loss in seven weeks. Turnover on Friday in Hong Kong markets neared 2013 lows.

""Yes, the China data did give markets a positive jolt, but the effect wore out quite quickly,"" said Jackson Wong, Tanrich Securities' vice-president for equity sales.

""At this point, investors are only very selectively coming back into the market. Any companies able to report an improvement in their results in this sluggish economic environment will be of particular interest,"" Wong added.

China Resources Enterprises soared 7.8 percent in its biggest daily gain in a year after entering a joint venture with Tesco that will see CRE take 80 percent, helping the state-owned enterprise expand its market share in the hypermart sector in the mainland.

Shares of Chinese sporting brand Li Ning surged 9.2 percent to its highest close in more than two months ahead of its interim earnings announcement after markets shut on Friday, with hopes high it will follow the lead of rival ANTA Sports in reporting easing inventory woes.

In Hong Kong, China Coal Energy spiked 10.3 percent, while China Shenhua Energy jumped 6.1 percent on signs that coal prices may finally rebound as independent power producers stock up on coal in the next few weeks before a scheduled rail maintenance, traders said.

The official People's Daily reported on their website on Thursday that coal producers such as Jizhong Energy and Yanzhou Coal have started raising prices.

CHINA DATA

China's industrial output rose 9.7 percent in July, above expectations, while fixed-asset investment, an important driver of economic activity, rose 20.1 percent in the first seven months from the same period last year, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday.

This came after official data in the morning showed China's consumer inflation steadied in July although factory-gate deflation persisted for a 17th month, pointing to monetary policy on hold as Beijing tries to arrest a slowdown that has run for more than two years.

Robust trade data on Thursday had raised hopes that China's economy may be stabilising after two years of slowing growth.

NEW ORLEANS: A federal judge on Wednesday ordered BP to pay more than $130 million in fees to the court-supervised administrator of its multibillion-dollar settlement with Gulf Coast businesses and residents after the company's 2010 oil spill.

The ruling from US District Judge Carl Barbier comes as BP tries to temporarily block claims payments while former FBI Director Louis Freeh investigates allegations of misconduct by an attorney who worked on the settlement program. BP also has complained of broader problems in the program run by court-appointed claims administrator Patrick Juneau.

The dispute over Juneau's administrative expenses is just the latest chapter in BP's increasingly aggressive campaign to challenge his handling of the claims process. Separately, the company has accused him and Barbier, who is overseeing the oil spill settlement, of misinterpreting the settlement in a manner that could force the company to pay billions of dollars in what it says are inflated and fictitious claims by businesses.

In his ruling Wednesday, Barbier said Juneau needs to submit his budget proposals earlier than he has been. But he concluded that BP's refusal to pay for the settlement program's third-quarter budget wasn't reasonable.

""My primary concern is that we don't allow these issues to cause a shutdown of the claims facility,"" Barbier said.

His ruling upheld that of US Magistrate Sally Shushan, who earlier Wednesday ordered BP to pay the fees after hearing arguments by a company attorney, Juneau and one of the private plaintiffs' attorneys who brokered the deal. When BP appealed Shushan's decision, Barbier summoned the parties to his courtroom for another hearing.

In a letter Monday, BP claims official Maria Travis said Juneau's office hasn't provided adequate documentation for the money it requested. Travis also alleged that the program has been plagued by poor productivity and excessive costs.

Shushan said that while the dispute over claims documentation was regrettable, there was no way she could cut off funding for administration of the program on such short notice.

""People are dependent. Jobs are dependent. We just can't have that happen,"" she said.

Shushan ruled that Juneau must start submitting budget proposals 60 days before the start of a quarter, beginning with his budget for the first quarter of 2014. She also issued an order outlining a process through which BP will be able to review and respond to Juneau's fourth-quarter budget proposal.

BP attorney Keith Moskowitz said it is ""patently unreasonable"" to expect BP to pay more than $130 million without a more detailed budget proposal from Juneau. He said the one Juneau submitted in June was ""in summary form without any backup.""

""That's simply not how budgets are created. That's now how businesses are operated,"" he told Shushan.

Moskowitz said BP is not trying to shut down the program, but Juneau said the program would be in jeopardy if BP did not cover its expenses. ""We've got bills that are due today,"" he said.

Juneau also defended his operation and claimed BP's characterization of his budget request was distorted.

""We give them what they ask for,"" he said. ""We give it to them in a format they ask for.""

In a separate request, BP has asked a second time for Barbier to suspend settlement payments until Freeh's investigation is completed. The federal judge has not yet ruled on that request. Barbier appointed Freeh, now a private consultant, to investigate Lionel H. Sutton III, who resigned from Juneau's office on June 21 after being accused of receiving a portion of settlement proceeds for claims he referred to a law firm before he went to work for Juneau.

In a court filing Monday, BP said there was evidence of additional fraud: The Company said at least two lawyers who have ruled on appeals of disputed settlement awards were partners at law firms that have represented claimants and filed claims of their own for the firms to be compensated. BP also said it recently learned of allegations that someone employed by the settlement program at its Mobile, Alabama, center helped people submit fraudulent claims in exchange for a portion of the awards. Juneau's office suspended that employee and a co-worker who allegedly helped that employee access claims data.

Based on the fresh allegations, BP renewed its request to delay claims, which Barbier had previously rejected.

Meanwhile, the parties are awaiting a high-stakes ruling by a three-judge panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Last month, BP asked the panel to overturn Barbier's interpretation of the settlement terms governing payouts to businesses.

Awards to businesses are based on a comparison of their revenues and expenses before and after the spill. BP says a ""policy decision"" that Juneau announced in January 2013 allows businesses to manipulate those figures in a way that leads to errors in calculating their actual lost profits.

Plaintiffs' lawyers, however, claim BP simply undervalued the settlement and underestimated how many claimants would qualify for payments.",cryptocurrency,1376211751

personalfinance,Student loans increased by over **9000** dollars.,"Background:  I graduated from college 3 years ago and I've been paying off my loans as fast as possible.  I've never missed a payment and I've been putting a lot of extra money into the loans (every bonus last year plus more).  My loans were services by Direct loans until earlier this year when Mohela bought them out. 

The problem:
Yesterday I looked at my bank statement and found that Mohela, the company servicing my student loans, changed me an extra 132.22 dollars this month.  **I went onto their website and found my loan balance increased by over $9000.**

The two loans in question are the following:

1) $2625 distributed on 9/30/04

2) $3500 distributed on 8/31/05

These are subsidized loans and I graduated from this college in December of 2008 (government paid the interest until then).  I also deferred them for a year for grad school.

In April of 2013, the loans had the following balances:

1) $1944.20

2) $2591.14

Now on the July statement, the loan balances are:

1) **$6025.77**

2) **$8031.86**

The interest rates on these two loans were variable interest rates, but the average was about 2.3%

I called the company and they are taking their time figuring this out while I'm left here stressing over it.  They've mentioned keywords like capitalized interest.

I don't fully understand how capitalized interest works.  In my mind, there is an interest rate and that is the amount of money the bank makes off of your loan each year.  I received no notification of outstanding interest balances.  Heck they didn't even send me a notice when they increased my loan balance by over 9000... 

My old direct loans statement show $1784.47 in the capitalized interest field, but that was added into the principal balance. That number is the total for about 9 different student loans, not just these two.

Assuming an average of 2.3% interest for 8.5 years, that's a total interest of 1197.44 dollars over that period of time.  That isn't taking into account any payments being made so it should really be lower than this. (2625+3500) * 0.023 interest per year * 8.5 years = ~1200

**Can someone help explain this to me?  Am I missing something? Is there any kind of sure shot argument I can make to Mohela to get them to drop these charges?  *How is it even possible that these two loans are now 230% higher than their original balances?***




**Edit:** As much as I'd love to blame Mohela, I'm starting to think the root of the problem isn't with them.  If NSLDS.ed.gov shows the same numbers Mohela has in their systems, and Mohela pulls their data from the same source as NSLDS, it doesn't sound logical for Mohela to be the culprit. That is, unless Mohela can publish data to NSLDS.

**Edit2:** Someone here said Mohela can most likely publish data there...  So much for that theory :(

**Edit3:**  Mohela got back to me and they think it's an error.  They just don't have proof for their theory yet.

**Edit4:** Mohela believes the found and fixed the error, but it won't post on their systems for a few days and won't post on the website for about a week.  They don't know if the number will change or disappear...  Apparently some software program thought 1 months worth in interest while my loans were deferred in grad school was over 9000 dollars..

personalfinance,"24 y/o, 47k salary. About to pay off my student loans with an inheritance and could use some perspective on my situation.","Hey PF.

I’ve been lurking here for a while and generally felt I had things under control but I want to make sure I’m on the right path here now that things have been changing.

**Background:** 

* 24 y/o, bachelor degree in engineering
* Income -  47k pretax, about 2,900 per month after tax. 
* Company does not offer 401k match. 
* Debt - student loan: 26k at about 6.8% (about 4k of that is at 6.5%). 
* Car - drive my mom’s hand-me down car so no debt there (2001 camry, has lots of life left). 
* Credit - I’ve held a few credit cards since 17 y/o and my score is a 744 according to Credit Karma (I’ve never had a late payment or an overdraft fee on anything in my life). 
* SO-  I have a long term relationship but we are not currently living together.

**Expenses:**

* Rent - $1,150 (I live in a city, I have two roommates, I know this is really high)
* Student Loans - $400
* Utilities - $100
* Food and Dining - $550
* Clothes and Other - $250
* Gas – $150 

**Savings:**

* Emergency Fund - $150
* Roth IRA - $150 

Some numbers vary but I generally break even on this budget or have a bit to spare.

-----
**Emergency Fund - $3,000:** 
I have this on [Betterment.com](https://wwws.betterment.com/). While this may be a riskier investment and has some higher fees I can take the money out anytime as well as adjust its stock allocation anytime. It was easy to get into and I simply haven’t changed it. I have returned about 6.8% on this money since opening the account.

**Retirement: - $6,200:**
Roth IRA through Fidelity (was an old 401k, already paid taxes on roth conversion). All of the money is in [FBIOX](http://quotes.morningstar.com/fund/FBIOX/f?t=FBIOX) which has returned 44% since I first purchased. I originally put all my money into this fund as I didn't have enough at the time I opened it to avoid fees with a Vanguard fund via Fidelity but I haven’t reorganized it since.

**Inheritance Curve-Ball:**
Just this month I was made aware of an inheritance from my grandmother that my parents have been holding in my name. This is where things get complicated. This money is about 90k and is all invested in [SENCX]( http://quotes.morningstar.com/fund/SENCX/f?t=SENCX). This has a high fee (1.09%) and a front loading fee (5%). This was chosen by my grandma or my parents. I am about to take 26k out of this money to pay off the student loans but I’m concerned I should also be thinking about moving the remaining 64k somewhere else. I don’t yet know what this money is to be for but I don’t want to touch it at all. My idea was that I would take the 400 I budgeted for the loans and begin paying it back into the account I used to pay it off. No lifestyle difference for me but instead of FedLoan making 6.8% interest off me over 10 years I am saving all that and building this account back up.

Further complicating things is that the 90k inheritance is also for my only sibling, my grandma/parents are leaving everything to me. My sibling has some mental issues and would not be capable of handling the money. In addition, due to reasons I can’t/won't get into; the state would take some or all of their inheritance, so to keep it in the family I have to get it. I will be in charge of taking care of this and deciding what if any my sibling is entitled to. This is not a responsibility I am interested in or know how to handle. If anyone has experienced a situation like this I would like to hear it. Once my parents are gone I’m going to be on my own to handle this I guess. 

I will likely want to have money for a down payment on a home someday but I don’t realistically know when that is. I may also want to go back to school to get an M.S. or PhD but I also don’t have any strong ideas of when or how much that would cost me. Right now I am interested in getting a higher paying and a more challenging job (my peers are making about 20k higher than me) but also nothing definite planned in that regard right now. This could easily be a whole different discussion but I’m having a lot of trouble figuring out if more school is going to be beneficial to my career, let alone if I have it in me to actually complete more school.  

I think that's all for now. If you got here and read all of the above I want to thank you for taking an interest in my situation. If you have any advice on even just a small part of what I said I would greatly appreciate it.",finance,1376340247
personalfinance,Friend is $100k in student loan debt. I put together a plan to help him get it together. Any suggestions? (US),"My friend has close to $100k in student loans. It's crushing him. I am trying to get him back on his feet, but I don't have much experience in dealing with debt. Here is his situation:

Monthly Expense:  
  
+  **$1000** student loan repayment (**$700** Wells Fargo private loan, **$300** federal loan)  
+  **$800** rent  
+  **$100** food/grocery  
+  **$100** utility/bills (including cellphone, internet, and electricity)  

Monthly income: **~$1800**

Total: **-$200**

I think he should be able to put the $300 federal repayment on forbearance for a year and switch the private loan repayment to an income based one. Meanwhile, he is working on a certificate in hope for a better paying job in a year. The certificate program is free thanks to his company.

He has no emergency fund. He has been living off his credit card for the past 6 months with a total balance of $800 so far. 

I hope with this plan he can establish an emergency fund of $1000 and clear off his credit card debt in an year.

Any thoughts? Suggestions? Stories or experience? I have my own student loan debt, but it's not nearly as bad ($10k remaining). To think of someone can rack up that amount of debt in 4 years for education is freaking me out!

They don't appear to be ""bad"" funds, but they aren't funds I would choose.  Unfortunately, I have about $15k worth of unrealized gain in these funds if I were to sell them.

The funds in question are:  TGVAX (international fund) with an ER of 1.3% and JAENX (Mid cap fund) with an ER of .94%.  They fit in my asset allocation, but aren't the funds I would choose.  They are in a taxable account.  I would replace them with VXUS (international total market ETF) and FSTVX (US Total Market fund).

The way I see it, I have 3 options:

1.  Wait for the market to down turn and sell them at a loss for tax harvesting.  Who knows how long this will take.

2.  Sell them now, and eat the capital gains taxes and re-invest in the funds I want.  I live in California, so I would have to pay CA &amp; Federal capital gains taxes on the sale for a total of somewhere around 24% on the gains.

I went to a for-profit school (ITT Tech) before I knew it was a horrible, horrible idea. I now have a combined $60,000 debt for an associates degree. ($18,000 PEAKS private loan, $42,000 federal)

I've been out of college a while now with no luck finding a job in my field. I currently work part-time at a grocery store making little more than minimum wage. (for the record I have been looking for a better job, ANY job, whether in my field or not. No luck yet) Starting next month I have to start making payments towards these loans.

The federal one (42k) at least sounds doable thanks to the ""Income-based repayment"" plans the government has. But the private PEAKS loan has me worried. 

**Details of PEAKS private loan:**

* Total owed: $18,000

* Interest rate: 10.25% (variable, may go up)

* Starting payments required: $240 /month

* Repayment time: 10 years

I *might* be able to make the payments with some serious financial planning, but I will have little to none left over for emergencies. I called PEAKS to see if perhaps they could extend the time I have to pay them back (from the current 10 years) in exchange for lower monthly payments but they do not offer that option. The only option they offer is forbearance but after some research it sounds like it will end up doing me more harm than good (increased payments when forbearance ends)

I heard that bankruptcy MIGHT be an option down the road, to get rid of the private loan, if I can prove poor circumstances or something like that? Is that a decent option?

Anyway this whole thing has me extremely stressed out and majorly depressed about the huge mistake I made going to a for-profit school. I wish life had do-overs, but alas. If anyone has any advice I would be very grateful.

personalfinance,Where to go after college?,"Hi everyone.

I originally posted this in /r/financialindependence but was told that I might get more feedback in this subreddit so here I am!

The purpose of this post is to get a sense of what steps I need to take to prepare myself for college graduation in a year. I have had the good fortune to go have both gone to a school with a great financial aid program and a family who has been able to afford any school costs. However, as it should be, my family will only be able to provide for me until graduation. Currently my finances are very much intertwined with those of my parents. I have a shared bank account with my father in a federal credit union. With unpaid internships and a low paying job on campus during the school year I haven't had time to accumulate much money after spending on living expenses at school (the least I can do to help out my family). I do have some money invested (it is all in one stock and fluctuates between 3-4k) that I inherited from my great grandmother when I turned 18. As a rule of thumb I have not touched it in the 2/3 years since it came to be mine. I do not have a credit card and as such no credit score.

If all goes according to plan I will graduate with no student loans. However, I still do not feel I have the appropriate foundation for financial independence. I do not need or want my parents to be linked to my financial life through shared bank accounts and the like (I recently got a letter from my bank that when I turn 21 I have the option to sever this tie - which prompted this post).

Before going back to school I have made it a priority to get a credit card for the year with the purpose of building some credit. I would simply make any purchases I would normally make on my debit card on my credit card. I also am trying to put in place a process by which the bank would take out 50 dollars a month from my paycheck and put it into my investment fund.

Other than that, what other things can I do to be in a position to be financially independent upon graduation. Should I open a different bank account with a different bank or simply retain the one I have with the credit union my parents use? What credit card company should I use? Retirement, investments - what do I do? This is all working under the assumption that I will find a job within 3 months of graduation. I know this all seems very general but I am sure many of you here have gone through the same thing and have advice on what to do or not to do and how to best prepare myself.

business,End of RBA easing cycle nearing?,"FXstreet.com (Barcelona) - What if, after all the talk about the gloomy prospects of the Australian economy, the RBA was growing more confident to the point that it may consider no longer necessary a further reduction in interest rates?

If one takes as reference the latest wording applied at the Quarterly Statement of Monetary Policy published late last week, one may notice a subtle change in narrative, with the central bank tweaking the old line ""inflation gives room to cut rates further"" for a new and less dovish ""rates will be adjusted as needed"", which implies there might be more options on the table depending on the next barrage of economic releases published in the country.

For now, RBA Chief Stevens and other Board members appear keen to support the idea of taking the foot off the accelerator, pause and stay on a 'wait and see mode' to assess whether or not the economy shows signs of being re-stimulated, on a combination of lower interest rates (currently at 2.5% historic lows) and a much cheaper currency. 

As cited by James Glynn at WSJ, quoting last week's RBA Monetary Policy Statement: “On the domestic front, there are risks to both the downside and upside for economic activity and inflation. There remains considerable uncertainty about the process of economic growth rebalancing away from mining investment towards other sources of domestic demand and to exports.”

In view of Eamonn Sheridan, Editor at Forexlive, ""the future path for interest rates in Australia is, as always, data-dependent"", adding that ""if the ‘transition’ (from mining investment to other sectors of the economy) slows, or does not produce economic growth sufficient to propel employment gains then its back to the chopping board for the bank (inflation allowing, of course).""",finance,1376287148

My payments are currently about $615 a month to Discover and $100 a month to Sallie Mae (the Sallie Mae amount will go up to around $250 at some point.)

It seemed great, around 6% fixed interest rate, co-signer can remove themselves after a year of payments. I went through a very long application process and eventually was essentially told that I didn't make enough money for them to finance me.

Similar deal, but with a variable interest rate. This is what frightens me a little bit. I know very little about how much the rate can vary, and why  it will change. My lack of confidence in the American financial system does very little to encourage my decision to pull the trigger on this. So, I guess I'm asking whoever is reading this to do a little bit of work, but I will appreciate it more than I can ever convey with words.

In this episode Shahriar demos the world’s fastest oscilloscope! The Agilent DSA-X 96204Q offers 160GS/s of conversion rate  with a bandwidth of 62GHz on two dedicated ‘RealEdge’ channels. It can also provide 80GS/s conversion rate and 33GHz of bandwidth on four simultaneous channels. The unit demoed in this video is equipped with all available options and is valued at over 0.5 million US dollars. The block diagram of various sub-systems of the oscilloscope are presented and the principle operation of the instrument is explained. A 56Gb/s PRBS-15 signal is applied to the scope from a Centellax 2G2P5A (now Agilent N4975A) and the resulting data pattern is examined in real-time. Various scope functions are also presented as well as the capability to observer bit failures at baud-rate using this instrument.

As a second experiment, two 3.125Gb/s PRBS-7 data streams are simultaneously up-convered to 20GHz and 40GHz respectively by using a pair of MITEQ mm-wave DSB tripple balanced mixers and a pair of Avantek 20-40GHz YIG oscillators. The resulting two signals are combined by using a power-combiner and fed to the oscilloscope. The capability of the instrument to act as an ultra-broadband software-defined radio is demonstrated by recovering the the two PRBS sequences simultaneously through DSP post processing. The block diagram of this setup can be downloaded from The Signal Path website.

Bitcoin, the once-obscure virtual currency, is getting attention from the most mainstream of all institutions: Congress. The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, Thomas Carper (D-Del.) and his Republican counterpart Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) have announced plans to begin probing the virtual currency and the regulatory regime that governs it.

The new inquiry was announced in a Monday letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. “Virtual currencies appear to be an important emerging area,” the senators wrote, arguing that the subject “demands a holistic and whole-government approach to understand and provide a sensible regulatory framework.” Similar letters were also sent to the Department of Justice, the Federal Reserve, Department of Treasury, the Securities and Exchanges Commission, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.

To that end, the Homeland Security Committee is asking the Obama administration to provide details about all of its current “policies, procedures, guidance or advisories” related to virtual currencies and information about “plans or strategies regarding virtual currencies.”

Congress isn’t the only government institution taking a closer look at the cryptocurrency. Also yesterday, the New York Department of Financial Services announced that it was initiating its own probe of the subject. It subpoenaed 22 companies with a significant role in the Bitcoin economy with an eye to determining whether and how those firms were subject to New York financial regulations.

As more and more regulators become interested in Bitcoin, it could become increasingly difficult for firms to enter the Bitcoin marketplace. Indeed, Congress could play an important rule by establishing a uniform set of federal rules that preempt conflicting state laws and give Bitcoin startups greater certainty about what rules they must follow.",finance,1376421523

Bitcoin,"With the recent subpoenas, this is the conference we should be talking about. Tomorrow, Wednesday the 14th in NYC.","2 weeks ago, the Inside Bitcoin conference made a big splash in the media and the bitcoin community. This Wednesday there is another bitcoin conference that is smaller but might be the start of something very important to the future of bitcoin.

This Wednesday, The National Money Transmitter's Association led by David Landsman is holding the Virtual Currencies Compliance Conference Association. The NMTA is a trade organization for money transfer businesses - offering advice and training dealing with regulatory and practical problems faced by money service businesses. Keeping bank accounts open, facing subpoenas, and being audited for AML compliance are things those of us in the bitcoin community are new to, and it sometimes seems like targeted harassment, but these are problems faced by the entire MSB industry that bitcoin has been lumped into.

According to Landsman ""The goal of the NMTA is to uphold the image of the money transfer industry and improve the practice of AML compliance among money transmitters. So we are looking forward to welcoming a new population of money transmitters - the Bitcoin operators who wish to operate as a business - and we look forward to bringing them up to speed on regulatory matters at the conference.""

There are some familiar faces from the bitcoin world speaking at the conference, including Marco Santori who is the Chairman of The Bitcoin Foundations Regulatory Affairs committee.  Juan Llanos is also speaking, an experienced AML and compliance professional who has been a valuable and generous resource for the bitcoin entrepreneur community here in New York City.

The other speakers are experienced compliance professionals that will be speaking from an MSB/MTB perspective and trying to explain and make clearer how the legislation can apply to bitcoin, and how we can legally operate our businesses in the US.

So the conference should be very informative from a legal perspective, but even more interesting to me is Mr. Landsman's personal mission to push for a Federal money transmitter license. The struggle of dealing with a web of state licenses is probably the single hardest and most expensive obstacle for creating any kind of nationwide bitcoin business.  This conference could be the beginning of an alliance between bitcoin and money transfer businesses, especially those that are smaller and hurt by the heavy licensing burden that keeps the advantage on huge operators like Western Union and Moneygram.

Here is the link to the conference.  It is this Wednesday, that's TOMORROW, in New York City.

personalfinance,How should I structure my debt over these three credit cards + overdraft with varying interest rates?,"Hey all,

I'm wondering if /r/personalfinance can offer my some advice on structuring my debt over three of my credit cards. The situation is a little complicated because although my outgoings are currently low and my income is high enough to pay the debt off pretty quickly, i'm not aiming to pay all the debt off straight away.

The cards, balances limits are as follows:

**Card 1**: 

* 0% APR Until July 2014, 18.9% APR thereafter

* Current balance £1950, limit £2000 

* 4% Balance Transfer fee


**Card 2**:  

* 12.3% APR

* Current Balance £1500, limit £2000 (Balance transfers limited to 75% of total limit, which is why i'm only taking advantage of £1500)


**Card 3**:

* 23% APR

* Current Balance £450, limit £3750

* 3% Balance Transfer fee 



It is also worth stating that I currently have an overdraft on the same account as Card 3, with a balance of around £400 on it and a limit of £900, with an APR of around 20%. 

My current income is around £2200 a month and my outgoings no more than £400. However, i'm paid a month in arrears and will not receive my first pay cheque until the end of August. My expected income is therefore as follows:

* August: £2200 

* September: £2200 

* October: £2200

As a visa condition for a move i'm expecting to do nearer the end of the year, I need a balance of £2000 in my current account, so essentially, my overall aim is to achieve that balance while reducing my debt as quickly as possible.

Obviously Card 1 seems like the obvious choice for paying off and transferring more debt to, but with the 4% transfer fee, how much sense does it actually make? What I had planned to do upon receiving my first pay cheque was pay off my overdraft and full balance of Card 3, but does it make more sense to pay off another card and move the balance first instead? Additionally, would it be more sensible to just make the minimum payments on the 0% APR card until the debt is cleared from my other card, or to pay off more of the 0% APR card and then make another balance transfer from Card 2 to Card 1?

Bitcoin,Proposal for a Bitcoin message service,"Hi, I'm a software developer with 15+ years experience. Yesterday I had an idea for a message service I'd like to propose here (let's call it ""Bitcoinmessage"").
The purpose is to send anonymous, secure, encrypted messages to Bitcoin users for free.

**How it works**

* The sender uses a Bitcoinmessage client or a web page to write a message to the Bitcoin address of the receiver(s).
* The client encrypts the message *on the sender's device* using the receiver's Bitcoin address and sends it to the Bitcoinmessage server.
* The receiver checks the Bitcoinmessage web site and downloads the encrypted message to the target device.
* The Bitcoinmessage client or a web page decrypts and displays the message using the private key of the receiver's Bitcoin address.

**How is it secure?**

* Unencrypted messages are never sent through the network.
* Only encrypted messages are stored on the Bitcoinmessage server.
* Only the intended receiver (the owner of the private key to the receiving Bitcoin address) can decrypt the messages.
* Private Bitcoin keys never leave the target device. Also, the receiving Bitcoin address doesn't need to have funds on it; any valid address will do.
* Sender and receiver remain anonymous. You don't have to register anywhere.

**How is it free?**

* The infrastructure is supported by donations (in Bitcoins, naturally).
* By donating a small amount from your Bitcoin address you may verify a regular email address to receive a notification whenever a message arrives for that Bitcoin address. The Bitcoin address together with the verified email address can also serve as login credentials so you can manage existing messages.

**What are the limitations?**

* Only text can be sent. Text size is limited for unverified Bitcoin addresses.
* Receiving Bitcoin addresses must have at least one outgoing transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain as the corresponding public key must be known. This is also an advantage because it can help to prevent DOS attacks.

**Advantages**

* No need for additional public key infrastructure/key management mechanisms. Having a Bitcoin address is enough.
* Bitcoin users should be familiar with the concept of public/private keys. So it's kind of easy-to-use privacy.
* Server hoster should be pretty much safe from legal harrassment. All they can be forced to do is shut down or hand over the database with the encrypted messages.
* Additional services for verified mail addresses (notifications etc.) may provide an incentive to donate a small amount. A constant stream of small donations could well pay for hosting and bandwidth.
* Software could be open source. Relatively easy to implement (apart from the crypto functionality which should be done by an expert).
* Service could provide a simple API for additional clients for smartphones etc.

**Disadvantages**

* Central infrastructure (not P2P; however, this makes it easier to implement, too).
* Private key must be extracted from the wallet and fed into the client (this needs to be done only once, though).

personalfinance,Looking for advice for what student loans to take.,"I'm currently a junior. I lost my scholarship last semester because of low gpa, trying to figure out how to pay for everything. I have 3750 in federal loans.  Need about 1500 more for the rest of tuition and about 1000 for living expenses. I have a part time job, but only make about $100 a week, so that should cover my rent. I live quite modestly, so I'm not too worried. Worst case, my parents are in town and are more than willing to help(except for outright loans or free money, they have their own stuff to deal with). 

Now to the real stuff. My only form of credit history is a discover credit card that I've had for a year. I wondering what institutions I should look into for that extra 2500 a semester or 5k a year. Discover is what I'm thinking, but sallie mae is another option I'm reading about. My dad is willing to cosign. I also wanted to know if multiple credit checks lower your credit rating.

Let's say for example, I make $50,000 a year and I contribute $5,000 to my traditional 401k. 

Does this mean that I only have to pay taxes on 45,000 for that year?


Since I have read that 401ks are a straight tax deduction (as my example above) why is it that people seem to always say, ""pay off credit cards"" first? 

As an example: Say there is a credit card that has a 14% interest rate and you owe $1200.00 on it. Say you can pay $100.00 a month, which means you end up paying .14 X 1200  = ~$168+ in interest over the year. However, if you were to instead put that $1200 into your 401k, you would instantly not have to pay 25% (due to the tax bracket you are in) X 1200 = $300 savings at the end of the year in addition to the growth rate. 

Obviously all these numbers may vary greatly, higher/lower tax bracket, credit interest rate, etc. I guess my question is, is it ALWAYS the case where you should pay off credit cards first, or is it just a generality?

I think that at the very best, I can hope to save about $500 a month for a total savings of 6k/yr. Of course that's hard to pin down until I relocate in a month, but when rent is more than 1/3 of my income it's probably ballpark. Of course I'll be making a budget after the first month of expenses. 

My spending goals for this money are uncertain - no plans for marriage, etc. After my grad life is over in 2018 I will most likely relocate to a postdoc for about 40k (no 401k match, no healthcare provided).

I'm not particularly hoping for line-item reduction help, because I've done that to some extent.  However, if something seems egregious, by all means, point it out.  I'm also wondering about big-picture planning.  I realize I could be more frugal and save more and put more toward retirement, but I also don't want to live only for the future and sacrifice the present.  My income will literally quadruple in several years.

I'm a resident physician in the US (have an MD, doing specialty training), making just shy of $60,000/year, before taxes, but after health insurance premiums.  My wife makes about $15,000 after taxes, working part-time.  I have several years of training left.  We have two kids, who are in daycare/preschool/aftercare/etc for the few days a week that my wife works.

We own a house that was $126,000, current principal is at $106,000, interest rate of 5.25%.  I still have PMI and can't get rid of it before I expect to graduate and leave this area.  My monthly payment is $1020, including escrow (PMI, insurance, property taxes).  Buying the house is probably going to be a relatively break-even endeavor, but we did get the $8000 home buyer's credit, which went to pay off her student loans.  I put an extra $12,000 toward the principal this year, from some money that came from 

We own two vehicles, both paid off up front, and should be around for years.  We've got a savings account with about $17,000 in it, for emergencies basically.  I have $300 transferred out of our checking account every two weeks, when we get paid.

Her student loans have been paid off for several years now, but mine have just crossed the $200,000 mark at 6.8% interest.  Yay.  They are in forbearance (which does not count against me, since I'm a resident), but I'd like to start chipping away at some of them.

I have some retirement money that my employer contributes, but I am **not** putting anything toward that right now.  Car insurance is paid in a lump sum of $570 annually for both vehicles, since that gives me a discount.

Averaged other monthly expenses **over the past year** include (these are pulled from Mint)

$1020 - mortgage (principal, PMI, insurance, property taxes)

$600 - child care (2 kids, 2-3 days/week), including the babysitters for dates

$500 - home upgrades, repairs and supplies (TP, soap, lady products, etc)

$450 - groceries

$400 - vacation/travel

$200 - gas and auto repairs ($800 for an electrical gremlin repair in the minivan and $600 for new tires brought up this year's average).

$200 - utilities (gas, electric, water, sewer)

$250 - church tithe [non-negotiable]

$150 - restaurants, fast food

$100 - health care, dental, eye care

$60 - Internet

I'm like dude, I'm not fucking stupid, there is something wrong with my disk and I need it replaced... I work in electronics, I've been working with electronics, computers, etc since I was 10... I'm not dumb, I even talked to a PlayStation representative in PERSON, and they said it sounds like something with the disk... SO.... I was told I need to fill out a form to get a replacement disk process going, and the form says I have to pay $20 because I'm 'out of warranty' - I said I'm not paying that... nor do I want to pay to ship a disk to you... I reported this problem a long time ago, you guys did nothing, and now I'm still having this problem, and you're trying to get me to pay $20 for a replacement disk... hell no. Have a good day, I'll speak to supervisor when I finally get connected.

So I'm still waiting... number 9 now. I'll give you guys updates if you want, I'm just so fed up with Activision's bullshit right now. I have MW2 and MW3, no issues. Something is wrong with my disk, and it's still in perfect condition with no scratches or anything.",technology,1376355113

personalfinance,"$187,100 in debts. Good income and prospects. Family. SF Bay area. What's my plan?","Situation: I have $187,100 in debts, mostly student loans. My home in WA is about to be foreclosed on (non-recourse state). I live in the SF Bay area with my family (2 very young children, wife who is staying home) and I have 2 stepdaughters at university in WA. 

My wife had a serious medical condition 2.5 years ago that eventually led to her being fired from her job. We had disability insurance but they refused to pay out. We sued and won but lost 1/3 of the settlement in lawyers fees. Smallprint of contract only covers 2 years of the condition. My wife worked at the bank that is now foreclosing on us. Moved to the SF Bay area a year ago since we were unable to make enough in WA. Currently renting.

Income: $148,500 salary plus stock that vests over time. Just got our first vest today and get $11,950 after insane (43%!) taxes. I will get around $5,500 pretax in september, $5,500 in December then $12,000 every 3 months after that.

I also own a business (tech startup) that is making a few thousand a month. We plan to continue to grow revenue until I can quit to work there full time. There is a small chance that this tech startup could make me rich but most likely it will at least contribute several thousand extra dollars a month eventually.

Assets:

$12,000 in cash (with another $4,100 coming tomorrow from my pay (every half month).
Cars are paid off. (worth perhaps $7,500 each)
Computer Science degree and MBA from good school.

Liabilities:
Student Loans - $144,067 @6.8% (a small number are lower %. 2 months behind on payments of $812 a month).
Credit Cards - $6,533 @22% (Again, varies, 22% is average).
Bank - We owe them around $20,000 and have not made any payments. Presumably they will contact us about this money eventually.
IRS - We owe them between 10K and 13K because they taxed the disability lawsuit payout and we were unaware we had to pay taxes on it.
Capital One - $3,500, currently in default, they are not chasing us yet.

Monthly Bills:
Rent: $2850 - locked into a lease for another year.
Water+Elec+Gas+Garbage: $490 (average)
Comcast: $300 (Internet and TV. Big spending leak on PPV movies here).
ATT: $300 (4 smartphones with data plans. We pay for the 2 adult kids plans while they are at university).
Car Insurance: $300 for 3 cars (1 belongs to adult kid).
Life insurance: $100 ($800K term on me, $550K on wife).
Renters Insurance: $65 (we own lots of electronics and furniture).
Gym: $45 for me, $75 for older child's Gymboree
Gasoline: $150 (27 mile commute. Train may be a free option).
World of Warcraft: $15

Plus minimum payments on debt (i.e. $812 for student loan and a couple of hundred for CC bills).

We have another huge spending leak on groceries: $1450/month or more. I'm going to fix that starting today. I'll take it to $1000 immediately and try to get to $800 soon.

We typically give the adult kids $250 to $300 each per month in terms of helping with rent, helping with tuition etc. They both work 20+ hours per week as students.

We don't spend a ton on clothes: perhaps $200? Probably less.

Looking at mint, we spent a lot on Amazon/Walmart/Target stuff - housewares and baby toys etc. Probably spent $700 last month on this stuff. I think it's time to set a budget for these things.

We also spend $150/month on medical bills. It's been a lot higher recently since my wife just gave birth. We owe about $1000 in birth-related bills. I had a maxed-out FSA card for $2500 but that's already gone for the year.




Plan:
Use the cash to pay off 2 small credit cards completely ($1500) plus get caught up on student loans ($1640). Put $1500 in emergency fund. Pay back a small debt to family ($600) and get all utilities etc. current ($350). Pay off all the small medical bills and put $100 towards largest. ($300 spent).

After that, I'm thinking that rest should go to the highest interest debt (a CC with $5,000 on it). 

Other things:
I make too much to deduct student loan interest. Should I contribute to my 401k to get my taxable income down a bit? 

Should I do something else to get my income down further to get the child tax credit?

Can I afford to put some money in a Coverdell account for my kids college this year? (Cap is $2000/year).

We have zero retirement. We are in our mid thirties. Should I be putting money in a roth (if I can - I may be above the income level) or should I try to pay off all my student debt first? 

I really appreciate any help you guys can give me!


EDIT:

Some updates.

1. I got a letter from capital one today. It looks like I owe them $2,400 instead of $3,500. The letter says that if I pay them before the end of the month they will accept $1,850 as payment in full. I'm going to do this.

2. Everything is completely caught up. No late payments on anything.

3. My wife is on-board with reducing our spending. We spent last night finding the cheapest grocery stores and signing up for a club card with them. No more $50 bottles of wine or steak and lobster dinners or buying a second roomba (!). (Yes, the ""second roomba"" was something we were seriously considering. How the hell did we get here...)

4. We were going to buy a quarter cow from a local farmer to reduce our grocery bills. Over 100lbs of meat = a years worth of consumption (since we don't plan on eating it every day) and the per-pound cost was less than half what we were paying at the store. I wonder if they sell an eighth instead... (Since we can't store that much meat for that long).

5. I'm going to start taking a salary from the startup. Even $1000/month would help reduce our debts significantly and I can probably do $1500 without it harming growth.

6. I used CA's unclaimed property website several months ago and found $1000 that is owed to me from an old job. I should get this inside the next two months and it will go to the final credit card if that's not already paid off.

7. I'm going to aggressively sell off anything we are not using and put the money towards our e-fund until it hits $5,500 then into the sole remaining credit card. After that, it's time to pay back the IRS.

8. My student loans were recently moved from Direct Loans to Costep. Mint is still showing a $10K balance at direct loans but I think this is incorrect since I don't see it on the direct loans site when I log in. I will call them. This implies I ""only"" owe around $131,600.

More detail on my student loans:

* Direct-Subsidized	6.8%	$4,779.99	$54.18	
* Direct-Subsidized	6.8%	$8,803.89	$99.78	
* Direct-Subsidized	6.8%	$8,803.89	$99.76	
* Direct-Unsubsidized	6.8%	$19,768.17	$224.04	
* Direct-Unsubsidized	6.8%	$14,179.46	$160.70	
* Direct-Unsubsidized	6.8%	$13,281.13	$150.52	
* Direct-GPLUS	7.9%	$10,303.45	$135.66	
* Direct-GPLUS	7.9%	$27,688.49	$364.56	
* Direct-GPLUS	7.9%	$25,570.70	$336.68	

This does NOT include $1650 I just paid to get them caught up.

After I pay off the high-interest credit card and the IRS, I plan on working on these loans (until the bank contacts me about the $20K in default). I plan on completely paying off the 7.9% $10,303 loan first and then the other ones at the highest interest rate. Is this best, or should I work on the smallest ones first (since my minimum monthly payment will go down, leading to less risk if I lose my job etc.)?",finance,1376519093

personalfinance,"(Canada) We have no money to pay off debt, but creditors keep calling me and being extremely rude. What should we do?","*Sorry, this turned out a bit long. I tried to give as much info as possible. Bear with me*

I have an overdue electrical bill that I wasn't aware of until it was in collections. The woman called me a few weeks ago and I asked her to send me an email with the account number and amount due. She did, but we don't have the money to pay for it. 

So she just called me today and I told her I didn't have the money to pay rent, let alone this overdue bill and she said ""Well, you could send something instead of pretending it doesn't exist."" I told her I wasn't pretending it didn't exist, we just couldn't do anything about it. Again she suggests paying it off, apparently not getting the fact that we can't, so I just said ""Thanks for letting me know."" and hung up. 

I also have about $7000 in credit card debt that they're ""going to take legal action"" over because we can't pay that either. The first guy who called me about this was yelling at me because it'd been over 2 years since I made a payment. Really. He was yelling at me, like it was a personal attack to him that I wasn't making payments. (Really, what do they care? If it's in collections making interest, I have to pay them back more.) The second guy was super nice, but I haven't been in contact with him because ... really, there's nothing that can be done. I could call him and tell him we can't pay? But what would that do?

The reason we can't pay? It's just been 3 years of bad luck. I really f'ed up my hip and thus can't work retail, which is what I have experience in. No one will hire me for admin work ... so no work... or when my husband has work, we are just barely getting by because his field is hard to find work in and what he does find is contract or only a few hours a month.

Anyway... we're a family of 4 with 3 year old twins. We're also in debt to my mom and brothers because of their help with rent, etc. I'm just so sick of not having money. What can we do? We've recently learned that if we're making over $200 a month we don't qualify for social assistance. Seriously. If you are a family of 4 and you make $201 dollars a month you get no help whatsoever. Yay Canada!

tl;dnr: Family of 4, two small kids, super bad luck with no work, or little work, over the last couple years. In debt to family, as well as creditors, who keep calling and being rude. No idea what to do. Also, I can't work because of a bad hip, so husband takes all of the work he can get, which is next to none. Can't get social assistance. fml.

personalfinance,"Parents have a $17,000 Parent PLUS loan for my college. Should I be aware of anything when I give them money to pay it off?","Here's a breakdown of my finances:

* $12,000 of subsidized loans (I'm still in school) with 3.4% interest
* $5,500 of subsidized loan with 4.5% interest
* $17,000 of Parent PLUS loan at 8.5% interest, belonging to my parents

* $34,000~ of estimated graduate school tuition assuming I don't get a tuition waiver (to be paid with graduate student loans)

Right now, my plan is to pay off my parents' Parent PLUS loan in December, and have roughly ~$15,000 saved up by the time I start graduate school in August.

If I get a tuition waiver, I will likely pay off my subsidized loans with my ~$15,000 savings and live on a part-time job that I'll be working while going to school.

If not, I'll put it towards my tuition since graduate student loans have a much higher interest rate than my subsidized loans.

**My question is**: Should I be concerned about paying off my parents' loan first? Are there any pitfalls that I need to look out for, since this will essentially look like a hole in my savings and income?

I'm worried because it's not technically my loan, though I had promised them years ago that I'd take care of this particular loan.",finance,1376508476

personalfinance,[RANT] Reducing interest rates on credit cards?,"Everytime someone submits a post seeking advise on attacking credit card debt, there are always comments that encourage OP to call and ask for a rate reduction.  

Certainly if you don't ask, it will never happen; but I feel like this is incredibly outdated advise and is kind of an r/pf circlejerk.  Each card comes with explicit T.O.S. and a ~~CC company has zero incentive to lower the rate~~.

So tell me, in the last 5 years has anyone successfully obtained an interest rate reduction on a credit card with a balance?

EDIT: Ok, there are a couple good arguments where there are incentives to lower rates.  CC's are a business, and as such must compete for customers who can get a cheap balance transfer with a competetor.

All the arguments make sense, but I'm still genuinely curious as to whether anyone has *actually successfully done it*.",finance,1376499867
personalfinance,Got approved for federal direct unsubsidized loan for master's classes; should I accept?,"I'm getting my master's in education from a public university in my area.

Each class has been slightly more expensive than the last: $2110, $2127, $2235 (not including university fees and expenses incurred).

I work two jobs: teaching for $943.46/month, administrative work for $1255.44/month (total of $2198.92). My only monthly expenses are paying my undergraduate loans. My current total loan balance is $14303.39; I pay each loan twice a month for a total of $370.84.

I got approved for $20,500 for the 2013-2014 academic year. My initial response was to refuse the loans and just keep paying out of pocket. At one class at a time, it'll take me another 2 years to get my degree. I don't really have a problem with that, except for that fact that it appears I'll keep paying more and more for each class. However, if I took the loan I could probably leave the admin job as it does not relate to my career aspirations nor does it provide benefits and take more classes per semester, which will lead to me getting a full time teaching position with benefits sooner.

I'm not sure what to do. I'd appreciate any input you could provide.

&gt;Her Jewish family was deported to Auschwitz from Budapest in 1944, whence only she survived out of fourteen, George Soros then in his teen years was hands on, ""cataloging"" her family's possessions.

&gt;The lack of police response to the Holocaust material, inculpates the entire Australian political and law enforcement hierarchy, for that and for allowing Jew crime boss [Abe Saffron,](http://www.davidicke.com/forum/showthread.php?p=1258172#post1258172) to get away with torching Sydney's Luna Park Ghost Train in 1978, in an act of arson that killed seven school students.

It's ridiculous, I know, and it wasn't a very wise decision, but it is what it is. I owe about $13,300 left on the car. It's a 2005 with one year of warranty left. The trade in value of the car would probably be around $8,000, and private deal would probably yield around $11,000. 

If I continue paying on the car, over the course of the term loan I would be paying $3000-$5000 of interest. 

I have a decent credit score, sitting at around 730-740, with good credit history. 

Would it be wise to trade the car in for a newer car at a significantly lower interest rate and deal with being upside down on a loan, but end up paying less in interest? Sell the car privately and take a loss? Pay the car off as fast as I can?

Has anyone had experience with an issue such as this? Your advice and input is greatly appreciated.",finance,1376595330

Feeling a bit lost and could use some help. I feel like I have a good grasp of my finances, but I feel like I'm bleeding money and could use some fresh eyes to figure out a better budget to grow my savings/reduce debt:

Im 25 years old, I currently make 35k pre-tax. 10% goes in to a 403(b). So it works out to 840 bi weekly after taxes/deductions

I recently purchased a home, I have 112k left, total bill (taxes, ins., etc.) is $761 per month.

I have a $3500 CC bill with 0% interest for 15 months. I try and pay between 150 and 250 a month to get this down (hoping an accident settlement I have coming or a tax return this year can wipe this out)

I have 2 room mates (a buddy and my girlfriend) paying me a total of 800 per mo. Plus a third of the utilities.

I drive a gas guzzler that typically takes 60 per week to fill and 150 a mo to insure (note 1: that premium also includes a 20/mo life insurance premium, note 2: to offset this I bought a scooter that cost me 79 a year to insure and 3 bucks a week to fill and I drive that as often as I can).

My current bills look like this (for all utilities (gas water cable/internet electric) I'm only paying a third:

Gas bill: 20-100 per month
Electric: 50-150 per month
Water: 50 per month
Cable/Internet: 100 per month
Netflix: 8 per month
Gym: 20 per month
Food: 150 a month


The range in utilities is because different times of the seasons certain bills will be higher (gas heats my home so winter that's higher then, window AC cool with ceiling fans in summer so electric is higher then).

In the winter I was paying 500/mo for 1/2 tank of oil to heat my house/water. Blew through 5k of savings to convert the system into a more energy efficient system (high efficiency heater, tankless hot water)

Currently, other then retirement, there are no savings. I'm supposed to get a 5-10k raise, an I intend to use that for savings and live off what I am currently.

I have 60k of school debt at various interest rates all in deferment as I am in grad school. Grad school finishes next may and I should be able to use that degree to supplement my income nicely.

Here is a clearer outline of my problems/goals:

I want a sizable emergency fund. As a home owner I've found out hard shit gets expensive quick.

I want a good budget that I can stick to.

I'm going to have a school loan bill six months after graduation, I want to be able to pay that debt down ASAP.

I want to be able to vacation once a year.

I want to be able to make improvements to my home (paint, remodel (I'm handy))

I want to invest

I don't want to be a slave to debt.

I think I'm not doing bad because I was able to get a home and still save for retirement, but my plans definitely could use some improvement.

The other option is to buy a larger house with a rental basement. I want to do it, but I don't know where to really start. We have lots of family and friends who know building/reno-work and are very motivated ourselves. Should all other debts (IE federal student loans) be gone before this happens?

I don't know if this is the best place to ask, but I'm feeling incredibly overwhelmed.  I always knew my fiancee had pretty significant student loans (from both undergrad and graduate school), but I always figured that she had a plan for paying them off.  Well, turns out she didn't - it was a problem for ""future her"" to figure out.  I just took a look at her student loan docs, and well, I have no clue where to even start.

$17,000 subsized (until 8/2014) @ 6.8%
$86,457 unsub @ 7.9%; $834 unpaid interest
$61,167 unsub @ 6.8%; $7,445 unpaid interest
$10,729 unsub @ 6.55%; $8 unpaid interest; in repayment
$5,173 unsub @ 1.54%; $1 unpaid interest; in repayment

(if you're wondering what's up with the $1 unpaid interest, well, she made her first student loan payment last week... on the loan with the lowest interest rate because it looked smaller.)

Have any of you found a good calculator to use to figure out what we need/could do?  I make around $75K right now, and she's taking her final year of school off from work, but with her new graduate degree should be able to find a $95K starting job next year, so with 2 year tax-free loan forgiveness from $40-60K.

If she signs up for direct deposit on the student loans, the ones in repayment can get a discount of .25% on their interest rates, so I guess that's something.

We're working on a budget, but I just can't understand these loans unless I had some sort of resource to plug in different payment values to see the impact of each scenario.  Please, does anyone have any great resources for something like this?",finance,1376545376

Assets:
Kia Optima 2013 $26000.00 value (has 27k miles)
Checking Account $1000.00

Debt:

$7,000.00 Credit Card 19% APR
$28,000.00 Car Loan 5% APR
$11,000.00 Car Loan 5% APR (his daughter's car)

He also says that a good friend loaned him $50,000.00 that he has to repay $500.00 a month on. (he apparently helped this guy in a life/death situation and this guy got a court settlement that he loaned this money out of)

On top of debt repayments he pays 2k a month in rent, $600 in food, $250 Cell Phones, $100 TV, $70 Internet. Not sure on other things, but add car insurance, 1000 miles a month worth of fuel etc. He has stated to me multiple times that his money expenses are totalling around 6k a month at the very least. He has been draining his savings over the past 6 months since he took a hit to his income (he is in sales).

Today he called me telling me he is trading in his KIA to buy a 2010 Grand Cherokee SRT. His interest will go from 5 to 15% and a term will reset from 5 to 6 years. He is upside down $2000 on his trade and will need 11k to put down to get this $42k vehicle. I'm not sure where this 11k is even coming from since he had trouble paying his rent the past couple months.

When he told me this I drove to the dealership and tried to talk sense into him for an hour and left as he went into finance department. I fear that this could lead him into eventual bankruptcy as his debt overwhelms him and I'm not sure how to convince him that he is crossing the event horizon.

I'm a generally well paid individual - with a loving wife and young child. Within the past few years we moved to a location with a much higher cost of living than we were used to. It's all equal we said... higher pay, for higher cost of living we thought... wrong. Living in a major metropolitan area has challenges, ones that we were not prepared for.

Over time, the inflated cost of living drastically stretched us thin financially - being a ""too proud"" male - I found it difficult to tell my wife that we couldn't afford those things we were used to having - and enjoyed watching the delight of my child as he received a new book or toy. Honestly, things seemed to be going generally ok for a while... but over time, our pockets seemed to grow deeper, as the costs of every day life seemed to increase.

I've never been frugal - and as my wife spent her days as a loving caregiver to our son - I couldn't expect her to be either - but it's caught up to us. First it was one payday loan at a local walkin loan shop... then as we re-paid that one, with it's exorbitant interest rates - we found ourselves tight the next month - having a bill due, or a medical emergency...

personalfinance,Is sacrificing for student loans worth the opportunity cost?,"I have two outstanding loans left and a very aggressive schedule to pay them off:

* $8,408.79 @ 6.55% interest
* $7,867.24 @ 6.55% interest

(I have another 0% credit card I'm paying off in installments such that I will pay no interest on that debt; that's at $2,892.12 with 0% interest until March 2014).

Between these three debts my plan was to pay $1,800/mo: equal installments on the credit card, then snowballing the other two (mathematically it's the same as avalanching since the interest rates are the same). With that plan I'm slated to pay off all debts by **July 2014**. 

But the $1,800/mo is around 45% of my monthly take-home pay. (Before anyone asks, I am maximizing my contribution to 401(k) and already maxed out my Roth IRA on the year; also contributing maximum to an HSA). I have a small emergency fund (~$2k savings, $2k HSA for medical expenses, and as a last resort I can dip into Roth IRA contributions with no tax/penalty). The ""proper"" emergency fund represents a little more than 1.5 months of expenses (and I can definitely cut a *lot* out of my budget in case of emergency; let it be known that I have very high job security right now so I personally think that money would be better served going to paying down the debt).

Playing with the calculator I made, if I drop the payments to $1,500/mo, I'm done paying debts by **September 2014**. If I cut it to $1,250/mo, I finish by December 2014. I only lose on the order of $100 of interest if I finish paying in 12/14 instead of 7/14. And I stand to keep **~$5k** over that time period by not paying it up that fast. This amount is about 30% of my take-home pay. 

The mathematically optimal solution is to pay down debt as fast as you can to minimize the interest rate. But there's an opportunity cost here.  The mathematically *inoptimal* solution is to pay minimums for the duration of the loans, but the tradeoff there is to be able to save up for a down payment for a house faster. (I don't plan on buying many material things, but there are some wants that I have, chief among them owning my own house/condo.)

Mr. Money Mustache says that [all debt is an emergency](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/04/18/news-flash-your-debt-is-an-emergency/), but that's really geared towards credit card debt.

My aspirations to buy my own place are getting larger (call it lifestyle creep if you want, but I would love to stop living like a college student).

personalfinance,EE Savings bonds conversion question,"Hello, 

Kind of stumped on my own research, but don't be afraid to hit me with numbers. 

My awesome aunt worked for the Feds and in 1995 when they changed the rules for EE savings bonds took advantage of some incentive to buy EE savings bonds every paycheck and put them in the names of a few of her nephews and nieces. As a result I have 1 $100 EE bond from every pay period from July 1995 to August 2000, when she stopped sending them to me. The bonds from this period are guaranteed to be worth their face value 17 years after issue, but the rate is at 0.59%.  So now that it's 2013, the 1995 and 1996 bonds are worth $100 and cents, while the slightly later bonds are worth ~$80. So it's clear to me to hold onto them until they hit the 17 year mark, but should I set up a plan to convert them to something else? 

Right now the ""face-valued batch"" is about $3,200 but I would be able to add $100 every two weeks to whatever the new account is. Is there something out there that seems optimal to this setup, or should I just keep the bonds as they are? (Until of course 2025 when the first ones no longer earn .6%) CD rates at my bank can't beat the 0.6% the bonds are making until I have all of them together and can deposit $10,000.  I should mention I am a graduate student saving some money anyway from my paychecks anyway and I think this savings bond money should be something long term. I have 3-4 years left here and then 1-2 years as a post-doc before I start to make real-person money.

Thanks ahead of time for any advice!",finance,1376671038

This might be a no brainer to some of you, but I was wondering if using the remaining money from my unsubsidized loans for something else is smart or stupid. I still have four years of pharmacy school to go.

The remaining unsub amount I can return: $5,203

2.) Invest...I have no experience yet in this field and would like to learn, but I'm in Pharmacy school and I'm not sure how much time I'll be able to allocate researching where to invest my money.

3.) Other choices??

I could use the money for spending, etc. etc., but I have saved up for 5 months and am anticipating a student job, so this remaining money from my unsub loans is pretty free in terms of what I do with it. By the time I graduate I'll probably accumulate $112,000 debt. I live at home currently, but once I graduate I will be in residency and fellowship where money will still be tight for three additional years. 

My goal basically is to be debt free but at the same time I'd like to take advantage of compounding interest. Help me tackle this the best way possible?

However, I've now changed jobs, and since I'm covered under a more traditional HMO plan, I don't feel like I need to keep my HSA funds in cash to cover a potentially large deductible cost. Although Alliant does let you invest your HSA money, they unfortunately charge $6/month for the privilege, and only let you invest in a limited number of mutual funds.

What are some better options out there? I have about $7,000 in the HSA, and ideally I'd just invest it all in some low-cost index funds and leave it until I'm 65 and can withdraw it without penalty--essentially using the HSA as another tax-deferred account along with my IRA/401k.

personalfinance,"Reddit, should I consolidate my private loans? I have about $140k in debt.","Hello Reddit!  For the past couple of months I've been repaying my student loans, both federal and private.  It has been pretty hard on me financially, to the point where I have no extra money to save.  Mostly, all my income goes to bills.  On average I make about $2,100-200 a month working full time.

Recently I received another bill from another loan that I must start repaying.  Currently, I have  3 private loans, my department of education loans (which are consolidated), and a Parent Plus Loan.  I'll put the details of these loans below.  I know I am not financially responsible for the Parent Plus Loan, but my mother has her own financial problems as well and that was the agreement we had before we took the loan out.

Now my question to you, reddit, is if consolidation is a good idea for me?  Where should I look to consolidate?  A couple of months ago, I tried to consolidate through CUStudentLoans, but I was denied because of ""Excessive obligations in relation to income"".  This discouraged me from applying to any more places because I want to minimize hard credit checks on my credit report.  I would like to try and consolidate without a cosigner, however, if needed I will try to find someone to cosign with.  I know I will probably wind up paying more in interest over time, but I could really use more financial leeway right now.

Here are my loan details:

**Salle Mae Smart Option Loan (Private)**

Current Balance: $21,160.00
Interest Rate: 9%
Minimum Payment: ~$413/month


**CitiAssist Undergraduate Loan (Private)**

Current Balance: $20,147.96

Minimum Payment: $159.19/month

**Discover Student Loan (Private)**

Current Balance: $14,295.04 
Interest Rate: 6.75%
Minimum Payment: ~$108/month

**DL Consolidated Subsidized Loan** (I've reduced my payment for the consolidated loans)

Current Balance: $22,320.83

Minimum Payment: $104.25/month

**DL Consolidated Unsubsidized Loan** 

Current Balance: $12,256.88

**Parent Plus Loan** (I have reduced my payments for this loan as well)

Current Balance: $50,078.64
Interest Rate: 7.9%
Minimum Payment: $333.42

And since this is /r/personalfinance these are my monthly expenses, excluding my loans:

personalfinance,"Should I invest the funds in my HSA in mutual funds, or keep them in a savings account with a good interest rate?","I am in the process of switching to a HDHP health plan individually as my employer does not offer health benefits.  I am opening an HSA to go along with this plan, and see 2 possible options.

1.  Open an account with an administrator that allows investment in mutual funds.  This would likely be through Health Savings Administrators due to their access to Vanguard funds and no minimum balance before you can buy funds.  This company does charge an annual fee of 45.00 and quarterly maintenance fee of .0008 on the first 20K per fund.   in addition to expense ratios for chosen investments.  This means my total fees will be about 1.5-1.7% to start and will be lower (as a percentage) as my balance grows.  This seems reasonable to me since their investment options give me greater growth potential.

2.  Open a savings account at my current credit union.  They do not offer investment options but the interest rates are relatively high (1.5-2% APY depending on account balance).  There are no fees of any kind unless I overdraw the account, need paper statements, etc.

I plan on contributing the maximum each year, at the start of each year.  I do not plan on withdrawing much from the account as I don't plan on needing to (hence the HDHP plan in the first place).  If I incur eligible expense I will likely defer reimbursement until it is most convenient so the account can grow as fast as possible.  I do not plan on using a debit card.

Regarding the rest of my financial situation:  I have a fully funded SIMPLE IRA, and am not eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA or make deductible contributions to a T-IRA as my MAGI is too high.  Even accounting for the max HSA contribution my MAGI will still be too high.  I already have a 6 month emergency fund and am in generally good financial shape with no debt.

So which option would be best here?  I kind of figured an HSA should be treated as an emergency fund and kept in something low risk (FDIC insured savings account) but then again, given my income using the HSA as an IRA-substitute has a lot of benefits as well.  I'm just not sure what the best course of action is here.  Are there other options I'm overlooking, or other administrators I should consider?",finance,1376763552
personalfinance,How do I get collection agency to give my account back to original lender? I'm about to be conned out of $3k and my credit score [student loan],"Hi Reddit,
I put myself through college so when I  graduated last year I had $50,000 in student loans. About $35k is a variety of federal loans ( subsidized, unsubsidized, and Perkins) and the rest is private loans with double the interest rate.

When they entered repayment, I quickly realized I couldn't handle paying for all the loans without starving myself. So I applied for forbearance on my federal loans and was granted that until April 2014. For my private loan I have been contributing $300 a month since its high interest.

Toward the end of July I received a call from my college saying I was 3 months behind on my Perkins loan and to pay all 3 months over the phone right then and there. I asked for a bill/statement because I was unaware this loan was due and because I didn't want to give some random lady my credit card info. I was also skeptical because I thought I had a forbearance on my Federal loans till 2014. Anyway, she said they have been mailing me and said the address. It was my old address.... So I gave her my new address and she said she would mail me a statement.

I never received said statement from her and unfortunately forgot to follow up as I had a big project due at work. A week ago I received a letter from ACS saying I defaulted on my Perkins on July 31 and my case had been referred to a collection agency. Next day I get a call during work from a collection agency explaining that they got my account and were going to ""help me."" The lady said I should consolidate all my federal loans into one and make one single monthly payment. Then she started asking for my updated backup contacts and whole lot of other info. I asked if I could do this call later because it was already 15 minutes and I had to get back to work. She said it'll be one more minute. She said she will just use my old contacts and prefill some form and ship it to me. And to call her when I got the forms.

I got home and found a one pager from the collection agency saying they got my case. Listed that I had to pay almost $11,000 immediately. My initial loan is just $8,000 with 5% interest. I have to pay them almost $3,000 in collection costs! What BS!

Got in contact with my old financial aid advisor from college to see if they could take my case back and I'll make up all the payments right away. She basically said I was shit out of luck and had to pay the extra 30% collection charge. Said the collection agency wouldn't give it back since I corresponded with them...

I feel swindled. I am a responsible person who made a small mistake. I've maintained a 700+ credit score for the last 4 years and now I will have this black mark on my credit account for the next 7 years and I have to cough up an extra $3000ish on top of my mountain of loans.

personalfinance,Trying to deal with the emotional and financial aspects of an inheritance...,"Hey all,

I'm currently in the process of grieving my father. He passed away from complications following a routine surgery back in July. It was really a shock. My two sisters and I are now handling his will, and while I'm sure it's not as complicated as some, it's incredibly emotional. 

I'm essentially looking for advice, but would love for this to also start a discussion for those who have dealt with the difficulties of losing a loved one and dealing with the financial duties that follow. There's a lot I really need to just get out right now, but the questions I have are in there. I'll try to be as succinct as possible. It basically boils down to an ethical question and a financial question. 

First, I want to say how proud of my father I am. He was a humble, working-class guy who was never one to talk about his personal finances. He was also very frugal, and we'd often tease him for saving ketchup packets and whatnot, so now that we're finding out where he was squirreling away his money, we are just....in awe. He really started with nothing. His father died when he was a teenager, and he started working 2 jobs while still in high school. Later in life, when my mother divorced him, he was stripped of almost everything he had, including our college savings. What he was able to make since then is really commendable. He wasn't a multi-millionaire or anything, but even just by working modest jobs was able to take care of his three daughters and son beyond the grave. 

Obviously, I want to honor my father with the inheritance. I want to watch the investment or saving of every penny just like he did in an attempt to continue building a legacy he started. So most of my concerns are with where to begin and with the fears that come with an emotionally complicated financial windfall. 

There are two aspects of the inheritance that are really troubling to me. The first, of course, is how to use it in the smartest way (I've never been the best with money), but before I get to that, there is another complicated factor to all of this. 

I got a call yesterday from the place where my dad used to work. It turns out that he set up a life insurance policy where I am the only beneficiary. I basically just started crying on the phone, shocked. Basically, they are going to send me a check once I provide a copy of my father's death certificate. This is terrifying for two reasons: 1) this money is going to be in my hands a lot quicker than anything from the estate, which is terrifying, and 2) I don't think there was anything set up for either of my sisters. 

I'm struggling with when and how (and if) I should tell my sisters about this. The executor of the estate (wtih whom I've always had a contentious relationship) has no part in the disbersement of life insurance benefits. I'm afraid that knowing I got this special treatment (which I think was mostly because I'm the baby of the family) might be really hard on her and possibly my other sister. Even though they know my dad had his reasons for doing this, I'm sure it's a hard pill to swallow when you're grieving. I'm afraid, also, that I might get different treatment in the inheritance as far as my dad's ""stuff"" goes (family herilooms, sentimental objects, etc.). 

My stepmother has been giving my executor sister all the paperwork needed for her to start parsing things out, though she's been very cautious about what she gives her and when. She DID let her know that her son (my dad's grandson) had a life insurance policy taken out for him (of course you would tell the mother) but she also mentioned that 'she thought there was another one.' I wish she hadn't said this because now I think the cat will have to be let out of the bag. The problem is, I'm not sure when to bring it up. I have thought about talking to my stepmother (who may not know it was in my name) to get perspective on things (but she's travelling for two weeks). I've thought about bringing it up to my other sister, who is my best friend (and I'm having trouble NOT telling her because I just think my dad is amazing for doing it). I just dont...know....what to do. I feel isolated by it and have needed to talk to outside people (and Reddit, I guess) to put some perspective on it. 

As for the rest of the estate, that's pretty straightforward. It is divided equally among myself and my sisters, and a separate trust has been made for my half-brother (who is on disability and risks having that taken away). The three of us are also inheriting a piece of property (which....will get complicated). 

Anyway, my biggest financial question is ""where to start"" with this windfall? 

I have mountains of student loan debt. I was never smart with the way I worked out my loans. I've been taking the year since I graduated to try and figure out how I can live a happy life AND get out of debt ASAP. Been putting things in order to try and pay things off and put them behind me.

And then my dad died. 

Now, obviously I would take all the debt and pain to have him back. That's no question. But while the absense of him is going to absolutely change my life in a sad way, he is leaving me with an opportunity to just....not have to struggle for the rest of my life. I am eternally grateful. 

The question is, do I just wipe off this debt first thing? The amount of the life insurance policy would cover about half of it, and the rest of the inheritance will cover the rest, but also leave me with a little less than twice the amount of the entire cost of the loans. It's probably best to pay down AT LEAST the loans with the high interest rates, right? I almost feel GUILT having that money go to pay off my poor decisions, but I will also NOW be able to save the money that I would have been putting towards loans (and I won't be throwing away interest dollars). 

The other option is to invest (though I suppose I could invest in addition to paying off the debt). However, I've never even HAD enough money to invest in anything really, so I don't really know where to start. Where do I put it? I'm thinking I should probably hire a financial advisor (how do I find one, what does it cost?) and put the remaining money in a CD or something. I just want to make sure not a single penny is squandered. I may take a small trip with the money, but other than that, I want to make sure I use the rest wisely. Have considered buying property, starting a business, buying a winnebago and driving around the country, making my first feature film...everything. Obviously some of these things have more risk than others, and some of these things can go on my own dime after I have my finances in order. 

I guess this is where my post sort of fizzles out. I'm not exactly sure what I should be doing. The entire direction of my life just took a sharp right turn, and yet I don't know what direction it's going in. 

I'd love advice, or even just personal stories, whatever. The pain is still pretty raw, so just talking about this stuff helps. I am sorry this became so long, and if you know of a better subreddit, please point me in the right direction. 

**EDIT TO INCLUDE FINANCIAL INFO:**

* The life insurance policy is $42,000. 
* My dad's IRA is worth about $900,000. ($20,000 will go into a trust for my half-brother, the rest will be split three ways with myself and my sisters.) 
* We are inheriting a property worth about $180,000 (with about $100,000 left to pay off)
* Other miscellaneous assets will total about $20,000 a piece once they are parced out.
* Student loans:
* I have four loans. All interest is accrued daily. 
* $22,418.21 at 6.55%
* $42,605.97 at 6.55%
* $11,330.51 at 6.3%
* $17,260.69 at 2.375%

These would each be .25% higher if I hadn't enrolled in AutoPay. Hey, I did something right, right?

Also, I told my sisters about the life insurance. They both seemed to understand that as someone with lots of debt and no spouse, my dad had practical reasons for taking a little extra care of me. I feel really good to have that off my chest. Now my only concern is my stepmother. I know deep down that she knows why he would do this, but I think she might be hurt if she finds there isn't one in her name. She wasn't even in the will (nor was he in hers), though they did share some properties.",finance,1376706552

financialindependence,What does FI think of manufactured homes?,"My wife and I currently have a mortgage for a small $124,000 three bedroom house. Reviewing our budget, the house itself is now our largest unnecessarily large expense. Renting in our area (near a University) costs more than owning.

We recently learned that we could buy an equivalently sized manufactured home in an equivalently safe neighborhood only a few blocks away, for $25,000, which is less than one quarter the market price of our current home, and not far off of the almost $20,000 we now have in equity.

We could not have bought a manufactured home initially because the banks will not finance them. But we now have about $20,000 equity in our current home, so it seems like we could easily finance the difference ($5,000 or probably $15,000 after closing costs) on a roughly equivalent manufactured home, and own it outright in 5 years. We might not get a very good interest rate, but on such a small principle over such a short time, I figure the costs will be minimal (maybe another $5,000 in interest?). If we stay in our current home, we will own it in 20 years, but will pay an extra $60,000 in interest along the way.

The raw numbers seem to favor selling our current place and buying a manufactured home. But can anyone share insights why this might be a good or bad idea?

Thanks!

**Income Sources**

I get $29,500 a year, which after taxes and my matched 3% 401k is about $2,100 a month.

She gets a stipend which is $1,100 a month.

I am also in the National Guard and get on average $3-400 a month.

**total avg**  $3550

**Savings &amp; Assets**

We have a miserable saving account with $300ish. We had our roommate leave and we fixed up our place with some craigslist stuff and painted that sapped a few hundred dollars. We are working on this right now.

Our two vehicles which is a funny situation explained in debts.

**Expenses**

$720 a month rent including utilities, cable, everything

$60 for two phones through Republic wireless

$8 Netflix

We spend about $550 a month on all food and household. Food is expensive in my city and is taxed. I cook everything in bulk and eat for the week.

We spend about $300 on gas for both our vehicles

Auto and renter's insurance is about $250 a month

**Sub total** $1,888


Soon I will have to start making payments on the career starter loan I used to refinance our vehicles which will be about $470 a month. More on this in debts.

**Sub total** $2,358

Student loans are a question I will ask later but this will is going to be another expense.

**Debt**

I had an opportunity to ""buy"" my car and a second vehicle for my wife to get to school since we no longer go together. This is classified as a Student Loan with USAA and is at a fixed 2.99% APR 60 month deal.
I start making payments next year.

Currently- $25,600

Total normal student loans for me are about $30k. I filled out an application for a federal loan consolidation with the income based program. I did this because once my wife graduates we will have significantly more income and can pay it down quicker. Alone I don't feel like we make enough.

We have a credit card with 7.75% APR and a 1,400 limit. I am at 1,070. We are focusing on splitting money saved and paying down this credit card. 

**Total debts** $56,670

**Other notes and current plan**

We are paying down the credit card and building up savings account now for emergencies. 

I will be leaving for 4-5 months sometime next year for military training. I make more money with the National Guard than with my current job and I planned on both saving that extra income and paying down the higher interest student loans. I can get the major student loans APR from ~7-8% to a flat 6% during training and if I am lucky they will forget to put it back which does happen. I am not counting on it though. 

I have life insurance with the army and my company pays 100% health and dental as well as my parking in the city so I am alright with my current salary considering it is entry level pay. 

I am planning on staying with them until after my training before making a career move and trying to jump onto Shell in their finance or marketing area. I am told that they like Junior Military Officers and I would make more money. I have been with my current job for 3 months and would like to make this the starting point into a business development career; this is a good place for connections across the US and could get me into a top 20 university for an MBA when my wife graduates and everything is stable.

personalfinance,529 Plan newbie questions,"After getting my PF checkup (http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1kj9sn/personal_finance_checkup_more_retirement_more/), I realized I need to start saving for my kiddos' education. So I have a few newbie questions. I looked in the PF FAQ and didn't find much. Perhaps we can put these questions in the FAQ.

1. Do I need a separate account for each of my 3 boys or 1 for all of them?

2. Where should I open my account(s)?

3. If you were to use the money for education expenses, what is the difference between funding education from a ROTH IRA vs a 529?

4. Is there a danger of over saving for 529? Answer: Seems not since you can change the beneficiary to another child or they can use it for their kids.

5. What qualifies for qualified expenses? High school? Elementary school? Grad school? Books? See here: http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/higher-education-expenses-that-qualify-for-529-col.html

6. Is it possible that the 529 money is not available to be used for a small private college? See qualified institutions here: http://www.savingforcollege.com/eligible_institutions/

7. Are there state boundary issues (e.g. if you have a 529 in California, can you go to a school in AZ?)

8. What should I expect to need saved for a UC school?

9. Where can I find a good 529 calculator? Answer: http://www.savingforcollege.com/college-savings-calculator/index.php?childs_age=2&amp;mode=Go&amp;page=results OR https://financialprofessional.hartfordinvestor.com/planco/content/college/calc/calc529.html

10. What happens if one/more of my kids cannot go to school/use the money? Answer: If your child receives a scholarship you might not need all the money you've saved up in your 529 plan for college expenses. You generally have three options at that point. The first is to earmark the 529 funds for some future use by that child, perhaps for graduate school. The second is to direct it to another family member, such as a current sibling or a future grandchild. You can make the change in beneficiary anytime before the second family member actually goes to college. The third option is to withdraw the extra funds. The earnings in your account will be subject to income tax either on your return or your child’s. Normally, there would be a a 10% additional federal tax on the earnings portion as well, which is penalty for taking a nonqualified withdrawal, but the penalty is waived when scholarships are the reason for it. In effect, the scholarships have turned your tax-free 529 investment into a tax-deferred 529 investment. Of course, many parents will still be able to use their entire 529 balance on other non-scholarship expenses such as room and board, books, and supplies, and so the scholarships received by their children will not lessen the tax benefit of the 529 plan.

personalfinance,Staring down the barrel of a student loan gun,"So I made some poor decisions in college.  I paid a ridiculous amount into a degree program I wasn't able to complete for medical reasons that I found out about late in the game.  I had just enough credits to graduate with a Bachelors of General Studies, and then changed schools and degree programs to try to do something else.  That didn't work out either and now I'm basically going to try to make life work with a Bachelors degree.

I currently make $10 per hour in a call center job working a reliable 40 hours per week.  My boss says he likes me and when it slows down he'll keep me around, but it's still through a temp agency so there's no REAL security.  Meanwhile in a couple months I'll have been out of school for 6 months.

I have private loans that have by now burgeoned up to 160K and about 50K of federal loans from school.  I did the math, and given the minimum payments I would need a 40K per year job to be able to make the payments and still live, and these loans would be eating fully half of that for the next 15 years.

One friend (who recently went through a bankruptcy himself) suggested looking into bankruptcy.  My friend's father was the lawyer for their bankruptcy (it's not his specialty, he was doing it for family) and according to lawyer dad private student loans can be gotten rid of in bankruptcy.  I had always been told they couldn't be gotten rid of.

I applied to join the national guard a couple years ago and never really heard anything from that.  I was hoping to use them to pay for schooling and wipe out the federal loans, and I'm still interested in extra income, resume fodder, networking connections and student loan forgiveness/repayment through them.  I just heard back from a new recruiter who's taking a fresh look at my application.  Given my 4 year degree if I get in I would go through OCS after basic and be an officer.

So given that situation, here's my questions

1. Regarding bankruptcy, what am I looking for in a lawyer?  Can bankruptcy really help my situation?  I have NO IDEA what I'm doing in that arena.

investing,A quick explanation I wrote about convertible notes.,"So last night I was trying to explain convertible notes at a party.

This is how it works.

You have the money someone lends you, this is the note.  Let's say 100k @ 8% on a 20 year Interest only. (So 100k@8% IO= 8000/year=$666/month (It's IO, so no principal in this example.)

So someone lends you this money (as a convertible note) and then a year from now you decide you need more money. Now, the whole time, this note has been accruing interest, so the principal is whatever it is.  This new 2nd investor is going to give you ONE MILLION DOLLARS for 10% STOCK, not a NOTE. (So no interest rate etc.)  Since their doing 10% ownership, that means that they think 100% of the company is worth 10M because 10% is 1M. 1% of the company is 100k.

The first investor has this note, and one of the features of the note is that when you hit 1M in aggregate funding, the note converts.  (Since we're now at 1M, this happens)  Now, we've been making the $666 payment, so our balance in 100k, which is 1% of the companies value.

politics,Why You Shouldn't Vote for Tony Abbott,"Firstly, let me assure you that I am not an ALP supporter; they are merely the lesser of two evils here. I’m also definitely not a Green.
My goal here today is quite simple: to explain to you why you shouldn’t vote for Tony Abbott and the Coalition this coming federal election, and for you to consider how you want to be remembered by history. 
Tony Abbott not only makes me embarrassed to be Australian but makes me embarrassed to be part of the same genus as him. He is a disgusting, vile little man – a relic of an antiquated generation. Just so we’re clear, he is a sexist and a homophobe – and you know what? 9 out of 10 times, if you’re both of those things, you’re probably a racist as well.
And to be any single one of those things, let alone two or all three means you are scum.
He does not support human rights. He does not support women’s right. He does not support animal rights. And he does not support marriage equality. He supports nothing that requires empathy and in 2013 it is simply inappropriate for someone like him to be a world leader.

The sexism.
Julia Gillard famously labelled Tony Abbott a misogynist. It went all over the world, everyone saw it on YouTube – and too right she was.
“But he has a loving wife and three daughters; how could he be a misogynist?” people say.
For those who use this as a defence: wife beaters have to have a wife to be a wife beater – he may even love her but it doesn’t change the fact that he’s a wife beater – so having a wife and daughters does not prevent Abbott from being a sexist.
He stood smiling next to a poster of Julia Gillard that said “Ditch the Witch”. Yes, he really did. Look it up. Had she been black, I’m positively sure he would have been all too happy to stand by a poster that said “Ditch the Black Bastard”. In the past, he’s said abortion is the “easy way out” and recently said that the Coalition candidate for the seat of Lindsay, Fiona Scott is the right choice because she has “sex appeal”, because apparently in Abbott’s warped little intolerant mind, that’s what it takes for women to succeed these day.
His own party is trying to fight the perception he has a sexism problem, the general perception being that he’s a sexist. Probably because he is.
And his idiocy doesn’t stop there. There is a whole library of moronic things that this potential world leader has said. He is a poor specimen of not just a man but a human being.
Do you really want someone like that as your leader? Do you really want someone like that representing Australia on the international stage? He’s had media training; he’s supposed to know better than saying these things.
Consider this: every other day Abbott makes some new stupid remark proving that he’s an intolerant asshole and it’s all good and well that he says these things here and we have a laugh about what a moron he is, but imagine him making one of his little “daggy dad moments” in front of the UN General Assembly. Imagine him standing up there and saying that women across the world need to worry about electricity prices because they’re the ones who do all the ironing. Yes, he really did say that as well. Look it up.
“I think it would be folly to expect that women will ever dominate or even approach equal representation in a large number of areas simply because their aptitudes, abilities and interests are different for physiological reasons”.
Yes! He actually said that! He honestly believes women are inferior to men – WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH HIM!?

The homophobia.
Mr Anthony Abbott has quite publically come out saying he doesn’t support gay marriage despite the fact the majority of the country is in favour of it. He won’t let his party have a conscience vote on the issue and he’s even said gay people make him uncomfortable. Really think about what he’s saying there. He’s saying he doesn’t want gay people to be happy or to be considered equal to other human beings.
Now, Abbott is an expert – like most politicians – at dodging questions he doesn’t want to answer. His usual deflection is that marriage is defined as a union between a man and a woman. Well you know what, Tony? Things change. Words change. Definitions change. He is a conservative in every sense of the term; he is opposed to change. But change is necessary for our society and culture to progress and evolve. The ability to understand the necessity of our specie’s progression is a sign of higher evolution and being unable to grasp that just reinforces how irrelevant you are.
Of course, I doubt Abbott even believes in evolution.
The world is constantly changing around us and not to seem too pop culture but gay marriage is the new black. We had the Suffragette Movement in the early 20th Century and we had the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. One day this will be remembered as the Marriage Equality Movement. And despite Abbott calming gay marriage is “the fashion of the moment” (yes, he also said that and you should look it up), he needs to stop for a moment, look around he see that he is even less than a “daggy dad”. He’s a socially backwards, culturally irrelevant bigot.
He stands opposed to the latest Cultural Revolution and I’m profoundly sure that were we facing the Suffragette or Civil Rights Movement today he would have been on the other side of those as well; labelling it is “the fashion of the moment” – that coloured people and women shouldn’t have equal rights. God forbid you be a coloured woman. If there is one thing history has taught us, it’s that the Left Wing always wins in matters like this. And Tony Abbott will be remembered by history as a man who stood against what was morally right. He will be remembered as the old fashioned, cold hearted, intolerant radical he is.
And you know what’s funny about all this? His own sister is gay! What kind of a man turns his back on his family like that?

The economy and technology.
I’m really sick of hearing all this banter about the economy and I’m sure most other people are too. Here’s the truth whether you like it or not: the economy is stable. It’s not perfect – God, knows it’s not – but it’s sure as hell not nearly as bad as lovely old Anthony Abbott would have you believe and we’re doing a bloody whole lot better than the rest of the world so shut up and stop complaining.
The new thing Abbott loves totting is Labour’s wasteful spending on the NBN. Now, Labour’s planned National Broadband Network is not perfect either. Its costs are ridiculous (and should be revised) but it’s going to move our country forward. Abbott’s NBN alternative is a joke and it simply is not a long term viable plan. The Liberals would have you believe the existing copper wire network is just fine.
It is not!
There is no sustainable argument in existence to back up Abbott on this one, only his own ignorance.
There is no way that the old copper wire network can carry this country into the future. Abbott doesn’t know how the internet is going to change, no one does. The internet is the deciding medium of our age and to try and dismiss its integration into our lives is completely arrogant. I don’t believe for a second that Malcolm Turnbull believes Abbott’s plans are fruitful and should they come to fruition we will be left with his misguided disaster. Fibre optic cables are being rolled out all over the world and just because Abbott, with his bible bashing ways doesn’t understand why we need it, doesn’t mean we don’t.
It would seem he is trying to keep this country in the dark ages both socially and technologically.

Climate change.
Abbott thinks climate change is “absolute crap” (again, look it up). And yeah, there are a lot of people who don’t believe in it. I know people who don’t.
Tony Abbott doesn’t believe in climate change which means he doesn’t believe in science. Nearly every single scientist out there is saying it’s happening. Look around: we’re in the middle of our hottest winter ever. If nearly every single doctor were telling you that you have cancer, wouldn’t you believe them?

The rest of it.
It just astounds me that someone as fundamentally conservative and socially backwards as Tony Abbot could be the leader of the Liberal Party in 2013. And don’t even get me started on how they shouldn’t be called the Liberal Party anymore when they’re so Right Wing.
So why is Tony Abbott against so many things a lot of people see merely as common sense? Probably because he’s a religious fundamentalist. You know, like the terrorists are.
He’s going to try and take this country backwards. A vote for him and a vote for the Coalition is to try and smear what all the people of the past have spent generations fighting for.
I implore you not to vote for this man.
And if you understand even a little what I’ve written here, please, do the right thing and don’t let this man become our leader; he has a deeply flawed character and he’s not fit to be Prime Minister.
Don’t vote for him. He is a bigot.
Don’t vote for him. He is intolerant.
Don’t vote for him. He doesn’t understand the world.

The question.
Finally, I propose this question to you: how do you want history to remember you? Do you want history to remember your generation as being on the side of progression, tolerance and change? Or do you want to be judged among those who stood against it?
There are those who stood against the Civil Rights Movements and those who stood against the Suffragette Movement, and history remembers them as – for want of a better term – the bad guys. Do you want to be remembered as being with Tony Abbott – a man who stands really only for the rights of rich heterosexual white men?
Yes, there are those who are sitting there reading this and saying a vote for Abbott is the right thing, history will remember us as having put Australia back on the right course. To a lot, the economy and the boat people issue is more important than the things I’ve discussed here (ranted about) and to those people, I submit this: If you want to think of yourself as a “good person”, how can you justify supporting a man who is essentially standing for everything wrong with the world, who is fighting to keep people down trodden; to exempt them from happiness and equality?

economy,How to fix the United States Economy?,"I'm not an expert by any means, but would this work?

Step 1) Increase federal minimum wage to $12 (or similar amount, something survivable without any welfare).

Step 2) Offer tax breaks to companies depending on the percentage of employees they have inside the United States. (i.e. 100% workforce inside United States=0% corporate taxes, 0% inside United States=35% corporate taxes).

Obviously there are many details, but overall these policies would decrease welfare expenses (due to higher wages and [hopefully] higher domestic employment from tax incentive), increase tax revenue from individual income taxes (while decreasing corporate taxes, but since effective corporate tax rates are ~12%, this should be an overall gain for the US fed gov't)

From a corporate standpoint the minimum wage increase could result in lower profits, but higher paid employees will spend more money, thus improving the economy overall, which is beneficial for the corporation. Plus the tax incentives to employ a domestic workforce can help offset expenses from higher wages.

personalfinance,Pay off loans or invest instead?,"Usually I'd go with paying off loans. I have student loans that have 6.55% interest at $11k. The interest-payment per year for this is around $680.  I have been paying it off for 3 years already with regular monthly payments.

However, a friend of mine said that there is ""value"" in having cash on hand.  But I feel the interest rate is too high for this and I'm burning money.

Perhaps investing this money in risky investments is better off? If on average I make 10% or something, that's still a 4% gain on ""borrowed"" money in a sense because I'd have an extra $11k to invest, rather than putting it down on student loan.

personalfinance,How to manage funds for the long and short term? Also student loan planning.,"Hi PF! I'm 25 years old just starting to have an income after grad school and I'm wondering how best to mange funds for the moment. I started a fellowship that pays $2000 a month for one year a week ago. Everyone I know that has completed this fellowship secured employment with income ranging between 50,000-70,000 (depending on what position they took specifically).

Currently I have student loans for 40,000 at a 7% interest rate that will come due in November. I have a CD that will mature in two years that has 37,000 that I intend to use to pay off the remainder of that amount. 

I have an emergency fund of 1700 and 700 in a low yield savings account that was opened when I opened my checking account. 

I am very lucky and live rent free with my sister. I spend about 650 a month on helping out around the house (groceries, utilities, tv/internet) and entertainment (I tend to eat out a lot because of various hours I had). I don't really have many other expenses, but I like to shop.

Short term goals: Move out of my sisters within the next two years. I will likely be paying about 700-800 in rent a month on my own. (I will of course spend less around the house and on eating out). Save some money to buy some great furniture (like 3000). I know it's not that important but furniture is what I really looked forward to.

Long term: increase emergency fund, save money for a house down payment, create some investments, and create retirement funding. (Houses I have casually looked at range from 175,000-225,000).

I'm wondering if just paying the minimum on loans with income based repayment should be fine until I use the CD? And how to manage my long term and short term goals? You guys always have fantastic advice so I'm looking for your help. Thanks in advance!",finance,1376787806

personalfinance,Paying off mortgage vs investing for retirement,"Greetings r/personalfinance,

I've tried to do a bit of research myself but the topic is terribly complex and I'm not having a lot of luck finding all of the information that I need. I hope you can help!

I am less than a year into my first mortgage and in that time I've managed to save up a bit of extra money while trying to establish a ""rainy-day"" fund as well as determine the best way for me to leverage my money. Here are the facts:

* In November 2012, I bought a home for ~$220,000 with ~$50,000 down payment. As of this writing, the outstanding balance on the mortgage account is ~$172,000. I am in a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage at 4% interest.
* I have ~$35,000 in savings right now, and of that, I'm willing to invest about $25,000 (leaving me with 10k ""rainy day"" savings)
* I am starting a new job at $90,000/year and my employer offers a 401k which allows contributions up to 90% of base pay with a max of $17,500. I believe the HR rep also told me that they do some level of matching when the company is profitable (which has been every quarter since they started, ten years ago). I don't know what the limits are for their matching (I plan to verify on my first day).



As I understand it, I have a few options:

**Option 1: Pay down some of the mortgage.**

*Pro's:* I will pay less over the life time of the mortgage by paying down the principal early. I expect to be in a position where I can comfortably continue to contribute additional amounts of my paycheck to my mortgage in the future, so this seems like a situation which will only continue to get better. After the mortgage is paid off, any income I make can be put towards retirement savings.

*Con's:* A 4% mortgage is pretty low as I understand it, so there may be other avenues which yield more savings than the mortgage interest is costing me. Furthermore, once I've paid off the house, the expense of home interest I can no longer write off in taxes, so I may end up paying a bit more in federal taxes. Finally, I am not certain that I'll be in the current house for another ten (or maybe even five) years, so it might be best to pay as little as possible toward the principal for that reason alone.



**Option 2: Invest in retirement vehicles**

As I understand it, there are a few common vehicles:

*401K:* Offered by my employer, just about all of the research I've found has told me to take advantage of as much matching as my company is willing to contribute. Let's assume that's a given no matter what I choose I plan on doing this, but don't know if I should go beyond their matching on my own so that's really where my question would be.

*Traditional IRA / Roth IRA:* I would imagine that I'll be retiring at a higher tax bracket than I am now, so it probably makes sense for me to invest in a Roth IRA (as long as I don't exceed $125,000 in income in the future).



So the question is, **what should I do with my cash to yield the best ROI?** I've read suggestions online about how if you're close to a tax bracket, you can invest in retirement so reduce your taxable income and drop into a lower bracket... I find that a bit strange because I'd always thought that the taxes were gradual; there is really no situation where you suddenly go from owing 15% in taxes to 25% in taxes because you made an extra $1k this year.

I've also read quite a bit about the importance of diversifying your assets. Ultimately, I think paying a little bit on the mortgage principal every month ($500-1000) while maxing out my company's 401K matching and contributing to a Roth IRA is probably my best bet. What are your thoughts? *How might I have obtained the information to make an educated decision on my own, how would I go about crunching those numbers?*



**TLDR:** $25k to spend, do I pay down my $170k 4% 30 year mortgage, max out a 401K, invest in a Roth IRA, or a mixture of everything? How exactly would you break it down, and why?

Thanks for the help everyone! :)",finance,1376949064

personalfinance,"Dear PF, Should I Quit My Job?","Here's the situation--thanks in advance for reading.

I currently have two monthly sources of income. Job A is a 9-5, gives me a biweekly paycheck and has benefits available should I choose to use them in the future (23yr old male, still on parents insurance). This is also a small business (less than 20 employees), so I wear a lot of hats and because of this, my stress level is through the roof. Monthly income from Job A totals in at ~$2200.

Job B is a partial telecommuting job that I work nights and weekends at. Essentially, I'm fed work through the company and complete it on my own time. I receive a single paycheck through PayPal at the end of every month. The primary duties of this job are copywriting and editing, which is what I went to college for. I'm very well respected in the organization and the company is growing (about 20 employees)--so much so that I am set up to be hired on as a W2 employee starting in 2014. Monthly income from Job B rings in at ~$2500 (over the last 6-8 months).

My dilemma is this: I absolutely love Job B and have no hesitations about quitting Job A to work there full time. What's holding me back is the lack of a W2 through the end of the year. If I choose to forgo Job A, how should I report income on my taxes at the end of the year? I have no doubt that I'll be able to recoup some of the losses from quitting Job A, but I'm apprehensive to leave if I'll be slammed come next tax season or until I get the W2 from Job B.

I should also mention that my monthly expenses total to be ~$1200, so I'm well within my means either way. I'm more posing this question in the end-of-year tax sense, than anything else.

So, what's PF's take on this? Again, thanks for reading!",finance,1376946647
litecoin,Why LTC on GOX might hurt cryptos once its implemented. (Wall of text),"I know most people have been very optimistic about GOX carrying LTC. Let me explain why I think they might be mistaken and why LTC has a serious risk of crashing to $1 in the near future. 

Right now it is extremely difficult to get USD out of GOX in a timely manner. This has been going on for months and won’t be resolved until GOX can find a bank that can support their withdrawals. 

Currently, the only quick way to get USD out of GOX is to convert it to BTC and then sell it on an exchange that allows USD withdrawals. The price on BTC-e is  $99 and $120 on GOX. In other words, GOX users are buying BTC at a premium and selling at a ~20% discount because they either need USD or think GOX won’t deliver in the future. This price difference is called arbitrage. 

The point to take from this is that people are paying a premium to convert their BTC into USD. Why does this matter for LTC?

Lets pretend that LTC trading is implemented on GOX tomorrow. More than likely, this will result in a significant price increase for LTC. What it also represents is a chance for people who want to convert BTC into USD, but who also don’t want to pay the GOX premium, to cash out using LTC as an option. How does that work?

People will convert their BTC into LTC. They will then transfer it out of GOX and onto another exchange, convert it into BTC again, and then ultimately cash out for USD. The point to take from this is that people are going to be selling BTC which will cause prices to fall. 

As the price of BTC on GOX decreases it will result in a contagion effect as other exchanges follow the price on GOX. IMO, this is the catalyst that starts an overall downward trend of BTC that won’t be able to be stopped by the best bots or the biggest whales. 

This is a zero sum game though; it’s obvious to get into LTC instead, right? This is where you guys probably aren’t going to like me. Let me preface this by me saying I love LTC. I think its fundamentals are great and I like it more than BTC. However, as I am sure most of you have already noticed, the price of LTC has been directly tied to speculation of GOX these past few months. We have all seen what happens when GOX floats a rumor. Prices instantly increase. 

This trend has been going on since April. Four months of people buying LTC on speculation that once GOX implements the price will rise. Let me say that again. Four months worth of speculators buying LTC. I have no doubt that the price will rise for LTC once it hits GOX. I do, however, think it will be short lived. The higher prices might last a few days and it even might last as long as a week. What will ultimately occur is four months worth of LTC speculators dumping once the price stops rising. I think this new price will be lower than current market values. As big as the market share of Mt Gox, there really aren’t any Cyprus like events that can give cryptos the boost they saw last spring. 

This is where panic will come into play. People who held LTC on the premise of high prices on GOX are going to be reassessing why they have LTC. While fundamentally it is a good coin, the speculators will have no rumor to follow and will sell. Obviously, some will hold, but the amount of sellers is going to outweigh the amount of buyers. The result is a snowball effect and lots of volatility. This is where price correction occurs. Price will be based on fear and I don’t know how low it will go. ~$1.10 seems like it could be the low of a longer-term trend and a good buying opportunity.  

With all that being said there a few things that could null my theory. The biggest one is that GOX finds a bank to carry their USD withdrawals. This will end the arbitrage of BTC prices. If this were to happen it would probably result in a sell off, but in the long term add a lot of stability. 

The other thing that could change is financial collapse. Whether it is in the Euro zone or in the States when people lose faith in fiat currency Cryptos rally. If this happened and GOX added LTC the price would go up due to new demand from fiat fears.  This actually might occur in a relatively short period of time. With the US stock market flashing signals of the Hindenburg omen and a historically overbought bull rally we could hit a correction fairly soon. I personally think something like that will happen, but not until very late 2013/early 2014 when we see the transition of the fed chairman. 

One last thing that might occur is people might hold LTC in anticipation of the arbitrage like they have seen with BTC. They might hold in anticipation that at some point they will be able to get USD out, but think it will be a long time and don’t mind taking the risk of holding long term. 

There are other variables that could also change the outcome, but at this moment in time I think these are among the most likely. The last thing to take from this is that I am not saying that these things will happen, just that they could happen. Take it FWIW and make you own conclusions. Happy trading ☺",cryptocurrency,1376946359

* Monthly bills: $160 phone bill (I pay for my parents cell phone), $112 in metrocard (cannot bike to work, I travel all over city), $120 in monthly medical expenses, $150 on groceries
* I currently am attending school so twice a year I have to pay a tuition bill of $1400. I currently just charge around $800 on my credit card for this semesters tuition.
* I cannot get a second job on account of my current job being very time consuming and being in school part time. I am, however, very very crafty and can make a lot stuff. I am also aware of the terrible market for crafts. So ideas are appreciated.
* I spend way too much money on eating out and buying lunch (about $300 a month)
* I try to save $1000 every month. But I always end up transferring money out because I have to pay for something unexpected.

I am engaged my boyfriend and we plan on moving out as soon as he starts his second job (this month). But he has a small bit of credit card debt and wants to save money and pay off his debt before he moves out. 

If you got this far thank you for reading. I'm desperate and I have no idea what to do. There is no one else I can turn to for help because the rest of my family and friends have even more drama and bullshit to deal with.

So can I move out? And if so, how do I get this shit in order and by when can I move out?

business,Whose Interests Are Being Promoted by Federal Reserve?,"Deceptive Delusions

In the name of national security and public interest, numerous unwanted, bitter pills are forced down the public throat by governments, law makers, secret services, corporations, banks etc. Ironic but as usual, there are covert, private vested interests at play that profit at public expense, yet in the name of nation and people.

Our central bank, the Federal Reserve, was created in 1913 and was allotted the all important task of monetary policy regulation. Now, no other policy affects common citizens more conspicuously than monetary policy because it determines the prices of goods and services. Naturally, public authorities would be expected to own such an upholder of public interest.

Surprisingly, the Fed has been owned by a cartel of private bankers ever since its inception. The real shocker is the absolute unaccountability of the Fed. It is not accountable to government agencies or to Congressional Committees, no one. The activities and budgets of even our intelligence agencies are subject to oversight by Congress.

Ostensibly, such autonomy is necessary to prevent ‘interference’ of politicians who are prone to succumb to public pressure of expansion of money supply that provides short term relief from economic problems. But then, hasn’t the Fed been printing billions at least since the outbreak of the subprime crisis? And haven’t these measures failed to boost the economy?

Federal Reserve System

These answers require a glimpse into our central banking system that consists of:

-          The (National) Federal Reserve with a Board of Seven Governors

-          Twelve Regional Federal Reserve Banks in important cities across the U.S.

-          Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) determines monetary policy. It consists of seven governors of the Federal Bank and the twelve presidents of the regional federal banks

-          Consumer Financial Protection Bureau established in 2010 under the Dodd-Frank Act

Operations of the regional Federal Reserve banks are similar to private corporations. They issue stock for their member banks. The real owners and controllers of the Fed are the entities that own these member banks. These include the financial elite viz. colossal investment banks, individuals, and corporations with their hands spread across the globe.

Their representatives sit on the FOMC.  Through control over the economy of the U.S. and a greater part of the rest of the world, they determine the course of politics and history. They support pliant politicians through campaign funds, hefty remunerations, and positive publicity through the media they own.

Perpetuated Prejudice

Our present financial system is based on fiat money, fractional reserve banking (FRB), and charging of exorbitant interest on loans. This system necessitates continuous monetary expansion. Debt and money are created together and thereby we have ever expanding debt and price-rise.

This structure was mainstreamed with the creation of the Fed in 1913. The same year saw the imposition of income tax because now government would never have enough money to settle debts. The beneficiaries are the Fed and its owners that print money at zero cost but make billions by loaning it to cash strapped governments, corporations, and, of course investment banks that get to use this fresh money before it enters circulation and loses value.

Monetary expansion by the Fed has not worked because money is not being channelized into employment generation and productivity improvement, but into excessive, speculative, and misdirected investments called bubbles. These fuel more inflation and concentration of wealth. By the time money reaches the commoners, it has lost value. Naturally, they do not spend and do not create demand, defeating the very purpose of monetary expansion.

 The Road Less Taken

Addressing a century of entrenched dominance and prejudice is difficult but not impossible. The present economic slowdown was created through the greed of the financial elite. It is time we opened our eyes and started asking for reforms that address the underlying malaise, not the symptoms. We can start by studying the merits of the full gold standard.",finance,1376929168

Now, I either missed the ""how to pay individual loans"" option or it was never provided in the first place for Federal Direct website but I'm particularly happy about this as it gives me the opportunity to control which loans are reduced the quickest.

So short background, I have ~32,000 Federal Loans at various interest rates which went into repayment November 2012. Initial ""minimum"" installments was ~347.00 so I started paying a minimum 350.00/month. After a couple good commission months and income tax returns I was able to put 500.00 towards the loans a couple months in a row. This essentially gave me credit where my new current minimum is ~281.00 and I'm still paying at least a minimum 350.00 (and maximum until my wife's checks start coming in this September at which point I can hopefully increase repayment size).

Any general advice on which loan to attack first would be great. I can definitely see that I've made progress and have thought about the debt-snowball method but just am uncertain which one will be the best to initiate this with since there are multiple at the 6.8% rate. Such as taking out the smallest 6.8% rate then going towards the next one for the mental ""feel-good"" of closing out a loan as paid-in-full.  

My final question concern when the best time of month to pay towards my loans? Such as beginning of the month to pay more principle as opposed to near the due date where 1/2 months worth of interest has accrued or does it really make any difference if I'm only doing one payment monthly? 

Thanks again for taking the time to give any advice. I'll try to stay as active as I can to provide any additional information needed.",finance,1376927765

-I've moved around 5 times...usually on a whim.

I also have a car that I purchased 3 months ago with a 23% interest rate. My payment is 400/ month over a 3 year period and I put 2k down and it's nothing fancy. I haven't paid my bill in 3 months because I haven't had any income....I started a job a month ago (fired on Saturday) and will have a large enough check coming in tomorrow to get current on my car payment. I have aspirations of going to school and finishing and moving out of the city that I live in...I'd like to go to school this semester. Getting another job won't be difficult and should only take a few days (I live in a boom town) 

My question is this- I originally got the car to rebuild my credit score and so that I could get around in something dependable- my last car was a clunker that I abandoned- but now Im realizing that it was a huge mistake and Im way in over my head. I'm afraid that I wont be able to keep up the payments when I'm ready to go to a four year university. 


Actually I'm afraid that I'll be unable to manage any kind of payment at all...rent, cell phone- currently cut off- utilities, etc.

personalfinance,Car Note is hurting me financially. Relative looking for newer car. Need advice: details inside,"Hey, /r/personalfinance.

Lurker on reddit for a long time, but came across this subreddit a week ago and this is the most important time to ask a question of you. So here goes:

I'm 26 years old. My credit is not the worst, but nothing to brag about either, mainly due to some STUPID mistakes I made in college. The past is the past, I've learned from it but my credit history is affected pretty severely for the time being...

 About 3 years ago, I started a new job. I had my old college car, and finished paying it off, and about two months later, it died on me. My parents were kind enough to let me borrow their cars for about 5 months, but I knew how much of a burden it was putting on them, and with living so far away, I couldn't do it to them any more. I made a foolish mistake and went and bought a car that, at the time, I thought would be easy to afford. I should have bought a cheaper car, but I had interest in a more expensive, roomier car with better gas mileage because of the amount I travel for work (25k miles a year for work). Because of my credit, I wasn't able to get a great interest rate, so my notes are about 30% of my monthly income.

My first year of owning the car, I had moved back home, so I didn't feel the pain as much. The commute time was killer (almost two hours each way, not to mention the 2-3 hours on average I spend in my car for work). I eventually had to move back to the city, and coupled with 550 in rent, my car note and rent eat away nearly a full paycheck. I'm planning a company and career change next year, and cannot have this weight dragging onto me since the change will move me up north where I will need money to live.

Right now, I am currently unable to save much money at all. I am already living pretty frugally, and make sure not to spend money on foolish things. I may spend $20 bucks a month to attend a concert, if there is one, which is rare, or the occasional bar with friends, where I will ring up maybe a $10 tab. My other pay check gets chipped away with student loans, insurance, phone bill, and one credit card bill that I had to create for an emergency about a year ago, and is almost paid off.

Anyway, I'm trying to find ways to get rid of this car note, two years later. As of now, my car has 52k miles on it, so the value has drastically decreased (worth about 20k) and I owe 27k on it. I thought about just eating the gap with an unsecured loan but I'd end up paying the same amount on a car note, I'd assume, since my credit is still needing improvement. My sister, however, is starting her career, and would like a a newer car, like mine. She has an older car that, with some work, could last another 100k miles. Her and I were talking, and she mentioned having the title of my car signed over to her, and then going and trying to refinance the car in her name, since her credit is spectacular (the joys of being debt free because you take 20+ hours every semester and graduate 2 years early). She would hand me over her car, which has less than $2000 left on the note.

So, after that backstory, here's my question: **Is it possible to sign over the car to her for her to continue payments on it and her to be able to refinance it at a much better rate than mine?** I refuse to put her in a hole, though. So if she were to end up paying the same amount or something obscene for her, I could not, in good conscience, do that to her. I would rather live with my mistake and idiocy than brush it off to her.

If you need any clarification from me, please ask in the comments and I'll try to answer them and add them to the post.

Student loan debt: $71k, all federal loans, in deferment until 2017

No car payment, no other debts

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Background**: My husband and I are both active duty military (USAF) officers, but stationed apart--I am in the US and he is overseas.  I will be getting a raise in September of $955/month (that money will go directly into wedding savings, travel fund, and emergency fund) but will be leaving my job in January and moving to be with my husband.   He currently makes over $80k/year and will get an additional $500/mo with me as his dependent.  His job is very secure for the next 8 years and he deploys frequently, adding to the base income.  He has a good emergency fund buffer and is well in control of his spending.  No kids in our future, two cats are plenty!  Our expenses once I move will be greater, as we are both travel bugs and living in Europe, but we will continue to contribute to the TSP, personal investments, and emergency funds.  



I am working a move into the AF reserves through the IMA program, but this may not result in any income until mid-2014 and even then will be under $10k.  In the meantime, I am a full time graduate student and (if all goes to plan) will graduate in mid-2016.  I am currently financing my school with federal student loans (approx. $10k/year) and the average starting salary for someone with my professional degree is $45k with many opportunities for growth in private practice.  



**Our current plan** is for me to separate from active duty in January (DOS is already approved), move to be with my husband and continue my degree program while being a reservist, picking up small jobs, and (if paid work is unavailable) unpaid/volunteer work in my expected career field.  I would begin working in my field when we are stationed back in the US.



Two people living on a single income of $80k sounds incredibly do-able, but it will definitely be a shock to my system as I am used to being a primary breadwinner.  I have streamlined my budget as much as I know how…travel/fun trips is still pretty high but that is the one area I do spend a lot because of trans-Atlantic flights and my love of travel (exploring the area--a 400 mile radius from my home).  I am also feverishly chucking money into savings due to the looming unemployment and to give us a bigger emergency fund bucket if needed.



**My questions are these:**

**Do any of you see areas of concern with our plan?**

**Should I be investing more so I have a larger ""starting amount"" before I stop contributing for a while?**

**Do you have any ideas on how to make the transition easier?**



The student loan situation has me concerned, but I don’t think that paying them off with my emergency fund is a good idea as I am soon to be unemployed.  I have always been a primary breadwinner, so I am paranoid that I am not doing as much as I can to be prepared for this transition or that I am missing something.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on student loan repayment (federal vs. private),"Hey guys, I'm looking for some advice on the order in which to pay down my husband's student loans (currently totaling $46K). Here's the breakdown:

**Federal Loans**

$1,600 @ 6.55%

$3,900 @ 6.55%

$3,900 @ 6.55%

$3,900 @ 5.75%

$2,500 @ 2.1%

$1,850 @ 2.1%

**Private Loans**

$6,300 @ 4.00%

$5,700 @ 2.875%

$6,900 @ 2.500%

$6,200 @ 2.500%

$3,400 @ 2.500%

I know it's generally best to pay down the loans with the highest interest rates first since they cost the most... but I'm wondering if there's a point where shitty terms trump the interest rates.

Specifically, the private loans have variable interest rates and a much longer repayment period (20 years vs. 10 years). It would also be more difficult to put the private loans into forbearance in the event that one of us becomes unemployed.

personalfinance,I just need a game plan... fucked up college issues.,"URI tuition: $26,922 / year
What I have (guaranteed): $19,395 (Scholarships, federal loans, grants, and work study)
Gap: $7,527

So here's what the fuck happened. So fucking screwed up.

For weeks I thought I was approved of a $7527 Parent PLUS loan. It said it was accepted and approved online and everything. Turns out it was a mistake or something. Fucking found out today my dad was denied due to adverse credit history.


But if you're denied the parent PLUS loan, you can get $4,000 more in Stafford loans.

So either I gotta get myself approved for the parent plus loan somehow (unlikely) via finding an endorser to cosign or somehow persuading them that extenuated circumstances should allow me to get the loan despite the adverse credit is. Thing is, I don't know the policies between the extenuating circumstances. By the looks of it, sob stories don't work - you need paperwork, evidence and such... it's really only for true mistakes it seems. But... it's all discretion based.

Otherwise, if I accept the Stafford loan I will still have a $3,527 gap. IDK if I can get more work study, work out some way to milk out more of the Stafford loan... I don't know.

Then there's a perkins loan.
And private loans.  But still, my parents have the shittiest credit in the world

personalfinance,"I can't wrap my head around ""purchases that retain equity are better""","I keep getting into petty arguments with my friends/coworkers because I rent an apartment and lease a car.

I can clearly understand why leasing a car isn't the *most* frugal option by any means (a $10k used car for 6+ years is very easily understood to be the cheaper option)

I also see how home ownership leaves a person a) in a position to live with no monthly mortgage/rent payment and b) in a position to make a profit given (semi-)good circumstances/conditions.

I'm just not sure how well-understood the opposing options practicality are, and I'm having trouble conveying them to my peers.

Please correct me if I am wrong! I am here as a pupil eager to learn.

If I understand correctly, in order to make money from a home purchase, you would need to:

* sell the house for what you bought it for, plus closing costs both ways
* your house would need to appreciate by more than your mortgage rate annually (I've never seen this mentioned so it feels like something I made up out of misunderstanding)

How competitive are monthly lease payments and rent payments compared to their equity-retaining counter-parts?

With that $10k car over 6+ years, how much is going to be spent in maintenance? I don't think leasing cars indefinitely that have a price tag of around $18k-$22k (which translates to somewhere between $0 down and $180-$240/mo for leases) is too far off from the numbers that would be experienced having a $10k car depreciate and require maintenance. I am also slightly talking out of my ass with very few figures to back it up. Please, provide me some insight! The used car doesn't have to be $10k, but when is the sweet spot between ""potential longevity"" and value crossed? $5k? $12.5k? This equation totally ignores the luxury of driving a brand new, smell-less, non-creaky-door car every so often for the sake of objectivity.

I looked into home ownership opposed to renting. I hope the substitution of condo for home isn't some detail I'm severely overlooking here, but rent seemed extremely competitive.

I currently split the rent of a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment in an apartment complex. The rent has increased 0.72% annually ($10). Water/garbage services are included in the rent. The rent is $1,397. For re-signing the 1 year lease, we are awarded an upgrade from the washer/dryer combination already included with the unit.

In order to purchase a condo of comparable size, I would need to look at condos that cost between $90k-$120k. This would be between $18k-$24k before any closing costs (I'm aware this is at least semi-negotiable and able to be tied into the loan) that could be earning 5-7% annually in the stock market (given average returns over a very long time horizon). The mortgage payment with average property taxes and an average interest rate (4.65%) seems like it would be under $520 a month. The association fees run between $350-$400. I don't see a 30+ year old condo appreciating, as it is only getting older. The $500 monthly gap between rent/buy situations would be further reduced with any maintenance I would have to put into a aging, semi-antique condo.

This equation totally ignores the benefits of having a huge surplus of money at least semi-liquid (more liquid than in real estate) and the comfort of life that comes with said sum.

I apologize if I took two really specific situations and tried to make a blanket statement.",finance,1377016219
personalfinance,Why is paying off small loans with high interest rates first more efficient than paying off significantly larger loans with a smaller interest rate first?,"First, the background information.

My wife and I have three loans at the moment:

218,000 Mortgage @ 4.6% interest rate - minimum monthly payment (not including taxes/insurance/etc) is 1100

55,000 Student Loans @ 6.8% interest rate - minimum monthly payment is 400

19,000 Car Loan @ 2.8% interest rate - minimum monthly payment is 330.

I am looking all over doing research on the cheapest/fastest way to pay down all of the loans. It seems like almost every online calculator says to pay down the student loans first, and while i understand that it has a higher interest rate I do not understand how that would be the most effective way to pay off my loans with the least amount of interest. 

If the two loans were equal then yes, i would pay the higher interest rate one first. I have also read the argument that at the end of the year the 6.8% will generate more interest than the 4.6% dollar for dollar, but over the course of the loan it seems that the interest will compound and the 4.6% interest rate with a much higher loan will overtake the 6.8% in total interest accumulated.

It seems logical in my mind that i should pay off the mortgage first to a certain point (like 100k) then switch to the student loans and finish those off. 

Can anyone explain the math to me on the most efficient way to pay off those three loans? I have been googling all morning and have not come to a consensus. Thanks!

Extra information:
Together we make 7,000/mo after taxes/health insurance/etc that comes out of our check.

We spend around ~1000/mo on monthly utilities, tax, HOI, etc.

We spend another ~1000-2000/mo on going out and/or buying new electronics. Could i spend less to get out of debt faster? Yes. Do i want to? No. 

That effectively leaves us with 2k-3k extra per month to pay off the debts earlier, so i guess the root question i am trying to answer is where is it most effective to apply that money to get out of debt faster? Most calculators are spitting out between 7-10 years, which for us being fresh out of college i am happy with, but i also want to be effective with how we pay off debts. Thanks!",finance,1377014169

I currently have 2 savings accounts and a checking account. One of my savings accounts is at the same bank as my checking and has an interest rate of 0.01%.

My question is, what would be a proper amount to keep in my bank savings for emergencies (if something happens to my car and I need quick money or if I need to transfer $ to my checking)?

I have no major expenses, except for my car.
I make roughly $700 (after taxes and IRA) every 2 weeks and have an auto-transfer set up for both accounts.
Oh, and regarding the IRA, I have $50 going into every pay period. Should I bump that up so I have more money in it later on?

personalfinance,New wife and I were about to open an interest checking and savings account with Ally. Sign-up process was so difficult we gave up with serious concerns about their customer service. Any alternatives?,"Long story short:

We tried signing up online, and it said that we needed to call them to complete the process.  We call up and they say that they'll have to call us back within 3-4 days.  We ask why we need to wait 3-4 days to create an account and they could not tell us why.  (Meanwhile, we walked into our local TD Bank and opened an account in 20 minutes)

On the 4th day, we get a call saying that they need a copy of her drivers license since she recently changed her last name.  We fax it over and they tell us it'll take 24 hours just to confirm that they received the fax.

After waiting 3 more days for them to call us, we finally decide to call them back and they tell us that the fax was too dark and they couldn't read the license info.  We ask why they couldn't call us when they realized it was too dark and they told us that there was a note in the account to call, but are not sure why no one called.

After all of this, we have serious doubts about Ally's customer service.  If they make it so difficult for us to open an account, how difficult will it be to get our money in case of an emergency??

personalfinance,In desperate need of solid advice concerning taking out loans to pay for grad school and surgeries!,"Here is my situation:
I'm a 27 year old U.S. citizen currently living out of the country with very little savings (a few thousand).

I'm planning to return to the U.S. very soon in order to pursue a doctorate in physical therapy. I'm intending to pay for this through loans and scholarships. 

I have a few health problems which are heavily weighing on me and really need to be addressed in order for me to be able to live a happy youth. Specially, I need surgery to repair a torn labrum and a torn lateral meniscus. I also may need to continue paying to treat DVT, which I have been recovering from since last winter.

I won't have health insurance initially, but am interested in what's available through the new marketplace opening this October. It's a little difficult to find clear details about it but I'm optimistic.


Obviously I am facing the potential of some very significant debt and am pretty apprehensive of positioning myself that way -- I've heard a lot of horror stories. At the same time, I'm not sure what better options I have which will still allow me to feel like I'm in control of my life and doing something respectable with it.

All told, my thinking is sort of life this: I know what I want to do with my life (physical therapy) and am very determined to succeed. I can't be happy with my life if I'm living it injured and unable to do physical activities that I love. In that case, any amount of money that I have to borrow is a worthwhile investment. Of course I want to keep it to a minimum and get a reasonable interest rate, but in the end I'll choose debt with good health and medical expertise to getting by in a job that I don't enjoy and watching my body slowly deteriorate further.

What are the chances I'd be able to ever recover from say ~$125k?

personalfinance,"Trying to help my mother get her finances in order. Five credit cards, car, house, bills, etc.","Going to try to make this as succinct as I possibly can.  Main questions are in bold for a kind of TL;DR.

My mom has a the following 5 credit cards (credit card : balance @ interest)...

* American Express: $3,800 @ 26.99%

* Visa Avian: $2,700 @ 24.99%

* Mastercard: $14,500 @ 19.90%

* Visa 1: $600 @ 11.90%

* Visa 2: $6,500 @ 11.90%

So a grand total of some $28k at an average of 19.14% interest.

However, she also has a Line of Credit open in her name at the bank.  Currently, it has a balance of $7k, with a limit of $50k.  This has an interest rate of 5.20%.  It's open and active, she's approved; the line of credit is not speculative, it's hers to use.

I was thinking of advising her of the following:

* Use the Line of Credit to immediately pay off all of the credit cards that are sucking down her payments to interest, effectively amalgamating all her major debt into one spot with 15% less interest.  Make the largest payment she can afford every month (with wiggle room after bills and such.)

* Stop using all but *exactly one* credit card and ensure that the full balance of the card is paid of at the end of the month, every month.


**Is this good advice?  Does it make fiscal sense?**

Item 2 is the mortgage.

She currently owes $160k at a 2.99% interest rate, which is fixed.  I think she is actually doing really well on this part, and here's why.  Her required payment is $800, which is some principle, some interest, and the tax on those both.  However, she pays double this amount per month, which means that 100% of the chunk of that second payment that is not interest ($620; interest is $180) is going straight to the priciple of the house loan.  

**That's a really good thing, right?**

Aside from all of that stuff, she has the normal bills, insurance stuff, and a car loan.  Those all have room for improvement, which she will be working on (ie cutting down on spending and such), but are pretty fixed and managable.  She's just very uncomfortable with the debt, and I'm very concerned about the interest rates she is facing given the interest rate I *think* she could be paying (by using the Line of Credit).

I'm a bit confused on which to pay down first, however, and would like some help. 

My thought process is to pay down the car loan so that the principal is about equivalent to the 6.8% student loans, then start paying extra to the student loans and scale back car payments to the minimum.

Reading here, everybody says to pay off highest interest rate debt first, but it seems like I'd end up paying more in interest overall by paying down the high interest student loans first and leaving a large principal at 5.5%. 

And where should Loan 8 come into play? Do I pay off Loans 1-7 and the car before tackling it?

I'm new to this (obviously) so all advice is appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1377106685

personalfinance,25 year old college graduate looking to buy a house,"Going to try and be as concise as possible.

One AES student loan $5k that my father insists that he pays. I am credit card debt free and my only other debt is a $5k left on a car valued at roughly $8-9k. This will be paid off in two years.

Started my current job at 35k/yr one year ago. I am now at 40k after a merit and Microsoft Certification raise. I have been all but promised a promotion in the coming months which would entail a minimum of 50k/yr. I know that I can not plan my life on what-ifs or things not set in stone, so lets assume I'm **NOT** getting the raise and am making $40k/yr which is basically worse case scenario and very unlikely to happen.

I contribute the maximum for company match to my 401k which is 6%/3%. I just opened a ROTH IRA which I will be direct depositing $50/week into. An additional $100 is direct deposited into my savings account while the remainder of my check goes into my checking account which is responsible for all bills and spending.

My take home ""spending and bill"" money after all savings/investments is roughly 1.8k/month. I have the ability to pick up ""on call"" shifts at work that pay $400 and $100 a week before taxes. I could feasibly pick up one of each a month for a total of $500.

I currently have about 6.5k in savings, 1k in checking, and am looking to buy a home in the future with a budge around 130k. I have been pre-approved for this value with estimated monthly payments of 1k. At 5% I currently have enough for the initial purchase but would otherwise be broke.

I have budgeted bills/mortgage/food/gas/utilities and have come out at about 2k/month with slight over-estimation just to be save. It is entirely feasible that I could get my actual budget down to 1.8k by just being smart with my purchases.

Given the market and interest rates I feel a little pressured to buy as soon as possible. For personal reasons I am looking to buy as soon as possible regardless of this fact so I am not looking to buy only because the market is attractive to buyers.

personalfinance,"In our low twenties, married, Surprise Baby!","I first want to preface this by saying that my wife and I are in a very fortunate position with our finances, and we are super excited to be having a baby. With that being said, I just want think this all through and potentially get some advice. I’m using a throwaway and being purposefully vague because there is a lot of stuff here that’s private, including the fact that she’s pregnant.

**Background:**

* My wife and I are both in our early 20’s, both graduated from a prestigious private university, are relatively financially adept, and live in a high cost of living area. Our baby is due in March. We have a budget, and keep track of everything closely on Mint. However, when we would go over the budget in the past we just kind of let it happen. I guess you can call it undisciplined budgeting. 

**Income/Assets:**

* Me: $19,000/yr graduate school stipend. Summer funding bumps it up to ~24,000/yr but it is not guaranteed. I will be in the program for about 5 more years, at which point I am going to try and go the academia route, and we will probably be moving somewhere. Despite being a very difficult field to enter, my program has a good history of job placement, and I am confident in myself. I would rather fail going this route than succeed in another.

* Wife: $45,000/yr as a high school teacher. She is very happy with the job, and has good job security. Since the baby is due in March, my wife will use her accumulated sick days and then go on unpaid leave until summer starts, so her income will be less this year. She will go back to work in the fall once summer is over.

* Emergency Fund: $12,000 in our savings account. This is down from $17,000 earlier this year. As I said, undisciplined budgeting. However, we spent the money going on trips, going out for nice dinners, and generally having fun. In retrospect, I am glad we spent it. 

* Checking Account: I like keeping it at ~$1500.

* Parents in law: $20,000-$40,000/yr for the foreseeable future. This is meant for us to invest long term. This is pretty much an early, not estate taxed, inheritance ($14,000/yr gift limit, but it’s per person giving and per person receiving, so hypothetically, if you plan it right, you can gift $56,000/yr to a couple.) We have ~$60,000 in the account now. Consider this money illiquid.

* Car: New car bought with cash in 2011. We plan to drive it until we can’t, and we make sure to keep up on maintenance. We are okay with 1 car for now. We are comfortable using it for baby transportation.

**Debt/Expenses:**

* Rent: $1350/mth, 2 br apartment, utilities and parking included. This is an *extremely* good deal for our area, and we will be staying here until I graduate and we move. In retrospect, I am glad we got the 2 br.

* Groceries: $350-$450/mth. I‘ve been trying to cut this down, but I think it might be indicative of the cost of living in our area. I switched from our regular supermarket to Trader Joe’s, which helps. Not buying wine anymore at the grocery store helps as well.

* Eating out/ Travel: I’m not going to list our entire budget, mainly because these are the two areas that we consistently go over. We live far from our families, so anytime we visit it is expensive. We also eat out a lot, but we have been reining this in since we found out about the pregnancy.

* Debt: I have $20,000 in federal student loans. Payments are deferred while I’m in school, but $17,000 of it collects interest during that time period at 3.6%-6.4% (the other $3000 is subsidized and does not collect interest while I’m in school. I’m letting inflation do its job on that loan for now.) I have been paying $240/month to the loans. My wife does not have any student loans or debt.

* Credit: We both have credit in the high 700s low 800s. We always pay our credit card in full each month. I think the spending limit is up to $11,600.

**Questions:**

1. My priority right now is to get as much money into our savings account as possible between now and when the baby comes. The $12,000 emergency fund we have already is keeping me from going into a panic, but I would like more wiggle room. Do you think I should divert my student loan payments into our saving account for the time being? Since the loans are deferred, it won’t make a difference other than the interest will start to grow.

2. Starting next September we will start needing to use daycare, which looks like a terrifyingly high expense. I have a flexible schedule, but I don’t think it is smart for me to postpone finishing my program to care for the baby. It puts into question a lot of future earning potential. Any advice?

3. Any general advice for keeping finances in order with a baby on the way? I always hear a baby is only as expensive as you make it, but so far the baby seems pretty expensive. Long term, we will probably be fine, but it is the next couple years I am worried about.

I've read suggestions here before saying I should save up for an emergency fund, ~6 months of expenses, before I start paying back my loans. This isn't really possible because my student loans are about to kick in. Should I still slowly but surely be saving up for my emergency fund?

Currently making 48k a year (IT consultant) before taxes. Contributing 6% to 401k. 401k portfolio is split 50/30/20 in order, with John Hancock:

* 500 Index Fund with JHAM = 0.53% -Growth+Income (Large Blend)
* Mid Cap Index Fund with JHAM = 0.56% - Growth (Mid-Cap Blend)
* Small Cap Growth Index Fund with Vangaurd = 0.76% - Aggresive growth (small growth)

Loans without consolidation would be about $1300 a month. It is possible but i budgeted $1000. (with the $1000 towards loans and having other expenses covered (Rent/Utilities/Food/Gas/Gym) it would leave me with about $600-500 a month free cash).

Zero credit card debt (I only use my credit card for gas/groceries because I get cash back. I pay it off in full each month)

$3,500 Emergency fund sitting in savings account. I feel like this is a fairly good number that will last me atleast a few months if absolutely needed.

Approx. $320 worth of bitcoins. Bought ~5BTC back when they were ~$45/BTC, sold a few when they were trading at ~$210/BTC and I've been holding on to 3BTC ever since. More or less just keeping these in case the market spikes up again.

Questions:
1) Should I sell my remaining EXC stock and apply it to my student loan? I've been leaning towards this idea for the last few weeks but the greater fool in me thinks that it'll rebound back a bit more each day.

2) What should I do with the VGHCX stock? I feel like it is too good an investment to sell off all so is there a way I can have the monthly dividends just get transferred into my checking account and apply them directly to my student loan each month?

3) I have been with my company for almost 1yr (Early October is my 1yr anniversary) and will soon be signed up in their 401k plan. They match up to 3%, how much should I be contributing?

4)I have a 2004 Subaru Legacy w/ 102k miles on it sitting in the garage at my parents house. I just had to replace the head gasket and some of the exaust parts. All together probably put ~$2,600 in it. Should I sell it and buy another vehicle or keep driving it until it falls apart? I live about 8 blocks from my work and I usually ride my bike or get a ride with my girlfriend (who has her own car) so I don't necessarily need a vehicle but it would be very convenient for small trips that I make without my girlfriend (friends live about a 1hr drive away, 4hrs by train...damn you SEPTA). My parents pay my insurance on the Legacy and it is completely paid off. I think I could afford about a $150-$200 monthly payment on a car loan. Not sure how much trade-in I could get for the Legacy and I can probably put an additional $2k down on a loan if i saved up for another month or so.

Praying that formats correctly...

The Citi bank card and CB&amp;T card are both accounts with two balances on each account. They way the minimum payments work is: There is one minimum payment for the entire account, but anything over the minimum goes towards the highest interest rate(so currently it would be going towards the 19.99% for the citi card.) Also worth noting, if they payed only the minimum($200), the way it handles payment is something along the lines of $180 to the 3.99% and $20 to the 19.99%, but paying $400, $180 still goes to the 3.99% but $220 goes to the 3.99%. This is presumably the same for the CB&amp;T card.

 I graduate this December and already have a couple jobs lined up, just waiting to pull the trigger. Lowest offer is 60k/yr so I plan to pay off my remaining student loans (&gt;11,000 subsidized) and then pay off the loans my parents took out for me as soon as possible.

My dad is a general and has been pretty busy but with construction there are always slow seasons and nothing is ever guaranteed so they like to have access to a good amount of their equity just in case. Because of this my mom wants to pay more towards the equity, which she sometimes puts an extra $300-$400 towards, but not usually. I told her she should only be worrying about the card with the highest interest at this point.

Is there anything more they can be doing? They don't do much investing at all (less than $100 straight from paycheck to 401k/roth i forget which) which I'm pretty sure is the correct thing to be doing since the interest rates are so high.

investing,Gold Fraud Investment Tips :Q2 Gold Demand: WGC Can’t Spell ‘Decoupling’ - exploreB2B,"What actually happened in the gold market during the second quarter of 2013? The One Bank launched one of its most savage assaults on bullion markets throughout the entire course of this 13-year bull market, causing all-time record demand for gold – while the market for its (fraudulent) paper-called-gold collapsed.

Decoupling

However (potential) gold investors wanting information on those events would have been hard-pressed to decipher what really happened in bullion markets from the fictionalized account of the World Paper Council for Q2. Despite observing itself that demand for paper-called-gold (NYSEARCA:GLD) suffered the largest crash ever, while demand for real gold experienced its greatest spike ever; the WGC simply finds it impossible to spell the word d-e-c-o-u-p-l-i-n-g.
This should not be a surprise to regular readers, who now understand that the WGC is little more than a mouthpiece for the One Bank. So when it comes to describing the crimes of the bankers in bullion markets, the mantra is “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.”
Some may attempt to argue that the report of the WGC does try to portray a (somewhat) bullish picture in the sector. It did report that demand for gold bars hit an all-time high. It did report that demand for minted coins hit an all-time. It did mention that global jewelry demand spiked to a five-year high.
But what choice does it have? It is (at least supposedly) the World “Gold” Council. And while it does its best to hide data on the gold market (only two years of supply/demand numbers exists for a commodity (NYSEARCA:DBC) which has traded for thousands of years), at the very least it will always be forced to report current sales data.
What we had here was the World Paper Council deliberately understating the most-explosive quarter in the history of the world’s gold market. What did the WGC lead with in its deceptive account of this quarter? A fictionalized number which it calls “total demand” – which (as its tag-team partner, Kitco immediately reported) was “down 12% from the same period a year ago.”
In the most-explosive quarter for demand in the history of the gold market, we have the WGC beginning its pseudo-report talking about falling demand. Of course what it calls “total demand” is the demand for real gold minus the plummeting demand for the Banksters’ paper-called-gold.
However, there can no longer be any possible excuse in reporting demand for gold and demand for paper-called-gold as a single number, for two reasons. The most-obvious reason is the dichotomy: thedecoupling we have seen in this market as demand for the One Bank’s paper-fraud products collapsed at the same moment that demand for gold hit an all-time high.
The second reason, while not as spectacular is no less imperative. The bullion banks (via the Corporate Media) have implicitly confessed that all of their own paper-called-gold is just paper.
When the Banksters attacked the gold market in Q2, driving down prices, demand exploded in India – still clinging to the mantle of “world’s largest gold market” (just ahead of China). Since India produces virtually no gold itself, this produced a gigantic gold deficit. How did the bankers and the Corporate Media insist (again and again) that they could “fix” this gold deficit? By selling Indians more of their own paper-called-gold.
And as I rebutted again and again in my own commentaries; as a simple proposition of arithmetic/logic the only way that selling “paper gold” could alleviate a “gold deficit” is if you are merely selling paper, and calling it gold. Fraud – now out in the open.

But all of this is totally invisible to the World Paper Council. Indeed, it allowed itself to be pimped-out by the One Bank, sending some of its own foot soldiers to India as sleazy “front men” to try to increase the success of these fraudsters in selling Indians paper-called-gold.
Thus when the WGC adds demand for gold, and demand for paper-called-gold together, and calls it total demand; it’s not comparing “apples and oranges.” It’s comparing apples with paper apples. In the former proposition we are dealing with two fruits; in the latter, a fruit and a poor imitation of a fruit. One does not report “total Rolex demand” by adding up demand for genuine Rolex watches plus all the millions of cheap knock-offs also sold around the world as “a Rolex.”
Yet this is precisely what the World Paper Council is now doing in headlining “global gold demand” with the fraudulent number it calls “total demand.” The global gold market has decoupled. It’s merely the One Bank, the Corporate Media, and the World “Gold” Council who are trying to pretend this didn’t happen.
Trying hard. Indeed, the bullion banks were forced to soak-up so much of their own fraudulent paper-called-gold, that they themselves are now officially “long gold” (in a typically perverse sort of way). This was forced upon them as the only alternative to the Decoupling reaching such a magnitude that it would have been absolutely impossible to wallpaper over it – even with the Corporate Media’s ‘industrial-strength’ propaganda.
What would have happened if the bullion banks had not stepped into this market (as buyers), a market where there were no buyers because of the panic caused by their own attacks on this market (and the relentless, gold-bashing propaganda which accompanied it)? Obviously the collapse in total holdings of paper-called-gold would have been far more spectacular.
But more important than that is it prevented a much larger decoupling in price between the gold market and the imitation-gold market. As it was, the discount at which the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) was trading reached its highest level ever, while (simultaneously) the “premiums” for real gold were soaring to their highest levels ever.
The combined effect was to produce a price-decoupling in bullion markets of approximately 20%. But how large would the price-differential have gotten if the Banksters had not stepped in, in such a large way that the world’s biggest Shorts are now “long gold”? Conceivably their paper-called-gold fraud products could have simply gone to zero.
With no buyers to soak-up the vast quantities of that shunned paper, what was merely a Decoupling could have easily become a full-fledged “run” on paper-called-gold – a stampede which fed upon itself until (when the dust settled) there was simply nothing left of the Banksters fraudulent “gold” empire.
We have more evidence of the complicity of the World Paper Council when it tries to characterize the events of the quarter. What did we see? Prices falling sharply while demand spiked to its highest level ever. There is no legitimate explanation for that event. As anyone with even a minimal understanding of markets grasps, demand drives prices.
What made this totally perverse outcome possible was the Flight Out Of Paper, as the Smart Money was fleeing the Banksters’ paper-called-gold market at precisely the same time they were also fleeing theirCyprus bank accounts…just weeks ahead of the Cyprus Steal. A remarkable set of coincidences.
How did the myopic WGC see this same world?
…demand for gold investment products in Q2 conceals a less clear-cut picture: one of professional investors liquidating ETF’s while investors in Asian and Middle Eastern markets eagerly absorbed the gold coming onto the market in the form of bars and coins. This divergent picture highlights the unique balance in the gold market, which sees demand from one sector compensating for declines elsewhere.[emphasis mine]
Bravo! In describing the decoupling between the gold market and the paper-called-gold market as a “unique balance”; the World Paper Council has produced a perverse euphemism of which Machiavelli himself would have been proud. The problem is that this is not what happened in the real world.
Had the absurd “unique balance” to which the WGC refers actually existed, and a mere transfer taken place from West-to-East from “gold” (in paper-form) to “gold” in the form of coins of bars; there would have been no overall decline in inventories. Instead, as readers saw in the real world; the Comex paper-fraud market experienced its greatest collapse in gold inventories ever – with no commensurate “inventory” magically appearing in Asia.
What we saw was “professional investors” selling 12% more paper-called-gold than the real gold which was purchased in physical form (as reported by the WGC itself). Yet inventories of actual gold plummeted. As an empirical fact, most (if not all) of what those “professional investors” in the West were selling wasjust paper.
Of course with Western investors fleeing the fraudulent world of the One Bank’s paper-called-gold in Q2, while ordinary Asian citizens (i.e. non-investors) soaked-up more than a thousand tons of real gold (at fire-sale prices); this does certainly beg the question of who are the real “professionals”?

personalfinance,Is this too much credit for me?,"Hi all. I am new to this sub-reddit and I ask that you bear with me here. I am 20 years old and live at home while I go to school full time. I am lucky enough to have parents who pay for everything except my own entertainment, car payment (they pay insurance) and credit cards. I work part time at my school making minimum wage, but I do not live outside my means by any stretch. I have a Cap One Journey card that is over a year old and has almost always had a balance on it. I pay more than the minimum payment every month. Over the past few days, I noticed my credit score has been stagnant for 6 months or so, so I decided I should apply for some credit cards in order to open up more accounts (as of now, I have 5 with the 2 new cards I was approved for. Student loans, car loan and now 3 credit cards). I also decided this would help my utilization. I applied for the discover it card and was approved for a $1k limit at 0% APR for 14 months, then 10.99%, which is the lowest the card goes. I plan on transferring the balance (just over $200) from the cap one to the discover when I get the card because I have 0% APR for 14 months on purchases and BTs. I also applied tonight for a Blue Cash Everyday AMEX and was approved, but cannot find the credit limit until tomorrow. I would assume its going to be at least $1000. I do not plan on using either card much, save for the holiday season when Discover offers 5% cash back at amazon and online retailers. The AMEX is probably only going to be used for gas when the 5% cash back from discover runs out in September as it gives 2% cash back all the time on gas, which I will pay as soon as the cash back posts (same goes for discover if I use that for something like gas). I am graduating college next year in June and should have a full-time job within 6 months.

TL;DR is having 3 credit cards (cap one $500, discover it $1000 and now Blue Cash Everyday AMEX at least $1000) too much? Did I just shoot myself in the foot? Or is this going to be enough for me to really start building my credit, as the Journey card has served its purpose and is now not viable due to its 19.8% interest rate.",finance,1377059433

Praying that formats correctly...

The Citi bank card and CB&amp;T card are both accounts with two balances on each account. They way the minimum payments work is: There is one minimum payment for the entire account, but anything over the minimum goes towards the highest interest rate(so currently it would be going towards the 19.99% for the citi card.) Also worth noting, if they payed only the minimum($200), the way it handles payment is something along the lines of $180 to the 3.99% and $20 to the 19.99%, but paying $400, $180 still goes to the 3.99% but $220 goes to the 3.99%. This is presumably the same for the CB&amp;T card.

 I graduate this December and already have a couple jobs lined up, just waiting to pull the trigger. Lowest offer is 60k/yr so I plan to pay off my remaining student loans (&gt;11,000 subsidized) and then pay off the loans my parents took out for me as soon as possible.

My dad is a general and has been pretty busy but with construction there are always slow seasons and nothing is ever guaranteed so they like to have access to a good amount of their equity just in case. Because of this my mom wants to pay more towards the equity, which she sometimes puts an extra $300-$400 towards, but not usually. I told her she should only be worrying about the card with the highest interest at this point.

Is there anything more they can be doing? They don't do much investing at all (less than $100 straight from paycheck to 401k/roth i forget which) which I'm pretty sure is the correct thing to be doing since the interest rates are so high.

personalfinance,"(Small victory, also would love advice) discussed the budget with the wife, and shockingly had a really great time doing it! [warning: long (sorry)]","So we've been in the mindset for the past few months that some time late next year, we're going to be buying a house. We know the potential areas we want to buy in (unfortunately, not super cheap areas), they both have fantastic school systems and this is the area we'll be staying in long term as we settle down to start a family. We knew we needed money saved for a down payment, but never sat down and truly budgeted the way we should have. The goal was more just ""don't overspend, throw excess into savings"". Some back of the napkin math said it would work fine. Well, of course, what are a couple of 20-something DINK's going to do? Spend. 

We realized this week that our current approach was useless. We barely have a sufficient emergency fund, let alone any kind of appreciable down payment savings.

We decided to sit down and flush out our budget: all our monthly expenditures, what our goals are savings wise, how much we'll need, how much house we want to buy vs how much we can afford (we can easily afford houses in our area, which unfortunately, aren't super cheap, but our goal is to find something that still puts us under our current rent rate for the mortgage payments). 

We knew this would be stressful, so to try and ease things, we made a date night out of it. She made up some dinner, packed it into a picnic basket, and we brought our cat down to the park with us where we had an awesome time, then tacked on the budget discussion at the end. We were actually a lot more on the same page than I thought we were, and it's helped ease my mind a TON about the whole process (I have bad anxiety and worry about money *constantly*, even though we're fine, so this was huge for me).

We determined that by making a few lifestyle adjustments and by making a weekly meal plan/grocery list, we can easily get by living off my paycheck alone. We're going to set up her direct deposit to go directly to the savings account, and life off just mine at least until late next year. By then, we calculated, we'll have at LEAST 15% down for the top of our budget, and if we can find something on the cheaper end, we'll hit 20% no problem. 



So now to my questions: 

* From what I understand from reading this subreddit, the reason 20% is the golden number to have for a down payment is to avoid PMI. If you're short of 20%, you need to pay PMI until you've reach 20% equity in the house. However, I've seen some people here recently mention that this rule has changed? That it now applies to the life of the loan if you don't START the loan with 20%? If someone could give me a basic rundown on the rules behind this, I'd appreciate it.

* What are some tips or tricks that could help us with following through? It's our biggest issue any time we ever set any kind of concrete ""rule"", be it working out more, dieting, budgeting, etc. The two things we do have going for us now though are that we have clear, defined, concrete goals (which we usually don't) and that her money will automatically be tied up in savings, so there will be a big deterrent to ever reaching for it unless we're in an emergency fund type situation. Is there anything else you can recommend that will help us remind ourselves to stay on track?

* How soon is too soon to start talking to realtors? The bank? We're not planning on buying until at least August of 2014. When should we start those discussions? What I'd REALLY love to be able to do is go to the bank and ask them ""Based on this theoretical number we'll have saved up, and based on our current income and credit history, what kind of interest rate and loan amounts could we *potentially* qualify for?"" Is that something they'd do this far out, even if it's just a rough ballpark? I don't trust all these online mortgage calculators. Just because I have enough money to pay 2500 a month for a mortgage doesn't mean it's a smart thing to do (or that a bank would actually agree to do it). 

* Most/all of the realtors fees are covered by the SELLER, correct? As in, the realtor I go talk to won't be paid by me at all? 

* What are some things to watch out for when it comes to picking a realtor? I've gotten several recommendations from friends and family, but are there any gotchas or redflags I should look out for, as a buyer?

* What kind of unexpected costs should I be planning for? Things like closing costs, inspections, other misc. fees, it all adds up. I want to be prepared for those costs in my budget so I don't end up having to lower my downpayment or increase my loan just to cover them.

* Someone I talked to recently said that homeowners insurance typically want a year of insurance payments in advance held in escrow. I know SOME about escrow accounts but not a whole lot. They're basically an account that rolls the mortgage, insurance, and taxes into one monthly payment, correct? If anyone could more clearly define them for me (or point me to a good resource) I'd appreciate it.

personalfinance,Mortgage Math,"I'm guessing that many people will find this obvious but it tripped me up from the normal logic that I thought of in terms of loan repayment so I wanted to share.

**The situation** is that two loans were opened at approximately the same time. Both were 30 yr, fixed rate mortgages at 4.0%. One for the amount of $50,000 and the second for $81,000.

**My previous thought** was that since both loans were for the same interest, for all purposes they could be viewed as a single debt as I was going to pay 4% interest on the sum of the loan balances. This meant extra payments could be made on either loan for equivalent benefit.

**My realization** is that while it's true my total interest payment will be 4% the interest of the sum of the loans; extra mortgage payments do not directly reduce the [total] interest paid on a loan but rather skip the next X number of payments. Where X is a function of both loan balance and remaining [number of] payment[s]. ~~Thus, it is best to make payments on the loan with more repayments/higher balance.~~

**The math**: Mortgage 1 has had numerous extra payments applied over the last year. The remaining balance is $40,000. Which means without additional extra payments the loan will cost a total of + $13,200 over the next 20 years. An extra payment at this point of $1,000 effectively mean skipping the next 9 months of interest; which would have totaled nearly $1,200.

Mortgage 2 has only had regular payments for the same year. Therefore it's balance is ~$78,000 and will cost $136,000 over the next 29 years. However, an extra payment at this point for the same $1,000 will mean that the loan will again effectively skip ahead by 9 months (if you follow a monthly amortization chart). However, the interest saved in this case would have totaled in excess of $2,100.

**Conclusion** While it's obvious once you think about it I still have an instinct to treat the two mortgages as a sum balance I need to pay down whilst paying a lump interest (which only works if they had equivalent minimum payments). **It should be noted the math will work out equivalently if you were to pay a single amount on both loans which totals at minimum the sum of the monthly payments throughout the life of both loans (e.g. $1,000/mo till both mortgages were paid could be applied in anyway).** However, for purposes of inconsistent extra payments (tax refund, etc) more than interest rate must be factored when determining which loan to apply the payment to maximize the money saved. In the example above you get 2.1x your payment amount vs 1.2x.

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this math. [I'm not wrong, but it's also not incredibly useful information and should not determine which loan you pay. But I find it interesting nonetheless.]

**Edit** The fact that so many argue my original assumption makes me believe that 1) I'm not alone in my original thought and 2) I didn't explain the limited specifics of when the math differs very well. Here is a simple example.
[Mortgage Calculator with one time payment options](https://origin.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.aspx)

$165,000 loan at 7% will cost $230,189.68 in interest. Making a single $5,000 extra payment at 1yr reduces the total interest to $200,788.53. A savings of $29,401.15.

$65,000 loan at 7% will cost $90,680.78 in interest. Making a single $5,000 extra payment at 1yr reduces the total interest to $65,161.25. A savings of $25,519.53.

A savings difference of $3,881.62 for a single $5,000 payment when applied to the higher balance mortgage even though both are the same interest rate.

**Edit 2** I'm not saying I stumbled onto anything radical. As /u/ResoluteMan pointed out and I stated above, snowballing the first loan payment into the second will mean that your net savings is the same. Everyone knows if applying a single extra payment to a mortgage you'll get more savings doing so in year 1 than year 29 of the loan. My only realization is that the same logic is true when comparing two different loans as well.",finance,1377196050

I have no credit whatsoever and no titles in my name. I have just short of a full ride, and I have an account through learningquest for student expenses. 

First question:I have decided that I need to get a credit card to build good credit (a card that would be used SOLELY FOR GAS, and NOTHING else so that I know I can always pay it). I'd like a card with no fees, a low interest rate and preferably some form of benefit... I'm really overwhelmed by the number of cards out there and have no idea what would be right for me. 

-I fly to Buenos Aires, Argentina about once a year, so would a frequent flier card be a good idea? Or would it save me more in the long run to get a card with cash back on gas, since that's all I'd be using the card for? 

-Also, what's a good interest rate on a credit card, and is it true that letting a couple bucks roll over to the next month is GOOD for your credit?


Second question: Vet school is ridiculously expensive. I'm looking at anything between 150K and 300K and I have no idea how to pay for it. I have about $2400 in a savings account, and I'll have some money left in my learning quest account, but that's not even close to enough. 

-Should I consider investing my money, or would I need a lot more than 2400 to make money with my money? If so, where/how do I invest?

-Would it be cheaper/easier to pay my school off as I go and pull out loans when I'm out of savings, or to pull out loans from the get-go and use my savings to pay off my loans so that I don't step out of school and immediately get hit with loan payments?

Bitcoin,Using BTC in Business - Form 8300,"Lets say that I run a small car dealership. I try to be honest, comply with DMV regulations, keep accurate records of all profits made, and pay my taxes. I do however highly value the privacy of my customers. I feel bad every time I file a Form 8300 (cash transactions over $10,000). I believe the BSA is unconstitutional and the government should not be meddling in private business transactions. My customers are law abiding citizens and nothing makes me believe they have done anything worth reporting.

Now the 8300 regulations state that any cash (or cash equivalent transaction such as money orders or cashiers checks or foreign currency at the spot price of $10k USD) transactions must be reported. Any ""suspicious"" transactions such as the customer deliberately asking how to avoid an 8300 and structuring the transactions must be reported. I am also not allowed to structure transactions or deliberately fail to file (""Hey pay me an extra $500 and i'll forget to file..."" -or- ""Pay me $9k today in cash and $5k in check tomorrow...""). I violate these I pay hefty fines and\or spend 5 years in federal prison. The IRS has run 8300 sting operations on dealers.

The 8300 requirements do not apply to barter however. If a car is $12,000 and the person gives me $8,000 + trade in I do not have to file. Extending that idea I could accept 3 chickens, a horse, a boat, and his wife for a car and not have to file if I so wanted to. Does that extend to BTC? Is trading in BTC the equivalent of a barter transaction such as being paid in ""monopoly money""? or does the US government view BTC as. a currency?

My goal is not to cheat tax. I plan to immediately sell the BTC and pay tax on the current market value (just as if I sold a car for 3 chickens and a horse). My goal is to protect my customers privacy.

Before a customer decides to pay I could give them a paper describing 8300, reporting requirements, barter transactions, and BTC. I can give this paper to every customer purchasing a car over $10k so that I am not aiding in structuring (I do not want to aid, only inform people of their legal rights). I will give no further advice or say no more. It is up to the customer to make an informed decision on how to pay me.",cryptocurrency,1377164492

 My credit is 713. I've built it up a bit by making payments on the school loans I already have. I don't have anyone who I can ask to be a cosigner for me.

He didn't have to get any loans to pay for college, and didn't have a credit card or anything until very recently, so he hasn't really had a chance to build his up at all. My credit is actually higher than his at the moment just because of the loan payments I have made.

personalfinance,"Not sure if I should save or pay off loans, need a little advice.","This is going to be a long post, so sit tight. I feel I have a decent grasp of finances but I still have so much to learn and I know that while I can understand how I should be spending my money, I am absolutely TERRIBLE at applying that knowledge. Here goes.

I graduated with my Bachelor's this past December from an in-state University. My mom didn't have any money to spare, so I had to take out student loans for every cent. I also changed my mind on what I wanted to do with my life, and changed majors 5 times in college. Long story short, it took me 6 years to graduate and I have just under 80k in student loan debt. I worked all through college to pay rent and food and books as much as I could out of pocket, but I didn't save anything. By the time I graduated, I was making 42k/year as restaurant manager. I knew once I had my degree (Computer Systems Technology) I wanted to get into the tech industry as soon as possible and end my restaurant career. 

I managed to find a job in March of this year, just a couple months after graduation. The only problem is that it was at a non-profit and my starting salary was 35k/year, which was a huge pay cut from where I was at the restaurant. However, I have full benefits (Health, Dental, Vision, Life) at VERY reasonable rates, and I went from 60hrs a week to 9-5. Quality of life skyrocketed. Enough backstory, time to get to the numbers.

I was paying $600/mo for rent which was actually pretty reasonable in the college town where I live, but at the beginning of August I managed to find an apartment twice as big for $450/mo. 

I originally had 1 credit card, I kept it pretty low, around $4-500 a month out of a $1200 limit. I got a big raise at the restaurant and moved into an unfurnished apartment so I put $400 down on a new bed and opened a line of credit for the other $800. A month later my car breaks down and I have to open a credit card with Sears to get my car repaired for $1200. They jerked me around and never fixed anything, I was out a couple hundred and had to go to a different place to get my car fixed and open a new credit there. All told, within 2-3 months I had opened 3 new cards and managed to max them all. I was not doing this adulthood thing right.

Heres where I stand right now:
Card 1 - 27.24% - Balance of $831.84
Card 2 - 25.24% - Balance of $1332.00
Card 3 - 24.90% - Balance of $800
Card 4 - 29.99% - Balance of $0

I just paid off the highest interest one, which is my emergency card for car repairs. 

My student loans are through 2 companies. My first half are all through Sallie Mae, 7 loans totaling $46,528. Interest rates of 4.5, 5.25, 5.75, 8.25, 8.5, 9.25, 11.75%.

My other half were through Direct Loans, but recently got transferred to Great Lakes. They are 5 loans (4 subsidized, 1 unsub) totaling $32,214. Interest rates of 4.5, 5.6, 6.0, 6.8, 6.8%.

Because I work at a non-profit, I have access to a 403.b. However, I am not currently paying into it. I only plan on living in this town until my SO graduates from college, so 2-3 years. My work will match up to 50%, for a total of 3% of my salary, but it only vests 20% every year, starting with the 2nd year. I would have to stay 6 years to get the full 100%. 

Here are my questions:
Avalanche is probably the best way to handle the student loans, yeah? I have some REALLY high interest loans and I wish I could consolidate but Sallie Mae swears up and down that I can't.

Is it possible to get my credit cards combined on a single, low interest card? What are some of the better options for cards to use to do this?

Should I bother paying into my 403.b when I will get at most 20% of what they put in? Would I be better off spending that money on my credit cards or loans?

And finally, do you think someone with a BS in a tech related field can get a starting job significantly higher than 35k/year? I would only consider relocating away from my SO for the last 2 years if I could find a job making quite a bit more than I am now. I want to end up in IT/Software Project Management.

I had been paying one lump sum with no problem until April 2013. I made an $8000 payment that month (normally pay between 900 and 1500 a month) and ever since then Wells has only used my payments towards the lowest interest rate loan, the 27k one. I wasn't happy with that, so this month I divided up the payment as I saw fit over the phone. I went to look at my new balance today and I found that only $200 of the $1200 I paid went towards the principal. In the past few months I have seen higher amounts go to principal with just $900 payments.

I understand these are very high interest rate loans, but is something fishy going on? I know Wells Fargo isn't happy I made that large payment, as I don't technically have another payment due until October. I'm just wondering if they're using some sort of formula for payments to keep me in debt slavery for as long as they can, or if that looks pretty standard.

Background: I'm from the UK and, to cut a long story short, sometimes need to look up the finances of non-publicly traded companies. Here that is easy because ALL companies need to register with a central authority called Companies House - most limited companies don't need to publish consolidated accounts (some do anyway for PR/CR reasons) but they still have to declare basic top-line financials.

Question: Is there a similar function for US companies? I realize that publicly traded organizations file their finances with the SEC and I've used EDGAR in the past to sort through things. But what about limited/private companies? 

My understanding is that for ltd's, reporting is done at a state (not federal) level - but are they required to report anything at all? I'm struggling to find information and I'm starting to come to the conclusion that financial reporting is completely optional! That can't be true.

The index of sentiment derived from a monthly Reuters survey of manufacturers rose by 3 points to plus 16 in August, which matched the level it was at in November 2010. A positive readings shows optimists outnumbered pessimists.

The index is expected to rise again to plus 18 in November in the Reuters survey, which is strongly correlated with a closely watched quarterly Bank of Japan tankan survey.

Makers of cars and electronics, however, were less upbeat due to worries about slowing growth in emerging markets, highlighting the risk overseas economies pose to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's reflationary policies.

""Sales are doing much better than we initially anticipated,"" one chemicals maker said in the August 2-9 poll of 400 big and medium-sized firms, of which 276 responded.

The service sector gauge also rose 5 points in August from the previous month to plus 23. This marked the highest level since April 2007 due to a housing boom and increased corporate spending on IT services.

The index is expected to improve further to plus 29 in November.

The BOJ's tankan issued on July 1 showed manufacturers' sentiment turned positive in April-June for the first time in nearly two years and was seen rising further on the feel-good mood generated by Abe's policies, intended to end 15 years of deflation, spur hiring and improve wages.

The BOJ will release its next tankan survey on October 1.

The central bank kept monetary policy steady earlier this month and left its economic assessment unchanged as board members wanted more time to measure the strength of capital expenditure.

Comments from the Reuters Tankan survey in August suggest that a turnaround in business investment is still distant.

""Europe's economy is in the doldrums and domestically companies feel they still have excess capacity,"" said one machinery maker.

""Going through with new capital expenditure is much more difficult than we thought.""

Japan's economic growth slowed more than expected in the second quarter, driven by an unexpected fall in capital expenditure in a worrying sign of companies' reluctance to invest.

Strong consumer spending, public works spending and a rebound in exports suggest that Japan's economic recovery can easily remain on track.

However, investor outflows from emerging markets due to worries about deteriorating growth could become a more of a concern for Japanese companies and policymakers.

We are working with at least one specific foreign currency for the next decade or so. Because of the nature of the contracts of our work, we can calculate daily operating costs fairly accurately which gives us a nice relatively clear picture of our monthly, quarterly and annual currency needs. Primarily transactional exposure risk. 

The company I work for, while large and multi-national, has a very lean treasury department of 4 people, not including the intern (myself). Of these 4 people, only 1 person has a practical understanding of derivatives but she is awful at explaining. Our board is even less knowledgeable. The policy needs to not only be practical but needs to be readable by our department and our board so that there is no confusion on what derivatives we are using and positions we are taking and why.

So, that's a bit of a snapshot of the situation. I'd be happy to answer any of questions without giving away too many specifics. Moving onto the scope of the policy:

We have a natural hedge in most of currency markets so the exposure is not all that large. We did a rudimentary exercise using FX forecasts from top banks and our currency needs. At one extreme we would be saving ourselves, 1.5m. On the other extreme, the costs would 150k. We need to sell this policy to the board and those numbers are hardly even worth mentioning. The tone needs to be more of a ""let's learn in the relatively stable market while we can so that we can be proactive when we ramp up our international services."" 

Finally, speaking to the actual scope. The instruments I can see us likely using are forwards, caps, floors, collars and swaps. I'd like to write a policy and speak specifically about the situations to use each instrument, the size, the side and the timing of the position, the accounting required to book the position, potential risks, strategies and controls. I mentioned most of our exposure is transactional. But I'd also like to incorporate economic exposure and translation exposure. Also, we at one point engaged in interest rate swaps as we had a variable rate on our LTD. We switched to a fixed rate and the company is not exactly all that interested in doing interest rate swaps, but the option to use interest rate swaps (and other interest rate hedging instruments?) needs to be included in the scope of the policy. 

It's not a small project and I'm tasked with creating the ""draft before the draft"" so to speak. Does anyone here have experience with that? Have useful templates? Can point me in the right direction?

Finally, as an aside. I thought I was clear in the understanding of the primary difference between a forward and future as it relates to a public company, and that is, with a forward you can keep your transactions private as it's you and another party. However, counterparty risk his higher. With a future, its the exact same ""agreement"" but it's public and the counterparty risk is lower as the counterparty is 'reputable'. This was my impression, but supervisor assured me we would never use futures and it wasn't because of the privacy or the counterparty risk, we would only be using forwards. But like I said she is awful at explaining. Any idea why this would be the case?",finance,1377233957
Bitcoin,Can anticipated deflation be a good thing?,"Most people understand how inflation is supposed to help stimulate the economy by flushing capital into the market.  The argument further states that deflation causes economic turmoil because the rich will not invest in capital ventures, but instead hold their money.  However, there are some interesting side effects of **anticipated** deflation that people should understand.

1. Anticipated deflation encourages people to work for a lower wage now and save their money for when it is more valuable.

2. If people are paid in a deflationary currency, they don't have to ask their bosses for raises.  Their bosses will have to ask them to take a pay cut instead.  This puts the wage earner at a distinct advantage over the businesses paying the wages.

3. A deflationary currency highlights labor over capital investments.  Those on the lower rung of society have less competition from automation and have more opportunities to invest their labor because they don't have to compete with the rich capital pushing them out of the markets.

4. If labor becomes more important than capital investments, then improving labor skills will become more important than labor saving devices.

Basically, in a deflationary environment, those with money are not incentivized to invest their money, because the money they hold is increasing in value.  On the flip side, those at the lower rungs of society may not find as many ""jobs"".  However, since the rich are not investing in capital improvements, those at the lower rungs can use ingenuity to invest a little of their labor to create capital equipment without competition from the rich sector of society.

NOTE: This assumes **anticipated** deflation.  We already know that the market anticipates inflation and compensates.  What is dangerous is **unanticipated** inflation and deflation.  If you go back and study the great depression, you'll note that the main cause of the depression was the Federal Reserve's drastic tightening of the money supply that was NOT anticipated.  If someone wishes to use this as an argument against deflation, point out that the Fed actually caused the massive deflation and that it was the shock of this deflation, not the deflation itself that caused the problems.",cryptocurrency,1377227278

personalfinance,Small investment vehicle for a non-US resident family,"Good evening, fellows. I live in a Southamerican country and work for my (extended) family business (legally, it would be the US-equivalent of a C Corp). 

This family Corp. serves to invest a pool of family savings (~ $250k) in local fixed income and money markets (60% of portfolio), along with some stocks (40% of portfolio) of local companies related to our family traditional professions (construction and real state). 

For some time now, my father and I have been diversifying our investments buying some ETFs and Treasuries in the US market through our brokerage account and the ""board"" of our family Corp. is interested in setting up and US-bases small company to function pretty much the same way we do here in our country and they instructed me to look into the details BEFORE hiring any accounting/law advisors.

I've done my homework (I think) and got a couple of questions:

1. I think that maybe the best structure would be that of what's usually used for hedge funds, meaning a LP (with the present shareholders of my family Corp as limited partners, about 5 people, non-US citizens nor residents) and the local (Southamerican company, that is) and the GP. 
- Would this be appropiate if (in the medium term) we'd like to have a couple of US citizens (maybe residents) investors (future inlaws, long story) ? 
- Is it correct that a LP that conducts business as a collective investment firm can have up to 15 partners before being required to register with the SEC ?

2. As foreign proprietors of the LP, can we act as US registered investors (in case we need to access products that require such status) even if we do not qualify in terms of assets ? Bottom line: would I be required to register the company at the SEC or any other federal agency after the regular incorporation and IRS paperwork ?


TL; DR: Foreign family wants to set up an investment vehicle for 5 non-US residents nor citizens plus two US citizens using an LP with a foreign corporation as a GP; is this suitable for our purpose ? Do we need any special licenses and/or RIA paperwork ?

Thanks in advance, cheers.",finance,1377386418

personalfinance,Delinquent Student Loan + Auto Loan Situation/Question,"Hey all, first time post to PF, and really only read a little bit here, but I am kind of in a tough spot and wanted to get some advice that wasn't an article written in 2006. Here's my current situation, not sure how much is relevant, but putting what I feel is relevant, if you need something I missed please let me know.

* 26 y/o male, Single, living with girlfriend
* Currently own a car, worth about $1500 trade-in
* Income: $28,000 a year
* Have $6500 available for down payment, leaving me with $2000 worth of safety net
* Current monthly bills: $50 credit card bill ($650 left), $75 student loans monthly ($8000 left), + rent and utilities. I have no current car payments because it is paid off
* I have 1 deliquent student loan (3 total, the $8000 above is 2 combined ones that I am in repayment with) worth $5800. It has been deliquent since 2011.
* Credit Score in the 650 range
* First time buyer for Auto

I recently have been saving up to try and purchase a car, as mine is nearing the time when it should be used as a hand me down to some teenager. I decided to ask around and see what type of loan I could get (never got pre-approval) and went to Wells Fargo and Fairwinds. Both of them suggested that I get rid of the delinquency off my credit report before I attempt to make a purchase because I would more than likely get turned down, but I have been told by other people that I would not need to do that.

So I guess my few questions are:

* Should I use the $6500 I have available for the down payment to pay off the delinquent student loan? 
* If I do use that to pay off the student loan, would it have any benefit to not settle for a lesser amount? I guess I want to know if I can settle with them for $3000 as opposed to $5800, is it worth doing that? Or should I just pay in full to get a higher score.
* Alternatively, should I get a higher interest rate loan to purchase a car now, using the $6500 to get that vehicle and then in 1-2 years pay off the student loan?
* If I were to pay off the delinquent student loan now, would it be FULLY removed, or would it still show up somewhat negatively? I am unsure how these items get removed, and I feel like the collection agency will just tell me what I want to hear so they can get their money.

In short, I just want to be able to clear the debt out, but I also need a new vehicle. I can perhaps push the vehicle off until next year, but April of next year would really be the point where I'd HAVE to buy another car. My current car has tire issues, alignment issues, no A/C, and brake problems, I feel at danger in this thing. Can anyone perhaps give me a direction to go in or tell me where I can start? This is all very new to me and I really am out of my league here :( I want to have a car, but I need to get rid of this debt as well, but there is no gaurentee that paying off the delinquent student loan will up my credit score anyways, at least what I've been told!

personalfinance,Question about my credit report and a company that thinks i owe them money. [CA],"Okay so here's the deal. I'm a 22 year old male. With a full time job in Alberta.
1) I want a new car
2) I have the money to do it
3) I don't want to pay a ridiculous interest rate.

The background story:

A few years ago i went on a trip to Europe during the summer for roughly 3 months.
Before i left i called my insurance broker to ask them to park the car for the summer so i wouldn't be paying the full premium.
the payment went from like $110 /month to about $42/month.

When i returned to alberta at the end of august i called my insurance broker back and had them put the coverage back on so i could drive my car around.

So here's where the issue came in. Before i had basic insurance, the cheapest of the cheap insurance for a 20 yo male. it came in at about $1320/year. like i said earlier $110/month.
I went about my business for the next 10 months, when i checked my credit card statement saying i was only paying $42/month for the past 10 months.
so i called up the insurance company and asked them if i was covered.
they said yes, but then they say ""oh i found a problem, i'll call you back""

sure. whatever.
they call me back and say yeah so were going to need you to pay us (around) $1400. for the past year of insurance, and your premium is going up to like $300/month. so of course i say HECK NO, i'm not paying that. that's a load of bull squish.

Which means i would have paid like $2400 for the year.

needless to say i finished my coverage with them, then cancelled.
I paid them the last two months but NOT the extra money they asked for.

I got one letter from them, asking for me to pay them again around a year ago.
i didn't. and i won't.

all this to say,  does anyone think this will show up on my credit report and mess with my credit rating?

While I'm relatively versed in financial markets, and work in the field, looking to get my own skin in the game.

My mentality is very mid-long term.  I'm starting off investing and trying to go mostly passive, LOOSELY based on Boglehead's 3 Fund portfolio as my basic jumping off point.  

**The idea**: would be to keep those 3 funds at all times.  Then kind of play around with the others as my ""alpha"" source (using ETF/passive as alpha...crazy idea?).  I just don't have the time or conviction to play around and research individual holdings.  Also, I don't trust mutual funds for some reason.  I rather play around with market themes rather then try to guess one name.  I'm welcome to all criticism on this idea.  I'm young and still developing my outlook/ideas.

**My goals**: I want to overweight large-caps in US for the short term (I personally think they have less exposure to interest rate risk).  I also want to be a tad aggressive and up exposure to Mexico, China, Frontier Markets/EM, and Europe, while also get FI exposure via unconstrained funds (such as PIMCO's Total Return) and I'll ramp up FI exposure as I see fit in a few years.  

I cast out a broad net and I have the following names (I used mostly iShares for ease, I know of fees, and I'll look into fees later) and trying to get recommendations from you guys on how to Optimize and focus in my portfolio (and then acquire it).



**Really looking for**

-&gt; What weights you'd recommend

-&gt; What names you'd cut that are overly repetitive

-&gt; If you'd recommend adding a mutual fund or two

-&gt; Any general advice you have on my strategy

-&gt; Any advice on my goals (they are a work in progress, nothing I have too much conviction over)

-&gt; Again, tell me if I'm an idiot

-&gt; What vehicles to use

How do I go about finding the total net cash flow in the project's terminal year? Would it be: Annual contracted revenues - Annual operating costs + (Annual depreciation expense X Marginal tax rate) + Expected market value of facility at end of project ?

60 - 25 - 10 + (20 X .35) + 5 = 47 ?

personalfinance,Credit card had a bogus charge from a place that does not seem to exist.,"Wednesday afternoon I received a call from my credit card's fraud prevention department regarding a charge of $8.73 at a women's clothing store in North Carolina that day. I live in California and hadn't used the card in about a week. So, bogus.

I wasn't stressed out at all- the CC company simply removed the charge, canceled that card, and FedEx'd a new one a couple days later. No muss, no fuss, right?

The only extra fishy thing about it, though, is that when I tried to look up the supposed store the card was used in, I got nothing. It was allegedly keyed in at a place called ""Lucerne"", a women's clothing store in Mount Airy, NC. Absolutely nothing even remotely close to that shows up in Google.

Given the tiny amount that was charged, I'm wondering if the thief was testing the waters with some CC software or something. Any insight? Thanks.",finance,1377453980
investing,Out of bonds...into what? Please help!,"TL;DR: My interest rate risk was too high and I need to find out where to put 60% of my portfolio, which used to be in long term bonds. 

So I had my portfolio set up to have risk in equal proportions across three primary asset classes, and I used Vanguard funds to do it: 

60% Long Term Bonds (VWETX)
20% World Equities (VTWSX)
10% Energy Equities (VGENX)

And 10% Cash as a safety / backup / working capital / liquid

The idea comes from Bridgewater's ""all weather"" fund, which traditionally brings in about 8-11% per year and has smaller spikes in terms of major losses and gains than the S&amp;P 500. They were long Gold instead of Cash; I made a decision on that front. 

Anyway I figured I'd mimic them, because I have no idea what I'm doing. But with interest rates projected to increase, the Long Term Bond fund is no longer viable. Which means I have to farm out 60% of my portfolio somewhere else. 

I'm looking to even out the risk here for steady, long term returns averaging 8-11% over time - what should I do? Thanks in advance!",finance,1377453829

politics,A Small Policy Proposal for Higher Education Reform,"What if schools (for-profit schools especially) couldn't take more in tuition than some percent of the average attendee's 10 year income?  Perhaps 15% or 10%.

The incentive would be to ensure that students got valuable educations that actually helped them secure financial prosperity for themselves.  Running a diploma mill scam, taking federally guaranteed loans at the highest allowed price possible and then giving some worthless classes in topics with no realistic chance of employment, would no longer be a viable commercial strategy.
 
The implementation would need government help to calculate that 10 year income, the school would have to send the list of names of attendees (it is best to include drop outs, to encourage the school to help people stay in and get a valuable education  rather than selectively kicking out all but the best students before graduation) to the IRS, the IRS would then just add up the numbers based  on payroll and income tax information, and then provide the combined  number so it doesn't reveal anyone's private tax information to the  school or public.
 
There would certainly be more competition for elite students, ones very likely to have profitable careers, but elite students tend to be able to find scholarship grants and there aren't enough elite students to finance all the schools around anyway.  So schools would have to take on enough students to pay the bills.  They would also have to carefully watch the number of people in various programs; no more would it be viable to produce a dozen Ph.D.s for every one good job available to them over the long term.  No more would people be victimized by arts or other programs that have no realistic  plan for student financial security after graduation.  Schools would have to figure out a way to make those skills work for their students,  or else not offer them because they'd be money losers for the school in  addition to the students, a radical change from the present.
 
This doesn't address the problem of schools increasingly using adjunct lecturers instead of actual professors for their teaching positions.   That problem - shifting from offering good middle class incomes to permanently keeping most people with doctorates below the poverty line - needs to be fixed. Not only for the welfare of the people themselves, but for the welfare of us all, as these are people who want to devote their lives to adding precious new knowledge and technology to the tools of all humanity, something they do much less effectively in poverty.

05 Neon (value $4000) 48 or 60 month (need to look)- Feb. 2011- $3654 remaining-7.95% rate

05 Grand Caravan (value $6000)- 60 months- Mar. 2012- $3927 remaining- 5.9% rate (I was in a parking lot accident July 2012 and put the $1500ish they gave me towards the loan instead of repairing the small dent).

I think both cars were between $7-8k when we financed them. Don't have the paperwork on me.

So I called today to ask about refinancing. Due to them being 05s and our current scores (722 and 724- bought a house last October, and have some credit card debt again so it went down some), we could only get a rate of 6.5% for a 2 year loan and 7.5% for a 4 year loan. The 2 year loan (based on an online calculator) would raise our payment $100 and the 4 year would lower it by $70. Neither seem ideal- first only because I am a SAHM and an extra $100 is not in the budget (have about $2000 in medical debt we are working on).


All of this is leaving me unable to make a good comparison on whether or not it is worth it. One benefit is they said we could refinance both into one loan, they'd briefly hold both titles until what we owed was covered by the value of just one car so we'd get the car title sooner. It's about an average of our current interest rate so not much of an improvement there. The loan officer said that she could get me better numbers after I filled out the application so what she gave me was just estimates based on the info I gave her.",finance,1377554102

So, I'm a 21 year old with a bachelor's in psychology, a minor in mathematics, and all of the prerequisites required for Florida nursing schools. And I'm totally lost as to what to do. 

My dream career is in nursing, but I couldn't get into my dream school before I finished my other bachelor's degree in Psychology (I was trying to obtain the two at the same time). As a result, I found out when I graduated that I'm actually at my ""maximum allowed borrowing number for federal student loans"" - which is a little less than 40,000 dollars. 

I really don't want to add to this already crazy amount of debt, but I really do want to go back to school. The job I have now pays just around ten dollars an hour, and nursing would definitely pay more than what I have now, and would probably pay more than anything I could find with my psych degree. It is also ultimately what I came to college to do as a career, and it is my passion. 

I'm kind of facing a dilemma here, and would like some advice on what to do. I have a few possible plans in mind: Taking out private loans to go back to school (through either a bank or one of those other borrowing services like Sallie May, though I'd like to avoid the latter), seeing if my parents could take out Plus loans to afford me going back, or just putting my nursing career off for ten years while I work in public education or a government social work agency and make minimum to hopefully get the loans forgiven.

 Another possible option (that I don't know if I could afford) is to maybe save up enough money to start school on my own dime without any loans...? I don't know anyone that has tried this and it seems impossible with the tuition fees that I remember, but I plan to go to a cheaper school (a community college rather than the university I previously attended), so I guess it might work...?

I sadly received a form letter back about how they want to protect gun owner's rights, and how the real problem in society is video games.

-----

As a parent, I found the events in Sandy Hook Elementary truly frightening. As a society, we should look for solutions to prevent gun violence. However, the discussion I'm seeing in Washington D.C. pointing back repeatedly to video games is not only off the mark, but it is harmful. When we point the finger in the wrong direction, we obfuscate the real issues, preventing them from being addressed. And we punish unfairly.

No one has ever found a link video games and aggression beyond vague correlations that don't stand up to basic logic and reasoning.

Violent crime has actually decreased since 1994 while video games are being played more. http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/tables/viortrdtab.cfm

Juvenile crime is actually at a 30-year low.

72% of Americans play video games. There does not appear to be any clear correlation to violent behavior.

Violent video games are just as popular, if not more-so in countries like Japan, Germany, Canada, England, etc. without any correlation of violent behavior.

The talking point that video games give people the courage to commit crimes they wouldn't otherwise could be applied just the same to music, books, movies and television shows. It is flawed logic to begin with, but video games should be viewed the same way as these other mediums. They are self-regulated with ratings to allow parents to make informed decisions about what games/shows/movies, etc. are appropriate for their children.

I served in the Marine Corps. Playing Halo is not the equivalent of military training and I find it laughable that people make such claims.

In the immediate aftermath of the Columbine school shooting, President Clinton and his wife were both quick to blame video games. Hillary Clinton made it a core issue of her tenure in New York, trying repeatedly to pass federal legislation to criminalize the sale of violent video games to kids (a problem that doesn't exist given that each study has shown most retailers will not sell M rated titles to children - http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/05/secretshop.shtm). If they had instead focused immediately on the actual issues, perhaps we wouldn't have had as many school shootings since then.

The more time that we waste in Washington D.C. blaming the wrong parties, the more we perpetuate the actual issues. Doing so is disrespectful and a disservice to those who have lost loved ones to such violence.

I am hoping that we can count on you as a leader to steer the discussion to where it needs to go (responsible gun control, mental health advocacy, reasonable security measures).",technology,1377533785

This is apparently part of the new law that supposedly cuts private banks out of the student loan industry. Now there are all of these ""non-profit"" companies that are buying up federal student loans. In my case fedloan servicing. 

The thing is, all my student were always from ACS (the government) so I'm confused as to why they were transferred to an NGO. I got a letter showing my current balance and principal and in most cases the principal is about the same and in a few cases higher than the original loan amount. I realize that a few of my loans were not subsidized and the interest was re-capitalized at the end of forbearance. But my forbearance period ended two years ago and I have made every payment. I would have to check my balance previous to the transfer, but the direct loan website shows that I owe nothing because they transferred it on August 8th to this new company.

So I called the new company and navigated the phone maze to a real person. She informed me that my interest was re-capitalized when the loans were transferred. Now it may not seem like much, but a few hundred added to the principal of the loans works out to be thousands more dollars paid over the life of the loan, especially at the ludicrous interest rate set by congress. I asked her why if I made all my payments and have never been in forbearance my loans were recapitalized. She transferred me to her supervisor. 

The supervisor was also nice and began to explain to me the process of the loan transfer. Apparently when they transferred the loans on August 8, they put it into forbearance for a day. This allows them to recapitalize the loan even though I am on direct debit and have never missed a payment. When he realized that I understood exactly what that meant, basically using a loophole of book keeping to add money to the principal he changed his tune. He assured me that no re-capitalization had occurred on my account and that the previous person I talked to was wrong.

I don't really trust the supervisor. The tone in his voice got a lot more slick and reassuring (lying?) when he told me my loans were not re-capitalized. But the only way to check would to be to see my principal amounts on the direct loan website and verify them with the new totals.

investing,Critique my investment strategy! I'm pretty new to this.,"Background on me: 25 year old graduate student in the second year toward my M.S. I have an assistantship and am lucky enough to live in a fairly inexpensive location. I'm planning on going into the Peace Corps after I graduate (to get an upper hand in federal hiring pools), so I will not have a steady income for at least 3 years. However, I won't have to worry about housing and such during that time. I have about $57k total to my name, in addition to a rental property that I partially own, all from an inheritance (recieved $80k 3 years ago and paid off all debt and helped out family a bit). I have no debt and my credit score is around 800. I won't be making any large purchases for at least 5-6 years and I am primarily interested in a set-and-forget approach, but a bit of day-trading sounds exciting to me. 

Asset Allocation (approx. values only):
Cash: $42,000
48 Month CD: $10,000 @ 0.800% APY (matures 08/16)
Merrill Edge: $5,000: SNE x 15, ADBE x 20, LIFE x 10, SCTY x 20, MO x 20, FSLR x 15, ONVO x 200, (Waiting to buy BDE until its annual late September drop)

I want to keep $12k readily accessible in a savings account, which leaves me with a little over $30K for additional investments. I'm looking at the following ETFs to hold on to for various amounts of time based on average returns: (1 year: SKYY) (5 years: FUE, GRES, PHO, FIW) (10 years: IDX, EWG).

personalfinance,Large cap vs. Mid cap/403(B) Fund Recommendations/ General advice,"Hey all,

Thanks for all the information already here. I'm 26 years old and about to start a 403(B)from work. The institution I work at offers the provisions through either Transamerica or HBS (BPAS.com). It seems like HBS has much better offerings in regard to the funds offered. The only thing that seems ""off"" about HBS is on the ""cheat-sheet"" given by HR to me, it says there's no death benefit guarantee... It does have a 75$ annual administrative fee, whereas the other plan doesn't have an administrative fee, but has a 1.1% annual ""mortality and risk fee"" with death benefit guarantee
Additionally, they have stable value/fixed interest rates which are awfully low (3.5% for transamerica and 1.7% for HBS, but from what I understand that would be the minimum returns I got if I opted for stablue value default plans instead of picking funds myself(?)

Going beyond that and into the specific funds, the ones that look most appealing to me are:

    *VMISX (Vanguard mid-cap) which as a 0.1% expense ratio
     *VIFSX (Vanguard 500/large-cap) which has a 0.05% expense ratio

It seems as if though the other funds offered don't seem to make as much sense to invest in due to higher expense ratios much higher (all around 1% or so), with T-Rowe Price blend for 2055 being around 0.84%) 

Does any one have suggestions regarding picking between large/mid/a combination of both or possibly other funds?

I can post the other funds by ticker, etc. if they are worth considering (Parametric emerging, PIMCO, total return, oppenheimer equity, etc)

Thanks!

P.S. Additional information: pre-tax salary ~ 102,000. Also considering Roth IRA as well
      Unfortunately 65k in student loans at 6.8%.  My initial plan was to knock these down immediately within 2-3 years, but it seems that the 403B/investing would be a better return while continuing minimum payments on the 10 year loan for now

personalfinance,I'm not sure what my next move should be?,"I'm wanting to move across the country at the beginning of the year but I am stuck with a mortgage.  I recently spent a lot of time and money doing repairs, cleaning, etc getting my house ready to put on the market.  Unfortunately I owe the same amount that the house would possible sale for.  Which means no funds for a realtor and/or closing cost.  To make matters worse the house next door and the house directly across the street are recent foreclosures and just went up for sale.

So I thought I would rent it out.  Other homes in my neighborhood rent for exactly what my mortgage payment is.  So no money for property manager fees or repairs.  

I bought my home in 2008 just before the crash so I have a high interest rate.  I just called my bank to see about refinancing but they said they wouldn't do it if I was renting it unless I got a business loan (or something along those lines) and that the interest rate would not be much if any lower then it currently is.   I'm not sure if I can refinance now anyways.  My credit rating recently dropped below 620 a few months ago because I failed to pay a bill.

I currently have $5000 saved up and I am expecting a bonus in a few months.  I just don't know what other options to try?  Any one have an idea?",finance,1377616128

Need advice on how to go forward.","I just graduated from a university in the Northeast US with a degree in computer science. I'm 21, and have no family in the US (I'm foreign and my family is back home), so I don't really know how to be smart with my money. I've been lurking on this subreddit for some time and was hoping to get some advice.

I've managed to secure a pretty decent job, 105K a year, 30K signing bonus, and 15% annual bonus target. The company offers a 100% match on a 401K upto 3%.

I'm about 32K in debt. It's not a student loan, I had borrowed money from an individual, and I just signed a promissory note stating that I'd pay the money back in 5 years. The interest rate on this money is 3.5%.

Between my bank accounts and and credit card balance I have about 28K in checking accounts. Since I started late this year, I've set my 401K account to a 18% contribution, which should give me about 10K in the 401K by the end of the year. I'll bring that down to %15 next year which should have me maxing out the IRA.

I don't have a car, mostly using zipcar or rentals for the occasional times I require one. I figure this makes sense since a parking spot where I am would cost between a $100 and $200 a month.

My rent is 1200 a month. Gym memberships, eating out, and other miscellaenous expenses push my total living expenses to an average of 2100 a month. This leaves me with a surplus of about $2500 every month, which currently just goes into a checkings account.

My question is, where do I go from here? I'd like to pay off the loan ASAP, despite the low interest rate. Because the person is a close friend. I was thinking of doing that by the end of the year, (I have three and a half more years to pay off the full amount).

* What do I do with any excess money. Put it in a savings account? Invest it?
* Do I start making contributions to a Roth IRA. I believe I'm eligible.
* Should I be trying to bring down my monthly expenses?
* Should I talk to a financial planner? Will that be expensive, and is it worth it?

Have $70k in federal loans, $20k in private loans. The interest rates for the federal loans are 5-7.9% while the private loans are closer to 9-10%. I've been grinding it out through my masters program, but I am about to graduate and have secured a job ($50k/year, $55k the 2nd year). 
 
I've been living off $19k/year the past two years while paying interest off the private loans, and I do not plan to change my standard of living with the new job. I plan to pay off the private loans ASAP while making minimum payments on the federal loans, and then attacking the federal loans. Is there a better plan I should take? Should I consolidate my loans? I welcome any and all advice and criticism.

I also have $11,000 in my savings, money that I earned off of online poker years ago (I do not gamble anymore) that I've been sitting on for emergency. Should I use that to knock off a private loan or keep it as an emergency fund?

Bitcoin,Possible Scenario for radically fast worldwide adoption.,"Context:

* Reports of the US being unwilling to give Germany back their gold or even properly inspect it
* popularity of bitcoin in Germany(Berlin)
* the fed's QE. 

Scenario:
Germany starts buying up bitcoins as fast as the market will allow(limiting factor)driving the price up yet still buying as much as they can. If they succeed they will have a substantial chunk of all bitcoins. Becoming the new the king of the new global reserve, the spot the US has enjoyed since WWII. The only things that need to happen for that to become true is: 1.The fed continue QE, hastening the end of USD hegemony 2. Germany committing to bitcoin, they are the largest and most powerful participant in the euro, which would likely die shortly after it pulls out. 

Since bitcoin is small enough you could assume that this will still take long enough for China and other countries to see what's happening and not wanting to be left out all start clamoring to buy bitcoin. Bam! Overnight bitcoin explodes. This would become even more enticing for Germany if they see US regulators come down with a heavy hand because they know that the US(private capital) will be mostly out of picture when the bitcoin gold rush comes. 

The only problem is that having the largest chunk is only temporary because they can't issue it but they would still be sitting on the largest ""gold"" reserve.

Are central chokes, such as the now failing(?) Mt.Gox currency exchange, consider a necessary evil within the Bitcoin ecosystem st least for the short term.

personalfinance,How to manage monthly payments on such a high interest rate? (Student Loans),"Hey all,

Since graduating last May, I have been working full-time and blindly making monthly payments/saving for a little over a year now. I finally decided to sit down, call all of my lenders and try to tackle this in a more efficient manner. In total I have 6 private loans and 4 federal loans with details below:

##Private Loans

**Lender: Sallie Mae**

|Loan Number|Current Balance|Interest Rate|
|:-----------|------------:|------------:|
| 1 |$20,221.71|10.50%   
| 2|$21,849.02|10.375%  

**Lender: Chase**

|Loan Number|Current Balance|Interest Rate|
|:-----------|------------:|------------:|
| 3 |$17,191.76|5.75%   
| 4|$12,572.43|9.25%  
|5|963.49|7.27%

**Lender: Credit Union**

|Loan Number|Current Balance|Interest Rate|

##Take-Home and Expenses

I'm a salaried employee and make $1,300 bi-weekly after taxes ($45,000/year before taxes) as of now. Sometimes I am able to bring home another ~$100/month if I pick up some weekend shifts at my other job. ***I have ~18,000 in the bank right now.***

  

|Other Expenses|| 
|:-----------|------------:|
|Car Insurance|$107/month
|Gas|$150/month
|Food/Entertainment/Medical|$150/month

So all in all, I've been able to make payments as they've been set up for me without a problem really. That initial 6-month grace period was great in letting me save up to where I am now ($18,000). But, now with all of these payments I am barely bringing anything home to save. I've been cutting out all ""excess"" spending that I can, eating ramen for lunch, skipping breakfast, etc. I'd really like to move on to the next step of my life and get a house/apartment on my own and think about marriage and all that great stuff - but as it stands, it seems like those are things that are unobtainable for YEARS. 

It makes sense to tackle loans #1 and #2 first since they have the highest interest rate by far... but how do I go about that without destroying my savings? I'm already paying ~$700 per month to Sallie Mae. Should I throw a large portion of my savings towards the balance on the Sallie Mae loans or just stay the course?",finance,1377713477
personalfinance,Looking to buy land (in addition to my house). Can you look over my budgets and help me out here?,"I started posting this on my main account but decided this information is SO detailed and specific, I just can't. Throwaways ahoy!. 

Essentially the situation is this: My fianceé and I bought a house in April 2012. We're getting married in a month, and decided that with interest rates still low, it might be a good idea to start looking at buying some land to build our dream home. (Sidenote-we eventually want a small hobby farm, land is a pre-req). Buying something with a house on it is okay too, but we would rather get just the land to limit liabilities on property tax, maintenance, etc. Also we couldn't really afford two houses. Banks would be less likely to loan the money. 

So, can we afford it, and what are the ramifications from a PF perspective that I haven't considered? 

A note: We make good money. Some of my budget line items are things you wouldn't purchase. While I am open to comment on my budget, please limit your comments to more of the ""well, if you moved this here and this here, you could afford this much more"" variety or general precautions on the liabilities of buying land.  

I am 25M, fianceé is 24F. 

Our monthly budget looks like this (joint income): 

401k contribution (pretax):$3100  
Health insurance and HAS savings (pretax): $160  
Monthly bus pass (pretax): $50   
Income (post tax, post everything above): $8500  
Mortgage: $2000- (actual mortgage is $1250, we're overpaying currently)   
Personal allowances (includes clothes, eating out when alone, personal expenditures, this is our ""no accountability"" money, but anything that benefits one person comes out of this accound): $1000  
Groceries and housewares: $500  
Joint restaurants:  $250
Pets: $290  
Fuel: $210
Alcohol &amp; Bars: $200  
Cell phones: $190  (we get reimbursed for this from fianceé's work, but it is just added to her paycheck)
Housekeeper: $170  
Utilities: $170  
Entertainment: $150  
HOA: $55  
Gifts &amp; Charity: $250  
Payment on furniture for house: $200  (no interest financing deal, will be paid off in October)  
Car Insurance: $150  
Miscellaneous: $150  


Home improvement savings: $600   
Travel Savings: $500  
Slush Fund savings (currently saving for downpayment on the land): $2000  

We have $40,000 saved in our emergency fund that we would dip into for the down payment. 

Only debt right now is the mortgage. We owe $200,000 on our house, which is currently valued at $341,000. There are 28.5 years left on the mortgage, interest rate is 3.5%. We are overpaying and the hope is to pay this down to get another mortgage to build the someday home and use this house as a rental property. 

So, my question is, how much (cost wise) land can we reasonably afford? How much will a sane bank allow us to take a loan for? Is there a better use for our money? I've only recently realized how much we make in comparison to how much we spend (even accounting for what feels like extravagances such as a housekeeper). 

What sort of liabilities would we need to watch out for on land prior to purchase? So far I know property tax, connection fees to local utilities when we go to build, and maintenance on the fence and such. I also know that land values can be wonky compared to the assessed value. (Eg, taxable value is 10k, property sells for 40-100k.)

Thoughts would be good.

Bitcoin,The development of Bitcoin Federal Reserves,"Sorry for the pompous title. This is just a thought experiment.

Let's say that in 10 years bitcoin is massively popular. Every day you'll hear about people and companies doing the complete bitcoin loop (all incomes and expenses are bitcoins, except maybe taxes). Fiat money is going down fast. There are interest organizations like Bitcoin Foundation, but basically the structure of the economy is very flat. People and companies have their wallets and are doing commerce. Online wallets are quite popular. They are convenient for the late majority and non-tech savy of people, and Apple is a bit slow to accept native bitcoin wallet apps.

People running the online wallets slowly starts to feel they want their cut of the economy. They have all these money sitting there in wallet accounts, and they decide to venture into two fields:

* Investing in the bitcoin economy with an expected ROI.
* Lending out bitcoins (ie. you get BTC IOUs in your online wallet). They will do all the risk analysis and thorough identity verification, to be pretty sure they get their money back — with interests.

The bitcoin economy will consist of normal people living their daily lives using bitcoin. They are not going to make a run on the bank. Small groups will however try, as they are ideological and afraid of the new centralized power of these online wallets. Let's just call them banks. The banks will start to look out for insurances, so they can survive a run of the bank. They'll pay a cut of their earnings to centralized bitcoin bank insurance companies. The insurance companies defines rules when an insurance is paid out and how the bank should be properly operated. Privately owned central banks.

My problem with this future is: I don't like the centralization of power. And my bitcoin will not be worth as much as some people expect. The banks will be able to inflate the economy many times over by running fractional reserves.

personalfinance,Make a lot of money but sick and tired of my job,"I'm in my mid 30's, happily married, and no kids yet. My wife is a housewife and I work for a mid-size company in sales.

I started with this company 8 years ago, and I am a sales superstar. I make a lot of money, averaging around between $500 - $600k after taxes annually. I have saved up $2.7 million, which I have invested in RE, stocks, and ETF's. Everything is self-directed.

My wife and I spend a lot of money and live a pretty luxurious lifestyle, but we still save about $400k a year. Our investments have been rising in value as well thanks to the stock market, but we don't take money out of there.

Now the problem is that I am fed up with my job. I make a lot more than everyone else, including my boss and his boss, and I know they resent me for it. I'm also bored to tears about doing the same shit every day and meeting the same type of clients and going through the same schpiel day in and day out. I am amazing at what I do, but I just can't do it anymore. 

I have this paranoia that if I quit, I won't be able to do anything else that will provide my wife and I with the lifestyle we're accustomed to. I'm really not good at anything else, and I have a lowly undergrad degree. My parents were middle class and living paycheck to paycheck, and even though they managed to put me through private school, they really scraped by. I don't want to ever have to stress about where the next paycheck is going to come from.

Granted, we do have a lot of investments, but they could tank just like  in 2009 when the market crashed. I can't put them into Treasuries because they pay less than inflation. Anyways, making 10-20% per year on the investments (long term) is the only financial strategy I have now.

I know that I'm better off financially than the majority of people, and I know that many would literally kill to make what I'm making, but I feel like my soul is getting sucked out.

Quick rundown of my situation:
 
* I graduate in May 2014
* My pre-tax income will be (ballpark) $105,000/year starting around July
* I will graduate with ~$210,000 in federal student loans averaging 7.2% interest
* I am married, my wife's income will be maybe $20-25,000/year
*  We want to buy a home soon after graduation (this is the really stressful part seeing as I don't know how qualifying for financing will go because of our massive debt)
* We will have ~ $10-15,000 in the bank when I graduate. 
* Our other debts will amount to around $12,000 when I graduate (her student loans 2k, her car 8.5k, carecredit 1.4k @ 0% until 2015)

I have no idea what to expect to bring home each month but I have guessed 6-7k. With my student loans being at such a high interest rate I want to pay them off quickly, but I also want to start funding for the future.

personalfinance,Insurance payout - car vs. student loans,"Earlier this week my car was totaled in an accident, so I am expecting to get insurance money in the near future.  After researching on KBB.com and Edmund's I'm estimating that I'll get around $10k in the end.  I'm not sure what the best way to use that money would be out of some options...

* Buy a new car without using the insurance money and instead pay off about 1/3 of my student loans.  This way I would have my student loan payments and a car payment.
* Buy a used car, pay it off completely with the money, and then just have student loans.

Some more info...  I'm a 22 year old male, I make about $40k a year, I have about $30,000 in unsubsidized student loans at a 6.8% interest rate, and if I was to buy a new car I could probably a very low interest rate on that (my last car had about 1%).

I think the new car is the better choice because it would be at a lower interest rate than my student loans, but I'm not positive.  Any thoughts?",finance,1377815863

I am in a position to sell 500K in direct, dollar for dollar federal tax credits.This can offset active or passive income. Initially I floated the figure of .90/$1 and seemed to get a lot of interest. Now that it is getting closer to ink on paper time, I am getting feedback that the figure is far too high (soft costs like accounting/attorney oversight will eat up that .10), and I should reasonably be seeking at least .75/$1. 

Does anyone have any experience purchasing/selling tax credits? Am I just getting knuckled down here? 

My client is a non-profit, and the tax investor will need to enter into an entity surrounding this project. In my mind, there is no risk in their position, as we are not seeking up front capital, only at the point where the rubber meets the road so to speak, and the credit is not tied to anything but total project cost.

My gross income/month is $2825 and after retirement, health insurance, and taxes, I bring home just over $2100/month. I contribute 4% to my employer's 401(k) to get their 2% match.

If we get divorced, I will have to survive on my own income and the following is a breakdown of what my expense would be:

Rent (1 bedroom apartment): $475 (water is included)

Electricity: $95

Internet: $60

Phone: $61 (my employer reimburses me half of that every May so that I am available outside of work, so every May I get a check for $360)

Groceries and Pet Supplies: $250

Car Payment: $285 (currently owe $13,400 with 0% financing; husband is a co-signer)

Car Insurance: $70

Gas: $150 (I drive 30 miles round-trip to work 5 days a week plus other random driving and travelling for work; I'm reimbursed for mileage when I have to travel for work)

Student Loans: $333 (~$50,100 with 6% interest rate; mine but husband is a co-signer)

Miscellaneous: $50 (this would include hygiene products, cleaning supplies, etc)

Renters Insurance: $21

I will have ""extra income"" of about $280/month that needs to go to an EF or paying down the student loans. I'm torn in determining how much of an EF I would need. My job is very stable, i.e. unless I royally screw up with a client, my job is pretty much guaranteed. But basically I will be starting over from ground zero with nothing saved.

Once a year, my dental bill is about $125. The other semi-annual appointment is about $50. I don't have glasses and I'm not on any medications and have no illnesses or disorders. Oil changes are every 4 months or so and run about $40 each time. My annual exams and birth control are covered 100% by the health insurance I have through work. So the emergency fund would be for any medical emergencies (which is unlikely) since my deductible is $7500 and max out-of-pocket is $1500. My car is a 2012 model and is under warranty, so I'm mostly covered in the case of a major breakdown. And my car insurance deductible will more than likely stay at $500, unless it's worth bumping it up to $1000.

One alternate is to move to the town in which I work. I currently live in a neighboring town about 15 miles away. If I move to my town, my monthly gas budget would drop to about $30/month. The rent would remain about the same or it might go up to $500-$550, so the potential difference is anywhere from $120 in savings to $45 in savings. But I would prefer to live in my current town since there is more to do.

investing,Nassim Nicholas Taleb Explains Why Portfolio Theory is Total Garbage. Part 1.,"""Gaussian or Bell curve is named because Friedrich Gauss proposed this curve . Bell curve, or Gaussian model, has since pervaded our business and scientific culture terms like sigma, variance, standard deviation, correlation, R-square and Sharpe.

Bell curve is meaningless in money and stocks but you may see it on German notes , financial markets run on the theories which are based on Gaussian Distribution . Bell curve is used in risk management though in many banks by Black Suit wearing officer. Assume that average height of men has a mean of 1.5 m and standard deviation 0.22 m and they follow a Normal /Bell distribution. Note that 220 cm standard deviation(.220 m) is randomness here and a very high one for a computer programmer.Gaussian yields its properties rather rapidly (a way to get a solution rather accuracy ), standard deviation in Bell curve faces a head wing where probabilities move rapidly as you move far away from mean. But my way of calculation does not make probability change ,it stays same over a range(unlike Bell curve). If I tell you that combined height of 2 men is 14 feet then you will think of 7 feet for each not 11 and 3 feet for them. People like to think in an easiest way and avoid randomness as 7 feet as for frequent and mind see it easier to conceive. Bell curves used in extreme events may cause a lot of disaster. Measures of uncertainty that are based on Bell curve disregard the impact the sharp jumps and inequalities and using them is like getting grass (grass disaster) and missing out the trees (Big Black Swans). This is why economics is based on Equilibrium , it allows you to treat economics as Gaussian . Assume you have a sample of 1000 people(giants and dwarfs) , your average will not be changed if you add another giant as your average will not be altered but if you add a mega giant it may be. So a single event will not change anything.

Randomness if Gaussian is tameable and is not altered by a single addition or removal. Casino people make such calculation and sleep well in night, no single gambler with a big hit will  not change it and you will never see one gambler getting 1 Billion. The Gaussian family also contains Poisson and the distribution are the ones where mean and standard deviation describe everything and you don't need any other thing.In fact, while the occasional and unpredictable large deviations are rare, they cannot be dismissed as “outliers” because, cumulatively,their impact in the long term is so dramatic.Mediocre events get fine or acceptable with Gaussian Distribution because big trees are not present in such events. I say that one should not use Gaussian in extreme events. But once you get Bell curve in head it's hard to avoid.
 
A group of thinkers consisting Karl Marx and others , they all worked on Socialism and were looking for ""Golden mean"" of everything ,like  height ,wealth and economy etc. A golden saying my Dad said once :Virtue lies in moderation ,all should embrace mediocrity. People have  a golden mean and so people deviate from these like a normal mind and steady health is best but many deviate .Some men are sick and some are intellectual and some are bulky and intelligent. Being an average man means that one should be mediocre in thinking but God has made every man equal and have given gifts to few and given flaws so to tell people as in Equilibrium. Though divergent society does change people like wars disable people and prosper some.""

""Henri Poincare was suspicious of Gaussian curve,Gaussian was initially established for cosmology and atomic uncertainty. But apart from pysicists mathematicians began to use it because maths people trusted physics people. Doing science for sake of knowledge does not mean you will be successful. Gentlemen scientists like  Lord Cavendish ,Lord Kelvin, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Uber philosopher Bertrand Russell are those who will think twice in using Gaussian curve. Bell curves are used in medicine in yes -no events because they are mediocre events.Even Sir Karl Popper also considered how new observations affected knowledge - such as spotting a black swan when it was thought all swans were white.""

**Gaussian Fallacies are Everywhere**

Gaussian yields its properties rather rapidly (a way to get a solution rather accuracy ), standard deviation in Bell curve face a head wing where probabilities move rapidly as you move far away from mean. But my way of calculation thus not make probability change ,it stays remain same over a range(unlike Bell curve). If I tell you that combined height of 2 men is 14 feet then you will think of 7 feet for each not 11 and 3 feet for them. People like to think in an easiest way and avoid randomness as 7 feet as for frequent and mind see it easier to conceive. Bell curves used in extreme events may cause a lot of disaster. Measures of uncertainty that are based on Bell curve disregard the impact the sharp jumps and inequalities and using them is like getting grass (grass disaster) and missing out the trees (Black Swans,black swans are rare events that carry a massive impact).

Nassim Taleb stipulates that financial markets do not follow Gaussian curves and that academics around the world , all the financial theories and all the monetary policy makers do not understand this concept and so cannot access its validity and that only guy to promote such thinking was Beniot Mandelbrot.

So, while weight, height and calorie consumption are Gaussian, wealth is not. Nor are income, market returns, size of hedge funds, returns in the financial markets, number of deaths in wars or casualties in terrorist attacks. Almost all man-made variables are wild or carry massive randomness(Black Swans).The unknown process and factors influence the financial markets and that according to the Central Limit Theorem ,these unknown influences become or accumulate to normal distribution. The reason that systematic risk is based on Normal distribution, so systematic risk is what rules financial risk and Bell curve does not follow it as it is evident from the 2007-2008 Financial crises.


The problem is that measures of uncertainty using the bell curve simply disregard the possibility of sharp jumps or discontinuities and, therefore, have no meaning or consequence.Using them is like focusing on the grass and missing out on the (gigantic) trees .This is why economics is based on Equilibrium , it allows you to treat economics as Gaussian . Assume you have a sample of 1000 people(giants and dwarfs) , your average will not be changed if you add another giant as your average will not be altered but if you add a mega giant it may be. So a single event will not change anything.Mediocre events get fine or acceptable with Gaussian Distribution because big trees are not present in such events.  

Financial Crisis of 2008:A key factor that led to the collapse of the banking industry in 2008 was the increasing use of mathematical models, spurred by the desire to exert total control over risk. These models, in all its elegance and beauty, badly underestimated the occurrence of extreme events.

Of particular note is a modeling technique called the Gaussian copula, which puts a price on the risk of multiple assets (or in this case, mortgages) defaulting at the same time. Upon its introduction by
a quant named David Li, the popularity of this model sky-rocketed and the banking industry
embraced it gleefully as the final piece to the risk management jigsaw that the industry had been
piecing together. Ratings agencies such as Moody’s and the S&amp;P readily adopted it in
formulating company credit ratings, and the model finally found its way into the Basel II
regulatory framework, as the guideline to calculate capital requirements for banks based on
structured credit that they hold.

If you use Bell curve in top stocks and genetic measures, extreme events if calculated Bell curve may cause disaster. Head -tail on a coin is a random walk (left or right or win or loose) is a mediocre event so we use Gaussian curve. Tree diagrams are based on multiple tosses or multiple balls chosen etc or two or more dices tossed etc. In tree diagram if net is one Win it can have many cases (2^3=8) .Use of this tree diagram makes us closer to Normal/Bell curve as we know that condition of Gaussian is that N (no of objects) should be greater than 10 etc and also Poisson is followed by these tosses of coins but it will get to Normal after some time.

We have moved from observation to mathematics ,something abstract is like thermometer where 25 degree Celsius is pleasant and 40 degrees is hot  and you do not need to know what temperature is. Also remember that standard deviation is not average standard deviation of a curve. Standard deviation  is between +1 to -1 ,it is a scale ,Standard deviation and Variance(standard deviation ^2) or sigma variates dramatically when you get away from average .Scaling to a sigma is used as well.In real life people don't take account of past probability ,though past winning has effect on future probability but Bell curve doesn't take into account of it. Models are made to scale standard deviation.

A major theme of Nassim Taleb is that models of uncertainty are too precise, and this thread has a long history. Taleb's sometime co-author Benoit Mandelbrot has been trying to sell the world on the big idea of fractals in finance for several decades.  James Gleick’s Chaos outlined the essence of Benoit Mandelbrot’s fractals, which takes a simple few lines of inputs to create graphics of insane complexity yet also beautiful recursive symmetry, in many cases eerily similar to nature (eg, ferns, snowflakes).  In dynamic systems, you have chaotic systems that are purely deterministic though sufficiently complex that they appear random.  These systems have large jumps, or phase shifts, reminiscent of market crashes or sudden bankruptcies; they have butterfly effects where small changes produce big differences in outcomes.  Mandelbrot and others have been trying to apply these ideas to financial markets for many decades now (since 1962!), and the effort has not gained any traction, in spite of many papers applying this concept (search skew or kurtosis in any financial journal and you will see many papers).  Mandelbrot’s big idea in finance is that finance relies on a profoundly flawed assumption, mainly that market prices are normally distributed.

The markets are non-linear, dynamic systems, subject to the rules of Chaos Theory. Market prices are highly random, with a short to intermediate term trend component. They are highly dependent on initial conditions. Markets also show qualities of fractals -- self-similar in the sense that the individual parts are related to the whole.Due to the non-Gaussian behavior of the markets the methods from Chas Theory, Fractals and Quantum Physics(probability calculations from quantum mechanics) are being used in Finance. 

There were only 2 Mathematicians who were actually able to understand randomness in a practical way and understand the flaws in them: 1.Beniot Mandelbrot 2.Henri Poincare


The poet of randomness : Beniot Mandelbrot : French philosopher, other mathematicians of probability like Kolmogorov may be more academic or progressive but Mandelbrot was unique he proved that mathematicians actually understand randomness. Black Swans were dealt by him in a philosophical and aesthetic way. Nassim Taleb and Mandelbrot have common things like Black Swans and Wild Randomness.Dr Mandelbrot also claimed that financial-market movements, too, have fractal forms, rather than the familiar bell shapes of “normal” distribution that Gauss  described.Fractals are linked with power laws, Mandelbrot worked on it and applied it to randomness. Mandelbrot designed the mathematical object called ""Mandelbrot set"" and later worked on shapes and fractals of maths and also worked on Chaos Theory.

 Alternative to Gaussian/Bell curve would be using power laws and fractals instead of the Gaussian distribution. The idea of power laws and fractals in the financial markets is first pioneered by Benoit Mandelbrot, and subsequently popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. This theory states
that the markets are not just random—they are turbulent.Randomness associated with Gaussian distributions is too polite, too courteous, and is too unrealistic. Turbulent markets, on the other hand, incorporate a “wild” kind of randomness into consideration, which is characterized by
sudden large jumps in volatility.EMH(Efficient Market Hypothesis ),the core concept of Finance also assumes Gaussian curve for its validity,another flaw in Finance.

 If stock markets were Gaussian then stock market crashes would have happened once in a Billion years. Mandelbrot's randomness methods make the statistics methods look useless. After the stock market crash William Sharpe and Markowitz model was given a Nobel Prize and this portfolio model was based on Gaussian Distribution. If in this world such method can get Noble then anything in this world is possible , anyone can become President etc. 


Fractals distributions do better than Bell curve in avoiding the Big Black Swans .Sometimes a Fractal can make you believe it is Gaussian. Normally extreme events fit into Fractal category , fractals thus have very high standard deviation . Statistical Physics is what is good for use in Fractals Methods and Econometric and Gaussian methods are not to be used in Fractal Distribution. Businessmen have big egos, the Fractal Ego. So Fractal is any event described mathematically and is an extreme event and has high standard deviation, just like Black Swanevent.(Nassim Taleb also worked with Mandelbrot on randomness of Black Swan events ).

The Gaussian bell curve variations face a headwind that makes probabilities drop at a faster and faster rate, as you move away from the mean, while “scalables” or Mandelbrotian variations
do not have such restriction.

True total intellectual  people are what I look for, erudition is what I look for in people.Mandelbrot linked randomness to geometry and made randomness a more natural science.Fractals are linked with power laws, Mandelbrot worked on it and applied it to randomness.""

Henri Poincare is said to be underrated, he was the best mathematical thinker of all time,a true polymath and the man who published in every branch of math and science. Every time I see picture of Einstein I think of Poincare because I think Poincare was better than Einstein(another form of narrative fallacy).It took almost a century to understand his theories ,Poincare was the first thinker to go against Gaussian or Normal Bell curve.Poincare was suspicious of of Gaussian as he knew that extreme events don't follow Bell curve.Poincare was the master of theory of relativity and atomic structure and even Einstein had to read him before he published as he was foremost authority on relativity.Many claim that Poincare was the first one to give idea of relativity but he never made it big to get prominence.Poincare also started the study of fractals and their use in physics,math and randomness etc,Poincare worked on Theory of Probability and also on Geometry,Chaos Theory and Astronomy/Mathematical Physics.Mandlbrolt later continued his work 100 years after his death. Poincre was first big gun to understand mathematical techniques and limits involved in randomness and hence forecasting limits. Poincare's research on solar system got a Prize which was the highest academic prize at that time. Poincare was the adviser of Louis Bachelier, the pioneer of Financial Maths. Poincare suggested that as you project in the future you may need an increasing amount of precision ,near precision is not possible . Think of forecasting as in terms of tree branches, this grows in multiple ways and doubling every time so such increasing amount requires a lot of precision.

Merton made his famous formula based on Gaussian and so  a flattering thing. Steve Ross an economist, famed to be more intellectual than Merton gave Nassim applause on his Black Swan theory work in a seminar in U.S.  Portfolio theory users can't tell me how can they accept the use of Gaussian curve with large deviations(high standard deviations) in stocks.Gaussian and high sigma cannot go together but all economists have been using it since a long time.

Robert Merton and Scholes made their company  LTCM (Long Term Capital Management), they employed top quants and used complex methods based on portfolio theory. Later in Russia when there was market crash and it made big impact on U.S market and thus making extreme event in U.S market and everything got busted along with LTCM. Someone using Gaussian in our U.S market or Wall Street (market which can experience extreme events)  is a madman in my world.

personalfinance,Another rent or buy question,"We are a stable family of three, the breadwinner has been with the same company for 15 years, moving upwards in rank steadily. Next year we are leaving our too-large house in an unbelievably shitty school district for a new place just a few miles from here in a stellar school district, and a much nicer neighborhood to boot. I highly doubt we will ever leave this area. Husband has a big fat 401k, I have a teeny tiny one, about $45k.

We have a nice amount of liquid cash plus my small 401k (I've retired to be a mother and home educator to our child so I'm not contributing), but aren't sure whether to raid my 401k and buy a place outright or pay off a low interest student loan and a low interest car payment with some of that money, keep the rest in the bank, and rent instead. We aren't interested in financing a home again. 

Renting will cost $7800 more annually than purchasing a condo if we have zero condo repairs. There's not much that would need repair, no laundry in unit, no hot water heater, just kitchen appliances, plumbing, and windows. 

Paying off the small student loan and the auto loan, both under 5% interest, frees up $385 monthly. We would have but one remaining debt, that being my other student loan. I could probably pay that off, too, now that I think of it. I definitely could. Edu loans 1 + 2 + Auto = 42,000. Condo = 65,000. I may not raid my 401k for a loan payoff though. That loan is only $150/month. Not that big of a deal. My goal isn't to be completely debt free when it comes to such low interest rates. For now. That small student loan is a federal loan and the rate will be jacked up soon.

We're torn. Having our own place for many years again feels secure and may be better for our son (same pool of neighborhood friends for most of childhood, no moving schools if he transitions to public school), it's easier without the threat of moving looming annually, no pet issues or pet rent (2 cats, who will not take well to moving, not one bit), but wiping out some debt is so appealing, too. 

The condo is also in a walkable neighborhood with loads of amenities. Big park, hockey rink, nature area, outdoor concert area, bike paths, massive library with a movie/music area the size of a Walgreens, farmer's market, 24 hour grocery store, restaurants, free splash pad for kids, elementary school, karate place, coffee house, other misc. stores all within a 3 minute walk, no crossing the street either. There's more if we cross the street. Going to a single car household would be well within the realm of possibility. Also, there's a community garden in this town.

I have a variety of undergraduate loans. Most are in my name, and don't have terms that are too onerous. There is one loan, however, that is crushing my finances. It's a Parent PLUS Loan (under my parents' names, obviously, but I am financially responsible for it). It has a balance of ~$57000 and a fixed interest rate of 8%.

I don't require any loans for the graduate school I'm in, but I thought that I might use my newly restored eligibility for student loans to try and get some loans with better terms and use that to pay off the horrible Parent PLUS Loan. I applied and was offered a Direct Unsubsidized Loan of $18640 (with an origination fee of ~1%). I should be eligible to receive this loan for the next two years as well, giving me enough in two years' time to completely payoff the Parent PLUS monstrosity.

I haven't finished crunching all the numbers yet other than the massive interest savings of the course of the two respective loans. What I really want to know is if there's anything I'm missing here...something that would make this a bad decision? So far it seems like the way to go and could save me tens of thousands of dollars!

Thanks in advance! This loan has been hammering for for a few years now and I am excited (strange to be excited about taking out yet another loan, even if it might actually help) to put this monstrous PLUS loan behind me.

personalfinance,Question about very early car refinancing,"Hi,

My girlfriend got a used car recently; it was more or less an emergency so we did not have time to go through and look for institutions (credit union) that would offer us loans with relatively low interest rates. 

So anyways, she let the dealer look for an institution to give the loan. The car cost about $13k and the interest ended up being 4%. After all the agreement, I suggested we look for a place to refinance and we got a quote from a credit union with a 1.99% interest. She hasn't made any payments yet (she got the car last week), and so she was calling the dealer to make the proper paper work to have the loan transfer (I guess), and the dealer mentioned that he recommends her waiting for 3 months before making the transfer because refinancing right away might ""hurt"" relationship with Capital One (the bank they went with the first time). I don't really like this idea because if she makes payment for the first 3 months, most of it will go into interest and won't go towards the capital. So if she makes the switch later to the credit union, she might not benefit greatly from the lower interest rate and/or might even be paying more in total (I haven't made the calculation yet).

So my question is, is the dealer talking out of his ass and talking so that she stays with them just for them to enjoy the kick back they get from the bank? Will the ""relationship"" with Capital One be influenced, and if so does it matter at all? 

Personally, I would just go with the Credit Union. And I don't really trust whatever the dealer is saying because when I told my girlfriend to tell them that she was having a better deal elsewhere, they mentioned right away that they could match the interest and do the financing not through capital one but through them. So all of the sudden, relationship with Capital One seems not to matter anymore.

TL;DR: Is refinancing a loan right after you got it with another institution that offers you a better deal detrimental to the relationship you have with the first institution and does that matter at all?",finance,1377901401

personalfinance,True Cost of Borrowing Student Loans - Why Doesn't the Government Demand Proper Disclosure??,"I can't believe that the government doesn't disclose, and doesn't require private lenders to disclose, something akin to an APR in the mortgage world so that we can easily make apples-to-apples comparisons on different student loan options. 

For example, according to the Department of Education, Unsubsidized Loans have a fixed rate of 5.41% while Direct PLUS Loans have a fixed rate of 6.41% [1]. (NOTE: All rates in this post are for graduate loans; undergraduate rates are different / lower). 

The problem? That interest rate tells you very little about the actual cost of borrowing, since there is no reference made to how interest is calculated or how often payments are made. 5.41% compounded daily is very different than 5.41% compounded quarterly or yearly. Further complicating this problem is that Unsubsidized Loans and Direct PLUS loans charge an origination fee (~1% for Direct Unsubsidized Loans and ~4% for Direct PLUS loans) that makes the true cost of borrowing funds diverge even further (read: more expensive) than the nominal rate quoted an basically ALL documents [2]. 

The result is a big mess when trying to make comparisons between private and Federal loans. What if the private loan doesn't have an origination fee? How does that change the total cost of borrowing? What if the compounding or payment period are different? 
This is a well-known problem in mortgage financing, which is why the government requires all mortgage lenders to disclose an Annual Percentage Rate (APR). 

The good news is that, because all Federal loans are standardized, so if we compute this once, we're done. Furthermore, since I am not 100% confident I did the math correctly, /r/PersonalFinance can help me peer-review the results! 

Punchline:
Effective Annual Interest Rate (note the Annual) for a Direct PLUS Loan is 7.36%. 

Effective Annual Interest Rate for a Direct Unsubsidized Loan is 5.53%. 
I used the formula [Average Daily Balance] x [Nominal Interest Rate] x [30 / 365.25] to compute monthly accrued interest [3]. Note that this formula is different than what is normally used in a mortgage calculator and I am using a static 30 days instead of the actual days between payments. 

Also, there is a 0.25% reduction in interest rates for automatic payments, so I reduced the nominal interest rates by that amount, and I assumed a 10-year repayment period. I am well aware that I am ignoring the fact that the accrued interest rate will not be 0.25% lower until you graduate and set up the automatic payment, but I ignored that for simplicity's sake. 

I used that accrued interest formula to get the monthly interest rate payment necessary to fully pay off the loan in 10 years. Then I used a financial calculator to figure out the effective monthly interest rate given the origination fees, and then I multiplied by 12 to get an annual figure. However, this annual figure is the annual rate compounded monthly. I then use this rate to figure out an effective annual interest rate - that is, an annual interest rate compounded annually [4]. This final figure is basically what you are paying on a yearly basis for borrowing funds, including the automatic payment discount and the origination fee. 

You would have to do the same procedure and get an effective annual interest rate for private loans to make apples-to-apples comparisons. As you can see, this is a very tedious process (if I even did it right), and most people won't bother to do this. 

Why the hell doesn't the government mandate that this percent be disclosed to borrowers like they do for mortgages is beyond me!

I believe that they will still serve a purpose and etch out an existence.  The main reason being is bitcoin, or any deflationary currency for that matter, is awful for giving loans or extending credit.  (Spending money you don't have.)  It's not impossible to take a loan in BTC, but it would be very stupid to do so.  Imagine you take a loan for 100 BTC at a time when 1 BTC = $10 and you have payments of 1 btc per month.  Then the price of bitcoin rises to $100.  Now your monthly payment is still 1 BTC per month even though the price went up.  Now imagine it was a 30 year mortgage and the value of 1 BTC has grown 10000 times over by the time your loan comes to term.  This is a market where an inflationary currency will always be superior and that market won't stop existing just because we adopt a deflationary currency.  Banks and credit card companies will continue to exist and deal in fiat for this reason.

I imagine a future where, due to competition from Bitcoin, banks will once again start offering real interest rates for their  customers like they once did decades ago.  They will have to compete with the natural increasing value over time of Bitcoin in order to sustain their business model of profiting off interest in fiat loans.

investing,Consumer Sentiment in U.S. Fell Less Than Forecast in August,"&gt;Consumer confidence in the U.S. dropped in August from a six-year high as interest rates rose and tensions in the Middle East intensified.


The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment for this month fell to 82.1, a four-month low, from 85.1 in July, which was the highest since July 2007. Economists in a Bloomberg survey called for 80.5, according to the median projection after a preliminary reading of 80.0.


Higher mortgage rates are threatening to stall momentum in the housing market, and turmoil in Egypt and the threat of potential U.S. intervention in Syria is raising the specter of higher fuel prices. Though stocks have dropped this month, increased personal wealth from rising home values may help to contain the decline.


“There was a good bounce in confidence a couple of months ago, and there has probably been a little bit of reversal in the last couple of months as mortgage rates have risen,” Jim O’Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York and the top forecaster in Bloomberg data going back two years, said before the report.


Estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 79 to 85. The index averaged 89 in the five years leading up to the last recession that began in December 2007 and 64.2 during the 18-month slump that ended in June 2009.


Other reports today showed consumer spending slowed in July and business activity picked up in August.

hardware,ASUS Maximus IV Gene-Z problem: second PCIe 16x slot won't detect GPU,"The backstory:

I was running this mobo with dual GPUs (6870's) for ages; not in Crossfire, just two GPUs in the machine. About a month ago, I took it to a LAN party, and in the aftermath it sat unplugged on my desk for 3 weeks. Upon booting it up again, my OS (Linux Mint 15) wouldn't display any graphics output on boot. I reinstalled the OS and everything *seemed* to be working, but today when setting up Bitcoin mining again (the reason for two GPUs with no Crossfire), I noticed that it was only detecting the primary GPU.

I checked the BIOS ""GPU.DIMM"" menu, and it only showed the GPU in slot 1 at full 16x speed, and ""N/A"" for the second slot. The second GPU was spun up, but was not being detected nor outputting any graphics. Thinking it might be the GPU, I swapped it out for a spare 6450 I have; no dice. After much rearranging of the GPUs, including a *successful* test of the 6450 in the bottom 4x slot with nothing plugged into the two 16x slots, and many MANY CMOS resets, I've come to the conclusion that the second PCIe 16x slot simply *will not work* and fails to detect any GPU in it, even if that is the only GPU installed.

Has anyone seen this before? Am I just missing a BIOS setting somewhere? Or is my board potentially 'effed?",technology,1377838751

personalfinance,How aggressively should one pay off high interest federal student loans with higher potential for forgiveness vs low interest but high balance private loans?,"Hello everyone! I recently graduated with a bachelor’s degree (social sciences) and am about to begin paying off student loans in a few months. I have read lots of good advice on this subreddit so far regarding paying off high interest loans before low interest loans.

I find myself in a slightly unusual situation in that my private loan has the lowest interest rate (3.25%) while my federal loans have high interest rates (6.8%). How aggressively should I pay off the high interest federal loans given 1) I am working in the public sector and have the potential to earn loan forgiveness, and 2) I could have low IBR payments for at least the next year.

For reference, my total loan breakdown looks like this:

* 37,000 in Direct Federal Unsubsidized loans, interest rate 6.8%. 
* 6,000 in Direct Federal Subsidized loans, interest rate 3.25%
* 10,700 in Sallie Mae Smart Option Student Loan, interest rate 3.25%

Additionally, I also have an auto-loan with a balance of 9000.  I have no credit card or any other form of debt.  My income and savings looks like this:

* 1,000 Bi-weekly take home pay
* 30,000 in savings

And information about my monthly costs:

* 500 for rent and utilities 
* 286.50 for car payments
* 300 for food and entertainment
* 100 for gas
* 300 for savings 
* Additional money goes to variable (emergency) costs and the rest goes towards savings

I am unsure whether or not I will still have this job in a year, since it’s grant based, but it is likely I could find another job in the same department that I work.

Sidenote: I am luck to have a pretty supportive family and I could potentially move back home as I haven’t yet signed the lease for the apartment - but that would be difficult to orchestrate given time constraints (I would need to find a new person to move in this week). I also have 2-3k dollars worth of furniture to move that would need to be stored somewhere, and living there would also increase my commute time substantially, from 5 minutes to 40 minutes one way.
   

**TL:DR;** Given stable employment at a government job with low IBR payments and potential forgiveness after 10 years, should I still pay these loans off as aggressively as I would private loans?

Thanks for any help or advice you could send my way!",finance,1377825232

Ive been reading and looking into things currently read Total Money Makeover and am in the process of reading The Bogleheads Guide to Investing and was looking at my options and curious if PF could look over it and give me some critique and help answer a question for me. Below is a list of my 401k options at work and what I'm currently investing based on suggestions by my dad's finance guy:

Basically, I'm curious if I should keep my contribution going into the 401k at I believe 8% total with the match or if I should drop it to the match and put the excess into a ROTH IRA with Vanguard? Any thoughts? Just realized I forgot the Expense Ratios I will get them and update later. Any thoughts right off the bat without those? I know they are important, my apologies in the memory laps!

Edit: Added Expense Ratios. After actually seeing them side by side I really doubt my fathers financial adviser, but I guess maybe he was going for more diversification with what options he had rather than worrying to much about expense ratios? Some of them seem pretty high...",finance,1377965885

personalfinance,Can I get more credit by paying loans with a CC? ('Murica!),"Ok so next month is a very depressing time... I get to start paying off my student loans! Now as of right now I have no credit history as far as I know. I actually am signed on a traditional credit card that is shared between me and my mom and right now I never use it. So supposedly that is building my credit history but I've never seen it. Maybe it's time to run another history report.

Anyway since I think that paying off loans on time, and paying off a CC on time will build my credit history will it have a noticeable effect on my credit if I use the CC to pay the loan back and then pay the card off immediately? I mean hell I am going to pay the loan one way or another so I might as well maximize the utility of paying it off.

Bitcoin,Can currency problems in BRIC countries stimulate Bitcoin adoption in emerging economies? And would Bitcoin be helpful?,"There are a growing number of reports that several of the largest emerging economies (often named BRIC countries), except China, are dealing with increasing currency devaluation problems - up to one third in the last months. This development seems to be the direct consequence of the beginning change in US monetary politics, which is going to end  ultra-low interest rates. According to analysts, higher interest can become a large problem for these economies, as they either have to increase their central bank interests too, or have to watch currency devaluation and capital flight. That means potentially significant trouble for up to one fourth of world's population.

personalfinance,Finally in a position to really pay off debt... or should I invest?,"I've recently paid off my student loans save for around $3k at a 2.8% interest rate, which will receive minimum payments for near forever.

I have $10k+ as an emergency fund.

I'm getting married in a little over half a year, and the wedding is primarily paid for with my own money, family help, and money I'll be making up to that point.

My wife-to-be will be bringing in around $2k a month and I've already been paying all of our bills/mortgage and able to save $1k a month on my own.

My wife-to-be has around $22k in student loans (many at 6.8% interest) and I have $123k at 3.75% for a mortgage and am still paying PMI (around $600 a year).

My current plan is:
-save for wedding/honeymoon
-after wedding/honeymoon, aggressively pay off mortgage until PMI isn't an issue (saving $600 a year)
-aggressively pay off higher interest loans (6.8% student loans)

It won't take very long to be in a position where we have the option to pay off the mortgage or invest, and I have no idea which path to go down.

I'm currently taking 6% of my paycheck into a non-matched 401k, but would like to fund my retirement a bit more aggressively as 6% of my paycheck isn't much.

My question is:

Do I invest in something like a Roth IRA to the maximum each year and then pay off the mortgage with anything extra, or do I just pay off the mortgage first and then invest in something like a Roth IRA?

It further complicates matters knowing that the mortgage is the only real debt I have after student loans, so the thought of having literally no debt whatsoever is incredibly tempting... especially knowing that we could both potentially lose our jobs or get injured, have kids and one want to stay home, etc.

What would you do?",finance,1377914890
