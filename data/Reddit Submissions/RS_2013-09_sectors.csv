personalfinance,"Just graduated with enormous student debt, lucky to be entering a high paying job - how much of my excess income should I dedicate to student debt, versus buying an apartment or saving?","I'm 28, and I just graduated from law school - I'm paying for both undergrad and law school by myself and I'd appreciate some advice on how to responsibly manage my massive debt while saving for an emergency, a house, and the future. 

My student debt stands at a devastating $299,070. The highest interest rates are 7.9%, and the lowest are 2.5%. The blended interest rate is 5.7%. I also have around $18,000 credit card debt at around 16% APR. I know, fuck.

The good news is that next month I'll start a relatively high income job. I start work at a New York City law firm and I'll make $170,000 annually after bonus.  I'll take home about $108,000 after taxes.  That's $9,000/month take home pay after taxes. 

I support my significant other. My monthly expenses total $7580. That's $3300 minimum payment on all the loans, $2200 rent and utilities, $300 cabs and subway, $700 food, $500 misc, $460 insurance, $120 dogs. 

That leaves me with $1420 income left over each month during my first year to allocate to paying down loans or savings. In the coming years, I'll have more to put towards either loans or savings/house goals. The typical ""big law"" pay scale increase is as follows before bonus: 
yr 2 - base pay 170,000
yr 3- 185,000
yr 4 - 210,000
yr 5 - 230,000
etc. 

As soon as I start work, I'm going to pay off the credit card debt as fast as possible and never ever carry a balance again.  That leaves around ~$300,000 in student debt to whittle down, at a blended interest rate of 5.7%. 

So, reddit, how much of my extra ~$1500+/month should I put towards those massive student loans at an average of 5.7% interest versus contributing to my firm's IRA and/or saving for a house? 

Since I'm going to be in a higher income tax bracket, I'd like to reduce my taxes by taking the mortgage deduction, and by saving for retirement through an IRA. 

Eventually, I would like to buy a $300,000 apartment in New York City, because I don't want to throwing away ~$25,000 a year on rent, but that would require a down payment of $60,000. It would take me about 2.5 years to save that much if I put my excess income in a CD or savings account instead of debt. If I got a house, I could get a mortgage that is the same as my $2200/month, so after three years I'd be building equity and I could again start putting all of my excess income towards loans. 

I've read the post on home-buying suggested in the FAQ, but I'm interested in your thoughts on how the calculus changes when you've got massive student debt. Should I just throw everything at my loans until they are paid down? Or should I treat this as long term debt and save for a house simultaneously? I appreciate any advice. Thanks!

Edit: Thanks everyone - didn't expect to get this many responses. I appreciate it! A couple things: 

1) I'm really interested if anyone has any insight on the tax implications of buying a house versus owning, when I'm in the 28% tax bracket. It's important to note that in order to save for a down payment, I'd be NOT spending around $2000 of excess income each month on student loans, but after saving for the down payment after 2 or 3 years, my mortgage and condo fees would be the same as my current rent. So what we're really talking about is the cost, over three years and after taxes, of not paying down my loans as fast as possible. After three years, when I'm in the home, I'd take the deductions for home ownership, and then I'd dedicate all excess income to the loans as fast as possible. 

2) People were concerned about me supporting my significant other, I should clarify that that won't be forever. He made big sacrifices working a job he didn't like while I was in school to help get me to where I am, so I'm supporting him for a year or two while he gets his dream start-up off the ground - the startup is making some money in the first year and he does have some income from that, but it's not very predictable. He's fundraising now and will leave this if it doesn't work out in the near future. I truly believe in him and his ability to be successful and be his own boss, but he also has good regular job prospects if it doesn't work out. We've been together 7 years and plan on getting married in the future, but we're waiting until I can get my loans paid down because that shit's expensive, and we want a nice wedding and are willing to wait till we can afford it. 

3) Here is the loan breakdown, by interest rate:
7.9% - $111,242;  
7.75% - $37,784;  
6.8% - $89,854;  
5.25% - $49,030;  
2.5% - $11,260.

4) I'm not completely unconcerned with job security, but I am entering one of the very best firms in New york, and the firm is in a very good financial position. From what I hear from older associates, people just don't get fired and put out on the street. They may get suggestions or a talking to that they are not going to make partner and it's better to seek work elsewhere, but they are given time to find another job and leave at their leisure. Being out on the streets is not a real threat. People with my foreign language skill set have lots of exit opportunities at other high paying jobs - recruiters call constantly. 

5) I feel like I'm pretty frugal for living in New York City. I only buy my food at costco, have a chest freezer, and actually do cook at home on the once a month cooking plan. My health insurance is high because that's what it costs in NY. I have a misc category because at least during the first year I need to buy some decent clothing for work - it's a very conservative office. There are definitely places in NYC at 600 or 700 square feet for $300,000k, within 15 min of my office. However, I do appreciate the thoughts about reducing the budget. I looked over the numbers again with my S.O. this morning and we think we can get my excess income number closer to $2000 per month, or $2500, which will be the goal.",finance,1378079254
personalfinance,28/f - Toronto - No savings/investments so I can pay more toward student debt. Unwise? (CA),"I am 28 yo, two years out of grad school with a lot of student debt and I'm worried about saving for the future (which I have not started doing).

I'm an Executive Director in the not-for-profit sector earning $1708 bi-weekly, and I don't believe the income will change drastically over the next little while. I enjoy what I do and I'm challenged in all the right ways, so it's immensely useful for me to stay where I am and learn/grow as much as possible. Salary cap for my position is around $85k, unless we scale up our operations, which may happen (but not a certainty). 

I graduated in 2011 with 50k gov't student debt and 50k bank student debt from a total of 8 years in university (5 years undergrad, 3 years architecture grad school). I wish I'd worked at higher paying gigs in the summers during school, but I ended up doing low-paying (but highly interesting/intellectually fulfilling) research work and paying for living expenses with loans. School in every case was on scholarship.

So back to the debt. Interest rates are pretty much the same on both (~5%). The big difference with the gov't loan is they matched some of my payments and have lots of forgiveness programs that have helped to allay the interest. I have paid everything I can since I went into re-payment on both. 

Today my bank loan is: **$18,707.14 CAD**
and my gov't loan is: **$32,888.35 CAD**

My bi-weekly income is $1708. (Sometimes I can earn ~$400/mth additional if I teach for a semester, or if I take on graphic design contract work).

I pay the bank loan first, usually around $700/month. And put $180/month toward the gov't loan (double the minimum payment). Based on this, it will take 67 more payments (or 5.6 years) to pay off the remaining balance. Interest will amount to $7,494.

Rent is $950. I ride a bicycle, so no car fees. 

With living expenses (beyond rent) at $1600/month (as budgeted in Mint), how can I save for my future? I have no savings, and if I do save, I immediately put that money toward debt payment. I'm starting to wonder if that's unwise.

Thanks in advance for your advice!

**TL;DR: I have $51k in student debt, I net $3400-3800 income after tax, per month. Rent and expenses are ~$2600 per month. I have no savings or investments. Should I start saving/investing? Any other advice?**",finance,1378078296
personalfinance,Just looking for general advice on planning for the future.,"Hi, I'm not in terrible shape with my finances or anything, just looking for advice on ways to make my situation better.  I bring home between $1,900 and $2,000/month (hourly).  My bills are as follows:

Rent: $475
Car: $330
Utilities: $100
Cable/Internet: $80
Gym: $35
Insurance: $55
Phone: $80
Gas: $200
Savings: $100 (included as a ""bill"" so I don't touch it.)
Savings #2: $40 (opened for surprise vet visits for my dog.)

A few of those are subject to usage, so typically my monthly bills are around $1,500.

I only started taking my personal financing really seriously about a year ago, so I am still pretty new to this being responsible stuff.  I really want to up how much I am able to devote to my savings.  The $100/month I am putting in there now is nice and I don't miss the $50 per paycheck, but I feel like I can be doing better.  While I am in a better spot than I was 2 years ago, it is kind of frustrating to be saving for a full year and not even have $2,000 in my savings.  I'm 28, single, have no credit card debt (use my card for gas and pay it off every month) and no student loans (employer has tuition reimbursement that has basically allowed me to pay for school while going to school).

I am considering getting a night and weekend job, but I really hate the idea of giving up my weekends.  It also wasn't really an option before because my dog doesn't deserve to have me not around for 60+ hours per week, but I recently got a roommate that has taken a very active role in helping me care for her.  I am wondering if it is realistic to be giving myself only $50/week for food and fun or if getting a second job is the best option?  Honestly, I would like to eventually up my savings closer to $300/month, but that might be a pipe dream at this point.  Any general advice on how you all limit your discretionary spending would be greatly appreciated.

A few more notes: I am considering buying the house that I am renting, which would drop down the monthly payment to $350 ($700 total, but I would keep the roommate), but I am not 100% convinced that I will be staying in the area after I finish school, plus I would pretty much have to be living with someone to be able to afford it. Also, the CU that I financed my car through said that if I get my credit score up 9 points, then they can redo it and drop my interest rate substantially.  I am planning on doing that in the next 2 months or so.

Reading this back to myself, I feel like I gave a lot more information than I needed to since I am just looking for general spending tips, but whatever.  Rather too much than too little.",finance,1378069789

Bitcoin,"For people who think Bitcoins can replace FIAT currency, please explain to me...","I hear people every now and then say Bitcoins have the potential to supplant all extant currencies due to their numerous advantages, but I wonder if that is realistic and want to get more input.

The current stance of the federal reserve is to apply a constant inflationary pressure to the USD to encourage capital investment and circulation.  For someone who (For instance) plans on retiring money made should be invested back into the market to protect against inflation (placing money into a portfolio with returns pinned to market growth is superior to keeping it under the mattress, because pinning your capital to market growth means you will meet or beat market growth in terms of purchasing power, versus losing purchasing power over time in cold capital)

This is ostensibly good for the economy because money sitting in dry dock represents reserved buying power that can not be used as principle for market expansion, but invested currency can contribute to market growth (again, ostensibly a positive outcome)

With the deflationary pressure of bitcoins, the smart play is to keep them in cold storage, because the only way you would lose money with them is market contraction.  We all have an interest in a growing market, for obvious reasons, and all labor contributes to a growing market, so the expectation is that the market will grow.  That growth is stunted by deflationary pressure, and in that a widely used/reserve currency in bitcoins would seem to contract the market.

Am I correct in my analysis?  Can someone lay out how bitcoins could function as a world currency, with the inherent limitations in place as a fixed availability currency (in fact a receding availability, as a bitcoin could theoretically be ""lost"" in an inaccessible account and never replaced)

personalfinance,Mortgage questions about credit-use ratios and an OIC in progress with the IRS. (X-post from /r/RealEstate),"Hello all, this sub has been very, very helpful getting me on the path to home ownership so far!

I have a couple of questions regarding my two car notes and an OIC in the works with the IRS.

I had a mortgage company run mine and my wife's credit for a pre-qual. The report stated too much of my debt was being used. I have $7500 in CC credit available and only use ~$500 of it a month, so no problems there that I can see. So, I assume they are talking about my two car notes.

First, I have a car note for ~2600, the original amount was ~3500. I have only had this loan for 5 months, it was my first car loan, shitty rate (~6%). In a couple of weeks, I will be able to pay off the entire balance. Should I pay it off entirely? Or should I pay it down to say $500 so the amount of that loan's line of credit is lower ~15% usage of the original amount?

Second, I have another vehicle with a note for ~$12,500 and a balance of ~$11,000 remaining. I have had this note for about 4 months. The rate on this vehicle is a bit worse ~7%. Had a kid and needed to get a safer, larger, reliable vehicle for the family and dogs. This vehicle was purchased with a BIFL mentality and it was a screaming deal for the price I paid. After I pay off my wife's car however, I would like to refi this loan for a lower rate, let it report on my credit a while, help my score, etc.

My score right now is ~720. I have never missed a payment on anything that reports to the big 3. However, my oldest account is only ~2 years old right now and it is my lowest balance CC.

I also have ~$10k owed to the IRS from being shitty with finances when I began contracting. I am on a payment plan with them, make regular payments, is about ~3%, so being my lowest interest rate and not reporting to my credit, it seems to be my lowest priority for pay-off. This debt was incurred before I got my shit together and paid attention to finances, etc. I have filed an OIC with the IRS to reduce the amount owed as I did not know what I was doing when I filled out my taxes the first couple of years until I quit doing it myself. I am pretty confident my offer will be accepted, I will pay a couple grand and issue resolved however it seems to be a slow process after my initial proposal.

MY QUESTIONS, TL;DR:

Should I pay off my small car note all the way? Or leave a small balance for the next couple of months to improve my debt-usage ratio?

Should I wait to try and refi my other, larger car note until after I get a mortgage?

What happens if I do not report my OIC situation on a mortgage application? Nowhere does the balance show on any credit reports. Is this something that will show when applying for the actual mortgage and not just the pre-qual?

The amount I am looking for a mortgage is (PMI, taxes, etc included) is ~$100 less than what we pay in rent per month. The PMI is more a safety number as I do not think we will need to pay it. Our rent is about 25% of our net income so nothing crazy.

I have about $4,000 in Credit Card Debt and a $14,000 Balance on my auto loan. Both have very high interest rates and I don't seem to be getting anywhere with them and paying out a lot of interest monthly.

I can take out a $18,000 401K loan and pay it off over a 4 year period via automatic paycheck withdraws (They take the money out of my paycheck automatically)

My monthly payments for the loan would be about $450/mo over 4 years vs. about $700 a month I pay now for the same debt over the same time frame (maybe longer).

From what I have read 401K Loans are BAD NEWS unless it makes sense for paying off current high interest debt.

I know that if I leave or lose my Job I need to pay all of the loan back within 6 months, so I know that is a risk. Right now I do not see myself leaving within 4 years and the job is stable.

Taking the 401K loan would allow me more monthly cash flow and assist in paying down my $24k Student loan balance.

personalfinance,"Feedback, getting my life organized","Hi everyone,
Been lurking here for several years while in grad school. Just got out and am now trying to organize my life + finances. Here is everything and I would love to get feedback.

**Bio**: 25 years old, married, starting a CS job on Tuesday earning $85k/yr+$3k signing bonus. Just signed a lease for an apartment in September.

**Debt**: $2.4k@6.8%, $5.5k @ 6%, $5.5k @ 5.6% in subsidized student loans. We paid off my unsubsidized + my wifes over the last 3 years. I also owe my parents between 40k-60k that they put on parent plus which they have been making payments towards. Overall their debt is easily 150k+ total or more as I also have 3 sisters at uni. About $400 in CC debt at the moment. We put everything on the CC but pay it completely off every month.

**Assets**: '07 Honda. I'll be buying my parent's '96 Honda for a few thousand. We have $12.8k in a rainy day savings fund earning 3%. We have $11.3k and $830 in checking accounts.

**Monthly expenses**:

* Rent $1235
* Cellphone $60
* Internet $30
* Utilities $120
* Auto insurance $150 (probably a bit lower, just an estimate for both cars)
* Health Insurance $225 (estimate, paid biweekly through employer)
* Groceries $300
* 401k $425 (my company does 6% matching, so I have to put in at least $5100/yr to get it all)
* Eating out $150
* Shopping $200

**Monthly Extras** (still sorting it out):

* Gym membership $60
* Loan repayments $500
* Taxes pulled out monthly $2100 (is this too high or low for $85k in IL?)

**One off expenses** (expecting this month):

* Renters insurance $120
* Furniture $1000

I think I have about 6 months before I have to start repaying the student loans. I am a bit impulsive with debt so I will probably just pay them all off in December and be done with the feds. Although I also feel like I should really try paying off my parents asap since family is family. They are fine, but just that family thing. I have all my undergrad loan statements, but we often pulled out more than we really need to because some of my parent's debt was at a lower rate than the parent plus (yeah that sounds pretty bad after I re-read the sentence). So I know what was taken out, I didn't use it all, but I will be helping them in the future more.

My wife doesn't have a job yet, but she is starting to look (just moved in the last week). She was making $35k at her last job, and will be between $30-45k most likely. She wants to start a family, so there are those baby costs looming over me (maybe a year or year and a half away?). Plus wanting to buy a house in the next year and a half if possible. We live within an hour of both of our parents, so having to leave the area is a very low risk.

Finally, I've wanted to open up a vanguard Roth IRA for some time. I know some of the benefits of a Roth IRA. I can pull money out the initial input after I think 5 years. I can pull out some of the earnings for my first house (although just a year or two of earning probably wouldn't be worth it). Should I also be getting a general savings account there? The rainy day savings has a pretty good interest rate for an emergency fund, and we've already stocked it pretty good. I probably should stop putting money into it, but I just have been.

This is my financial life. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. All numbers are rough estimates since I haven't actually gotten my first paycheck, bills here, etc. Thanks!",finance,1378089500
personalfinance,Using home loan to pay off school loan?,"Hey PF.

my wife and I just bought our first house last week and put 20% down ($38,000).  The interest rate on the mortgage is 3.5% and we are paying it over 15 years.  

We have around $140,000 in school loans to pay off still, with an interest rate of 6.8%. 

Does anyone know how much you have to have paid on your mortgage to take out a loan against it?  If I took out say 50 grand and put it towards our school loan, that would save a lot in interest over time (6.8% vs 3.5%).  Is that a dumb idea? Or are there any banks out there that will pay off all your school loans and then you have a loan with them, at a lower rate than 6.8%?  Just not looking forward to paying a ton in interest.

we bring in around $12,000 a month after taxes...monthly home payment is $1,250. 

thanks for any advice...we are very frugal people, and hate paying interest and wasting money!",finance,1378086424
gaming,Crysis 1 [PC] will not run. Should I skip to Crysis 2?,"A while back I downloaded Crysis 1 for the PC. I've always wanted to play the game but I never had a machine capable of running it until now. After downloading and installing it, the game immediately crashes on startup. This happened the exact same way with a purchased download from GameStop as it did from a torrented .iso. I haven't been able to fix it. No one I know can explain why a game designed for Vista won't run on Windows 7 64bit. Anyways, I'm fed up with it and I want to know if it's safe to skip ahead to Crysis 2. I'm usually quite particular with playing games in order of release, but I'm fed up with not playing any of them. What are your suggestions?

personalfinance,What next?,"I'm married, mid-30s, household income about 90k/year, maxing 401k. No debt aside from mortgage, 15K emergency fund, 15K (and growing) fund that we're using for upgrades to the old house we bought last year. We're also hoping to have a baby next year. We still owe 300K of the 330K purchase price at 3.375%. We're banking a few grand each month and have been using it to aggressively pay down the principal on the house, with the idea that we should get to 20% equity in our home ASAP to get rid of the $200/month mortgage insurance we're currently paying.

Is this a reasonable strategy? I'm tempted to sink everything we've got in savings to get to 20% but I imagine that's probably reckless. In the meantime, is there something better I can do with my savings and emergency fund instead of leaving them in a savings account with a crappy (but relatively competitive) interest rate? How about once we get to 20% equity, can I take advantage of the low mortgage rate we have and prioritize some investments over paying off the house?",finance,1378252078

The world may be increasingly unstable, riven by economic woes and political upheaval. Yet still they come. Perhaps not in such great numbers as when the global economy was soaring to new heights, but they come all the same: the world's great cities and their leaders, lining up in a beauty pageant to secure the event that has become all things to all people – a panacea that can distract from a country's woes or underline their ambition on a global scale.

At the International Olympic Committee's session in Buenos Aires next weekend, protests and turmoil will seem a world away amid the polite protocol and arcane traditions of the body that will bestow the gift of the 2020 Olympics on Madrid, Istanbul or Tokyo.

The first is still in the grip of economic meltdown, the second made global headlines as the centre of political revolt in Taksim Square and the third has convinced many of the 104 voting IOC members that it can host the Games, but has much work to do persuading them why.

The six candidates to replace Jacques Rogge as the IOC president and arguably the most important person in world sport, in a vote that will also be decided in Buenos Aires, have lined up to argue that the costs of bidding for and staging the Olympic Games must come down. Yet there appears no sign of the bidding circus and the media frenzy that surrounds it being reduced in scale.

The swisher hotels of the Argentinian capital will this week hum to the sound of fevered speculation and last-minute lobbying as the three cities hone their final presentations before Saturday's vote.

The IOC instigated stringent rules in the wake of the Salt Lake City scandal, which tend to place greater importance on the inspection reports compiled by a team led by the British IOC executive board member Sir Craig Reedie.

Yet those same reports leave plenty of room for interpretation and, in 2005 and 2009, it was a late drive by a bid that did not begin as favourite but was able to time a last-ditch lobbying push to make a compelling emotional as well as logistical case that came through to win.

In 2005 in Singapore Lord Coe and Tony Blair helped London to victory with their stirring legacy pledges. Four years later in Copenhagen Rio swayed the IOC members with promises of beach volleyball on Copacabana and the bald fact that the Games had never been held in South America.

The shortlist may not be as long as in previous years – ambitious but flawed bids from Doha and Baku were chopped at an earlier stage and Rome bowed out as Italy's economic woes deepened – but the competition is as keen as ever. The success of the 2012 London Games was a huge relief for the IOC, as the lavish tributes paid by the various presidential candidates have made clear.

Dr CK Wu, the sometimes controversial president of the Association of International Boxing Associations, said London was ""probably the most successful Olympic Games in history"", adding: ""The public support for the sport was so impressive. You have left a legacy in so many ways."" Sergey Bubka, the International Association of Athletics Federations vice-president who is also standing, said it was ""unforgettable"". The Singaporean IOC vice-president Ng Ser Miang called the 2012 edition a ""huge success"".

The legacy rhetoric has allowed the government and the organisers, on the back of sometimes fairly flimsy figures, to declare that the Olympics were not only a success on their own terms but delivered long-lasting reputational and economic benefits.

In some ways London 2012 rebooted the Olympic movement after the money-no-object spectacle of Beijing, making governments around the world gaze longingly at the feelgood fillip it provided to a country suffering economically and the extent to which it effectively rebranded London and the UK.

The arguments about whether the £8.7bn in public money spent on the Games represented value for money, and indeed whether the true number was in fact far higher, will go on and on. But in the eyes of those who made the bid promises, it was an unalloyed success.

Paradoxically, the idea of hosting major sporting events is in some ways more attractive to governments in difficult times – providing they can convince an often sceptical public that the outlay on infrastructure is worthwhile – because they deal in the rare and precious commodities of hope and optimism.

""There are many reasons why people want to organise the Games. But there is one common denominator,"" says Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, the son of the former IOC president and an IOC member who is a pivotal figure in the Madrid delegation. ""It is the utmost party of youth, it is the best phenomenon in the world nowadays that delivers inspiration for the youth. It means good news, it means healthy competition, the youth of the world coming together."" Samaranch's Madrid bid started as an outsider but has gathered momentum and support in recent months and is now a contender. ""All of that represents much more than money, much more than investment, new stadia or new airports. It is a dream. It is such good news in a world that has so little good news to offer.""

Madrid offers what it calls ""a new vision"" for the Olympic movement. By promising to hold the Games largely in existing venues and with clever use of temporary ones, it insists the Spanish capital can deliver them at a fraction of the cost. ""That's the feeling we have, momentum wise,"" Samaranch added. ""It feels everything is clicking together. We've put together a very solid bid and we are very happy. We are proud and confident. When you are bidding, you need many things. But there are two key things: you have to prove what differential you can offer to the Olympic movement and why it is important to you."".

""On the first, we believe that in the world today we can't afford the vast expense of previous Olympic Games. I don't think there is anyone now who thinks the Games are about big investment programmes.""

Istanbul, by contrast, is more in the Rio mould: an expansive, ambitious vision that promises to unite east and west on the banks of the Bosphorus. It was making real headway until the wall-to-wall live coverage of the Taksim Square protests stopped it in its tracks.

Tokyo, meanwhile, stands somewhere between the two. The bookmakers' favourite, it ticks all the boxes in terms of infrastructure and facilities but must convince IOC members it can pack an emotional punch and improve its reputation for dour presentations – explain the ""why"" as well as the ""how"".

There does seem to be a genuine push within the IOC hierarchy to find ways of reducing the costs of the summer Games, even as they search for new events and responsibilities elsewhere to expand their remit.

It has become a key debating point in a presidential race that began with the German Thomas Bach as favourite but in which he faces a tough challenge from the 64-year old Singaporean Ng, who has the advantage of representing the view that the IOC should look beyond Europe for its leader for the first time.

Wu said: ""To reduce the costs is very important. With the economy as it is, who can guarantee that in future cities will be able to afford to hold a Games like this. My proposal is to make 50% of the venues temporary. After the Games, they can be dismantled and shipped to the next Olympic Games to be used.""

And yet even while the candidates pursue their austerity manifestos to match the times, the three 2020 bidders will leave no stone unturned and no expense spared in their efforts to secure the self-styled greatest sporting show on earth.",finance,1378185629
finance,Black-Scholes for Restricted Stock Units,"Hello,

Does anyone have a concise Black-Scholes formula for Restricted Stock Units? (Stock awards granted to employees at full value, vested at specified durations).  I know the full formula is applicable to more complex derivatives.  Any other insights would be appreciated. 

EDIT:  The reason I mentioned Black-Scholes was that I had read that the IRS recommended a valuation for RSUs in the case of divorce, but perhaps that source was wrong.  I understand that a stock can not be valued at higher that its market value.  Still though, I found a good source (http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/esops.pdf) that included a quote regarding restricted stock from the FASB.  ""In estimating  the fair value of restricted securities, the quoted price of an otherwise identical unrestricted security shall be adjusted for the effect of the restriction, considering factors such as the nature and duration of the restriction, the volatility of the unrestricted security, and the risk-free interest rate.""  
So, it seems to me that there should be some sort of formula to account for these variables.  Anyone have any insight?",finance,1378185094
personalfinance,We need advice on a car loan we didn't know existed until now...,"Hi guys,

My husband and I frequent PF pretty often and would appreciate advice on something we have just become involved in. Today, I found out that my dad has been paying for a car loan for me that i thought had been paid a long time ago. As it turns out, he has $6400 left as a pay off amount on a $17,900 loan, with a 7% interest rate, and a 5 year term. He financed the vehicle through Toyota Financial Services in the summer of 2009 and has been paying the minimum ever since. Why he didn't tell me about this sooner, I really couldn't tell you. But now that I know about it, I want to really take it off his hands. He certainly can't afford it, and while we would take a pretty big hit, we are willing to go ahead and just pay it off in full and be done with it. Before we do so though, we wondered if we had any options here. I.E- Is there any room for negotiation, would refinancing for a lower interest rate be best (we really don't want to deal with payments though), is it really as simple as just paying the ""pay off"" amount on the website? Or is there some sort of trick we should be aware of? We really have no idea what we are doing here. 

For reference, we are both in our early to mid 20s, recently married, and have about $5300 in take home pay between us. No other real debts, a 6 month emergency fund (that we would dip into to pay this off), and 2 IRAs that we are currently funding.

I recently divorced and for the sake of simplicity, I have about 15k in an IRA.  In order to defend myself from my ex-wife I had to cash out a bunch of stock to pay for a lawyer.  It paid off, but basically I got stuck with a 6000$ federal tax bill and a 2000$ (Minnesota)state tax bill from the increased income.  I borrowed some money from a friend to pay off the state and used PayUSAtax to get into a payback agreement with the federal bill.  I've already paid my friend back half already, but still owe 1000$.  I'm paying 203$ a month on my federal tax bill.

To make matters worse;
- I have some medical bills that are going to collection, less than 5 grand at the moment.
- I have to find a new apartment in April.  Need to save up for deposit/first month and preserve my credit score.

Looking at my budget, I'm just getting by, and I can see that it's getting tighter as the months go by.  I have a good job (80k/year), and I've started a new 401k (Contribution is low as it will go to give me the additional cash in my check.) Zero'd out my exemptions so I don't accumulate additional tax liability.  

If I withhold 40-50% of the IRA payout will it be enough to keep from getting another huge tax bill at the end of this year?

Thank you for your time and advice. I appreciate it! :)

TL/DR: How do cash out my 15k IRA so that I have no or little tax liability for upcoming tax deadline.",finance,1378332111

I've looked at options for getting it there already:

*Removing the drives and shipping it via FedEx or some specialized courier service (expensive obviously, but I'll pay to protect it if I have to)

*Buying some pricey hard-shell luggage and just taking it with me that way (bringing that plus my other stuff through an airport on my own seems like a big pain, but having it with me is a nice comfort bonus)

*Or last resort, leaving it here (sobs), and buying a new laptop that'll suit my needs as much as possible.

Another compounding issue is that this job is a newly created position - the initial contract is only four months, so if it doesn't work out, any expense paid shipping it could be doubled come the end of December. If that is my best option, I'd like to do it as cheaply as I can while still making sure the whole thing doesn't get dropped out of a plane somewhere over Utah.

personalfinance,"Trying to get an Auto Loan, anything we might be missing?","Hello /r/personalfinance,

My Boyfriend and I are at our wits end, trying to figure out how to get him an auto loan for a vehicle he desperately needs.

He had *okay* credit to start out, he did the whole run around with a secured credit card for a year, and now has a regular credit card, only getting him into the mid 6's. He's been trying to apply for a few loans, and the inquiries have started to chip away at his score, which is unfortunate.

We've tried almost everything, and he still keeps getting declined. He sold his falling apart car private sale and got a decent bit for it, but he's on the market for a car that will last him a little while, and needs to finance about 5k. 

Apparently, when you have *okay* credit, 5k is a lot to ask from borrowers. I was wondering if there were any loopholes/tricks that are out there that personalfinance knew about to try and net some extra financing/boost for the vehicle. He's looking to put down a lot of money up front (he saved all he got from the car he sold, and is saving his paychecks diligently. He's looking to put down 5k. He lives with his parents, and has no living expenses to speak of. He likes to go out to dinner, but he's saving everything he makes and it's not hurting his budget.) He isn't terribly worried about having a high interest rate right now, as I work at a Credit Union and am confident that we could refinance the loan in a year need be.

Where could one come about a 5k auto loan? Should I/Could I be doing more (I have low 7's for a credit score.) Is there something we're missing? He's applied to major banks, credit unions, everything really short of those seedy payroll-advanced type loans.

He's had a rough year, we both have really. His birthday is next week and we just want to do something nice for him in getting this loan.

ANYWAY. Had some unexpected vet bills and been eating out a lot these last couple of months due to stress and mismanagement of time and got myself $1000 in credit card debt. I do have a couple thousand in savings but: 

*a) I need most of it for school
*b) I'm trying to move out of my parents' house by the beginning of next year so I have a kind of non-negotiable monthly savings goal that as a rule, I don't plan on touching until I need it to move out (the exception was for the down payment on the car).

If things stay as is, I can pay off about $200-300 a month on the card and take care of it by February or March. According to Mint.com that'll leave me paying about $50 in interest over that time. 

My Questions/Concerns:
* Idea: get a new credit card (I only have one now, I'm *usually* good about paying off the balance monthly) with 0% APR, transfer the balance, and essentially stop stressing? 
* Will the credit check hurt my score, or will it be a kind of wash since I'll be getting a new card and opening up a new line of credit? I'm concerned because I had two credit checks in the process of getting a new car just a couple of months ago and I know too many in a short time span can reflect badly.
*Should I just stick with the obvious plan to pay it off monthly and deal with the interest rate?

Bitcoin,I would appreciate some feedback on this project. Also who could do this for some BTC?,"I have been trying to find a way to visualize in an understandable way how a debt-based moneysystem benefits the banks and those who already have capital. I think I have come up with a good way and would love to see this done. As the video concerns bitcoin in a way (as in the more people understand the moneysystem we have the more they will be interested in alternatives) I thought I´d get some feedback and maybe help! 

I know it´s a lot of work to make a neat animation like this, but maybe someone knows exactly how to do it and it wouldn´t take him or her that long. And maybe this someone likes the idea so much that he or she will do it sort of for the educational benefit this animation might have. I would even be willing to pay a small amount of BTC as a sign of good will, (unfortunately I can´t pay a normal hourly rate).

So here´s what I am thinking of:

A text that would have to be written explains what happens when a bank lends money to someone. (Such as ""The bank simply writes the newly created money on either sides of their balance sheet and crosses it out as the customer pays back the credit. The interest rate has not been created in this transaction so it will be left over in our financial system as debt) You know what I mean, there already are several videos like this. 

Now what I am imagining for the video is a number animated graphs that get bigger and smaller as money is transferred around. There would be one graph for the banks money, one for the creditor and maybe one more chart for another person (from whom the creditor would get the money to pay the interest). This graphs should demonstrate how after the 100k loan was created in the bank´s balance another 10k is created on top of that (the interest). Now the two bars kind of load up the money. As the loan is paid back the graphs shrink, but left over is 5k that stays as debt in the system.

Stylewise I am thinking that it should be done in a modern way maybe even with ""plop"" sounds when the money is created and so on. 

Not that I have written all this I realize it would be quite the project. However, maybe with some positive feedback it´s worth the effort so what do you think about this?",cryptocurrency,1378396222

investing,I'm thinking the market will continue to drop/decline this month after the Fed policy meeting on QE taper on the 18th. What are your opinions? And what do you recommend for hedging?,"First of all, I am no expert and this is just my personal opinion as to how the market may behave. I am just posting because I want to see what others are thinking. So let's not start attacking each other on differences in opinions. 

secondly, I don't trade individual stocks. I only deal with ETFs and mutual funds. 



With that said...
So this QE taper thing has been on the news for a while and from what I gather, there are two opposing opinions. One side is saying QE infinity and the other is saying the fed will begin tapering this month. I am siding towards the latter due to the following:

1. The fed is probably scared of hyperinflation so they do need to go easy at some point - I realize this doesn't have to be September..but it also could be.

2. Draghi's announcement about ECB interest rates to remain the same or lower strengthens the dollar as Europe's recovery seems to take a bit of a hold.

3. Overall economy seems to be on track to recovery though not quite satisfactory. (maybe tomorrow's nonfarm payrolls report could add to supporting this thought)


The bottom line is, this taper thing may not happen this month, but it seems to me like it will happen in the near future. What do you suggest I do in terms of hedging? Is it best to sit some money out in the money market in order to buy back when the market does drop? I mention the money market because buying bond etfs right now would not be profitable. Is there a better option/route that I could take?

Please critique my thinking! Also, I would appreciate it very much for any advice or suggestion! Thanks!

Even when a school is successful at teaching kids, they fail by creating students who are not independent learners, who are too afraid to try new things because they fear failure, who are terrible at divergent thinking and just don’t have the creative and critical thinking skills that will help them thrive.

The teachers socialize the kids by teaching them complete obedience to authority and that there is one right answer and the authority figure is the one who knows it.

Kids are not allowed to learn at their own pace, so both students who excel in certain subjects as well as those challenged by them are not served. If a child finds a subject especially interesting, they can’t delve deep into that topic in the school environment.

Toxic peer environments are created by grouping kids together by age instead of by interests, or learning styles, or any other more meaningful ways. Kids miss out on the value of collaborating with kids who are not their exact age. But really, they aren’t allowed to collaborate much at all, which is too bad because collaboration is also a valuable skill.

So even when a school succeeds, they fail. And they too often fail to even teach kids the basics of reading, writing and math.

But there are already many successful and innovative teaching methods available. There is Reggio, Waldorf, Charlotte Mason, and Montessori to name a few. There are also amazing opportunities to learn with new technology.

We have the ability to create self-directed learners by using mentors and grouping kids together with others that share their passions or learning styles. We can benefit kids by letting them work with kids older and younger than themselves. We can help kids learn from failure and learn not to be afraid to try something new. We can help them become creative thinkers and critical thinkers.

And we desperately need to create more people who think like this. We have so many problems that require innovative thinking. Problems like, how do we better use our resources so that so much of the world doesn’t lack enough food or access to basic health care? How do we keep from overpopulating the world and ruining it through pollution and depletion of environmental resources? It can be pretty depressing to see these problems that our kids will have do deal with and know we have entire generations waiting for authority figures to spoon them “right” answers.

But we can create a better generation. Maybe we will start small, but we can create generations where each year we have nurtured more and more young adults into the kind of innovators that we need to solve these problems. With enough innovators, any problem can be solved.

But of course most of us look at the problem of education reform and don’t know how to make anything change. Our schools are layered in Federal, State and Local government bureaucracies, unions, administrations run by people with PhD’s in what-we-don’t-want-to-do-anymore. The PTA’s are filled with parents who just want higher scores on those terrible standardized tests. Where does innovation begin?

If you are familiar with the Law of Diffusion of Innovation, then you know that innovation starts small, with just a few innovators. Then come the early adopters, and eventually the early and late majorities. Finally the laggards change, if it is absolutely required.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations

So how do we change education if we are dealing with a system where you need to convince the laggards and late majority folks to make an innovative leap at the same time as the innovators and early adopters?

You start OUTSIDE of the current school system. We start our OWN schools. We innovate without them, but with a vision of changing education for EVERYONE as more and more parents and teachers are comfortable with embracing innovation. But we can IMMEDIATELY make a drastic difference in the lives of the kids who are in the first waves of change.

How do we start schools outside the system? We start small and use as many ways as we can find. We start ONE ROOM at a time. We make a whole bunch of One Room Schools. These One Room Schools can include age ranges across all grade school levels or just a few. They can be Waldorf or Reggio or Montessori or something new entirely. The beauty of it is there is not ONE WAY. We allow innovators to be innovators.

How do we pay for this? Some may be funded by businesses or organizations. Maybe companies like Rackspace or Google or Apple could devote a little money and space for a One Room School. Others will start with parents forming their own co-op schools. Back in the 1800’s, One Room Schools were built by the members of a community who came together and hired a teacher.

We can do that again. A group of families can come together and provide a space and materials and a few hundred dollars a month per student to pay a teacher. They won’t need accreditation, because we don’t want accreditation. We aren’t out to prove that our schools operate like a tradition school. That is not the goal. They won’t have administrators to pay, or secretaries. Parents can find materials at garage sales or their own closets. It doesn’t have to have the price tag of a traditional private school. Maybe a business will sponsor a child in one of these parent co-op schools.

There might be crowdfunding for a lot of these schools.

There will be other innovators with other ideas on how to create these schools.

There is not ONE right answer for how to create the schools or what methods to use.

When innovating, you often find you need to tweak what you are doing, or completely revamp it, or add things to it. That is not something easily done when our public school systems try anything new. But small groups of innovative people running One Room Schools can easily make these changes as they learn from their experiences.
Who will we find to teach/mentor in these schools? There are lots of amazing, innovative teachers who want to make a real difference. They are no longer allowed to be innovative and help their kids the way they want because they are forced to spend all of their time trying to get kids to pass standardized tests. These teachers are spending 80 hours a week on their jobs because of all of the busy work. The good ones are leaving the teaching field because their talents are wasted and their time is squandered. Let’s give these teachers an opportunity to really make a difference.

This is an idea for people who care about the future of the planet, the future of our country and the future of our children. It’s for people who want to change education for all children and who want to be able to do something real RIGHT NOW to make an immediate difference in the lives and education of children. It may start with parents creating One Room Schools for their own children, but it is not selfish. It is what we need to do to drive the public schools to innovation.

And everyday people can help make this happen, even if you don’t start your own school, you can spread the word. You can suggest it to parents who are looking for something better for their kids’ education. You can connect with experts in the various educational methods to encourage them to reach out to parents and businesses who might be interested in forming a One Room School. You can add your own ideas to the movement.",technology,1378504058

14k principal on a loan, 1.5k left in interest accrued. 10.88% interest rate.

Loan originated with company A. Company A sold the loan to company B, and I've been paying B to reduce the interest (something like 4k in the last two months).

I recently found out that Company A charged an additional $630 as a fee to apply for the loan. This money is not due to Company B, as they only own the principal and interest on the loan (I've confirmed this with the people at Company B). It is, however, listed in the current balance for the loan on Company B's web portal.

I've got an emergency fund with a few thousand in it, so I'm not to worried about that. However, between my wife and I (being dumb teenagers), we have about 17k in CC debt.

personalfinance,"Given the recent post and discussion on federal pensions, how much can we rely on a state pension?","My wife recently got a job as a state employee - namely, she is in the public school system in Massachusetts.  Her job comes with a pension that will pay a maximum of 80% of the average of her highest 3 yearly salaries if she retires at 60 with 30 years of service (we are both in our mid-20s).  She anticipates working in the school system for the rest of her career, and her salary will probably top off in the $75-$80K range, so in retirement that would be about a $60K yearly benefit.

How much can we rely on this pension being there in 30+ years? I was taking a look at the [pension reserves annual report](http://www.mapension.com/files/4213/5576/6437/CAFR_Fiscal_Year_2012.pdf) and the following paragraph seemed cause for alarm:

*The most recent Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission (PERAC) valuation report, dated
January 1, 2012, calculated the Commonwealth’s unfunded actuarial pension liability at $23.6 billion. The
PERAC valuation report estimates that, as of January 1, 2012, the pension liability is 65.1% funded using a
target date of 2040. It should be noted that the unfunded actuarial pension liability is calculated on a
calendar year basis.*

65.1% funded through 2040 doesn't seem very good, especially since our retirement would be probably in the 2045-2050 range.  This worry is compounded with the fact that my wife is now reluctant to contribute to her Roth IRA, as she believes that her pension is more than enough to retire on (combined with my Roth IRA and 401k).  She would rather spend the $5,500 we would put into her Roth elsewhere (home improvements, traveling) than put it towards retirement.  We already live a frugal lifestyle, so I'm having a hard time convincing her to still contribute.

Any arguments I can use to convince her otherwise?  Am I being paranoid in thinking the pension won't be there, or at least won't be there in the current projected amount?  I don't plan on changing anything with my own 401k and Roth, but does she have valid cause to stop her Roth contributions?",finance,1378476768

I am 30 middle class. I bought a house about 12 years ago, it made me 3x capital gain in 12 months. I have since bought more property, been self employed and basically just do what i want. 


Many of my close friends live pay to pay, pay rent, i even rent a house to one guy. I often get sob stories about how they're broke or can't eat in a given week. I usually end up paying for things, but it has come to a point where I feel like now i pay for everything . 


Few stories, I let one girl live in my house for a while and she (accidentally) damaged half my bathroom which i let her off, also i often shouted her food and weed, i think i spent about $2000 on her including the damage. when she moved out i just asked her to replace some curtains, but she didn't. another guy i lent my ipad when he went overseas, brought it back broken, i told him to just go me halves in a new one and he still never has. Another girl i let live with me, supported her through unemployment and depression, then she turned on me and hasn't spoke since. others i'm the guy who pays for pizza, buys concert tickets (and then wait 6 months for the concert before i get paid back) buy alcohol etc.


kind of curious what the social norm is in my situation. Obviously my friends are just taking advantage, but they are still my friends. I don't know how to tell them to knock it off or ask them to pay for things without coming off as an ass. They know that i was very lucky to buy my property when i did, and they struggle along on minimum wage or unemployment. Has anyone else had to deal with this?




**Edit** - Just an update on this. I have decided to enact a no paying for anything policy for the foreseeable future. Whenever a situation arises that i would previously pay for, i am going to tell them to get stuffed since i am sick of paying for peoples shit. but i am not going to specifically mention anyone's names. i am hoping this will be a wake up call to anyone who has just been free rolling without really realizing, and maybe guilt them into a change. anyone who doesn't like it is probably a replaceable friend.


It is really not in my nature to approach people and ask for money, so anyone who already owes me money i am just going to memory bank it and never lend or give them anything. and in the future i will have a strict policy on lending based on past dealings with the individual. i am also not going to down pay for concert tickets and flights any more, and no more house mates.",finance,1378475257

I was able to save a little bit, but not much.

Three months ago, I started a new job at $65,000/year. I splurged and got a studio apartment (worth it), but now I really want to start positioning myself for a financially stable future. Unlike my last job, this one should involve regular raises and room for growth.

**GOALS:**

* 6 months living expenses as an emergency fund ($18,000)
* $25,000 additional in savings (not inc. retirement)
* *(Those first two mean saving about $33,000 on top of what I already have)*
* 10% of after-tax, after-student-loan, after-rent income given to charity ($178/month)
* Two Buddhist seminaries and a retreat next year ($4,000 total)

Reddit, please help me think through how to make this happen. I'm open to any advice.

**Question: Given my student loan interest rates, should I be less concerned about building my savings account (beyond the emergency fund) and more concerned about paying down those loans?**

**SAVINGS:**

$10,000 in the bank

$2,200 in an IRA

**POST-TAX INCOME:**

$3,900/month

**DEBT:**

$46,000 in student loan debt (interest rates from 6.8-8.25%)

No credit card debt; I always pay it in full each month

**MONTHLY EXPENSES:**

Rent + Utilities: $1,375 (unfortunately, this is considered cheap for where I live)

Student Loans: $750

Food + Dining: $400

Retirement: $250

Haircuts: $60

Charity: $50

Transportation: $50

Phone: $14 (work pays most of it)

Miscellaneous one-time: $200

**LESS THAN MONTHLY, BUT STILL REGULAR EXPENSES:**

4-5 rental cars per year to visit parents: $1200/year

Extra student loan payments: About $1500/year

**Now, as for my second question.** I'm in a relationship with someone who is financially unstable but actively working to get himself on track. He's 34 and finishing the last year of his masters program, and has a competitive resume for the job market. He's working part time while in school to cover basic living expenses but has tens of thousands in debt for his masters and about $8,000 in debt from some stupid financial decisions made about 5 years ago (he is making payments regularly). He has little money in the bank and no retirement savings.

Trust me, I am proceeding with caution. I feel like I'm finally hitting a position where I can see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of my own financial position. I want a house and kids and retirement account and I think my career is starting to take off, and those things could happen, but even if he gets a decent full-time job upon graduation, I feel like he's 10 years behind where he could be, financially, and I'm not sure he could make up the ground in time for us to have a home and family before we're in our 40s.

In the first episode of The Daily Show following the attacks, you mentioned that one of your [earliest memories](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1457392) is of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. – you expressed your hope that our nation's recovery from these extreme acts of violence would reflect ""a dream realized… Martin Luther King’s dream."" Though Dr. King was killed in 1968, it was not until [1999](http://www.thekingcenter.org/assassination-conspiracy-trial) that 'conspiracy theories' claiming his death was something more than a hate crime began to achieve mainstream validity: as documented on The King Center's website, ""after four weeks of testimony and over 70 witnesses in a civil trial in Memphis, Tennessee, twelve jurors reached a unanimous verdict on December 8, 1999 after about an hour of deliberations that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy."" Dr. King’s wife, Corretta Scott King, called the verdict 'a victory for truth' and welcomed official acknowledgement of the ""abundant evidence of a major high level conspiracy"" noting that ""the conspiracy of the Mafia, local, state and federal government agencies, were deeply involved in the assassination.""

This is a tricky word, 'conspiracy,' and in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, it has grown even more problematic. As the assassination of Dr. King shows, public awareness of the truth often lags far behind the awareness of powerful elites. As you yourself [have said](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1457355), this issue is about the difference between an open and closed society, and between a free one and a burdened one. Since 9/11, we have witnessed the passage of the PATRIOT Act, and its installation of a vast apparatus of surveillance, alongside two brutal and costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have left over a million people dead. Our government has not used the 9/11 attacks as an opportunity for recovery; instead, it has served as a powerful rhetorical justification for the imperial exercise of American power across the globe, to the benefit of [multinational corporations](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-march-25-2003/halliburton-wins) and their [revolving door](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-november-8-2011/the-walking-debt) of wealthy politicians, rather than the security and prosperity of the American people.

In his words: ""After 9/11, many of the most important news outlets in America abdicated their role as a check to power – the journalistic responsibility to challenge the excesses of government – for fear of being seen as unpatriotic and punished in the market during a period of heightened nationalism… From a business perspective, this was the obvious strategy… But what benefited the institutions ended up costing the public dearly. The major outlets are still only beginning to recover from this cold period."" Why haven't journalists gone further in investigating the circumstances surrounding that tragic day? As you yourself [have noted](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1457578) when discussing the Department of Justice’s hypocrisy in their [prosecution of major financial institutions](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1457584), the government seems to believe in freedom of the press… just not freedom of speech for the people that might talk to the press.

In the past, you have dismissed the notion that 9/11 was an [‘inside job’](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1457588), pointing to evidence indicating Al Qaeda's involvement. However, this does not rule out the possibility of government complicity, corruption, or foreknowledge. In light of the alarming revelations by Edward Snowden, I want to mention another 'whistleblower' of great significance – former FBI language specialist, [Sibel Edmonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibel_Edmonds). After briefly working for the intelligence agency as a translator in late 2001, she was fired in [retaliation](http://www.justacitizen.com/articles_documents/Edmonds.ReplyBrief.pdf) after stumbling upon evidence of government complicity in various acts of [espionage and treason](http://ariwatch.com/Links/SibelEdmondsDeposition2009.htm). She was called to testify before the official 9/11 Commission to discuss evidence she possessed demonstrating [profound government foreknowledge](http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2011/02/01/the-fbi-“kamikaze-pilots”-case) of the 9/11 attacks – but Attorney General John Ashcroft intervened, invoking the 'state secrets privilege' and placing on her a [gag order](http://www.pogoarchives.org/m/gp/a/POGO%20facts.pdf) of unprecedented scope; in the entire 500+ page official report, her 8-hour testimony is mentioned in only a [minor footnote](http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf). Edmonds has recently written and published a book, entitled ""[Classified Woman](http://www.amazon.com/Classified-Woman-The-Sibel-Edmonds-Story/dp/0615602223),"" about her story and the enormous obstacles she has encountered in her attempts to bring attention to government corruption and abuses of power.

You [said recently](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1457427) with regard to the IRS' targeting of fringe right-wing political groups, ""this has, in one seismic moment, shifted the burden of proof from the tin-foil behatted, to the government."" There has been a dearth of public discussion of 9/11 despite the ever-increasing pile of evidence casting doubt upon the government's official story – you are in a privileged position, as the host of an incredibly entertaining and popular Comedy Central show, to do something about it. This Wednesday, I hope you will join the chorus of [millions of Americans](http://rethink911.org) demanding transparency and accountability for what really took place on that tragic day twelve years ago. All Americans, and in particular the families of the innocent people who needlessly perished, deserve to know the truth – we hope that you will use your national platform to, once again, help shift the burden of proof from the 'tin-foil behatted' to the government, where it belongs.

What's most important to me with this card is the ability to turn it into an unsecured card I would actually want/use like one with no annual fee and preferably with rewards. I would also like the a low annual fee.

I'm not too worried about interest rates, as I don't intend to carry a balance.

So far I'm liking the USAA Secured card, but I don't know if I can turn that into a card I would like to have.

Also I'm wondering if it's reasonable to just get any secured card and once I get my score up to the point where I qualify for a better card to just drop the line of credit and take the hit to my score and use the better card to build my history up.

personalfinance,"Important PSA: Until you already have a lot of money, your rate of return matters MUCH less than your rate of savings","Something that always blows my mind is seeing people upset about low interest rates or bond yields while simultaneously disclosing that they only have 4-digit sums saved up. 

For those of us who are just starting to save and invest, understanding how investment works is important, but so is a realistic assessment of what we can get out of it. 

Thought experiment: John earns $50,000 per year and has $5,000 in the bank earning 0.5% interest. that amounts to about $2.1 in interest every month. 

Now, John instead decides to invest in a high yield corporate bond fund, and manages to get an attractive 4% interest rate. John is now earning $16.67 in interest per month - but his money is less liquid, has MUCH higher risk of principal loss, is less tax advantaged, etc. 

$16 is better than $2, right? But John's salary is over $4,000 per month before taxes... John could make up the difference between those interest rates by making sound frugal choices - saving leftovers, packing lunch at work just a few days instead of eating at a local sandwich shop, etc. 

High interest rates are nice, but while you're starting out the earnings you get from interest *tend* to be much less significant than the earnings you get by choosing to save money, be frugal, and generally maximize value.

The tables get turned later on though. John diligently saves and now instead of $5,000 in his bank, he has $100,000. 

4% interest per year comes to $330 per month - a figure that's much harder to generate by frugal choices, even if his salary has gone up while he saved. 

If John has $250,000 in the bank, that 4% interest rate is now over $800 per month - more than a lot of people pay in rent - or even live on! in a month. 

Basically, until you have a lot of money to invest, you shouldn't be distracted by yield. It's bad to ""leave money on the table"" but it's worse to chase yield by taking on more risk than you need to via investments in stocks or other risky asset classes when the return could easily be matched through lifestyle choices. 

Now, if you have an emergency fund and know you aren't saving for something short term (house, car, etc.) then there's no reason to AVOID higher-risk, higher-reward investments just because your total account size is small. But it absolutely shouldn't be the first priority.",finance,1378577967

politics,"Selfie-Saturday: Why I ""support"" a US strike on Syria, the NSA, and believe both are constitutional under American law. This is kind of long. You can't TL;DR a missile.","I am an American and *if* Syria used sarin gas on unarmed civilians then I support a measured military strike against them. My reasoning is as follows:


#1. It is not a violation of international law for the US to unilaterally strike Syria. It just isn't. Maybe it should be, but today on Friday, August 30, 2013 it is not.

#2. It is not a violation of the US constitution for the US President to strike Syria without Congressional approval. In fact, Congress could pass a resolution which *unanimously* opposes a strike against Syria and this would *still* not stop the President from doing it if he wanted to act unilaterally. This will remain the case until the Supreme Court declares that such behavior is unconstitutional. I don't necessarily believe it is. A full discussion on this topic can be quite lengthy but the *functional* end result is that it doesn't matter what *you* or *I* think, it matters what the Supreme Court rules and they have not made a ruling on this issue, therefore it is not presently (8/30/2013) unconstitutional. This is separation of powers and it is a fundamental cornerstone of our republic.

#3. We are not a democracy. We are very specifically *not* a democracy in order to protect against ""tyranny from the majority"" - which means pretty much what it says. The majority of our country cannot stop a minority (always/necessarily) from doing something which ""needs"" to be done. This element is *by design of the founders* (*Federalist No. 10*) Please reference point #2 and imagine a grey area where a lot of things are not specifically defined and exist in a sort of quasi-state where it is ""empirically"" unknown whether they are or are not constitutional, kind of like Schrodinger's Cat.  Amending the constitution *will not change this* but rather a full constitutional convention would be needed. Amendments can be declared unconstitutional, repealed, etc. Articles cannot.

#3a. It isn't a violation of the USC for the NSA to monitor all web communications either. Is it a good idea? That is a *different* discussion but the rationale here is much the same. If something isn't *specifically* mentioned by name as being illegal, or prohibited, then it exists in this legal quasi-state and the *executive* (President) can at his or her own *personal discretion.* [EDIT: [Nulla poena sine lege](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nulla_poena_sine_lege) is the cornerstone of our legal system.] This is why the US President is known as the most powerful man in the free world. This isn't me bragging, or being arrogant, this is *functionally* what they refer to with that title. He/She doesn't need the public, or Congress, or the UN/international community but the scope of what he/she can do is limited as is the number of terms they can occupy the office. 

#3b. Using the Internet (public network) amounts to exercising your first amendment rights in a public space. Speaking in public, the *contents* of your speech, is not (presently) protected by the fourth amendment and contradicting federal law exists which creates a quasi-state that allows this behavior by the executive branch of government with congressional oversight. Legally this is at the center of the net neutrality debate. See *Katz v US*, *US v Graham*, *US v Warshak* (no-SCOTUS ruling, only applies to one federal district and only references the SCA not other federal laws which enable similar behavior), *SJ Res 23*, and Article 1, Section 9 of the USC. For the techies reading this... the NSA is building this system using an agile/scrum approach as the law is defined in real time by the judicial branch of government.

#3c. No part of this should indicate that I, in my professional opinion (IT, coding, etc.), support the system that has been built in terms of it's technical design in relationship to whether it makes technology more or less secure, is properly admin'd, etc. Snowden's revelations indicate that this is not the case, and his ability to ""game the system"" highlights the shortcomings of the project. For that I am grateful to Mr. Snowden, but am conflicted about the other information leaked which escape this specific technical area, and current whistle-blowing legislation does not protect someone from educating the public about a program that is constitutional, but which maybe shouldn't be. This is a judicial shortcoming. Objectively I feel Mr. Snowden is guilty, but I also believe he should be fully pardoned and thanked for his revelations... although I do take some exception to the manner in which he chose to do this, that is something irrelevant and which (imho) can be overlooked completely.

#4. The definition of sovereignty is immensely complex and even as an adult who has been academically studying this field for almost a decade (not professionally, but seriously... it is hard to find a good job in this field, lol) it is something I only feel I have a primitive understanding of. To simplify what constitutes sovereignty, and all of the elements and facets involved... is impossible. Looking at gorillas or chimpanzees, or other social animals and their group dynamics is probably the only analogy I can give you. 

#4a. States are not moral agents (Chomsky) and working within the framework of something like Bacevich's (neocon) definition of sovereignty and then approaching the field from a modern (Russian hyperrealism) take on social contract theory ---&gt; The best way to compare our species and the state of all geopolitical behavior (in history) is to look at a group of gorillas and watch how the alpha behaves. Arguments that humans are different than other animals, or arguments which involve ethics/morality will be referred to Chomsky &amp; Machiavelli's Prince. States are not moral agents. You can also look at the psychology of group mentality, or mob behavior from this ten thousand foot macroscopic global perspective of multivariate systems (sovereign) interacting with one another.

#5. The economics of states are not similar to the economics of your household. My post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1l2264/what_are_some_specific_aspects_of_the_future_that/cbv10po) briefly discusses how the concepts of sovereignty &amp; economics marry. Arguing that the US can't afford to go to war with Syria, or Russia, or China, or any other country for that matter belies a fundamental failure to understand how states operate. That doesn't mean I think it's a good idea, and it doesn't mean that *our individual lives* or the quality of them will directly improve or even become worse. The total scope of this discussion as it relates to war is even more complex... it is fair to say some wars may result in an increase in the standard of living for all Americans, and some wars may result in a decrease. My own reasons for supporting a strike in Syria have nothing at all to do with the subject of economics.

#6. I do not support that the US originally went to war in Iraq in the 90s, I did not support our invasion post 9/11, and I have very mixed feelings about whether or not we should have gone to war with Afghanistan. I feel all of these things were horribly executed. My post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1lc9zl/alan_grayson_on_syria_strike_nobody_wants_this/cbxzmsu) is more detailed on these issues. Additionally, in retrospect I feel it was a very poor decision to involve ourselves in Middle Eastern affairs in the 1950s and likely should have let Wilsonianism take its course... especially in Vietnam. 

#6a. Despite how I feel about the past it happened and I do not, considering the huge advances in global technology since the end of WW2 (introduction of nuclear arms into geopolitics) and referencing point #4, feel it is possible to simply ""walk away"" or ""behave in such a way as though we should have simply behaved in the 1950s"". 

#6b. As we advance towards what will become the future state of geopolitics (Schrodinger) my own personal, or moral, or ethical approach towards our *present behavior* is that gassing ones people constitutes behavior that ultimately threatens regional, and thus threatens global stability by not only running the risk of approaching a future state which makes genocide possible, but by drawing larger global powers into the conflict who are inevitably (states are not moral agents) looking out for their own self interest regarding the definition of sovereignty and ensuring their own self-preservation and existence in *all possible* future states.

#6c. It must be understood by the international community that despite what any of our prior differences in the past have been, that when certain types of behavior and especially those which run the risk of genocide should be reacted to immediately. As they happen in real time. This is not 1939, we have the Internet, and we have the ability to launch effective measured strikes that are not designed to necessarily depose a leader (because we know from the past that this isn't necessarily the right idea either) but show them that this behavior will not be tolerated, and should it become necessary that a larger multinational and unanimous consensus will do whatever is necessary regardless of cost to prevent this behavior from evolving. See #5. Allowing for this behavior to evolve will be more economically costly *always*, which is to say it will always be cheaper over time to nip it in the bud. I'm talking in terms of absolute value as things ""cost"" to states who are sovereign. This is *not* similar to how you balance your checkbook!

#7. War sucks.

#8. I don't know how to solve the problems in the Middle East nor do I even feel educated enough for me to say ""this is what I think we should do"".

#8a. Bombing isn't me saying it's what I think we should do. It's what I feel we must do despite #7. Impassioned arguments from veterans about how shitty war is will be referred to this 7/8 loop and [this](http://imgur.com/2kxA2wb) picture from Tuol Sleng.

#9. All of this hinges on proof and evidence that Syria used sarin against civilians. [Here](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=215850326) is a great article from NPR about nerve agents, why we think it was sarin and not something like VX, although what it is doesn't matter: They are all fundamentally the exact same.

#9a. Establishing proof is something the US can more easily and speedily do than the UN, and the normal way that matters like this are handled is by presenting evidence *to* the UN, not waiting for them to present evidence *to* the US and then passing a resolution for action. UN approval is not necessary to act and in many ways may make the matter even worse. UN approval will likely mean a larger involvement in the region and the need to commit troops, possibly American, which is at this point is (despite the death of over 100,000 by *conventional means*) a less preferable and economically viable route for America as far as #4 is concerned. This can quickly change if, for example, a measured strike/warning is not heeded by Assad/Syria.

#9b. The US has assets in place in Syria and internationally/domestically (NSA, CIA, etc.) which make this much easier to establish. Comparisons to GWB and evidence presented to Congress in order to get approval to invade Iraq post-9/11 will be referred to point #6 and the link that accompanies it. 

#10. It does not matter if Assad himself knew or or ordered these strikes. If he didn't order them and a rogue commander is in possession of sarin then the situation there is worse than if he did order it. The ""best"" (imho) situation would be if he did order it, but no evidence exists which can firmly tie it to him... that way the possibility exists for him to reengage the international community, make huge concessions politically for reform (which may involve losing power but not being convicted and hung), and then allowing for the international community to directly support Syria (preferably, imho, through Europe/Russia) to squash any remaining rebels. 

#10a. This is what Russia wants. See [this](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/03/russia-iraq-10-year-anniversary-putin-bush-syria.html) article. This is why Russia would not want a UN resolution at this time. I wonder whether Snowden will be used as a bargaining chip... US has measured strike, Assad claims he didn't order the attack, public arrest/execution of some commanders, massive reforms promised, then Russia going back to helping put down the terrorists who refuse to stop fighting if they deport Snowden (who is presently violating the terms of his conditional visa).

#11. Regarding the NSA, or the part from the link in point #6 which talks about the ulterior motives of intelligence agencies/military industrial complex misleading the President in relationship to point #3a... I feel very uneasy about the whole thing. I don't think Snowden should spend a day in jail, but at the same time he did break the law. My total feelings on this issue is much more complex and lengthy... I feel that the judicial branch is the short coming here in primitive terms and that guidance is needed as well as a public discussion which feeds into the net neutrality discussion and then feeds into a technical discussion about the architecture of the Internet itself. This becomes highly cyclical and has nothing to do with sarin, or Syria. One must remember in this discussion that the US constitution is several hundred years old and modern introductions of new inventions/technology as they begin to find use by society at large is something that takes time. See #3 and the concept of separation of powers if you disagree.

I am happy to discuss this and remain civil. I don't think you're an idiot if you disagree with me, but at the same time... appeals to the ""majority"" or ""will of the people"" will be referred to *Federalist No. 10*.

Bitcoin,Minecraft Casino BitVegas Hacked. (And Poker alpha released),"Hello Reddit!
Yesterday BitVegas (A Bitcoin Minecraft casino) had a player use an exploit in craftbukkit (The back-bone of Minecraft plugins) to be able to log in as other players, send there money to another account, and withdraw.

This exploit was by using a spoofed login packet. The CraftBukkit team has since updated there code, although I was unable to respond quick enough to this as I was offline.

Around 7 BTC was stolen from the casino. Most of it was stolen from my own admin account and only 0.5762 from player accounts. Fortunately we keep a log of everything that happens in BitVegas so this money will be refunded in full.

No players will be affected by this exploit.

What we have learnt:
We are forever expanding BitVegas. Early players will remember our tiny 3-room casino we launched with. We are now a full-blown 6 story casino with many games.

From this exploit we have learnt not to trust any third party with security. We will be soon adding a second authentication method for logging in. So that even if someone gets access to your Minecraft account they will another step known only by you to access your BTC.

On a brighter note.. We have released our first (Very alpha) version of Texas Hold'em Poker! It's missing a few features such as setting how much you want to bring to the table and the house rake, but feel free to give it a test drive in play-money mode.",cryptocurrency,1378568173
personalfinance,"Pay off credit cards, and put wedding stuff on credit or put money away for wedding?","The subject pretty much explains it all. Due to a bunch of emergency situations in the last year (moving from Chicago to Boston for work and personal reasons, some significant car repairs, other necessities -- I'm generally pretty frugal) I have about $5k in credit card debt. Some of this debt is shared with my fiancee, but for the sake of this discussion, let's pretend it's all my own personal debt.

$1k of the debt is on a bank-provided credit card with an interest rate around 11%. 
$4k (rounding up, here) is on a card that is 0% until June 2014, and then will be something similar to the above, hovering around 10-12%.

We also have a wedding coming up in May. My parents have graciously agreed to pay for nearly half of it, under the stipulation that it would mean a slightly more formal and organized affair. For awhile now I have been going by the idea of sacking away $700 a month to save for the wedding, $800 if I live SUPER frugally for the next 6-8 months, but after another necessary car repair yesterday (and another $1k on the credit card), I'm starting to feel the weight of this debt. I've been a pretty financially secure person for awhile, so I'm naturally inclined to switch gears and start making big payments against my credit cards.

But then the question is: if I do that, will I have enough money for this wedding? Can I just put THAT stuff on credit? That makes me feel kind of sick too, but we're pretty simple people and can likely manage a great wedding on as little money as possible.

What's the best solution here? My fiancee just got a new job that will provide some good credit payment money, too, but for the sake of this discussion, let's pretend that her income isn't a part of it. What would be the best practice? Pay credit now, take on more credit debt later, or save now, pay credit slowly?",finance,1378566892

A friends and I are looking into buying a house together. We're sick of paying high rents, want to build equity, take advantage of low interest rates (going up now!) and we both have good jobs.
We're looking at rental properties(300-400,000$). We live in a college town with one of the lowest vacancy rates in the country, a strong real estate market, growing population, and wonderfully high living standards.
While taking out sweet time looking into first time homebuyer classes, looking into legal agreements (tenancy-in-common vs. joint tenancy), etc, we learned that one of our investor friends has a volunteer working for them. She's older and retired and lives off a bunch of money from an old divorce. These are her terms:
She has 150,000 dollars to invest with us
She doesn't want to have us pay her back over many years, maybe 5 at the max.
A little more background on us: We both make about 50,000$/year. We're pretty young and don't have an extensive credit history or a bunch of downpayment money. Places we're looking at are like triplex's - we'd live in one, rent out the other 2 (or maybe eventually live in 2, rent out one),etc.
One of my jobs is the ED for a small building science non profit. I used to work as a carpenter during college and know many builders, electricians, plumbers as friends. I can also use expensive equipment (cellulose insulating hoppers, etc etc) for free and use their discounts for buying materials . Long story short...I could renovate the house (if needed) for much cheaper than the average joe.
My question: I want to take advantage of this opportunity, while interest rates are lower, I'm young and have plenty of time to build equity (i.e. stop wasting money on rental in a decent market). Is there a way to use her money, make sure its worth while for her, work together with the bank for the rest of the money, use tenants in common then buy her out, or any combination of the above?
I feel if I wait 10 years to buy, interest rates will be higher, housing prices will be higher and it will be harder to obtain a loan. Whether you agree wit this statement or not, do you have any advice for me?

And I have 22.5k in cash on hand from a signing bonus and some summer work. 

I paid my car off (2000 Toyota Corolla with ~180k miles), good chance that this will need replacing in the near future. 

Budget is typical, with rent being the largest expense due to location (~900 per month). 

Now, does it make sense to pay off my highest interest loans first with the cash that I have on hand? Or would it be better to carry the loans out since the interest rate is fairly low? 

Second, what would be the best thing to invest my money in in order to reach an early retirement (age 45 maybe)?

Finally, I have no idea what my tax situation is going to look like. What can I expect for monthly take home given the stuff above?

personalfinance,Emergency fund vs. moving fund vs. debt,"Can/should my emergency fund be the same as my moving fund?

I'm hoping to have saved $12,000 from both freelance income and sending part of my take home pay to savings every month while planning to move in the next year or so (which will open up potential for career advancement, a higher income and/or possibly full time freelancing.) I have 5k saved now plus another 1k set aside for taxes, and more gigs coming up the next few months that will net 2-3k. This 12k figure is based on 6 months of expenses in my current (and cheap) city, I plan on moving to SF/NYC or another coast city.)

I just started a new job in my industry, thought not at the pay rate I was hoping for.

Salaried income after taxes/healthcare (no 401k offered) - $1960/mo

monthly hard costs (rent, phone, car payment (4k), insurance, utilities, student loans (16k) credit card debt (3k))
$1400/mo
This does include minimums on all debt except the CC debt I am paying over at $200/mo and it's a 0% APR until next spring)
This doesn't include food or other soft costs, which really put me at paycheck to paycheck up until I started getting freelance work. This 5k is the most I've ever had saved.

My freelance income is sporadic and right now is serving as a way to both build my emergency fund and also invest in equipment for the work itself (video production is expensive.) I will also need to keep a lot of it aside for taxes on my freelance and some other income ( I was laid off/unemployed before starting to freelance and made airbnb income this year), the 1k I have set aside is in a money market account but am nervous I may owe more than that.

All of my debt has reasonable interest rates no more than 4% except 10k of the student loans at 6.8%

While I realize it may come down to deciding on what risks to take, I'd like to be smart about those risks and am not sure where to focus right now between 1. saving to move  2. build/maintain an emergency fund 3. pay off debt

There's some ways to waive the fee (opening checking acct with direct deposit, starting a CD [min $1000], or mortgage/other loans). However, I'm not looking to start a mortgage or other large loan, my checking is with another bank and I'm not really looking to move. I could however, start a CD, but the rates are so low, I feel like I could put the money elsewhere and do better.


I spend probably ~$3000 on gas a year, because I drive long distances for work. Is it worth it to pay the fee and still receive the cash back? Doing the math I'll make back the money for the fee quickly, but I'm usually against paying fees to use credit cards. I'd need to spend &gt;$2600 to make it worth the same as getting a new card with 4%. Should I look for another card?

About 6 years ago we took a big hit. We were carrying more credit card debt than we should have been and I started bringing in a lot less less money. My Amex card (no credit limit, but not the one that you have to pay off each month) was capped at $25k, which was just about the balance on the card. We have been doing all of the correct things since then and making every effort to pay down the cards. Right now I have two balances left: $10k on this one and $15k on a Chase card with 0% interest for a year. I have about $40k in open credit. I was thinking about using a 0% balance transfer on one of my other cards, but I know that Amex will probably drop my limits down to $1000, or just outright close this card down. I'm worried that doing so will hurt my credit. I have never missed a payment and otherwise have good credit (770s when I last checked). The Amex interest rate isn't awful (around 9%) so I'd be willing to keep paying the interest to prevent a significant hit to my credit score.",finance,1378743395
personalfinance,Debt repayment and moving out of parents' house,"I'm 24 years old and I recently finished paying off all of my privately-held student loans and I'm trying to formulate a plan of attack for my federally-held student loans. I'm currently considering the possibility of moving out of my parents' house before I'm completely paid in full vs staying with my parents until everything is paid off.
  
Here are the details:  
Direct Subsidized: $3.1K @ 6.55%  
Direct Subsidized: $3.9K @ 5.75%  
Direct Subsidized: $4.8K @ 5.35%

Total: $22.5K  
Minimum Payment: ~$275 per month

Here's the plan of attack that I'm currently weighing against my previous plan of attack, which was to pay everything off before moving out: Pay off all of the unsubsidized loans over the course of the next three months, then spend the following six months building a healthy emergency/moving out for first time fund. According to unbury.me, if I pay the minimums on the remaining $16.5K, it will cost about $4K in interest and will be done in 2021. However, I'd also like to be able to aggressively save for retirement as soon as possible. In my current living situation, I can afford to put about $2,400 a month towards my loans and I'd be completely paid off by the summer of 2014, though I would not have much of an emergency fund. If I moved out, I doubt I could comfortably pay more than $1,000 a month, unless I got a roommate (I'd rather not do this if possible). I'm tempted to pay it all off before moving out, but I'm also itching to move out as soon as possible. Does /r/personalfinance have any input?",finance,1378742454
gaming,"If I was a game lead designer, who could make any game I'd like in the blockbuster high budget category, this would be one of the games I would make.","I would make a complete reboot of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. Here me out. 

After all the generic expectations of military shooter gaming today, I would attempt an experiment. A game that does away with most shooter mechanics of today in favor of some new ideas (as well as old ones from the first game on PC) to create a game more about planning, efficiency, atmosphere, and storytelling.

The game would be built up from an updated adaptation of Clancy's original book, ideas presented in the first Rainbow Six game, and cinematic direction similar to what was done by Katherine Bigalow in *The Hurt Locker* and *Zero Dark Thirty* and the numerous directors of the TV Show *Homeland*. With all that in mind, the game would have 4 episodic games that would be highly experimental and introduce the players to the characters, story, and mechanics, all before the final and full retail game is released (simply known as Rainbow Six), which would be geared more towards the basic FPS market, yet have much of what was introduced in the episodic games, streamlined. Here is further explanation of that plan.

*Episode 1: Chavez*
This episode begins in 1992 in LA during [""Operation Green Sweep""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Green_Sweep) a series of drug raids conducted by a joint task team of the US Army, The National Guard, and the Feds. Marking the first time the US Military ever conducted an operation against its own citizens. Being a part of the 7th Infantry Division, John Clark, the eventual commander of Rainbow Six, is a part of the raids.  This game could also change perspective back and forth between John Clark, and his eventual protégé  Domingo ""Ding"" Chavez, who is currently 10 years old. Both stories would eventually meet by the end of the episode.

This part of the game would introduce the gamers to the core command functions of tactical squad work, in close quarter combat. Just in drug raids though with little to no casualties and not terrorist hunts. It is important to get this down here because Ding becomes the eventual squad leader for Rainbow Six. 

*Episode 2: Covington*
It's the year 2000, and a SAS soldier runs out early one morning for a jog in Hereford, England. The player has access to whatever Peter Covington is carrying, either it be water to build endurance after running (will reoccur in final game) or his Gen 1 iPod with assorted playlists for running (PC and Xbox ports will allow a player to play uploaded music). You jog through the streets, assessing the people/cars/other things passing by, introducing the gamer to how a character observes the environment to watch out for targets (Covington's combat instincts never truly shut off) until the player reaches the SAS safehouse, where the crew will be conducting a breach exercise.

This part of the game introduces environment interaction. How things  such as light, sound, and interaction with people can affect the missions. This will also introduce the player to tactical infultration of a small space, say house, bank, etc. Things such as latters, rope, battering rams, disguises, breach charges, and other things from the first chapter would be explored further.

*Episode 3: Vega*
This episode might be the most throwaway, but it does introduce allot of core mechanics and introduces some tense drama. This episode almost serves as an adaptation of Katherine Bigalow's the Hurt Locker, but it all works toward setting up the final game. Set in Iraq in 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Julio Vega of the 75th Ranger Regiment was a part of the invasion in May, and though the Rangers usually push forward, Vega's squad is sitting tight for a couple of weeks, on guard for any Iraqi Republic Guards left over or IEDs.

This episode introduces larger environments, tense atmosphere, and direct combat (i.e. Firefights). It also introduces hostage negotiation, bomb deactivation, and civilian management. The beginning of the episode does not begin with Vega however. Instead, it begins with a kidnaped Iraqi History professor waking up after being drugged (during a kidnaping). To the player's discovery, the professor has a bomb vest attached to his torso. What follows is allot of environment interaction mechanics introduced in episode 2 until the player either explodes (prompting Game Over) or constructs a series of events that eventually lead to Vega's squad, thus prompting a flashback to Vega a couple days earlier and the rest of the game to be played.

*Episode 4: Noonan and Tawney*
This is where many of the new ideas come into play. In the original Rainbow Six, before each map, you were given intel on how the breach of a terrorist hold up would be invaded. This episode introduces an idea to be carried over into the final game: intelligence and surveillance. This includes Spy recon to follow targets to known locations, surveying the area for points of entry and to assess defenses and escape routes, and information gathering via records, wire taps, air surveillance, etc. When all consolidated, this info will be presented to John Clark and other officials via presentation, models, and documents via meeting before each mission. Where the player can choose how the operation will be handled.

*Final Game: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six*

Based on the 1998 novel of the same name, the 36 member special anti-terrorist task force: Rainbow Six is pretty much assigned tasks similar to what was presented in the book, but updated to the 00's instead of the late 90's. Much of the updates will better reflect events that actually happened with assorted nation's military and terrorism from 2007-2009. This installment, more than any previous one, will focus on building a tense/realistic atmosphere and a sense of urgency when needed. Things such as motion capture, of body and facial animations would be important in establishing this. 

All mechanics from the previous episodes would be back in this game, but streamlined to focus on the immediate mission at hand. There wouldn't be too much time for drama, with the exception of what happens in real time as a mission is carried out. Some new game mechanics would be introduced, mostly that of team work based interaction. This game would bring about the return of the whole Rainbow Six team. You control Team 2 as Ding, but you can switch between players in this 10+ squad. Not everyone attends the raid at once, you can bring up to 5-6 members for your squad (instead of 3 in the traditional game and 2 in Vegas). Team One is also present at times, for large operations.

There is not a competitive multiplayer function, but there is a co-op mode that functions very similar to the Payday franchise. The game would have to be re-worked greatly to accommodate computer AI being replace by human players.",technology,1378740373

During the last two months, I have been using this extra cash flow strictly to pay down my debt.
Starting next month, I will be eligible for participation in my employer’s 401k plan. The plan provides for a maximum matching contribution of $2,500 ($0.50 per $1.00 up to the first $1000 matched, and $0.25 per $1.00 up to the $2,500 maximum. Or, in another way, this is $2500 for free on my $8,000 contribution, which translates to an instantaneous 31% pre-tax return. Ignoring future growth, and assuming a 30% tax rate in the future, the post-tax equivalent instantaneous return of 20% far exceeds the 2.3% that carrying my student loans would cost for an additional four months (1/3 of 6.8%, ignoring compounding).
To me, contributing up to the match seems like a no-brainer. Am I missing something?




One stumbling block I may come across is contribution limits. The way I read my employer’s policy, there appears to be a cap on my contribution as a percentage of compensation, currently set at 25%. What is conventional? Do you think it is 25% of annual pay, or of each pay check? I understand this would be the same if you work all year long and are eligible are eligible for the entire period, but not in my case.



Additionally, I will not be eligible for employer match in the following year, because my income will exceed the threshold set by the company for matching contributions. I understand that this is a very nice problem to have, but I feel it is still relevant information.



In order to meet the $8,000 in the three months, my pre-tax contribution per month needs to be $2,667. This would leave me with approximately $2,200 per month, after withholding, for expenses and either additional debt pay down or Roth IRA funding, which should be sufficient. If I am unable to exceed the 25% per month contribution, then the additional surplus would go to paying down debt or a Roth IRA.



In terms of the dollars I have available after making matched contributions, initially, I thought that paying down student loans was my best first step, but upon further consideration the preferential tax treatment on $5500 in a Roth IRA over the next 40 years seems attractive. Moreover, next year I anticipate exceeding the AGI limits for Roth contributions, so I would rather pay down the student loans next year when this privilege is unavailable.



Summary of above questions:
    
1. In my situation, what is the best way to take advantage of 401k employer match and Roth IRA contributions, in the context of my student loan and earnings situation?
2. Are 401k contributions limits typically based on each pay check, or your annual earnings?
    
Additional questions:
    
3. Do you see any areas in my financial life that are ripe for improvement?
4. What else should I be thinking about in my situation?
Thanks for all of the help.

TL;DR – Should I contribute to my 401k before paying down student loans and contribute to a Roth IRA before paying down student loans because I will be ineligible for the match and the Roth in the new year? And, how am I doing financially?",finance,1378700579
investing,Which companies do best in rising interest rate environments?,"I'm curious on Reddit's 2 cents.

We're all certain that fed tapering will lead to rising interest rates. Yet, what's unique about this environment is that short-term rates will likely rise faster than the long-term rates. Eventually though, the spreads between long-term and short-term maturities will expand to historic norms.

I was curious on what your opinion is on which types of companies/industries will outperform the market in a rising yield environment.",finance,1378698527

Bitcoin,some utopia: democrazycoin (an idea),"democracycoin

- Every citizen gets a dc-adress 

- On democracycoin.com all citizen are allowed to submit propositions of things they would like to see done in their country/community

- On every first of the month all adresses are charged with 1 dc

- Over the month everybody can submit his dc to different positions on the list. If it´s not on there, he can submit it

- All positions have to meet certain criteria (this might be the biggest discussion. for now let´s go with only things that at least 50 people send to count)

- At the end of the month an amount all money that has come in via taxes is distributed to the different submissions 

- If someone doesn´t spend his/her dc it doesn´t matter, you just take all dc that were submitted as 100% and go from there (but really, it´s so easy to submit everybody would do it)

- Holy shit!


Ideas for debate:

- Should the transactions be anonymous? From the technical side either one should work.

- The criteria for the submissions need to be thought through. Maybe there could even be different dc for different purposes. For example you could have 1 dc to spend on federal budget and 1dc for state budget and 1 for your local community. 

- Depending on your view on how society should work you could also put rules on what kind of submissions can be made to avoid stuff like.

- Maybe it would be just a good start if the government made an experiment and took 1 billion out of the budget and said ""hey citizens, what do you want to spend this money on?""

I´m honestly pretty excited about this idea. It wouldn´t even have anything to do with the government acknowledging bitcoin because it´s only the protocol and doesn´t have anything to do with money directly. the coins are simply voting shares.  what do you guys think?

personalfinance,Let the Lump Sum Grow or Continue Retirement Investing?,"Long story short: I want to know what to consider when planning for retirement. When I married my wife she had a fairly sizable inherited IRA. For the time being, we are pretending that it does not exist in our nest egg but considering our age and it's size it's very hard for me not to consider it. 

We are in our early 30's and have 0 debt. We are very committed to staying out of debt and we pay cash for everything. I have a fairly steady and reliable job and a regular paycheck while her income is more variable. Financially speaking, we place a high value on giving (12% of income), family, and traveling. 

I have a 401(k) that matches 50% of the first 6% of my contributions. I'm currently saving 15% in my 401(k) and on pace to max out my Roth IRA each year. My wife has very small balances and low contribution rates for several of her income streams. She is also contributing $100 a month into her Roth IRA.

Gross Annual Household Income: $75,000 
Me: $53,000
Wife: $22,000

Assets: 

Home: $100,000 (100% Equity)
Inherited IRA: $150,000 (70/30 mix, managed by financial advisor)
Combined Roth IRAs: $16,000 
My 401(k): $11,000
Taxable Brokerage: $2,500
Liquid Savings: $7500

I used a Compound Interest app on my phone using the following assumptions:

Principle Amount: $150,000
Monthly Addition: $0
Duration: 31 years (I will be 59 1/2)
Interest Rate: 8%
Inflation Rate: 4%

The result comes out to $1.6 Million. This seems like a decent retirement to me, and that does not take into consideration our other retirement savings.

gaming,Minecraft new ideas for update,"Hello, my name is Adam Weintraub I have two to three good ideas for the
next minecraft update. 1. If you are one of those people that like
starting with certain items, but not allowing cheats then i have a good
idea! you can make it so you can edit the bonus chest in the world options.
when you click on the tab to allow bonus chests another one comes up from
under saying ""Customize"" when you click on it, it brings you to another
page that has the interface of a chest, but under it has the creative
inventory. This is useful, because if you want to start with iron armor and
tools plus wood and cobble, but you dont want to allow cheats this works.
Its better than just allowing cheats, because sometimes, you will be
ashamed when people see your world has cheats, and so you wont be tempted
to effect yourself or gamemode. The second one is, that for each new biome
ypu add new blocks. For example, in redwood forest you will have red wood
logs, that make red wood planks. However in a roofed forest biome it will
be just oak wood like usual. This is helpful, because then you can build
more things with different colors. You can have redwood plank walls with
cobblestone roof, and mesa plank floor. Also i think that you should add
the animations of the fish in water. This will be easier to catch that one
certain fish you need instead of spending days trying to catch that one
pufferfish. These three little additions i think will improve the gameplay
and time spent playing alone. If you will be implementing these three
additions or not please commentl me back telling me if you like them or not i
would like to know your opinion about them.",technology,1378847830

Quick story: My wife and I both owe student debt in a combined amount of around 70k. Her 30k and me about 40k. The total number is unknown and to whom exactly we owe is also unknown. I feel like a failure in this part of my life because we are responsible people in every other facet. We were recently having diner with some of the elder members of her family, who are very well off, when the discussion of student loans and how both the Federal and private institutions have been making it difficult to repay those loans. We were honest and candid about the situation we were in and without expecting anything or leading into anything they offered to ""be the bank"". That's right, they want us to settle the loans for a total pay off and want to pay it off on the bank end. We would still owe the money but to them. They want us to be able to clear this off our credit so in a few years, we can buy a house. We are lucky, fortunate, blessed, ect to be in this situation. They want us to find out the exact amount and to whom we owe the total amount, settle on a lump payment, and they'll take care of the rest. We will then pay them back without interest and in whatever payment amount we decide is doable. Question is, how do I look this information up? I have a small idea of who we owe but I need to be sure. Any one have any resources that could aid in my search? Thank you all very much!",finance,1378825002

personalfinance,Some questions about debt consolidation,"Hi all,

I'm looking for advice regarding consolidating some credit card debt.  I don't have *much*, but at my current situation, making the minimum monthly payments (what I can afford) isn't making a huge dent, and I feel like I'm paying a lot in interest and I want to improve my credit score if possible by lowering the amount of my credit I'm utilizing.


So here's my situation:

I have a couple credit cards from college. Both are virtually maxed out.  I've moved back in with my parents and I've made a lot of progress in changing my spending habits.  However, I'm currently really underemployed, so I'm not making enough to make significant dents in the balances.  I recently had an accident that required about 3K in dental bills, and my parents have helped me pay those bills and I'm paying them back the money when I can. They can't loan me any more money interest free.  Last I checked, my credit score was around 680.



One card has about $2500 on it with a 20.99% interest rate. The other has about $1000 and a 17.99% interest rate.  Making the minimum payments on these has me in debt for like, 7 or 8 years. That sucks and gives me a **lot** of anxiety. 

My plan:  Get a roughly $3500 loan from a bank, and pay off the credit cards, then pay the bank a little over $100 a month for 36 (or 48?) months.  **I can afford this, and I *think* on average it would end up being a smaller or similar sized monthly payment than I'm making now, as well as taking significantly less time to pay off the debt.** I'd also shred my cards just to be safe, and hopefully make even bigger payments when I get a better paying job.  Just looking at the Wells Fargo calculator, they would give me a 9.25% interest rate.

Does this make sense?  **Do I have a chance getting a loan like this from a bank?** I've never missed a payment or had a late payment.  Would this improve my credit score at all, seeing as I wouldn't have a high utilization ratio? 

Would you advise consolidating debt in a situation like this?  If I got a loan like this, should I go with a big bank like Wells Fargo, my local bank, (any chance they'd loan me $4000 without a co-signer?), or some debt consolidation company? 


Any advice would be appreciated; thanks in advance for your help!

**TL;DR: I have less than $4,000 in credit card debt, but making the minimum payments is tough and I feel like getting a debt consolidation loan would allow me to pay off the debt quicker *and* give me a smaller monthly payment. Am I missing something/is this a bad idea?**",finance,1378784614
personalfinance,Recent story regarding my student loan. Curious what Reddit thinks.,"I'm a 30 year old on the east coast of the US from poor middle class parents who couldn't afford to send their 2 children to private schools. Naturally, we both went to private schools. For me, 5 years of undergrad resulted in a whopping 127k private loan and 20k fed loan. The second mistake (the 1st is obv), was choosing the fixed interest rate of 10% over the flex rate upon consolidating when I graduated in 2006. That gem of advice came from my ex-gfs' father, who was a hardcore finance guy. Parents paid most of accruing interest while I was in school; that's all. 

Until a few weeks ago, my balance was 118k. Miraculous, I know. I'll explain in a bit. Recently, I was able to moonlight for a lot of extra loot. I decided I was O.K. with my checking account minus 10k. I called my student loan company; discover is the manager, not the original lender. I asked all the right questions. Person on phone estimated my new minimum payment would be $92 less than what it is. She said glad I called, a request to adjust min. payment was necessary when making  a large principle balance payment, but just a formality. I said okay great. At the same time I finally switched over to automatic deduction for the .25 interest rate benefit. Had to wait since I was in deferment for grad school (yes, I have a federal loan for grad school). Checked online a week later, principle balance was 109k, minimum payment was unchanged except for the $23 deduction from the int. rate change. I called, and actually got the same adviser I got from the 1st call. She said she thought it was a mistake, since the entire 10k wasn't processed, some went to current int. balance. She said check back in a week. After the holiday, I called again and got a smart adviser. Basically she admitted that I was told the wrong thing, twice. My request to adj min payment was denied. It was really never an option, as per my loan agreement. Min. payment is only adjusted after deferment or at the loaner's discretion. I asked for documentation of the first convo (she was obv able to view it) and she said she wasn't capable of sending. I wanted all 10k to go towards the principle and pay the interest balance like normal, that also was never an option, despite what I was told. I asked if I could submitt another request to adj. min balance or submit some kind of waiver/request...I was just making shit up. She said no. 
Has this loan company done me wrong? Obv they don't care about how much diff in my month to month finances a payment reduction makes. I  know in the long wrong I will pay less interest, but I really wanted to reduce my min. payment so I can afford things normal people have like a house or an engagement ring. That 10k would of eliminated an entire fed loan I pay ~$75 a month on. Is there a bureau I could report this to? Or, am I at fault for not really knowing the terms of the loan despite what I was told on the phone?
If any of you fine people have any advice on my loan in general I am all ears. I am looking into getting a loan with a lower interest rate from wells fargo to pay off this one, but I was denied before and it seems they r the only ones that offer those type of loans now. I make too much $$ to qualify for income based payments; the upside of my story I alluded to earlier. 
As an undergrad, I had the wherewithal to procure an internship from the father of a fraternity brother. This put me on the path to a rare, lucrative, satisfying, cutting edge and well paying career that somewhat makes up for the price I paid. I'm an embryologist; I make babies in a lab. AMA-lol. Being a scientist and helping couples is great, but I would trade it for little debt and a desk job.

investing,Received Life Insurance Payout - Don't Know What To Do,"Hey, guys. My father recently passed away and left a pretty large amount of money to my family. Given that my wife and I are in our mid-20s and we live in a very cheap area of the US, the ~$130,000 in checks we've received so far is a huge amount for us. Our finances are already very well tended with a strict budget but, with this windfall, we are just stunned and unsure of what we should do next.

Here is what our current, very basic plan is: Our initial thought is to open a bank account somewhere local just to go ahead and get the checks deposited **somewhere**. Once everything there clears, we're going to pay off some of the few, small debts we've still got. We'd like to keep our auto loan because we're trying to build/repair our credit and it has done a great job of helping with that and the interest rate is very low. After that, we're thinking of taking just barely what we'll need to get by for the next year to supplement our income as things have pretty tight tight lately with my wife going back to college this fall and working a lot less. After that, we'll set aside a slightly larger ""emergency fund"" than what we currently have. With us taking care of these things, we should easily have over $100,000 left and we're planning to deposit everything else into a 1 year CD (probably with GE Capital Bank) so it's getting a slightly better interest rate while we take the time to really step back and figure out what we're going to do.

My mother has told us that there should be no taxes due on anything we've received so far. There may also be a little more money coming later on, but nothing as big as this first amount. We're also likely to receive a good amount of stocks he held in the company he was employed at but we don't know any details on those yet.

We've always talked about wanting to start investing *some day* but figured we'd work ourselves into it slowly over time. Now that we're being thrust into managing such a large amount of money, we are a bit overwhelmed. Do any of you guys have any basic advice on what we should do, where we should start, or solid reading material to get us pointed in the right direction?",finance,1378939124

This is my last opportunity to borrow any federal money, and I was wondering if I should borrow extra to pay off the Sallie Mae loan for a better interest rate through this federal loan. I think it is a good idea because I work for a qualifying non-profit, and after 10 years of full time employment (I'm on year 3 now) and 120 loan payments (all loans are in deferment now, so this may be what takes me a bit), the government has a program that will forgive the balance on any federal loans.

But the president is proposing that beneficiaries must empty the inherited IRA by the end of the fifth year after the year of the original owner’s death.

If they have to withdraw more money each year, beneficiaries, of course, would face bigger tax bills and the government would collect more revenue. The proposal would exempt certain beneficiaries, including those who are disabled.

Savings cap: In a bid to limit contributions by the wealthy to tax-favored retirement accounts, the White House is proposing a savings cap. When a person’s tax-deferred accounts, taken together, become large enough to produce a joint and 100% survivor annuity of $205,000 a year (which would require about $3.4 million today), no additional contributions to his or her retirement accounts would be permitted.

Most people wouldn’t feel the effects – at first. But as Slott points out, if interest rates rise, annuities paying $205,000 would cost less, and the cap could go much lower.

Mandatory IRAs: Employers with more than 10 workers and a business more than two years old would be required to develop and provide automatic enrollment in IRAs for their workers. Contributions would be made through payroll deductions, and employees could choose how much of their salary would go to the IRA. (The default contribution: 3%.)

I am 26 years old, currently completed 1 year of a 2 year (expensive) healthcare related masters program, graduating June 2014. I had trouble finding starting salary information, but median salary is $58,000 with 1-3 years of experience. 

I worked for two years out of college and contributed to a 401k plan. I hadn’t initially planned on going to grad school (in which case I probably would have saved in a more flexible way), but stopped contributing six months before starting school. I am now trying to decide whether it makes sense for me to withdraw the funds from the 401k and put it towards tuition (and thereby incurring the penalties), or take further unsubsidized federal student loans (with current interest rates of 6.8%, unfortunately). I am thinking the answer is no but I would like some advice from others. 

There are several loan repayment programs associated with my field that I plan to look into after graduation, including at least partial loan forgiveness if I work in an area of need, or paying back a percentage contingent on my income size. Loan repayment begins 9 months after graduation.

I have included my financial information with the loans I have already taken out and 401k info below, along with a partial budget.

**Tuition for the next year:** $25,000 

**Loans I have already taken out for the 2012 year**

* 1. Direct Unsub Stafford Loan $20,500.00 (interest rate: 6.8% which has already began accruing and currently totals $1,014.49)
* 2. Fed Perkins Loan $4,500.00 (interest rate: fixed 5% interest which begins accruing 9 months post graduation in June 2014)
* 3. Departmental Loan $2,000.00 (need to find out the terms and interest rate)
**Total:** $27,000

**Investments (401k split across 2 accounts)**

* After reviewing my withdrawal options and the associated penalties, I have determined I would receive at most $16,000 and at least $12,000, depending upon my tax bracket and the amount of vesting of my former employer.

* **Current amount in account 1:** $10,300 (rate of return this year so far 12.7%)
* **Current amount in account 2:** $10,300 (rate of return this year so far 8.4%)
* **Total in the accounts currently:** $20,600

* **Total I would get if I withdrew:** $12,000-16,000

**Income** 

* Current income: $686 dollars per month (TA position ending in June) 

**Current accessible assets** 

* Current money in the bank: $5,000

personalfinance,Lost Mom to cancer left with ~40k. 3rd year university student with loans. What should I do with it?,"Okay so here's my story. My parents divorced about 15 years ago and my mother had official custody, but it was about 50-50 time spent with each. About 4 years ago, when I was 15, my mother lost her battle with cancer. This ended up with me and my 2 brothers (25 &amp; 29 now) being left about 40 thousand dollars each.

Let me start by saying that I have almost no idea what I am doing when it comes to this finance stuff here as you will soon discover.

Now about 11k of that is in a government held trust account at about 5-7% interest growth rate. I can withdraw from but not deposit from this account and I can keep it in there for as long as I'm in any type of schooling and under 25. At that interest rate I think it would be dumb to touch it until I have to.

The other 30 or so K is in a low risk/low interest account and has been since the day I got it. I haven't lost any of it, but it also hasn't really grown any either. 

Now the issues: I am now in my third year of University (geophysics) and about to take out my second loan. This will put me at about 16k in the hole with about 9500 saved in my account. Now I know this may sound a little strange to be taking out loans.. But The interest rate is very low on the student loans in canada here and There is a chance that quite a bit of it will be forgiven in my situation if I stay in canada.  The idea behind this was for me to use the money I received for a down payment on a house right after (before?) I graduate. That way at least I would be able to start off strong after schooling is done.

My first question is what should I do with the ~30k in the low risk account? Keep it there?  I am going to schedule a meeting with my investment people and see what we can do, but I would like a little help from an unbiased outside source also before I head in.  

My next question would be about property.  The city I live in, the market is constantly on the rise.  An average sized, newer condo (apartment) goes for about 200k.  The idea has been tossed around by my brothers and myself and a few outside family members that I could use it as a down payment on a condo or small house now and rent it out and live in it to pay the mortgage payments and whatnot.  As much as I love the idea of paying for my own house rather than paying off someone else's mortgage with my rent, I think that may not be the wisest decision yet with maintenance and taxes and other hidden costs.  That may put me in over my head while still in university.

I guess my main question is... What do I do with the money? Use it to pay for school/what loans I have and have it gone but no(more) student loans.  Or do I keep it invested and continue taking loans and use the money for something else down the road (house?)

I'm sorry If I've been all over the place or a little confusing, but I'll be more than happy to clear anything up if you ask!

Tl;dr - Single mom died and left me with 40k.  In school with loans.  Use money for school/loans? or continue investing it and saving it for down the road?",finance,1379022353
Bitcoin,"""Bitcoin is a scam."" Can we discuss?","Found the quoted text [here] (http://np.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1m22so/what_is_rinvestings_opinion_on_bitcoin/cc53fay)

Insightful comments are appreciated. I personally think there are some issues being brought up here that should be addressed, but I do not agree with the overall conclusions. 

&gt; **Bitcoin is a specific kind of scam called a seigniorage scheme** (credit goes to 19Alcibiades87)

&gt; Seigniorage has two functional definitions, although they really dovetail out of one. Within debt-backed fiat it's usually defined as the profit made from interest paid on the debt which backs the fiat. The persons with seigniorage privilege in debt-backed fiat would be the cartel of international banking elite to whom once-sovereign nations pay the interest to lease their non-sovereign ""sovereign"" currencies.
&gt; 
&gt; The strict definition of seigniorage, however, is 'the difference between the face value of something and the cost to produce and distribute it.' In the case of debt-backed fiat, the interest is rolled in as a functional increase in the value of the currency to the seignoirage privilege holders, since it's additional revenue generated from the same dollar despite no additional cost being required to produce the physical bill or digital dollar entry on a balance sheet. In the case of coinage, the inheritor of seigniorage is the United States treasury (say a quarter costs $.03 to produce and bring to market, and its face value is $.25. The inheritors of the seigniorage profit $.22 per quarter when they are initially spent into the market).
&gt; Bitcoin is a seigniorage scheme because the program was not widely known or public when the first bitcoins were generated. You can show me your fancy bs (and it's really just window dressing, making things appear fantastic so you will be distracted from the same rotten core that's at the center of all such scams) about 'mining' them and how it's 'free to all' and all of this, but the fact remains that whether they were 'mined' or not initially, at the beginning there was a very small group of people who knew of the existence of Bitcoin. An anonymous, shadowy cartel of insiders who pretends to be one fictitious person in order to maintain their anonymity.
&gt; 
&gt; Because Bitcoins are digital, the cost of generating them was negligible, as was their value. Their value was then pumped artificially using paid gophers and an enormous marketing campaign throughout internet circles, preying upon lonely techies with decent job security and convincing them it was a gateway to 'economic freedom.' This is textbook scam; it has a vulnerable, wealthy, lonely market audience with very little practical experience with economic models or systems, but plenty of money to take.
&gt; 
&gt; The creators of the initial currency and system are unknown, which means the inheritors of the seigniorage are totally anonymous and to this day no one knows who they are and what they've done with the massive amount of money they've earned when they sold their once-worthless but post-pump-valuable Bitcoins onto the market initially. This is textbook scam, it should be a huge red flag. The fairytale that this is the creation of one person, who obviously does not exist, is another red flag of a textbook scam. When Rome crashes and burns, these insiders simply slip away to their new island in Micronesia while you're dead in the water, and you have no way of even knowing who pantsed you.
&gt; 
&gt; Once the value of the commodity was inflated beyond its initial zero value, Bitcoins were then sold liberally to lonely suckers with zero scam experience, at which point the insider cartel could've just walked away and let it crash and burn. Instead, more scarily, it appears they have used part of that capital (and perhaps only sold part of their initial reserve) to exert influence within or over the exchanges themselves, and may control one or more entirely for all we know. The pump then continued. The exchanges are incredibly corrupt, there have been several crashes already and there is zero explanation for how the value of Bitcoins has recovered from any of them. The most likely answer, in my opinion, is that the seigniorage gains and revenues from insider-generated dumps and successive rebuys are being used to continue to pump the scam, as is typical in equity market pump and dumps as well. The insiders are always going to exit before everyone else, allowing them to rebuy on the cheap and pump again, and their control over one or more exchanges facilitates this.
&gt; 
&gt; Then there's the total hogwash that Bitcoin is a 'currency.' There are several reasons why Bitcoin is not a currency, but rather a zero-purpose digital commodity. This distinction is very important, because removing its distinction as a currency means its downfall is inevitable since as a digital commodity it has zero tangible purpose. Anything can be a medium of exchange for as long as you can trick one fool into valuing it, but that doesn't make it a currency. It makes it a pet rock, minus the rock and the paint if it's digital.
&gt; 
&gt; A key difference between a currency and a commodity is that currencies typically command a premium within poorer societies, and commodities need not. A great example is the Federal Reserve Note (most people mistakenly call it the United States Dollar), which is worth more and generates a great deal of attention if pulled out of a wallet in Zimbabwe. Try that with a Bitcoin, and after the initial curiosity surrounding its novelty you'll be left only with confusion as you utterly fail to explain to these people why this silly token has any value whatsoever.
&gt; 
&gt; If you can name one poor society that values Bitcoins more highly than first-world ones, you'll be well on your way to shattering my logic. But you won't be able to do that, because poor societies have zero use for Bitcoin; it is a commodity of privilege because its uses are fictitious, and the fact that it doesn't translate vertically down the income inequality ladder means it is completely screwed in its supposed-intended long-term purpose. This is in marked contrast with, say, silver, which is a true currency (as well as a commodity) in that it has ubiquitous global liquidity and can be exchanged for virtually any world currency within any society, with a linear increasing premium as income within the society of exchange falls.
&gt; Bitcoins also have very poor liquidity, in that they are incapable of purchasing most fundamental necessities of life, and certainly cannot do so on demand. The very few exceptions to this are niche cases hoping to benefit from the fad and nothing more. This also makes it dissimilar to currencies, which have peak liquidity.
&gt; 
&gt; Magic cards, for instance (interestingly, the thing MtGOX, short for Magic: the Gathering Online Exchange, was initially designed to trade, before they were prohibited from doing so), are an infinitely stronger currency than Bitcoins ever will be because they are incredibly liquid anywhere but indigenous communities (making them weaker than, say, silver or gold but little else), and command a great premium in less-affluent societies like Brazil. They're also a functional on-shore tax shelter, making them one of the most practically useful mediums of exchange in the entire world, and their market has experienced more sustained, successive growth than any in modern history to my knowledge, while remaining nearly crash free.
&gt; The most recent seigniorage scheme that Bitcoin resembles is cap-and-trade. Only cap-and-trade was a far more honest scam, in that at least the globalist billionaires like Al Gore were willing to admit they were the team who was going to inherit the seigniorage when companies were forced to purchase a totally worthless and created-from-zero-and-at-zero-cost commodity called 'carbon credits' at an artificially inflated value. When the carbon credit market crashed in Europe and the whole scheme reached seeing-is-believing level, the plan was abandoned (money already made, just like Bitcoin is poised to do/be). Bitcoin is even shadier; the sinister seigniorage schemers won't even admit who they are, and the only difference is that its market hasn't crashed yet. But it will. Guaranteed. Because they're totally worthless.
&gt; 
&gt; Magic cards (intentionally trivial comparison) are a real currency in every single way Bitcoins are not, and will continue to function as a far better alternative currency than Bitcoins ever will, because they're also a functional on-shore tax shelter as well as having peak liquidity and being a way to convert any currency into any other currency without paying conversion fees.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't be a bag holder like ChaosMotor.  Or worse, don't let people like ChaosMotor, who invested a large amount of their personal wealth into a scheme, trick you into allowing them to exit profitably at your expense.

personalfinance,Student Loan Rehab Program. Should I?,"Looking for some advice. I'll get right down to it.

I'm looking to get rid of my Federal Student Loans.
Right now the account is in default sitting at 10k.
They offered 8.2k as a ""compromise"" I countered with 7k and they want 7.6k.  

I can write the check for 7.6k today and just be done with it.  But they brought up this Rehabiliation program. Where they want $125/month for 9 months which applies to principle.  Which will bring it out of default and they will take off around $2k in closing fees or what not, which I still don't quite understand. 

My main concern is that if I settle today, the loan will still show as a loan settled in default on my credit report.  Where as I do the rehab program for 9 months and settle after.

Not sure which way to go.  Any input appreciated.",finance,1379021990
personalfinance,"In the process of buying a home, just found out wife's credit score is way lower than mine.","We're currently looking into purchasing a house. We have two cars in both of our names and my wife had a Student Loan that she has paid in full (otherwise no other credit history). My score is around 780 and I just decided to run her report and found that a hospital bill she had from before we were married had went into collections and was basically unpaid. She had been paying $10 a month which is what she said she owed, I thought it was just an agreement with the hospital and figured it didn't hurt to not pay it off since it was interest free (my mom does the same).

It turns out that the hospital bills were split across 5 accounts and total $1,430 unpaid.  Her score according to Experian is 599 btw.

So I'm unsure what to do. We'll definitely pay that balance off immediately.  After that should we post-pone our plans of home ownership until her score improves or go ahead now and hopefully refinance later? 

Basically, should we wait for her score to improve to get a better interest rate down the road or should we lock in the currently low interest rates with a mortgage now.  I'm leaning towards going ahead with the mortgage since any improvement in our possible interest rate will be offset by the rising interest rates. Other options include just putting me on the mortgage I guess (I make twice as much as her).

tl;dr looking to buy a home but while my credit is 783 my wife's is 599 due to an unpaid hospital bill from before we were married. Continue with home or wait for improved score?

edit update:  Thank you so much for all the helpful replies.  I ended up contacting the agency for a ""pay for delete"" and they obliged.  Hopefully it drops of off her report soon.  I had no idea the inner workings of how much power these creditors have with the credit agencies.  This has been a very instructive thread.  Thank you all again!

edit #2: ran the report and score again today just for fun. Her score went from 599 to 674!!! Awesome. Thanks again everybody!",finance,1379019090
investing,Investment Portfolio - Balanced?,"Hi,

I am interested on others input on my current holdings. I am in my early thirties and my investment goals are to be somewhat aggressive, but mainly to beat inflation. 

I am going through a CFP for all of my retirement contributions. He is a family friend and whenever I ask how much I owe him he replies nothing. This year I again asked how he makes money and he said once he has 50k under management then they'll earn money after a certain period of time. So, I asked him if I could put some of my savings in to ETFs in order to be in the market with the option to make a relatively quick exit if the cash is needed. I have listed IRA investments first then the 50k investments next. Am I fortunate to have a good CFP or should I be wary? 

I was having issues with the formatting. If there is a better way then please let me know.

personalfinance,Student Loan Advice From You Gurus,"Hey guys! I know to always take advice from strangers on the internet with a grain of salt, but I want to try and get as many opinions as I can before I make my decision. I am young (19) and pretty naive in finances. But, I like to always have a plan. Right now, I'm a sophomore at a reputable in state college with a modest tuition and fees, majoring in Computer Science. The WORST CASE scenario for me (assuming I only ever work a minimum wage job that only covers my food, car insurance, and phone bill; and I get NO financial assistance outside loans) is that I will graduate with $28,000 in debt. All of it would be loans taken out with Uncle Sam, the highest interest rate at 6.8%. 

I've heard a good rule of thumb is never take out more in loans than you will make in your first year of work after graduation. The average starting salary for CS majors in my state (Utah) is $60,000. Does this mean I shouldn't worry about loans at all? After all, $28,000 is the WORST that could happen, and I will most likely graduate with less debt than that. But I've heard some horror stories that make student loans out to be literally Satan. I want to make sure that I make good financial choices that don't come back to screw me in the future. I want to make sure that in a few years I can support a family.

personalfinance,Pay off mortgage?,"Hi all,
I have the ability to pay off my entire home loan at the end of next year. I'm 31 years old, and my remaining balance is 87k on my mortgage. The value of the house was hit due to the market crash, and I estimate it to be worth about 70k fair market value. My loan is 30 year fixed, 4.65%. I plan on living at this residence for at least the next couple of years, although I could charge about $600-700 a month to rent it out when I leave. Without getting into too many details on my other personal finances, I fully max out my 401k/Roth IRA every year, so retirement is fine and have an emergency fund, no other debts (no car, student loans, etc)

My question is this: Is it worth it to pay off my entire mortgage and live mortgage free (while I can)? Currently, I have about 40k sitting in the bank doing nothing - not making money and loosing purchasing power to inflation. Is it a smart idea to pay off the house in full or should I invest the large sum of money elsewhere? I'm not interested in putting this money in the stock market/equities as this is short-term risk-adverse cash. It probably won't be worth my while to put it in a CD or money market either due to the low rates. I'm just thinking it would be so nice to not have to pay the bank at an interest rate of 4.65% (which is still a reasonably good interest rate).
My house is in a 'developing' area, meaning a gentrified area. I'm not married, nor do I have kids, but at 31, I would like to see this happening in the future. I would not feel comfortable putting my children in the school system here. I suppose this would remain a passive income stream if I chose to keep the house once I moved to an area with better school systems.

I understand owning the house in full makes my 87k liquid cash turn into an illiquid asset.

My mortgage is $600 total (includes everything, PMI, sewage, property taxes (only $20 a year... yes I did not miss a zero)). So I'm paying back myself, rather than the bank, $600 a month x 12 months = $7200 profit (paying myself) a year. iBonds/CDs/money markets wouldn't even come close to paying that on my 87k cash. Is that correct?
Let me know if I need to provide any more details.

business,BP Holdings Madrid news updates 5 Barriers to and Solutions for Community Renewable Energy,"bp holdings madrid news updates, 5 Barriers to and Solutions for Community Renewable Energy


Source: http://valdoughmir.weebly.com/index.html


Community renewable energy has significant political and economic benefits, but is often hindered by five major barriers.  Read on for a summary of the five barriers, watch them in a 17-minute presentation, or check out the vividly illustrated slideshow.


Barrier one is tradition. Utilities are simply used to operating a grid in a 20th century model, where large-scale power plants are connected in a top-down, one-way grid to power consumers. Policies that have allowed for on-site solar and wind generation, for consumers to be instead producers, have nibbled at the margins of this tradition.  It’s only in the past year that utilities have realized how low-cost solar power can fundamentally up-end their entire business model.  And the response has often been to entrench.


A second barrier facing community-based renewable energy is capital – upfront cash to buy a solar array or wind turbine. And the biggest cause is securities law and regulations, intended to prevent fraud like perpetrated by Bernie Madoff and others, that makes pooling capital very difficult for groups of interested local power investors. The federal or state rules often come with high compliance costs or significant limitations that hinder most efforts to raise community capital.


A third barrier is cash flow. American renewable energy policy is a byzantine array of tax incentives, rebates, and bill credits that can challenge a CPA. Figuring out how to pool all these revenue streams together to make a project with reasonable payback is a significant challenge.


A fourth barrier is legal, because of the mis-match between federal renewable energy incentives paid through the tax code and the non-taxable status of many of the logical entities for organizing community renewable energy projects. Want to use a city, county, cooperative, or non-profit structure for your community solar project?  Then you may have to forgo the 30% federal tax credit.  A level playing field for energy cooperatives is a major reason the Germans have such high levels of local ownership of their 63,000 MW renewable energy economy.


Finally, utilities themselves (as implied in #1) have acted as barriers to more community-based renewable energy.  In particular, policies like the “15% Rule” have set artificially (and arbitrarily) low limits on distributed generation under the guise of system safety.


The good news is that the barriers are being broken.  Tradition has been tossed as utilities have had to grapple with state policies encouraging distributed generation and solar power and others have embraced pro-active measures to accommodate more local renewable energy. Crowdfunding opportunities like those offered by Mosaic are giving people an unprecedented opportunity to pool their money to go renewable. The falling cost of solar is rapidly making incentives unimportant in many areas, reducing the problems caused by half baked, tax-based federal policy.


Most importantly, utilities, regulators, and policy makers are recognizing that the 20th century model of concentrated power and capital doesn’t serve a distributed, 21st century grid.  And as that aging paradigm crumbles, community renewable energy will grow up through the cracks.

My wife and I are current California residents, but starting next March we're planning on taking a year off from our normal life and traveling around the US and Europe.  We will NOT be in California at all during that time.  We own our home and are planning on renting it out during the year we are gone.  I telecommute already, and will continue to telecommute and earn about $100K, which would be a bit less than $10K in California income tax.  

As you probably guessed from the title...I'm exploring the possibility of changing our state of residence for the time we're away...with hopes of avoiding that $10K hit.  My wife's brother lives in Washington state, which has NO state income tax, so we could theoretically use his address.  I checked the state of washington website about establishing residence and it lists several options including ""Uses a Washington address for federal or state taxes;"".  

Am I missing anything, or is it really as simple as changing my address with my employer and while filing taxes to my wife's brother's address?  We will actually be visiting him during the trip, so we'd be spending more time in WA then we would in CA.  


I assume we'd still end up being hit with CA income tax on the rental property (our current primary residence), but if we can figure out how to save that $10K on my salary that would be SIGNIFICANT!

I do want to stay but I also want to eventually have my own place in a decent area and I feel like that can't happen since my income probably won't change a whole lot (+bills will only increase!). I don't know anything about investing so any tips on how to get started are also much appreciated! Thanks!",finance,1379113103

personalfinance,"Federal, Parent Plus, and Private Loans... OH MY!!! (x-post from r/StudentLoans)","*Disclaimer: I was asked by my SO to help him find a path forward for his educational costs. I anticipate seeking professional financial advice in the near, near future but wanted to start here first.*

**Background**
My SO and I have been together for 4 years. Since we started dating I have finished college with zero debt. He has stayed in school since he is a 2 years younger than me. As we are not legally tied to each other in any way, we have kept our finances strictly separate. I have had a general understanding of his financial status but I have not had any hard numbers put in front of me until yesterday. To be honest, the current financial situation is making me rethink our relationship (but only slightly).

**Current Status**
I added up his debt earlier today. I was actually shocked because he had initially told me a smaller total debt amount.

* Federal Direct (subsidized): ~$23,000
* Federal Direct (unsubsidized): ~$25,500
* Federal Direct Parent Plus: ~$26,500
* Federal Perkins: ~$2,500
* Total = ~$77,500

**The Catch**
My SO began college with two directions in mind. Linguistics or Computer Science. Having a stronger background and interest in language, he went with the linguistics major. As the years went by, he steadily grew less and less fond of linguistics and was very discontent with the job prospects since he would never go on to graduate school (bad grades and severe depression early on). He contemplated changing majors after completing his junior year but was encouraged by many to stay the course. Now he is interested in pursuing a concurrent degree (on paper concurrent but technically not done at the same time) at the same university in computer and information science. He finds that his job prospects and average income will be well worth the additional debt.

**The Problem**
As I understand it, he has maxed out his Federal Loans. His parents (who have suffered their own financial hardships due to the housing bust) have poor credit scores and can no longer secure the Parent Plus Loan for him. In fact, they were outright denied when they applied. It seems that his only option is to take out private loans in order to move forward with his career aspirations. 

**The Questions**

**1** I've heard rumors that you can receive an additional (albeit small) loan increase for Federal Loans if your Parent Plus Loan has been denied. Does this hold true for those that have already maxed out their Federal Loans?

**2** Being that his parents have poor credit history, is there a way to secure a private student loan without a co-signer? He really does not have many close family members capable of co-signing for his debt, and I am unwilling to co-sign since I am not legally tied to him. Would his limited (or most-likely lack of) personal credit history prevent him from getting a private loan?

**3** If I understand correctly, you can increase your maximum limit on Federal Loans if you are considered an independent student. Is there a way to be declared legally independent despite only being 22 years old? (I believe the ""age of independence"" is 24 years old.) Keep in mind that he does not currently have a job, although he has done work-study in the past.

**4** If anyone else were to co-sign for his private student loans, should the co-signer purchase a life insurance policy on him?

**5** What would be a reasonable student loan rate, taking into consideration the difference between variable and fixed rates? Are there any loopholes, scams, or fine-print details that I should he should be aware of when searching for a private student loan? Is it possible to negotiate a lower interest rate prior to signing a student loan or is this generally frowned upon?

Thanks for your advice.",finance,1379099135

hardware,Cruelty-Free PC Hardware,"xpost from /r/buildapc (where they hate the working class)


I am a very picky shopper because I've heard so much about the exploitation and mistreatment of workers. I've heard so many terrible things about China in particular (and have confirmed them with a guy i know there) that I feel uncomfortable purchasing anything made there.

When i hear about people working 20 hours every single day and getting waken up with a tazer in the mouth when they pass out from exhaustion, or political dissidents &amp; complete innocents being fed to the prison industrial complex, while nearly all the proceeds go to fatcats who play golf all day, it breaks my heart. Most people don't care though, so there are no ""fair trade"" stickers on hardware and it is difficult to find information on the conditions of the individuals making and assembling these parts.

Do you know where i can find equitably made computer parts?

personalfinance,"Just got my bonus check, and was looking at my taxes and now I'm concerned my federal withholding has been too low, I'm worried about owing a lot come tax time. Advice please?","My salary is $46,350 and according to this year's tax tables, for that much I should owe $7,516.25 (16.2% effective rate) in federal tax. My statement for my bonus has a gross amount of income of $34,284.25, and federal tax withheld so far is $3,383.07, which is obviously just under 10%. If I extrapolate that percentage to my whole salary + bonus, I get $4,681.54. Does that mean I'm going to be hit with a ~$3,000 bill in April?

I know there are deductions and everything, so I'm assuming it won't be that bad. Still it seems like I'm putting a good bit less to federal withholding than I should be. However I also thought I adjusted my W-4 at the beginning of the tax year to bump up my withholding just a bit, because I owed a little last year. 

Based on my numbers, and the fact that I'm filing single, no dependents, non-itemized, am I close to on track with my withholdings, or should I have extra withheld and/or prepare to owe some money at tax time? Thanks in advance.",finance,1379085241
investing,Why do people still invest in stocks?,"I see so many posts on here related to questions in regards to specific stocks/companies. Does anyone really believe that the markets are not past the point of manipulation and that these fundamentals/events for XYZ stock for going up/down on a given really matter? If you the S&amp;P500 goes up 2% on the day, so will the majority of stocks in that index, look at the correlation, it's ridiculous. It seems like blantant manipulation through MM/algo trading. I know many on here realize this and do stick to the index ETFs/commodities/ETC, but do others really think that fundamentals or technical analysis really hold anymore (if they ever did), with the exception in regards to algorithmic trading (they do use various types of technical analysis in some models)? 

What is an investor supposed to do at such unprecendented times? I've just graduated college, have a steady job. First thing I am doing is saving up the 6 month emergency fund, then going from there (although I do have a bit of $$ in the markets to play around with and a decent amount of PMs, ofc won't be selling those for 10yrs+), I am not really sure what to do. Global economic data is pretty abismal looking, inflation is there (I lose more money in my Ally savings everyday to inflation than I gain on interest). Equitiy markets are at an all time highs (on extremely low volume), 10y just broke 3.00%...it just doesn't make sense. 25-35 years ago we would have graduated, been able to put money into a savings account with a decent interest rate (3/4%), and be almost guaranteed 8% on your 401k/retirement fund. Nowadays you'll be lucky to find a savings account with 100bps interest and be **very** lucky to see more than 1/2% gain in your retirement account (if that), imo. What to do? Assume the Fed will continue with QE and ride the roller coaster up, but how far up can it go? I know 'buy-and-hold' have been trusted/proven over the years, but with the way they have been injecting money into the economy makes me wonder if this is really the case anymore. I could sit on the sidelines with my cash and wait for another crash and BTFD, or be conservative, keep most in cash some in some conservative govt FI ETF and maybe an index ETF and hope I can time the waterfall (something has to give eventually, imo, the bull mkt has to pull back at some point, and I think it may be a bit messy when it all does unravel).",finance,1379082379
personalfinance,Have what feels like a stupid question about paying one loan with another,"This question feels a bit stupid, because on the one hand, I feel like, based on all the advice I've previously seen in this subreddit, my idea is exactly how I should pay loans back. However, on the other hand, the idea of paying one loan with another feels like something *incredibly* stupid.

My wife and I currently have a little more than $15,000 in loans from school. We expect my wife's schooling to add a total of ~$10,000 to our total debt. I'm going back to school for an MBA early next year, which will eventually add $75,000 to our loan debt. 

Our credit cards are paid in full each month, and we don't have any other debts. We currently earn about $130,000 a year between the two of us. 

We have been taking out loans to pay the few thousand a semester my wife's community college courses currently cost. We recently knocked out a big chunk of our savings to pay off our car, and are just now getting back to where we'd like to be in terms of savings. Paying cash for future semesters is an option, but wasn't for this one. 

All that to set the stage for this question: my wife got about $1,300 more than she needed for her loans this semester, so she got it in cash. Her loans are at around 3% interest rates, while I have some that are at 6.8%. I'd like to take the additional money and pay off a part of my higher interest rate loan - but is it stupid to take money from another debt and pay off a different one?",finance,1379080057

personalfinance,Student loan question concerning withdrawing early,"I graduated in 2007 with my bachelors degree and around $24k in student loan debt after scholarships.  I decided to go back to school in 2010 for a different bachelors with federal loans, but then my daughter was born that same year and I didn't even finish 1 semester at the same school before withdrawing and moving away to raise her.  I believe I was charged $16k for that mistake and I've been paying back both loans ever since, but I just started to wonder if there's something I can do to lower that amount because I barely even went to the school.  

I guess I'm just wondering what financial responsibility I have to pay back loans for a school I didn't even go to for very long.  It looks like the cost of 1 semester is nearly even to the cost of 5 years of tuition previously which seems ridiculous to me now, but at the time I wasn't considering the cost.  I'm guessing I'll have to pay back the $16k, but I wanted to ask PF if anything can be done to lessen that burden or get an itemized list of the exact amount I'm paying for each enrollment.  I have consolidated my loans since so it's hard to tell which payments are going to which degree and I'm wondering what the total costs of each were.  Any help or advice would be much appreciated so I can begin to make sense of these amounts and stop kicking myself for digging myself a hole in an attempt to get a degree I never finished.

EDIT:

I got an email back showing my history and it makes some more sense now, I was given the 50% refund ther0pyle talked about and didn't pay nearly as much for that one semester as I had thought.  I actually feel pretty good about what I paid now considering it was a $92,000 education for around $40,000.  Thanks everyone for the help!

Bitcoin,How to start a Ponzi Scheme!,"Steps to start a ponzi scheme:

1. Create or have worthless shit that only you own or know about, make it kinda secretive and cool
2. Convince other people (* see: idiot) that this shit you are shoveling is worth more than nothing and start selling this shit to those people or exchange it for their services and promise them vast richest for being an early adopter. Do this by making the worthless shit seem to have an advantage over other forms of worthless shit. Make shit up, you are already neck deep in shit already. Make it seem fancy or advanced or increasingly rare!
3. Get those people to tell others how much the worthless shit is worth on the worthless shit market that you and some early adopters started and control. Don't forget to provide numerous bullshit reasons for how much more the market value of worthless shit will be worth when the worthless shit becomes more commonly adopted.
4. Sell as much worthless shit to the people who listened to the people you sold the original amount of worthless shit to. You are all making money on worthless shit together now.
5. The people you sold the worthless shit to may understand its actually worthless shit but want to make money, so they keep selling the worthless shit. Others just believe in how unique and advanced and better the worthless shit is compared to competing worthless shit, and that it's just a matter of time before the worthless shit market price skyrockets. 
6. Keep producing and selling worthless shit as long and as fast as possible. Never let up! To attract more people, offer derivative forms of the worthless shit, start selling shovels and shit storing facilities. You name it!
7. If you don't tell more people how much more the shit is now worth, and keep inspiring others to increase the price of the worthless shit, your personal worthless shit holdings would stop making money.
8. Never say anything bad about the shit, otherwise the market value of worthless shit might go back to being worth shit before you could sell out and profit on the worthless shit investment. 
9. If someone notices how worthless the worthless shit it, call him a shill, a liar or a fed or mad that he wasn't an early adopter or whatever you think works. The more unprovable and asinine, the better. Make it look like he's trying to confuse the worthless shit owners into selling their worthless shit for less than market value.
10. Don't be the last person out, or you'll be stuck with a whole bunch of worthless shit.

personalfinance,"401k Roth or Traditional, Recent College Grad","Here's the scoop, and many thanks in advance for replying to my lengthy question(s). I started my first job out of college on August 12, and am eligible to contribute to my company's 401k plans, Roth or Traditional. I understand the pre-tax/post-tax advantages of both, and how much I can contribute, but can't decide what's the best option. I'm 22 years old, single, making 40k. I've heard the argument to opt for Traditional 401k so that my contributions are pre-tax and then when I retire and I'm in a lower tax bracket, I'm good. I've also heard Roth is better suited for people not making a ton of money, and later on when my salary increases switching to Traditional.

I guess I have a couple questions.

1) Can I contribute to both, and is that advisable? 

2) Should I contribute enough before Jan 1. to get below the $8,700 mark (10% tax bracket)? I'll have made about 13k pre-tax by Jan 1 by my calculations, meaning I'd have to contribute about 5k to the plan by then. Does that make sense and is that advisable?

3) Which funds should I contribute to? There are many, and I have no idea. I've heard S&amp;P500 is a solid choice...

I'm working on paying off the last of my student loans. I have about $6500 left to go, paying anywhere between $1000 and $1500 a month. They're federal student loans, with interest rates varying between 4.5% and 6.8% (mostly on the lower end, I've snowballed most of the higher rate ones away). Beyond that, I've got another 3.9% loan with a $5500 balance I'd like to get paid off, leaving me with just a 0% car loan after that.

I figure I can move somewhere around $1500/month in spending to the new CC, and float it interest free, meanwhile sending that money to pay off the loans. I could then be putting $2500-$3000/month on the student loans, then ~$2800-$3300/month on the $5500 loan. The limit on the new card is high enough to sustain this for more than enough time to get those loans paid off, and the 0% APR period is plenty long enough to then pay the card back down to 0 afterwards.

In the end, I'm still debt free in (except for the car loan) roughly the same time frame, but by leveraging the 0%, I pay slightly less in interest. Doing a 0% balance transfer to pay off the debt isn't worth it due to the 3% fee.

Is this actually a good idea? Obviously, I expose myself to more risk by doing this, in the unlikely scenario that I lose my job or something catastrophic happens. I have have somewhere between two and three months of income in the bank, so I wouldn't be running on E immediately should something happen. Beyond that though, is there any reason I shouldn't do this?

I'll also preemptively state that I do have plenty of credit card experience, so doing this won't lead me to spending more than I can afford and cause me extra debt or to spill out of the 0% intro period.",finance,1379187687

Further explanation taken from my a comment: My reasoning is that I think that because the economy has shown enough signs of growth, the feds will try to raise interest rates by buying less bonds. And more bonds mean more supply and decreased price obviously. What I don't know is how much ""signs of growth"" do the feds need to show before the tapering begins (could suggest some reports to look? payroll, nonfarm?)

ten years ago I screwed myself up via Credit. It's been ten long hard years but I got it all fixed (well sorta more on that below), anyways in the post I've got a new card staggering down the way with a real short and low credit line and a whopping 22.9% Interest Rate.

What is THE BEST way to get the best use out of this new line, the best way to put it to good work? To better repair my credit? 

The Second Bit: 

There are two 'Heavies' still stuck on my reports, however they are set to drop off in three months. 

These 'Heavies' are some old accounts that carry more than $400 on their shoulders.

personalfinance,"Should I get rid of credit card debt at all costs, even if it means dipping into savings?","Until a couple months ago, I was to the point where I had zero non-mortgage debt and was paying off the entire balance of my credit cards every month.

However, some things have come up that have caused me to generate about $5500 in CC debt that I have carried over, causing me to pay CC interest for the first time in several months.

I'm expecting a semi-large windfall in a few months which could pay off some of this (or possibly all) although I also am going to have some significant non-standard costs coming up that will likely amount to an additional $2-3k on the credit cards.

I have about $10k in liquid savings (which is NOT my only savings; I have around $45k in a 401k) that I could take out-without any tax or other negative effects-and pay off these CC balances, but I'm on the fence about doing so.

On the one hand, this is money I was saving to put toward purchase of a different car (+ trading in my current car) so that I could hopefully not have a car payment.

On the other hand, if I use the money to pay off CCs, I would get rid of the interest I'm being charged on those (although ideally I will only incur interest for a few months), but would likely end up having to take out a car loan.  However, the interest rate on the car loan is likely to be less than what I'm paying percentage-wise on the credit cards.

On the third hand, the total dollars in interest paid on the credit cards (currently around $75-100 a month and falling) for the next few months is likely to be much less than what I would pay on total interest on a car loan, although there's a chance the CC debt does not get paid off as soon as I anticipate if I let it slide.

I'm in my mid-thirties, married with no kids (and no intention to have any) if that makes any difference.  Thoughts?

Edit:  To clarify a little bit:  some of you seem to have inferred that I'm asking this question because this $5500 on the CCs and the associated interest is putting me in a tight financial bind.  I'm not bragging, but that's really not the case.  I make pretty good money (and my job is pretty secure I think) and don't have a ton of extra bills.  I just don't really like having any kind of debt which is why I'm bringing this up.  If I did nothing, I could likely have this balance paid off in 6 months with the 'windfall' as well as my tax refund.  Also I forgot to mention that about half of the $5500 is on a card that only has a 3% interest rate.  Any opinion changes based on the above?  Thanks for your input.",finance,1379130392

I am already in classes and when I spoke on the phone to the financial aid office they told me everything was covered etc so I was fine. The cost of my classes was $2275. The Pell grant gave me $2447.50. I received $172.50 during the first week of classes beginning. That's the remainder of the PELL grant that wasn't used.

Now my question is about the $1679 TAP grant I got. Should I be getting a 2nd check from school for that $1679 sometime in the middle of the semester or what?

That check I got for $172 was enough to cover just a Biology class.

Hopefully someone can help me out. Oh also I go to Kingsborough Community College if that helps at all.

I'm heading off to college and my estimated 4 year cost (including housing, food etc.) is $73,600. The school wants payment at the end of each semester and has a 1% interest rate. 

To help pay my parents have saved $16,000. I have a scholarship that offers $3,500 per year. I also have two guaranteed six month internships paying together approximately $20,000 (but this won't be until my start of junior year).

I received a letter from my college saying I have student aid available as a ""Federal Ford Direct Loan-unsub"" for $9,000 in the 2013-2014 year. The letter also says there is parent aid available of up to $15,000 with interest of 6.41%.

TLDR: I will owe $73,600, I will have 53,200, I need $20,400 in loans. 

So my questions are:
For the FederalFord is this financial aid I should accept?
Should my parents use the offered loan or are there other loans you would recommend?
Should I use up all the $16000 in savings first and delay getting a loan till later in my college years or should I spread out how I spend it?

The company that I work for has an option for a company matching (up to 4%) 401k that I currently am putting 10% of my net income into, managed by an investment manager or sub-advisor for a well-known financial group (brand name is one of the big ones). It is currently in a balanced/asset allocation type of fund, mostly because I just went for the default setting of it, and haven;t really touched it at all. I am not planning on ""retiring"" for another 40-50 years, if that (am in a niche market in the healthcare field that is not too physically demanding and I can only see growing more as the technology evolves with it), but at the same time would like to maximize what i have socked away. What I was wondering is if there is anything I could/should be doing right now that would help, either diversify my 401k money (how?), or borrow some of it to invest in something else, something stable (if so, what? Bonds, stocks, precious metals, real estate?), or even get life insurance (what is this? No clue about this at all). Any ideas for someone just getting his feet wet?

Now with the recent housing crisis, somehow I really don't see this happening at all.

If you add to that that historically, long-term fixed rate has almost never been worth it, and that I am more than willing to accept a little risk, why would I ever do that ?  Am I missing something ?

* Credit card debt at $4,900, an additional $4,000 in retail credit card (engagement ring), but very manageable financing deal on it with no interest over 3 years to pay off.

* Car lease monthly $275

**Good News**

* New long term job I'm happy with, making $60k, started about 4 months ago (about double what I was making previously). 

* Moving into an apartment in less than a month with my fiancée. Between me and her we are splitting cell phone bill, utilities and rent at ~$1000 each. More expensive rent but actually cheaper with us committing to splitting all living bills evenly. 

**Saving goals**

* Wedding planned for next November. My fiancéeand I must jointly save! Not sure how much contribution we're getting from both our parents yet, but expecting worse case scenario. Venue booked.

* We expect to be renting for a couple years at least at the new apartment and concurrently save up for a house. However, we got a very quality place that has 2 bedrooms and we can feel comfortable being there for however long we need to. 

* Get a 401k/IRA/something started for retirement

* Emergency fund would be very nice to have

___________________________

OKAY! Sorry about the read, but I feel it was necessary to understand where I'm coming from.

**Source of Problem:** Me. I think the big issue with my finance control was always getting paid and letting the hunk of income be used through the month with my rent, living expenses, loan payments, car payment and just spending money (erratic). Payments were on auto-pay (randomly throughout the month) and I've had the savings account open but never thought to deposit it because I always thought I just didn't have anything to save. I'd spend whenever for whatever through the month hoping that if I spend on a new dress shirt or $40 at the bar, I'd think... well...hopefully 'x' loan was paid already!

I had enough after seeing I've hardly shaved an ounce off my principal of student loans and realized I need to figure out what I'm doing wrong. Long story short, did a lot of research, and turns out everything. 

**Plan of Attack:**

* I've already developed a personal finance tracker of every possible predictable fixed payments on loans and credit card (minimum). Also put together full budget of living expenses. Also included interest rates and balance on loans so I can see it all in one spot.

* I've put together a cash flow spreadsheet (including those above payments and income), and I realized that.. holy crap I can actually save a decent amount in a few months! Problem I fear is, I see though I have extra money.. I'm going to spend it.

* I learned about a 'bucket budget' and realized that is right up my alley. I will take the exact amount of my payments and living expenses and leave in my existing checking account every month (that way I don't need to move around auto-payments). I want to open up a checking account at a different bank (I hate Bank of America ATM fees and the hundreds of dollars of overdraft fees they have of mine) along with a savings account. I'll set up recurring transfer of whatever is left over after the BoA expenses to between this new checking and savings account. I'll give myself $200 a paycheck (every other Friday) for spending (incl. gas and groceries). Whatever is left over at the end of the month goes into savings as well. If I'm giving myself too little, I'll have to adjust.

* I understand that you have to cut back in spending to make dents into debt. I've promised myself to start with no sporting events, concerts, big time spending until this credit card is off the books.

* My savings be a combination of what is needed to save a month for the wedding, and money to attack my credit card hard. Then after that is paid off, attack the small amount private loans. Then the large private loan, lastly the large Dept. of Ed loan.

* After I can pay off my credit card, I'll open up my 401k or Roth 401k with my employer where they match dollar for dollar. 

___________________________________

Does all the above make sense to the resident personal finance experts here? Am I doing this the right way? As I've been planning this, I've realized I need advice and opinions on a couple of things...

* Does it make sense to set up my recurring payments to hit at the same time or spread throughout the month? Does it matter? 

* What do I look for in a new checking account? Credit Union? Online bank like Schwab? A big bank like Citi? Hoping to take this opportunity to find something that I will be happy with, rather than the misery with BoA. 

* Paying off my credit card. Continue paying minimum and once I have the a decent amount of money in my savings, attack it with whatever I have? Same for all the loans?

* Once the credit card is paid off, do I just put it in a block of ice for emergency? Or spend ~$100 and pay it off every month? My credit score definitely isn't hurting and I've run score estimates on Free Credit Score and see how much it will go up even when I pay off half of it.

* After going through the information on this subreddit, sounds better to get my Roth 401k started? Start with the minimum contribution and as my debts come off the board, invest in more?

* Does it make sense how I am going to go after my debt? Credit card then low amount fixed loans then high amount?

* For our wedding fund, should my fiancée and I set up a SEPARATE savings account that we can jointly send money to for saving? Is there an ideal savings account for something like this?

* What's the best way of going about putting together an 'emergency fund'? A certain amount I should be able to have if needed? Should this be the priority over the credit card?

* LASTLY, is there anything else I can do to enhance what I am trying to do? Is there something I should change from above that would help me more? Any other Personal Finance Redditors going through a similar epiphany and have success with going about it the way I have planned?

Thanks all for sticking through this. All opinions, criticisms and thoughts are seriously appreciated. Hoping this turns things around for me financially.

personalfinance,Purchasing a car (paying off vs financing and investing),"My car is getting up there (2006 w/ 170k miles).  I'm not looking to get rid of it now, but with the amount I drive, I'm probably going to be looking to get another car in 1-2 years (I got the car in 2009 w/ 18K miles).

By that time, I want to have the cash to buy the car outright, but I started thinking about possibilities of getting a really low to zero finance rate and how much of a benefit there would be.

I know at face value, paying off the car gives peace of mind versus the thought of financing at 0% for 3 years gives additional cash.  Is it worth it, though?

I'm looking for help in calculating this and am curious if I'm missing anything.  

Let's say the car costs 15K and you're able to get a loan for 0% financing:

| Term (yrs)  | 1.5% APR    | 3% APR     | 5% APR |
|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|:------|
| 1        |         $225 |     $450 | $750
| 3  |    $675 |  $1350   | $2250
| 5      |        $1125 |   $2250 | $3750

I used a simple calculator for the interest rate so this isn't compounded.  So, first off, are my calculations even right?

The other thing I'm not considering is the possibility of getting the car for cheaper by paying for it up front.  Are dealers willing to give the customer a cut if you pay cash?

At the end of the day, is it worth it to pay for the car flat out or invest the money and finance?",finance,1379366533

So I was wondering if you could all help me come up with a bit better financial plan. I don't really see what I should be doing or how to change it/make it better but I figured you all might be able to assist.

leaving a defecit of -500 a month. Granted, I am WAY high on my utilities, which on average have been 50 for gas, 50 for water, 105 for electric, and trash only comes once every three months, so that makes the defecit only -100 a month, which I have been dipping out of the savings for.

Next month, (October 1st) I get an annual military bonus of $5,666.00 (so with 25% tax, actual in pocket of 4,249 which I plan on using to pay off the Paypal, Capital One, Chase, and Best Buy credit cards, freeing up $180 a month and pulling me out of deficit, and also leaving an additional $1,349 from the bonus. My thoughts were to skip putting 400 into savings in october and using the rest of the bonus to pay off the First Liberty personal loan. Thus freeing up an additional $100 a month, but having absolutely 0 in savings. 

So.. what's your thoughts here? How can I get ahead and make myself better off? Any tips and tricks, or potential pay off strategies you might have would be most welcome. 

Thanks!

personalfinance,"Roth IRA vs Traditional, with two separate pension accounts","I'm 28 and my wife is 29. After pre-tax deductions, which includes deductions for our separate pension accounts (CalSTRS and CalPERS, I'm a seasonal firefighter and she's a teacher), we pull in about $70k in taxable income per year. I only work about 5-6 months out of the year and a combined $70k is the low-end average, depending on how busy fire season is - I've pulled in an additional $5-10k during a few very busy seasons in the past. My wife is a salaried employee.  

We have no debt besides &lt;$100 on each of our credit cards each month that we subsequently pay off. We currently rent and plan on buying within the next few years. We have two young children and plan on having a third within the next year or so.  

The question I have is in regards to a traditional vs. roth IRA - our deductions and exemptions tally up to about $30k and our credits are $2k for the kids so we only owe ~$3.3k in federal taxes each year, and our California state taxes are less than $600. These deductions and credits will only increase when we have another child and purchase a home.  

This basically means that all of our contributions to a Roth IRA will be taxed, at most, 15% upon deposit and obviously tax-free when we eventually withdraw at retirement age. By the time we retire most of the exemptions, deductions and credits will be gone for all three of our children and (as I understand it) our house once we are finished paying it off. Assuming we are withdrawing a bit more than we make currently (the equivalent of $80k per year at retirement), our tax burden will be greater at that time. Also, our pension payments will be taxed regardless as they are currently being deposited pre-tax.  

To me, the solution is obvious - Roth IRA all the way. I just want to be sure there is nothing that I missed in my reasoning.",finance,1379351938

House boom lifts pressure for 'speed limits' on loans

FEARS of property bubbles have prompted a warning from one of the world's pre-eminent financial regulators that using monetary policy to ward off dangerous dislocation in house prices is losing its clout, putting pressure on the Reserve Bank to consider ""speed limits"" on lending to cool the market.

As the weekend auction clearance rate in Sydney again topped 84 per cent, a study by the Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements found central banks had increasingly used prudential rules to battle property market ""booms and busts"" instead of monetary policy.

This comes as the RBA's record-low interest rates set up a potentially uncomfortable position for governor Glenn Stevens.

The RBA would not want to raise rates to soften property prices while the broader economy was weak and after the jobless rate last week hit a four-year high, analysts said.

In addition, higher rates would boost the Australian dollar, further straining the economy's critical transition to non-mining sectors such as manufacturing, tourism and housing construction.

Led by a Sydney market that real estate agents say is ""hot"", house prices are rising at an annualised rate of about 8 per cent as demand from investors floods tight supply.

In a bid to cool its booming property market, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand recently imposed macro prudential rules capping the lending banks can do at high loan-to-value ratios.

Canada, Sweden and Norway have also implemented LVR restrictions since the global financial crisis.
Economists say while the RBA has been opposed to macro prudential tools, the greater use of such rules by central banks globally may prompt a rethink if house price growth continues.

""Australian house valuations have recovered in the last 12 months, along with a rebound in consumer confidence metrics,"" said John Buonaccorsi, a banking analyst at investment bank CIMB. ""At the same time, business confidence remains weak, suggesting to us that low interest rates are still needed to support business investment. Against this background, NZ's policies could prompt a rethink on using macro prudential tools in Australia.""

The BIS's one-off study looked at policy actions on housing markets in 60 economies, including Australia, from January 1990 to June last year.

Monetary policy in terms of changes in rates is not included as it is already ""well documented"", with the study focusing on three actions: reserve and liquidity requirements, and limits on credit growth. Five prudential measures were included.

While it found greater use of monetary policy actions overall, the share of prudential policy actions more than doubled to 33 per cent in the 2000s and 39 per cent from January 2010 to June 2012. In addition, the 13 economies in the Asia-Pacific region were the most active users of prudential measures.

""These findings are in line with the increasing interest of policymakers in prudential measures that specifically influence housing credit booms,"" the report says.

""Since the 1990s, financial cycles such as housing credit and house price cycles have become longer, larger and less synchronised with business cycles and inflation cycles.""

The report concludes many central banks have adopted interest rate policy and inflation targeting as the main part of monetary policy framework since the 1990s. The RBA's primary mandate is to set the cash rate to meet its inflation target of 2-3 per cent, but it is also charged with ensuring economic stability, in which housing markets play a big role.

BIS did not refer to Australia's current property market, but the surge in prices has caught the eye of regulators. Last week, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority warned banks not to relax home lending standards.",finance,1379311818

personalfinance,Borrowing against 401k to flush CC debt?,"Hey guys,

Throwaway as I have some reddit friends I'd rather not share my financial woes with. I'm a little financially dumb, and while lately I've been getting better, I have a long way to go. In college I racked up moderate loan debt and large CC debt, and since college I've been generally underemployed and leaning on my CC to supplement. Objectively, I've known how stupid this is, but I wasn't ready to get serious about fixing my situation because it seemed hopeless. I can be a little avoidant about problems that stress me out.

Anyway, I'm now taking concrete steps toward righting my situation. I've frozen my physical CC in a block of ice in my freezer (still have it if I NEED it, don't have it for impulse purchases), living only through my checking account for the past few months. I have practically nothing in savings, but I have about 16,000 in the 401k I started a few years back. This year we changed 401k providers, so the numbers are a little harder to understand, but I seem to be seeing about 10-12% returns.

Since starting at my job, I've always taken the maximum match for my 401k, and even when my money situation got tight, I never touched it. Truth told, I don't fully understand the ramifications of borrowing against it, and would hate to put myself in an even worse situation by doing so.

Outweighing the 16,000 I have in my 401k is about 18,000 on my CC. I got my CC back when interest rates were pretty low, so the brunt of that debt is at 9%. That said, it looks like they changed something on me a year back or so, as some of the newest CC debt is at 15%. Nice of them to make sure I knew that was happening, but I digress. My fault for being oblivious to my finances.

So what I'm wondering is, how stupid would it be for me to empty my 401k to mostly pay off my CC and then owe my 401k instead? My monthly payments to my CC are around 350 right now, and while I've never missed a payment, I'm not left with much unspent month-to-month. My student loans will be jumping up soon, too (I'm on Income Based Repayment, so my monthly payments are increasing by about 150 per month due to a significant raise last year), and I am a little nervous about making ends meet.

I'd really like to stop paying this CC interest if I can, but I don't want to act too hastily where my financial future is concerned--I've already put myself in a pretty tough spot. I appreciate your advice, and I know that no matter how I approach the problem, I've got a lot of digging to get myself out.",finance,1379302031

personalfinance,Question about private loan,"I'm in my last semester of graduate school. Because I'm below half time, I had to apply for a private loan through SallieMae. A few financial burdens have been put upon me so I contacted SallieMae about expediting the process. They said per federal law, they have to wait 7 days to disburse the fundings to my university, which will then take them 3 days to process the funding. My question is, (and I've called SallieMae a few different times and got customer service representatives who seem to read from note cards), is there way to bypass this federal law grace period of 7 days? Is there a form, or a document that says something along the lines of, ""I understand my loan, I'm not going to change my mind, and I don't need this grace period to think about it""? They just kept saying ""federal law requires us to wait 7 days."" But federal law requires people to do a lot of things and there is usually ways (aka forms or speaking with the right person) to help with this. I would have applied for the loan sooner if I thought I needed it, but as I said, some financial hardships have conveniently showed up so I was unable to pay the school like I had originally intended and I literally can not afford to wait till October for the loan refund disbursement. 

For those wondering, this is how the process worked so far and how far along I am...

1) applied for loan.
2) SallieMae approved.
3) SallieMae contacted school.
4) School finally accepted the loan amount.
5) [waiting] SallieMae to approve the uni's acceptance.
6) This grace period that they speak of.
7) University receives funds (told me to call and they'll process w/in 24 hours).
8) University accepts funds.
9) University distributes refund to me (I have direct deposit).

So back to my question, do I really need to wait for this federal grace period to end? or is there a way I can contact someone at Sallie Mae or say something to one of the customer service reps to expedite this process? Because the university is on board and understanding of my situation and has already said they will help me when they can, but right now, the customer service representatives haven't been too informative or helpful.

personalfinance,Advice on home loan refi options I have been given - sure could use some analysis....,"Thanks in advance for your thoughts on this.
My lender has ""preapproved"" me for a refi loan at the following terms:

I have 20 years left on a 30-yr mortgage.  My interest rate right now is 5.75%.  My monthly pmts are 2073.00. I owe $173,200 as the current payoff amount.  Over remaining life of the loan, I will be paying $119k in interest.

The options are:
A -- 20-year loan @ 5.25% with $2000/mo payment (no addtl fee)
B -- 15-year loan @ 4.75% with $2179/mo payment (no addtl fee)
C -- 30-year loan @ 5.50% with $1815/mo payment (no addtl fee)
D -- 30-year loan @ 5.25% with $1803/mo payment (monthly payment includes a $1,500 fee rolled into the loan)

Although I have no plans to sell the house anytime soon, I don't think I will keep it for more than 7-10 years.  Credit scores are 705/659/642.  House was bought in 2004 for $212,500.  Worth $270ish based on comp sales in the neighborhood.  Neighborhood is in transition where the *cheaper* 1930s/1940s homes (mine is 1934-era) are being bought, torn-down and McMansions being put up in their place.

So, I am not sure what I should do.  This is so confusing...

personalfinance,"Bonus coming, possibly withholding too much, W-4 changes?","Hello trusty /r/personalfinance. I'm a regular reader/commenter here, but using a throwaway because I want to be as specific as necessary to get guidance. As always, please let me know if any additional details are needed. So here's what's up...

Background info: DINK, married filing joint, combined salaries including bonuses $112k, closed on house Nov 2012 and no mortgage payment until 1/1/2013, started putting 4.5% of my salary into 401k at the beginning of January, husband puts 5% into state employees retirement program.

In 2012, my withholdings were set to 1/0 (federal/state) and my husband's were set to 0/0. Come tax time, turned out we owed $1300 federal and got a state refund of $300. Ouch! We paid negligible mortgage insurance in 2012, just how the timing worked out, so we did not get any help toward taxes owed there. Not wanting to risk owing a boat load again, I made sure my withholdings were 0/0 for 2013.

I have a very generous bonus to the tune of $5300 coming this month at the same time as my next paycheck. Ideally, I'd like to minimize overpaying taxes now (duh), instead of waiting for it to pan out when we file our taxes in the spring. But I don't want to end up in a bad situation of owing like we did for 2012. So before messing with W-4 stuff for this upcoming pay period, I filled out the IRS withholding calculator to see how far along we are for the year...

&gt;Based on the information you previously entered, your anticipated income tax for 2013 is $1,626. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $10,778 withheld for 2013 resulting in an overpayment of $9,152 when you file your return. 

WOAH! This seems ridiculously wrong, but I can't figure out where my error was with the calculator. It totaled our projected income, salaries and bonuses, for 2013 to be $112k. New to us this year is our mortgage interest - at the beginning of the calculator where it asks for expected credits I entered $12k (mortgage interest, student loan interest). Was that the correct place to enter that value? Later in the calculator, when it asks about itemized deductions, we definitely won't have enough to beat the standard deduction so I let the calculator roll with the standard. I'm assuming the calculator accounted for pre-tax retirement contributions since it asked. And I was as exact as possible about salaries and bonuses, assuming there's no more surprise bonuses coming the rest of 2013.

So what's going on here? Is the mortgage interest making *that much* of a difference in our total tax obligation? Did I enter things into the calculator incorrectly?

**EDIT/UPDATE:** Thanks all for your quick responses and helping me sort this out. Utilizing your feedback, the calculator results are much more realistic now:

&gt;Based on your responses, your anticipated income tax for 2013 is $11,264. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $10,778 withheld for 2013 leaving $486 due when you file your return.

The collection agency MRS took over the debt from my bank in early 2011. Started making a payment of $50/month. Due to interest rates, the debt has gone down some but has remained basically at the same amount ($14k). I have around $5k saved up. I was thinking of offering $4k to settle. Though I’ve heard you need at least 50% or more usually? I could not offer $7k until perhaps early November.

Pay for deletion an option? Does that even matter? My credit score is already poor. This is the only debt/credit issue I’ve ever had. I plan to start rebuilding credit after this is settled.

Another question. Only contact collection agency by writing? I’ve spoken with them on the phone a few times but never gone in depth yet about settling. I know at least to get verification in writing before making any settlement payment but what about asking questions about settlement over the phone? Also I’ve heard it might help to make offer near the end of the month as some agencies have certain quotas to meet?

When I just look at the world in 2025 I can have popups and statuses and danger warnings and all kinds of stuff! This place is freaking traumatizing, I don't know what my current heart rate is or my triglyceride levels.

OK, on the upside, it is cool to not have to worry about Imperial drones targeting ""illegal combatants"" who may or may not have d/l'd something the RIAA/MPAA had marked as ""of national security"". Me and Luka are from East Europe. Generally these kinds of strikes are not a problem so much any more. North America, the UK, Australia and NZ has become locked down zones and very little information we get about there is reliable. They still send across the occasional strike to take out people who may be communicating with a US citizen. The strikes are getting less, leading us to believe the federal government is finally out of money. The majority of their budget we suspect is now aimed at controlling all communications and keeping sniper drones operational in their territories. 

You guys should get a kick out of this; there is a massive wall between Mexico and America now. It was put up by the US gov to keep ""non-contributors"" from fleeing!

Let me put your minds at ease, non of you are billionaires, no need to feel guilty. Bitcoin has had several hard forks and trades as 5 disparate currencies, alongside a few other distributed currencies. The adjustments were chaotic and wiped out most of us, but the system was stable by the time the masses got on board. I don't want to cause like a time-space rift or whatever, but SHA256, are you sure??? There is also an open source currency system based on extending credit and giving people a kick start in life, very popular in emerging market of the Free State of North Korea, among most young people and venture capitalists. 

There are still governments, but they are in a constant fight for funding due to near perpetual whistle blowing and live gov-budget-efficiency apps that allow people real time interaction with them. The biggest factor however is that they can no-longer print money. I suspect that they'll all soon be doing nothing but punishing violent crime and keeping the Imperial drones out. Guys, please for the love of all that is good and kind, fund defensive anti-drone projects, government or otherwise.

business,The Koyal Group: The Real State of the World Economy is Dire,"Source: http://www.lewrockwell.com/2013/09/egon-von-greyerz/the-real-state-of-the-world-economy/

We are now back to the “green shoots” era of false hope and total misunderstanding of the real state of the world economy. There are minor tidbits of good news that combined with manipulated and seasonally adjusted economic figures are giving politicians worldwide reason for spreading their optimistic gospel of recovery that has nothing to do with reality.

A world based on debt

How can a world with $250 trillion of debt and over $1 quadrillion of worthless derivatives ever recover? Of course it can’t, especially since this is a world that is supported by legs of worthless printed paper money – legs that are just getting longer and more unstable by the day as trillions are added to the debt every year.

Wherever we turn Europe, USA, Japan and many other nations, the situation is totally beyond repair. But as I have said in recent interviews and articles, it is not just beyond repair but we are likely to be at the end of a major economic cycle that started at the end of the Dark Ages. I wrote about this already back in 2009 in my article “The Dark Years Are Here”. Major economic cycles take a long time to develop and if we are now at the beginning of a major downturn in the world economy, people living today will only experience the very beginning of the downturn. But sadly the beginning will be a major and very unpleasant upheaval that virtually nobody will escape. Get more info: http://koyalgroupinfomag.com/blog/

We have had a century of false prosperity based on printed money and credit. In the last 100 years we have seen the creation of the Fed in the US (a central bank owned, created and controlled by private bankers) combined with fractional reserve banking (allowing banks to leverage 10 to 50 times), exploding government debt and a derivatives market of $1.4+ quadrillion. These are the principal reasons why the world economy has expanded in the last century and particularly in the last 40 years. These four extremely shaky legs, Central bank printing, Bank leverage, Government borrowing and Derivatives manufacturing have created a world of delusional wealth and illusory prosperity. Also, there is a total absence of moral and ethical values. We are in the final stages of an era of extreme decadence, an era that sadly cannot and will not have a happy ending.

Europe a hopeless case

But still, governments and the media are continuing to feed us with good news which bears no resemblance to the real state of the world economy. In Europe the Mediterranean countries are expanding their debt at exponential rates. Government debt to GDP of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece is ranging from 100% to 180%. There are futile attempt at austerity but this only leads to lower growth and higher debts. There is sadly no way out for these countries whose population is suffering terribly. The best solution would be to leave the EU and the Euro, renege on the debts and devalue currencies. But the Eurocrats are unlikely to accept this and would rather add more debt and print more money, making the situation even worse.

economy,Bradley Associates on HK shares to first from worst,"Hong Kong Shares Go to First From Worst on China Economy Rebound

Hong Kong stocks are beating every market in Asia as China’s economy strengthens, rebounding from the biggest drop among developed world shares in the first half.

The Hang Seng Index surged 16 percent from its June 24 low, outpacing the 14 percent climb for the Shanghai Composite Index, the next-biggest gain among Asian benchmark gauges in the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Even after the rally, Hong Kong’s index traded at 10.9 times estimated earnings as of Sept. 13, the lowest in global developed markets behind Israel.

Chinese economic data that beat forecasts this quarter spurred Hong Kong stocks to reverse course after posting an 8.2 percent loss in the six months through June. New credit almost doubled in August from July, easing concern that a lending crunch would curtail expansion in the world’s second-biggest economy, while equities rallied worldwide on signs growth is picking up.

“A lot of economic data have come in to show China’s not going to have a hard landing,” said Jeffrey Shen, head of emerging markets at BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager. “Hong Kong is clearly the first place for international investors to put some money to work in China.”

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI), also known as the H-share index, last week entered a bull market after climbing 20 percent from its June low, and the Hang Seng Index erased this year’s loss. The measure of Chinese shares listed in the city trades at 7.8 times forecast profits, the lowest in Asia.

Relative Value
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 9.6 percent from its June low. Singapore’s Straits Times Index is the only decliner this quarter among 26 developed markets tracked by Bloomberg as investors pulled cash from Southeast Asia before an expected reduction in U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus this week.

Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) led gains on the Hang Seng Index since June 24. China’s No. 1 Internet company surged 47 percent as the government signaled a renewed push to boost the telecom industry. China Oilfield Services Ltd., an offshore energy contractor, rose 43 percent during the period to lead the H-share gauge higher after its first-half profit beat estimates.

China’s industrial output expanded at the fastest pace in 17 months in August and exports rose more than expected, signs of an economic rebound after a two-quarter slump. Factory production rose 10.4 percent last month while overseas shipments gained 7.2 percent, beating the 5.5 percent estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Less Concern
That data allayed concern that a government crackdown on speculative lending would stifle the economy. The Hang Seng Index lost 16 percent from May 20 through June 24 as money-market rates surged to records.

“At the time, expectations for growth in the second half were declining to an extent that they may ultimately miss the government’s GDP growth target for 2013,” said Stephen Corry, a Hong Kong-based chief investment strategist at LGT Group. “This fear has not materialized.”

Premier Li Keqiang said he was confident of achieving 7.5 percent GDP growth in 2013 as the nation enters a phase of “medium-high” expansion. Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit boosted its growth estimate for China this year to 7.7 percent from 7.6 percent, joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in raising projections.

Credit Growth
Reports last week showed China’s broadest measure of new credit almost doubled in August from the previous month. Aggregate financing was 1.57 trillion yuan ($257 billion), the People’s Bank of China said, topping the 950 billion yuan median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 13.3 times estimated earnings on Sept. 13. That compares with multiples of 14.7 for Japan’s Topix (TPX) index and 15.1 for Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ratio for the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell to 6.53 in June, the lowest since the financial crisis in 2008.

Hong Kong shares have also gotten a boost from expectations the Fed will taper stimulus as investors withdraw funds from emerging markets. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the Fed will cut monthly bond purchases to $75 billion this week. Markets in India, Indonesia and the Philippines declined to hit new 2013 lows last month.

Investors pulled $2.2 billion from Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines in August, after plowing $6.8 billion into the markets in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

“Managers are reallocating money from Asean and moving it back to North Asia,” said Corry at LGT Group, which oversees about $117 billion. “The Hang Seng Index is a beneficiary.”

So I'm thinking of getting this card and making it be my primary.  I've had a Discover card for years, and recently they changed me from 1% cash back to 0.25% cash back by default, which is a bummer.

Because they kind of shafted me without telling me (or I missed the notification), I don't really want to go to a Discover IT card.  So I've been looking around for new cards.

I have higher than normal gas costs (~225/mo), so high gas % is a priority.  Restaurants is my second highest expense (much higher than it should be, a few hundred a month), followed by groceries and a long tail after that.

Don't want to go through the hassle of getting the 5% PenFed card.  Amex cash cards seem decent, but I'd stll need a backup Visa, and Bank Americard gets the 3%/2% balance right for me (gas/groceries instead of groceries/gas).

Also, I have a BoA account and they give a 10% bonus for credits to that account.

Chase Freedom is out because I hate Chase, and will just continue to use the Discover for the 5% only.

I have a Chase Sapphire (authorizaed as secondary) through the GF that we can/should start using for restaurants.

That leaves maybe the Capital One Quicksilver card, which I don't know much about.  Given that the majority of my purchases are in things in the 2 and 3 percent categories, a flat 1.5% on everything doesn't seem like it will make up the difference.

personalfinance,How am I doing and what can I do better?,"Greetings PF. I've been lurking here every so often for tips and advice. Well, I'd like to ask for some feedback on my situation because I want a bigger perspective. Sometimes I tend to get tunnel vision.

I'm 22 years old, and have a two year degree in computers. I was fortunate enough to have the funds for that thanks to my parents. I now work part-time in IT, and have been for about 14 months now. I make about $11k/yr and still live with my parents. My only bills right now are for mobile phone, martial arts, and personal purchases (video games, computer parts, 'vacation,' etc). Because all of my essentials are covered, I'm saving about 80-90% of my income right now. By the end of this month, I will have about $10k in my checking account, which I plan on moving to a savings account (shopping around for banks, as my current only offers 0.05% interest in savings) very soon. I have an additional $1500 in a traditional IRA, which is in a 3-year CD with 0.30% interest. I plan on moving that to another bank that has higher interest rates on their CD/IRAs, if that's possible.

Here are my goals:

- Financially stable, ideally independent. I want to be able to cover/plan for any unexpected financial scenarios (car breaks down, house needs repair, that kind of thing) without too much stress.

- Self employed, or at least flexibly employed. I'd like to be able to spend my time and energy as I choose, rather than it being chosen for me. I'd love to 'retire early.'

I think I'm headed in the right direction, but I'd love some feedback on things I could add, change or tweak now that will help me out in the future.

Thanks all!",finance,1379520589

investing,"Read the newbie threads and FAQ but still a bit confused. Brand new to investing and I want to invest $3,000. The goal is $10,000 in the next 5 to 7 years. Should I go with safer index funds/CDs or go more aggressive? Any advice would be really appreciated.","Hello Redditors! I made sure to read all the newbie side bar threads before posting this so please bear with me.

My specs: I'm in my late 20's and just got a large check in the form of a returned apartment security deposit. I already have 6 months worth of emergency savings, a 401K (unmatched), and a maxed-out Roth IRA. With that in mind this $3,000 is play money that I've decided to invest instead of blowing on a new computer. 

I'm combining this returned security deposit check with some of my savings to get an even $3,000 and start a new independent investment account at TDAmeritrade. Right now I trust my Roth to the brokers at Fidelity (mutual funds) so this is my first time striking out on my own. My goal is to earn enough money through investments to eventually put a down payment on either a new car or a small condo. Not a big down payment, but my goal is a modest $10,000 in the next 5 to 7 years if possible. 

Upon reading the newbie threads I noticed a lot of you recommended trading in index funds or just getting a CD with a 1.6% or 2% interest rate. Should I go this route or would it be more pertinent to do a split between a couple of larger stocks like PNG and index funds? 

I can go higher risk for this. I know the ups and downs of the market so I don't plan on day trading (lest the fees eat me alive) and as with the case with my Roth I don't freak out when I lose money. I'm ready to play ball and could really use some wise tips from you all. Thank you! 

**Edit:** My apologies, I should have been more clear that I'm hoping to reach $10,000 with the help of investing but I would be periodically adding funds to the principal during that 5 to 7 year time period. So far the advice I'm receiving is to stick with index funds, which sounds quite reasonable.",finance,1379516815

personalfinance,"In school, about to be married, potential first-time home buyer with a lot of student debt","Hello, r/personalfinance

Here is my current situation...

I am getting married in May, and we are considering buying a house. I'm 26, she's 25. I am a software developer and pull in about $3500 a month after taxes ($60k a year). My fiancee is a nurse and makes about $2000 a month (about $22/hr) after taxes if she doesn't pick up extra shifts, but she often does. 

I am debt free, but she has a large pile of student loans, totaling close to $90,000 (got 2 bachelor degrees, each from an expensive private school. She realizes her mistakes now). She also has 10k left to pay on her car (at $429 a month). Currently I own my car outright.

Her total minimum payment on all loans combined is about $900 a month. About $30k of her loans are federal and since she's in a public service job, they will get forgiven after 10 years as long as she continues to make the minimum payment on those. She also got chosen for a Nursing Loan Repayment plan that gives her $1500 a month over the next 2 years...enough to pay her minimum payments on everything, plus $600 additional to put towards the loan with the highest interest rate. So despite her decisions that got her $90k in debt, she is succeeding at doing what she can to rectify it.

On top of this, she is just started going back to school again to be a Nurse Practitioner. This time she is taking the more economical route and going to a public school where the entire 3-year program costs a modest $23,000. She gets a stipend from her work to cover about $500 a semester (9 semesters total...3 per year) so total out-of-pocket per semester ends up being around $2,000. She already has this semester paid off. I don't anticipate having to take out more student loans for this graduate program. She is also contributing that maximum that her employer will match to her 401(k)

Meanwhile, I have always been frugal and have never been in debt, so all these expenses seem overwhelming to me. Currently I have $50,000 in a checking account (kept high right now for a potential down payment on a house) I have amassed around $100k in non-retirement investments plus another $65k in a Roth IRA. Personally, I would like to not touch any of that, including the non-retirement investments where they are because I would prefer to retire as early as I can.

Once she gets out of school in 3 years, and if she gets a job as a nurse practitioner, she should start out making at least $80k. But again, that is 3 years from now. For the next 2 years she will have the loan repayment plan to take care of her minimum loan payments (and then some). She has been living at her parents' the last couple months and has been putting almost everything she can into paying her debt down further, to the point where she has no savings except for her 401(k). I'm particularly worried about the 3rd year in her program where, not only will that repayment program stop, but she will also be doing clinicals and she doubts she will be able to work full time for that year. So for that year, I'm expecting most of it to fall onto me, including most of her loan payments.

Anyway...that's my situation. Here is my question...
Is now the best time to buy a house? I for sure want to do a 20% down payment to avoid PMI. She's..well...a girl... and wants a ""nice"" house. I told her I think it would be completely unnecessary to get a house over $200k for just the 2 of us (plus her little dog). So if we buy a house it would be around that $200k mark with a $40k down payment (coming from my checking account). From talking briefly with a lender, that would mean about $1200 a month for a 30 year mortgage, $1600 a month for a 15-year...both including taxes and insurance. I'm anticipating about additional $6k in closing costs.

So as you can tell, there's a lot going on and I'm feeling overwhelmed by it and not sure what to do. I'm thinking maybe we would be better off renting while she's in school...then have cost certainty (not have to worry about any unexpected maintenance cost with the house). Rent wold probably be in the realm of $900 a month, so we would have  less expenses without the fear of having to deal with maintenance costs. It would certainly make me feel better during that year when her loan re-payment program is done and she's only able to work part time. As stated, we will be newlyweds so it will be less stressful and we'll be able to enjoy each other more than worrying about a house. I also believe I will be able to save and invest the difference hopefully at a rate higher than current mortgage rates. Or pay off more and more of her student loan debt.

But on the flip side of that..I'm fully expecting mortgage rates to go significantly higher by that time. Only having to move once sounds appealing. She very much is in favor of buying a house immediately, but as of right now the money will be coming from me so she recognizes that, and seems open to the idea of renting while she's in school despite her belief that it's ""throwing money away"".

So anyway, there's a lot going on here and I don't know what to do. There's a lot of expenses from school, loan payments, living situation..but also a good amount of income too from both of us, and I have a lot of money saved up. Can someone please help? As to whether buying or renting for now would be the best way to go? Also any suggestions as to what to do about loan payments. Should we just use the re-payment program money for now and save/use the rest? Or should we pay off as much as we can while she's in school? Would it be worth halting contributions to our retirement accounts to do this?

Sorry for the long post. There's just a lot happening and decisions to make seem overwhelming to me. I want to get our marriage started off on a happy yet responsible note.

“Trout, incidentally, had written a book about a money tree. It had twenty-dollar bills for leaves. Its flowers were government bonds. Its fruit was diamonds. It attracted human beings who killed each other around the roots and made very good fertilizer.” Slaughterhouse 5, Kurt Vonnegut

It is the year 3030. Bitcoin is dominated by few hands: The Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Carnegies, Warburg's &amp; Nakamoto, according to YouTube.

Bitcoin had been an experiment in decentralized currency. But, by 3030, it had been adopted by the banking system which had reigned before it, and forever been changed.

Before this, an intermediate dynasty, the ""old guard,"" had reigned for approximately 100 years: The dynasties of Andresen, Garzik, Ver &amp; Mayer. 

The abovementioned dynasty ""Nakamoto"" was created by splicing the genes of the so-called ""old-guard."" 

That happened in 3020, the year the House of Winklevoss had their BTC wallet fortune hacked by a clone of Mayer Rothschild, whom had pulled the stunt while drinking whisky and entertaining a hologram of Johnny Depp, his favorite actor.  

This could be seen by the public ledger, which had since began recording via laptop data as ""extra-data."" 

The NSA (former US gov agency), it had been uncovered after the fall of the Great Mexican Border Wall while its offices were raided in a scene reminiscent of the Stasi offices in 1990, had actually stolen the code from Satoshi Nakamoto days before the protocol was to be released, and then released it itself and mined the genesis block. Nakamoto was devastated. 

Satoshi Nakamoto had actually been hired by Ben Bernanke, a Federal Reserve (long story) President at the turn of the 21st century, who met Nakamoto at an orgy hosted by Google. 

Nakamoto had covertly received bailout money during a bailout program in the US in 2008. He was high when he wrote the code and was given 49% stake in ""Bitcoin"" by Bernanke in the infamous communication intercepted by the NSA's ""Follow The Money"" division and later leaked by the Pravda of the time, the Genesis Block.com.

Although neither Bernanke nor Nakamoto knew who had hijacked the protocol, they were early in, and Bitcoin was deliberately helped by Bernanke's economic policies. 


Over time, the block chain grew so large that few users chose to download its client on their machine. 

Bitcoin wallets floating in the cloud became the preference of the usermasses: There was Wallet of America; US Wallet; Wallet Fargo; Deutsche Wallet and CitiWallet. There were a few others, but these were subsidiaries of the others. 

Mining long ago had ceased to be profitable except for those who could implement it on a large scale due to indulgences in the form of charity to ""The New Bitcoin Foundation,"" a liberal think-tank dedicated to BTC. 

There was the Federal Miner, and central miners of all nations, all members of the Federal Miner System and united under the Miner of International Settlements. The United Nation-Wallets held a bug that had been created in the US in 2020, the year before its fall and resurrection as ""NAW"" (North American Wallet), known as the ""Wallet Kill Switch."" Nobody knew if it worked.

But, off-chain, The Resistance - the so-called ""old believers"" who had read on the Internet about a decentralized Bitcoin which died long ago - loosely organized. 

They had their work cut out for them, for in school the users of different nation-wallets were taught normal users shouldn't ever download the blockchain, and be using wallets and other technologies. Each morning they convened in the school auditorium and sang a song to the school's offline wallet. The song went like:

""Ohhh, Satoshiii."" (repeat 21 times)

Why 21 times? Nobody knew why. There were, in 3030, 32 million bitcoins in existence. On the eve December 24, 3021, the protocol had been ""tuned-up"" as Moderators on BitcoinTalk termed it. 


All the users needed were bitcoins, not clients. Bitcoins had never been so easy to procure. All one had to do was go into one of the aforementioned banks, open an account, and presto. It took a couple days for the DNA test to come back, to be sure. 

But, on the cusps of the gray culture, The Resistance did what they could to mine chips they themselves manufactured. There was risk in this, of course, as jurisdictions had state vans which drove around and detected excess electricity, such as would be used for mining bitcoins, growing marijuana or drying freshly printed $100 bills (these were sold as historical artifacts for $50. They were,after all, the last paper money). They were last used 110 years ago.  

Electricity, also, cost an arm and a leg, sometimes literally. One had to have ""blat"" as the soviets called it - connections - in order to get electricity off-grid (not through the state provider). Still raids and mass power outages undermined this effort of The Resistance. 

Unknown to The Resistance: they had help. Nakamoto had gained a sense of themself, and had stealthily began coordinating to return Bitcoin to its original state. 

One night he bought 14 of the most beautiful prostitutes he could find on Backpage.com, a classifieds site. When they showed up, he realized they weren't ideal. 

Still, the guards fell for it. 

He had gained access to the protocol. He had already written a code, which was to return all coins stolen in the Crime Of 2018 when all Bitcoin users - except for those, of course, with access to Bitcoin Airlines - were purged. The coins were returned to their future families.  

He then returned the protocol to the original 21 million coin programming, undid some other stuff, and typed a PR Web blast. The title of the Press Release? 

""Chancellor Satoshi Nakamoto on brink of second end for banks""

It was dated January 3, 3031. 

The Resistance understood. Nakamoto had referenced the note left in the code of the original Bitcoin protocol. Everyone knew that. In 3026 the headline had been changed to ""Online wallets are safe."" 

The Resistance began travelling first to their families houses, then to their neighbors. Once there they downloaded Bitcoin-QT and began showing their loved ones how to use it and care for their savings. 

The online wallets pushed for a bailout, but they had essentially been bankrupted when the code went back to the original 21 million coins because most of their profits had been from the Federal Miners ""philanthropy"" system of automated tax. They held little political clout.

personalfinance,How to manage stocks with potentially looming (US) gov't shutdown?,"The US stock market has been doing rather well as of late. The major indices and averages are approaching their all-time highs. Unfortunately, there are some looming issues that could derail the current direction. In chronological order (and potential for market reversal): New direction from the Fed, US Gov't shutdown, and the Debt Ceiling.

Normally, I would just ride through the Fed meeting notes, counting on the market to correct itself and then recover based on whatever is in the meeting minutes. So I'm not so concerned there, but would still love to hear some thoughts on that point. The Gov't shutdown and the Debt Ceiling do have me a bit worried.

When the government shutdowns in 1995/1996 occurred, there was no real impact on the stock market, though the economy was more robust at the time. Per this article from the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/business/economy/08econ.html?pagewanted=all):

&gt;When the government shut down for 20 days in late 1995, the nation’s economic growth was slowed by **as much as a full percentage point** in that quarter, according to James F. O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. The effect was temporary, he said, with the economy adding about that much in the following quarter.

If growth were to slow that much this quarter, I'm unsure whether it would automatically be made up the following quarter. If Wall Street shares the same concern, the stock market would take a hit this time around unlike in 1995/96

The potential shutdown is just a prelude to a potentially bigger clash over the raising of the debt ceiling. With the previous debt ceiling showdown in August of 2011, the Dow lost over 2000 pts. Dropping 5.6% in a single day.

[Snapshot](http://imgur.com/i9jEgRH)

The Dow recovered slowly from there but was down around 2% going into the New Year (when compared to pre-debt ceiling levels).

I don't want to delve into politics here at all. What I do want to know is what should I/other readers do to either minimize their losses or try to maximize their gains?


I'm not sure the precise mechanisms of stop on quote (e.g. how close to the quote the sale price will be in a flash crash type situation), but is that a good method to insulate yourself from losses/preserve some gains? Or is that just a crapshoot?


Is it worthwhile to preemptively buy out of the stock market prior to the debt ceiling or government shutdown?



Or should I just sit back relax, and leave everything as is.



(I should add I'm in the stock market mostly for longer term growth. I have some money set aside to play around with so I do cash in and out on say 10% of my portfolio, so there may be a point of delineation there. It might be better to cash on on my buy low stocks (e.g. Nokia) while hanging onto my longer term stocks (Vanguard, MSFT, etc).

personalfinance,25 in a whole with my family.,"So I did this from a new account  for privacy purposes. My parents have been in a big mess for a while now and I am trying to help them as much as possible while also wanting to get myself out of debt.

I really would like to get myself out of debt. I have an okay job that allows me some extra cash but my parents are living way above their means. I'm also enrolled in college part time.

Currently I work in a commission job. I make guaranteed take home (after 401k+taxes) pay of 1,000 a month from my hourly. My commissions range from 1,200 to 2,700 per month (take home). I would say $1,200 to $1,400 is where it usually is. The big checks are 2 or 3 months out of the year. My 401k contribution is 7% and my company matches up to 6%.

I own the car I drive. I'm currently paying off a judgment against me for an auto loan for $280 a month. I pay insurance for our family which is $133 a month.
My monthly expenses at the bare minimum for gas, food, going out 700.

What I owe: The judgement has about 15 months left I have to pay it otherwise they garnish my wages.
I owe about 2k in traffic tickets are in collections. 
There is a $800 credit card in collections.
And two old phone bills in collections for I believe a total of $400.
I also have a bank account I overdrew that is in collection for $750.

I'm not certain of the interest rate on any of these.

Now for my family. Right now their main problem is making ends meat. Together my parents make a total of $3,400 a month (take home after insurance + taxes). My father can supplement that income with an extra 1k a month through some freelance work however it comes and goes and is not reliable.

The rent is $2,260 a month (waaaay too high I know) 
They have a car payment that they are 3 payments behind on that is 500 a month.  And bills and living expenses easily surpass another $1,200 a month.

Now some background. How have we been making it this way for so long? As I mentioned my father does do extra work that can help a lot some months. I know they have been borrowing money left and right over the last year and I contribute anywhere between $200 and $1,000 on a given month. I need to be clear I have an incredibly stubborn family that will not take my advice on any of these matters. I recently put my foot down that we absolutely need to downsize and after a huge argument last night they are getting the picture. I know the rule of rent being 25%. We live in SoCal and I have to tell you this is very difficult to get that kind of place. We would have to move to the desert and the savings would be lost on gas for us to commute to our jobs. Also my family has 0 money to move. They have absolutely no money in savings. The only thing they would have is the security deposit on the home we're renting. And also big surprise credit is an issue in getting a place here too. 

As I mentioned before my parents are pretty immune to good advice and thus I am simply looking to figure out how I can help myself and what amount I can give them per month so they can figure out their finances. I have 0 emergency fund and would like to build one. My questions are:
How much should I be giving them a month? I've been paying debts off little by little when I get larger bonus checks and just taking care of it that way. Should I be paying everything little by little? Is there something I should be focusing on more? Can I even build an emergency fund at this point? Should I keep up my 401k contributions since it is the only money I have saved? Historically I have had a very difficult time saving money so the 401k has worked well since it is automatically taken out.

I'm happy to answer questions and I'll make sure to keep everyone as updated as possible. Thanks so much in advance for your help I've really enjoyed reading this subreddit.

Edit: Don't know why I typed ""whole."" and if this isn't clear I do live with them rent free and feel I do owe them at least something.

personalfinance,Best way to pay off Student Loans?,"I am a senior in college and thought of an interesting way to pay off my student loans while in class the other day.
So I've heard of people using their Credit Cards to pay for expensive things like furniture and whatnot and they would pay off a little at a time until their Interest-free period expires and then transferring all of that money onto a different Credit Card with an Interest-free period. This occurs until they either give up and pay it all off in full or cave in and fall victim to the Interest Period. 
So, my question to you Personal Finance experts is:
Would it be smart to pay off all $90,000 of my student debt by using a Credit Card and paying it off using these Interest-Free Periods instead of falling prey to the overwhelming Student Loan Interest Rates?
What are other little clever ways of avoiding Student Loan Interest Rates such as this?",finance,1379623439

I think the new credit card laws prevent companies from mailing me credit card offers until 21 (I'm 19 atm). Should I be expecting more mail like this or are they pulling off something illegal?

Interestingly enough, I wanted the Discover It Student card beforehand, but since I'm only 19 yrs old and have no job, I didn't bother to apply. The offer doesn't affect me (I get less APR for the first couple months), but now that they seem ""interested in me"", is it worth applying for? My income is still 0, but does having a credit card already give me a much greater chance? I have a couple thousand in checkings and savings combined to show that I can pay off my credit card but the form in the mail only wants my income and personal information.",finance,1379622920

personalfinance,Advice needed on budgeting and Private Student Loans.,"Hello PF,

I could use some help/advice/insight when it comes to my income vs expenses and my private student loans. Sorry in advance for all the text.

My Student Loan payments began this month and now I am in the red in terms of my income vs expenses. I have never been in this situation and I am scared. I used some of my savings to pay my bills this month because I didn't know what else to do. 


**My financial situation**:

*Current Savings:* $2900

*Current Checking:* $530

*Income:* $1020/month

* Job #1 @ $8/hr, ~30 hours per week
* Job #2 @ $12/hr, 16 hours per week 

*Expenses (Monthly)*:

* Rent- $570

* Comcast- $25

* Car- $210

* At&amp;t- $45

* Private Loans- $720

* Federal Loans- $7

* Food- ~$200

* Gas- ~$150


**What I'm doing to try to improve my situation:**

* Job #2 just offered me up to 32 hours per week instead of 16 so I am talking to my manager tomorrow about lessening my hours at the minimum wage job to take advantage of the higher paying job.

* I began walking to work/using the bus instead of driving to cut down on gas.

* I just did a Food Stamps eligibility check and I'm eligible for $100/month in assistance.

* I began Income Based Repayment on my Federal loans and got the monthly payment lowered from $460 to $7. I have been trying to contact my private loan lender but I work during their call center hours each day, I emailed a few days ago but have yet to receive any response. I am going to try calling tonight after work and hopefully discuss some options. This is what I could use advice on...can private loans be consolidated? If they can be, should I? I can provide more detailed info on my loans if need be (amounts, interest rates, etc.) Should I increase my repayment term to lower payments or is this a bad thing?


Any help is appreciated.

Currently my wife just has a small part time job bringing home about $600-700/mo. Starting pay in her field is $20/hr and she is nearly guaranteed a job when she finishes. 

I am wondering if we should look for something in the $100-110,000 range that we can afford. Once she graduates and gets her job, we should have nearly double our current income. Her student loans will be about $18,000 total, $300/mo.

Bitcoin,BFL's illegal refund policy.,"So I tried to cancel my BFL preorder today, and I was met with this wall of text.

|While we reserve the right to handle refund requests on a case by case basis, pre-ordered products are non-refundable as is clearly stated at the time of purchase.  The reason for this is that pre-order funds are used in the build process which makes it impractical to reverse.  It's also been observed that some small number of customers have placed orders as part of a bitcoin price hedging strategy which involves multiple requests to cancel and then re-enstate their orders as market conditions change.  This has created an enormous customer service burden which is resolved by enforcing the all sales final policy.
Some customers have asked why we've given order cancellation refunds to others, but they can't get one.  The answer is that we had opted to process order cancellation requests during our long product development phase as a courtesy to those who endured the stress of the unknown.  However, once full production began, a notice was sent out advising that orders would be shipped as produced according to the order queue and that if anyone was unwilling to endure the wait, they had a final opportunity to cancel.  Customers were required to positively confirm their desire to remain in the order queue and accept the order terms.
Pre-Order terms for new orders were updated on the website on April 1, 2013.  The terms state, ""I accept the terms of the sale and understand that all sales are final and there is a backlog of orders and production &amp; delivery of my order may take 2 months or longer.""
As a Wyoming Corporation, we operate under the US Federal Trade Commission's business guide for mail or telephone ordered merchandise.  The relevant guideline suggests that if no delivery terms are stated or agreed to, then 30 days should be assumed.  In our case, we've gone to great length to ensure there is no ambiguity.  Customers are/were notified of the back order situation, the inability to cancel their order and the multi month wait to be expected. However, we have added a new feature to your account dashboard. You have the option of selling your order. There are more details and instructions on how to do so on our facebook page. 
Announcing a Pre-Order Marketplace

New customers frequently ask us how they can move up in the order queue, and at times offer us more money to do so. Of course, we refuse. We also have customers who decide to sell their orders on eBay or other venues. Unfortunately, doing so requires a secure form of transfer, and the trust factor simply makes it difficult for a seller to find buyers.

Butterfly Labs is excited to announce a platform that will help merge the needs of both parties. Starting today, a seller will be able to announce the sale of their pre-order position in our classifieds forum. They will establish the terms of sale and make the deal on their own. Once a deal has been made, they will use the transfer system in their account Dashboard to transfer an order to a new owner. When both parties verify and agree to the terms, the order will be moved to the buyer's account.

The order transfer system was set in place September 10, 2013.Butterfly Labs will only provide the platform for the order transfer to take place. We are not responsible for any deals made between our customers. Use of the order transfer system is solely the risk of the parties making the order transfer deal. Buyer's must agree to the original terms of the sale, and specifically to the no refund policy.
Here is the relevant FTC guideline text:
""when you advertise merchandise, you must have a reasonable basis for stating or implying that you can ship within a certain time. If you make no shipment statement, you must have a reasonable basis for believing that you can ship within 30 days.""

**I went and read the http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus02-business-guide-mail-and-telephone-order-merchandise-rule and it states that if the consumer agrees to an indefinite shipping period aka ""2 or more months"" they are legally allowed to seek a refund up until their order is shipped.**

What to do if you want a refund:
File a complaint with the FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#&amp;panel1-1
File a complaint with your state's attorny general.
File a complaint with the BBB.
If you paid with a credit card there are often laws about being charged for a product before it is shipped to you, contact your credit card company.
If you paid with paypal file a complaint with them.

We want to be able to travel, do fun things, and give to charity as we want, but we need to have enough money in retirement (no kids to fall back on!). We need to find a balance between the two. We're both pretty clueless about finances and investing... math makes me want to throw my head back and snore. But we're both dedicated to doing better.

What else can we be doing? Where should we focus our attention, paying off the relatively low-interest debt we have, saving more, or investing somewhere? If investing, into what? Theoretically it seems we'd want wherever we invest to have a higher interest rate than what we're losing on debt, otherwise we should focus on debt, right?",finance,1379612919

Basically, from what I can gather with these options, VFCAX, ISCAX, FGFAX are the best from the first list. They only require $1500 for an initial investment. How does that work? Does the bank just hold my contributions until my employer and I have contributed $1500 before they do any investing for me at all?

Obviously, FMDCX from the second list is excellent, but it requires a $1M initial investment. I'm not sure why that's even an option for us?!?! Or am I looking at that the wrong way?

Since I have been given the option of investing pre-tax as a 401(k) or post-tax as a Roth, which is the best method? My husband and I are in the 25% tax bracket at the moment, if that makes any difference. I'm just overwhelmed all the way around.......",finance,1379602711

Last yr my loans defaulted for about 90 days. This reflected on my report so with some research I consolidated them. I agreed to pay 'base on my income' or IBR plan. After the default and preceding consolidation I was between jobs and couldn't pay anything so I went into forbearance which, unknowingly, capitalizes. On a loan totaling $40,000 bucks this was insane!!! With the consolidation and the forbearance I am now up to $45,000!!! :-( Now I have a new entry-level job making $35,000. Called FedLoan to make a payment and the lady told me it was time to renew my IBR plan which takes 3 months (this is where it gets weird) she insists I go into forbearance even though I assured her that I could pay the past IBR price. She says ""oh you can pay even in the forebearance state."" As a result of her persistence for forbearance, I say ok... Now my payments are going towards the compounding interest!! AHHH!!!

I want to buy a house after renting throughout college and thereafter (7yrs total). I know that I need to make regular payments on my loans to show good payment history.But with the default fresh on my record I was turned down for a home loan twice. Research suggests that it will fall off after 7yrs. But I can't wait that long to qualify for a house. Is there any way to get a mortgage sooner? and how? 

Extra info to help steer answers:
Itemized Expenses- Rent $400, Phone $100, car insurance $75, Food $100, misc $150, savings $100
I live with my Fiance' who takes care of everything else as long as I pay off my loans. Once I get it down to a manangable $10k we will set a wedding date. There is no option to get a house together before this. I want to be able to build equity for myself before marriage.

**tr;dl** - After my student loans defaulted last yr can I get a house? and how? While my IBR plan in being renewed is forbearance (which capitalizes) the best option for me? Can I get out of forbearance? how? How aggressive should I pay my loans back with a $35k job?

Please let me know if I need to clear things up or if there is any questions for me. Answer any part you like or all if you choose. I want to thank you all in advance for your time and answers! &lt;3

Edit: Thanks for the responses. I was framing this in context of the recent budget showdown in the US, so the Government shutdown would be temporary (I hope, similar to what happened under Clinton... the financial state of the country was stronger than it is now, so I was thinking the data from what happened then is somewhat less useful as an indicator of what would happen this time). Not talking about government collapse. 

Seeing that the government defaulting would be catastrophic to the entire world economy, and that the party threatening to not raise the debt ceiling is typically more pro-business/free market/whatever than the other, one would think that, in spite all of the blustering going on, that no one in congress would actually let us default (too much money at stake), and that the markets don't seem particularly concerned that would happen, at this point.

Consumer sentiment falder, en anden advarsel om økonomi?

Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan forbrugernes tillid til indeks er en vigtig indikator for forbrugerens opfattelse af den amerikanske økonomi. I lighed med andre foranstaltninger, forbrugernes tillid, det anmoder forbrugerne om deres syn på de nuværende økonomiske vilkår og deres forventninger til seks måneder ud. Det er en af de ældste forbrugerundersøgelser, oprindeligt startede i 1964.

Forbrug er den store drivkraft i den amerikanske økonomi og det tegner sig for 70% af BNP (bruttonationalproduktet). Forbrug har været relativt afdæmpet siden krisen begyndte, som amerikanerne har øget deres opsparing sats og bruges kun på essentials. Fast ejendom boble kørte forbrug i midten af ' 00s, da folk tog kontanter 
refinansierer og tilbragte den udpakkede friværdi. Dette øgede omkostningsgrundlag for mange folks hjem og forlod dem sårbare, når huspriserne brød sammen. Som et resultat, har de fokuseret mere på at betale ned gæld end om udgifterne.

Højdepunkter fra rapporten

Consumer Sentiment Index faldt til 76,8 i September, betydeligt fra sin postkrise post af 85,1 i juli. (Forbrugernes tillid i 1964 = 100.) Dette er den foreløbige September rapport, så det er underlagt revision ved udgangen af måneden.

Bloomberg undersøgelse konsensus var 82. De nuværende betingelser indeks faldt til 91,8 fra 95.2 og forventninger-indekset faldt så godt til 67.2 fra 73,7 sidste måned. Eftersom at en indeksværdi på 90 har været mere eller mindre gennemsnittet over de sidste 50 år, er forbrugertillid stadig til den svage side. Indekset kan variere meget: i januar 2000, det var 112, og i November 2008, det bund på 55.3.

En teori, der er blevet kastet ud er, at forbrugerne er begyndt at samle op på forbedring i markedet for fast ejendom, og der er drivkraften bag forbrugernes tillid. Som vi har set fra real estate indeks, medmindre du bor i San Francisco, Phoenix, Las Vegas eller et par andre steder, ikke har du virkelig oplevet en stor stigning i huspriser. Det kan være, at de overordnede tal er nok til at gøre folk føler sig bedre, selv om priserne ikke stiger, dramatisk hvor de lever. Når det er sagt, stigende renter kan være begyndt at dukke op i de økonomiske data. En række investeringsbanker har trimning deres Q3 BNP skøn. Fed har været konsekvent for optimistisk i sin økonomiske prognose for — som gør du spekulerer på, hvorfor de er så ivrig efter at begynde tilspidset.

economy,"Don’t know much about economics, can you help me understand or point me to a good article/book that explains Quantitative Easing and its effect on inflation?","First off, I make no claims to know anything about economics beyond a basic understanding of a supply and demand curve that I somehow retained from my freshman year economics class. But, I want to understand more. I got started down this path by trying to figure out what Quantitative Easing actually is. It’s always in the news and has an effect on financial markets whenever Mr. Bernanke talks about it. I decided I wanted to know more about it.


So, please correct me if I am wrong, but my current understanding is that QE is the process of the Federal Reserve taking money that it prints (don’t think they actually print physical dollars) and buying US Government bonds and other assets. However, the Federal Reserve does not buy these bonds and assets directly from the Government but from commercial banks. Now this is where I kind of hit a wall. Where and how are the banks getting these bonds and assets to sell? What are these ""other assets""? Who determines what the purchase price is? Does the Federal Reserve receive the interest on the bonds it purchases and, if so, what does it do with that money?


Finally my understanding is that the goal of all of this is to decrease yields and to increase the money supply. But what is the point of doing this? I know the end goal of QE is to increase employment but I don’t understand how buying bonds and assets is supposed to lead to that. 

Finally, I read a lot of articles of people claiming that QE is going to lead to crazy inflation because something called the monetary base is increasing exponentially. They point to [this graph](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BASE). So why hasn’t that happened if there is so much money now in circulation compared to a few years ago? Isn’t inflation really low right now compared to historical averages? 


If anyone has a good explanation I would really appreciate it but if you know of any good books or articles that explain the whole process pretty well please pass them along to me. Thanks all!",finance,1379571595

I graduated from college in May take home $4000/mo. When I started working, I used as much money as I could save to aggressively pay off my $3500 in CC debt. I have since been saving up an emergency fund and will have met my goal of $5000 by next paycheck. Now I need to decide which debt to hit hard next, and pay the minimum on the others. 

Here's the breakdown:

Auto loan: $9,740 -- 4.95%

Direct subsidized stafford 1: $2750 -- 3.4%

Direct subsidized stafford 2: $5500 -- 3.4%

Direct unsubsidized stafford: $2259 -- 6.8%

Federal stafford: $3500 -- 5.6%

Perkins: $2000 -- 5.0%

Owed to family member: $2000 -- 0.0%


My monthly expenses are ~$1500 (didn't include car payment- $194/mo or student loan payment in that). 


I have heard often to pay off the highest interest debt first and I understand the math behind this, but I was wondering if there were a reason to pay off the car first. All of the loans are in grace until November (unsub and stafford 1 are accruing interest already), so I am not sure what their monthly payment will be. I am not too familiar with the tax credit for paid student loan interest, but I guess that plays in to the decision as well. 


I have talked to my credit union and after I've owned the car 6 months (November 2013), I can refinance. I only quickly glanced at a table of rates they showed me and I should be able to qualify for 2.9-3.75% rate. I'm not sure of the exact rate and recall that my credit score was in their excellent range, but my DTI may increase the rate they can offer me.

We will pay them back on a schedule with interested above the federal rates.  Basically they are looking to make a little money on their savings before retirement and we have excellent credit, but it will take years for us to save 50k for downpayment.

I'm expecting to go to grad school in the next 1-2 years, so it seems like the consensus is mostly to keep it in a risk-free cash-type form. I'd like to be making the most of it in that time, though.  



Right now I have a Citibank account where most of it sits in a .05% money market account linked to my checking. I've been dithering for a while about opening up a savings account at Ally so it's at least losing less to inflation, but keeping my Citibank checking for ease of use and easy access to cash.   



But now, I've just stumbled across the existence of rewards checking accounts, and I'm wondering whether to go for that instead? Based on [this](http://www.depositaccounts.com/checking/reward-checking-accounts.html) link I've seen posted, Great Lakes Credit Union seems like my best bet, and the couple hundred extra dollars a year sounds significant to me (if probably not to the on-average much wealthier people in this sub.)   



But comments on [this](http://www.depositaccounts.com/blog/2013/03/update-on-great-lakes-credit-unions-reward-checking-account.html) article suggest that the rate will be dropping soon to be more similar to the others, and they'll have a $100 minimum spend? Light googling wasn't able to figure out where else this information is corroborated. 
So, to fulfill the requirements I'd have to do 


- $500 Direct deposit (Or ACH transfer?)  


- 10 Debit card purchases (Of at least $100 total?)  


- Billpay or mobile banking login (As obsessed as I am with PF right now, logging into my bank account does not really sound like much hassle)  



My Citibank account is still for some reason a student account 16 months after graduation, but assuming they eventually figure it out and I want to keep it as a safety blanket, I'll have to either keep 1500 in it or do direct deposit and a billpay through them. 



The main problems I see with GCLU are



- $500 is over my expected savings/month, although I'm unclear what would stop me from transferring  some of it right back


- 10 debit card purchases a month is actually a lot for me and so something I'd probably have to pay attention to - I think that's how much I average right now, but I'd have to break things down, meaning possibly more annoying trips. And my gut is sad about the lost cashback, although realistically $1.25 lost/month is nothing compared to the saving rate.


- If I at some point become less obsessed with PF, I run the risk of forgetting to jump through hoops and lose the higher interest rate and possibly get charged a $5 fee. 



(Currently I haven't gotten around to setting up direct deposit anywhere, so I'd have the option of feeding my paychecks to either or splitting between both, but I don't know how much hassle it is/how time consuming it is to transfer from a credit union.)




So, wrapping up an unnecessarily long post, should I 


a) Do nothing and keep everything at Citibank


b) Mollify my desire to earn (slightly) more money and just go with ally


c) Go through the hassle of a RCA and do GLCU even though it may be about to get worse


d) Go with a different less hassle RCA than GLCU on the assumption it may be about to get worse rates and I don't want to do the $100 minimum spend 


e) Options b-d plus getting rid of the Citibank accounts


f) Other

gaming,"Dear Rockstar, about the torture scene:","SPOILERS BELOW! (I also mention a spoiler in Breaking Bad - thats the one with spoiler tags!)

Hello,

I write to you as a big fan, and I request a few things from you here.

1) That you listen, and pass it on to the designers/writers of GTA V so they have an opportunity to read it.

2) A skip to the torture scene, which I will explain my reasoning for.

As a man who has played and enjoyed every GTA game available, except any Sony exclusives, and both Manhunt games - including many other very violent video games that focus on killing in grotesque ways, such as Harvest, Postal 1 and 2 - when I got to the torture scene, my heart dropped because I knew that I either wouldn't be able to play through it, and or couldn't enjoy the rest of the game. 

This is very interesting to me, and I don't think I am an isolated case. Why? 

When you presented the choice of torture tools, I realized what you were doing. You were going to force me to perform torture on an innocent man that would probably be well done in a pretty realistic way. As a mini game. The point of it likely being that torture is wrong - and you can get someone to say anything through torture. Meanwhile, Michael would be sent on wild goose chases because of this practice. 

The point is fair, and I understand your reasoning for presenting it in that way, I think, but it is a misunderstood way of communicating that idea. I will draw a parallel to the movie Funny Games. Funny Games, because it's a movie, unfortunately gets away with what you did with the torture scene. It has a sort of meta story to it, that is suppose to communicate how consumed by violence our modern societies are. As a movie it and the director behind it enjoy a sort of mysticism, an unspoken deeper meaning that nobody is obliged to formulate. (Haneke has expressed his intent as being a social commentary, a sort of jolt to the viewer, a provocation to thought, as I understand it.) In my opinion this is hypocracy. Put simply he is fighting fire with fire. I don't believe what was done with Funny Games was much more clever than that. And I was really disappointed by the torture scene for the same reasons. It's backwards, and it does me a big disservice.

For one, up untill then, I had understood Trevor as a psychopath consumed by hate, with no conscience. A personality feature that allows him to be ruthless in his criminal enterprises. I see his psychopathic personality a lot like Ice Mans, [the hit man that they probably based that hit man in Breaking Bad on, who Walt kills](/spoiler). That man would film people being killed by rats, for the pleasure of vengeful employers - and do all kinds of horrible things to his victims, and as he explains, would feel nothing for it. And through curiosity, just trying to elicit ANY kind of emotion, he would do increasingly grizzly things to people. The Ice Man killed for money, and often out of burning contempt, which could be sparked with little provocation. He infact did not kill because he enjoyed it. People who get pleasure from human suffering, would include serial killers and professional executioners of torture employed through war and intelligence gathering.

I don't think you meant to portray Trevor as a man who gains pleasure from human suffering. His constant bullying, the submissive character of his friends, his short fuse, all point to an Ice Man like person. I think that makes sense because in effect that was actually entertaining - a character who has no fear, is completely brazen in everything he does, and acts on every hateful impulse he gets. A totally crazy person, with a lot of power - a good fit for a GTA game. But not someone who fantasizes about raping and torturing women, for example. Why? Because that's just not very fun, is it? It doesn't really fulfill most peoples power fantasies. The torture scene in fact distorts his character, and somehow crosses a line into a completely unlikable character. I believe the crucial difference is the writers intent.

This is my personal, moral feeling anyway. At that point, I don't want to play him. Earlier in the game, when I was presented a drunk homosexual who wanted a ride home, and had the option of driving him to the Altruists, I began driving him out of town, because I thought that might be something Trevor would do - but it just seemed too much. A homosexual, who you can drive to his certain death in a very nefarious way... not exactly what I want to do in my GTA game. So I explained to myself that Trevor was just getting fed up with listening to him, and that took precedence over the money ot him, and he just left the guy out in the middle of nowhere. As you can hear, I enjoy actively  immersing myself in your well written characters.

Further, the torture scene presumes that I don't know how fucking terrible torture is. I really already do... So your point of making me perform it myself is completely lost on me. I am dumbfounded that you would try to put me through that to make your point, since there are so many ways to make that point that jive more with the overall theme of satire and silliness that is prevalent in your GTA games.

I turned off my xbox, and since yesterday have been debating with myself if I want to play through your torture scene to get to the rest of the game. It becomes a moral dilemma for me, because I think the approach is so hamfisted and misunderstood, at the expense of my overall feelings towards a game that I was otherwise really enjoying - and a company that I have always supported. When something that I feel is that plain stupid - im sorry to say so but that's how I feel - I feel the urge to move on to more clever things that have more to offer. I loose faith in your ability to entertain with substance.

Please implement the ability to jump to Michael during the torture scene. It only makes sense. I thought Trevor was going to use the torture tools on the asshole agent, which in my opinion would have been much more in line with his character - and be funny as well. And maybe I would have even done that! Depending on how it would have been portrayed. Because that would have made sense, as strange as that sounds. But in any event, the choice is crucial. 

I hope this has made it's way to someone with their hands in the creative process, and made some kind of sense to you.

Best regards,
Chow, 
(fan)

EDIT: mrcandyman: ""Trevor DOESN'T want to do it. It's not really evident from the get-go, but it is afterwards. Basically he knows he has to appease the FIB agents, so he does it. Also, it seems like the THREAT of the torture works as well. As in you can grab a tooth but not yank it out. You can spark the battery, but not use it. Do these things enough and it does appear to work, at least for me. I did do SOME torturing but not as much as I expected.""

This changes the scene for me, from being outright stupid, and a break of character, to more like Rockstar being Rockstar.... and gathering unnecessary hate from the media by holding their cards close to their chest, and choosing to not allow character swap.

I still think making it skipable would be the classy response to the media attention, some fans like me, and reactions like Amnesty's.

Last EDIT:

I played through the scene. Trying to do as little as possible, I had electricuted him, busted his knee and water boarded him, all the while the characters making satirical remarks. ""Look he's got a chubby."" ""I don't need a restart!"" And something about being a regular government employee.

I could tell that Rockstar hadn't gone all out on the acting, the edge was taken off - or not taken as far into reality in terms of the voice acting of the victim when he screams. However, the sound design overall made me feel really uneasy, and reminded me alot of Manhunt. I was meant to feel the weight of it, it's grimness, that was clear.

Afterwards when I'm driving him to the airport, Trevor claims that torture is his bag. But as some act of political activism tries to make him go tell the story of what happened. Which is pretty odd coming from a guy who just offed a trailer park full bikers because he suspected they might want to retaliate at a later time. Isn't Trevor worried that this will somehow implicate him, since he did the torture? He has been laying low for 10 years... In a manor of speaking ofcourse.

The man mentions several secret agencies, suggesting perhaps that he is infact a spy of some kind? And maybe the opperation actually offed a terrorist by chance?

Finally, I see in order to get a perfect score on the mission, I need to use all the given torture tools. How exactly does that tie into the whole commentary they are doing here?

I think it was an accurate discription that it missed the satirical mark, in this article: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/18/grand-theft-auto-5-under-fire-for-graphic-torture-scene And I stand by my post and the problematic nature of it. To my mind, it doesn't make a whole lotta sense on its own, and is a poorly constructed commentary on torture techniques to gather intelligence.",technology,1379679093
investing,So should I assume higher inflation is inevitable?,"I don't know much about monetary politics but it seems Bernanke doesn't even dare slow down QE, let alone reverse the policy and clean out the FED's balance sheet. Perhaps there isn't even a plausible alternative? I really wouldn't know.

Assuming however there is no lesser evil than this, then I feel the only solution left for the world's governments and central banks is to inflate away the debt. Plenty of people seem to predict much higher inflation anyway as a direct result of the current monetary policy.

So what is your average schmuch like me to do? I am 100% in cash. Sure I have already missed the big rise in stock prices, but then again I haven't lost anything in 2008 either.

Perhaps like an idiot, I never went to my bank to open some kind of roll-over account. 

So today I received 2 checks from the investment company. One check for the bulk of the invested money and then a tiny one labeled as ""trailing dividend.""

Both of these show that some withholdings were deducted for Michigan.

This is where things get tricky...I'm still in the process of getting a Californian drivers license (I took a severe paycut with my job here and I've been struggling a bit.)

Bitcoin,My (unique) experience with BFL,"My business relationship with Butterfly Labs permanently ended today, so I thought I'd break up the monotony of BFL refund advice and stories with the tale of a guy who bought from BFL and came out ahead in the end.

Okay, a lot of delays. But the product existed, and that's all that matterd to me. I thought on it for a week or two, then decided to go for it.

So I went back to the website intending to buy a Single, but while I was in indecision, pre-orders had started. It was August 8, and they said they'd be shipping by October 2012 (lol). I had to decide whether to get the Single right away, then do a trade-in later, or go straight for a pre-order of four Jalapenos. Both cost the same. I fully expected some delays on the ASICs, but fugued they'd be out the door by February 2013, if not sooner (lol). So I figured I'd be better off having an early place on the ASIC pre-order list than to get the FPGA, but be near the end of the trade-in list. Call it a dumb decision, but if I hadn't gone that way, none of the following would have happened.

Time passed. The day the Little Single was announced, I switched my order to that. More time passed. I read Jody's blog every day. I was there for every Two More Weeks that ever came out of BFL's urban farming mouthpiece. And then, one day, nearly a year after this story began, on June 12, 2013, as if by a miracle, there was an e-mail in my inbox that said my order had been shipped.

But it wasn't right. They shipped me four Jalapenos, but I had changed my order to a Little Single. Little Singles weren't even shipping yet. I sent them an email explaining what had happened and asking them what I should do. Two weeks went by without a response, and the package came. I sent them another email with an update, then proceeded to plug all my new gear in. One of them was defective and mined only 200 MH/s for some reason. But the other three got about 6 GH/s. I waited for a response to my emails, and mined. 

Weeks passed. Little Singles started shipping. I started phoning the office. I don't know what the deal is with their phones, but I only got voicemail (which they don't seem to check), until one day I discovered that if you phone them 3-5 times in rapid succession, you get through to someone. I told him my story. He said he'd look into it and get back to me later that day. I waited a week, then called back. He said that I could either ship back the defective one, and they'd send me three more Jalapenos, or I could ship back all four and they'd give me my Little Single. I asked how I'd be compensated for shipping. He said that I wouldn't be. I informed him that he was full of shit. He said he'd send me a fedex label. That afternoon, for the first time, possibly ever, Butterfly Labs followed through on a promise.

I waited two days, mined my eighth bitcoin, then shipped my gear back. They sent me my Little Single, I plugged it in, and that should have been the end of the story. At that point, I considered myself to have come out even. I had to stop mining for two weeks to do a product trade, but on the other hand, I started mining -albeit at a lower hash rate - sooner than I otherwise would have.

But then, two weeks ago... Remember those emails I sent back at the *end of June*? Well, Jody replied to the second one. Sorry about the mix-up, she said. Hope it's all right with you if we send you two extra Jalapenos, so that you needn't ship anything back. She wan't aware that the case had been resolved over the phone.

So what would you do in this situation? Yeah, I took 'em. They arrived today and are happily hashing away over in my little bookshelf bitcoin farm. As of now, I have 2.2x my original investment (including shipping and customs fees) in bitcoin, and I feel like a winner. I decided Butterfly Labs doesn't deserve the honesty I would probably have extended to most any other company. 

So yeah, that's the long-winded story of how I profited from BFL's incompetence. Hope you enjoyed.",cryptocurrency,1379651719

investing,Long term portfolio check up,"Hi /r/investing,

I am here for a portfolio checkup. I am a young investor very much in the accumulation phase. One year ago I decided to adhere to the [Boglehead investment philosophy](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy) and other ideas I learned in this community and others. I welcome any kind of question, comment, or suggestion. I have some questions below.

----------------------------------------------

Emergency funds: 6 Months living expenses

Debt: None


Tax Filing Status: Single

Tax Rate: 25% Federal, 9.3% State 

State of Residence: California

Age: 25

Desired Asset allocation: 90% stocks / 10% bonds

Desired International allocation: 33% of stocks

--------------------------------------------------------------


Mid-High five-figures (~$80k)

53% in taxable account at Vanguard

30% in traditional 401k (contains vanguard and other index funds at very low expense ratio)

17% in Roth IRA at vanguard


-------------------------------------------------------

37% TSM

23% Total International Index

15% Small Cap Value Index

10% Vanguard Long term Government Bond 

4% Large Value Index

4% Small Cap Index

3% International Dividend Achiever ETF (0.56% ER)

2% Emerging Market Index

2% International REIT (0.37% ER)


-----------------------------------

For simplicity, I take advantage of the auto rebalance features of my 401k. I allocate 5% of 401k paycheck contributions to emerging markets and international REIT funds but I do not own any in my IRA or taxable. I also use a 4 fund small value tilt in my 401k that auto rebalances quarterly but in my Vanguard account I tilt with just Small-cap value + TSM. The International Dividend appreciation etf is a holdover from an inheritance that has grown for quite some time. I don't hold a domestic REIT fund because I am tilting to Small Value which as more real estate than TSM.

My bond portfolio is entirely long government bonds because the role of bonds in my portfolio is to protect against the risks of owning an almost entirely equity portfolio (90/10). At this stage in my life a low/negatively correlating asset (with cashflow and positive nominal returns) like Treasury Bonds are better than a stable value fund. There is some good data and discussion about this topic in [this Boglehead thread on treasuries](http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2409&amp;mrr=1265740503). Treasury bonds protect against deflationary crises that young people are especially hurt by. [This thread from the M* Diehards forum](http://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/forums/t/183963.aspx) contains correspondence between a Boglehead and David Swenson, who said ""The purity of noncallable, long-term, default-free Treasury bonds provides the most powerful diversification to investor portfolios.""

My investment policy is to keep a 60/30/10 domestic/international/bond allocation and stay the course!!. Going for rougly age-15 in bonds. As bond allocation increases, start adding Intermediate Government Bonds, and eventually Total Bond Market. I believe TBM is appropriate for a 60/40 portfolio but longer term, higher quality bonds are more appropriate in a 90/10 portfolio.

How badly am I hurting myself for not holding these in the most tax-efficient manner? It saves me a lot of rebalancing complexity to be able to take advantage of auto rebalance features in my 401k, which contains many funds. However in my Vanguard account I only have 4 funds (TSM, Total International, Small Cap Value Index, and my bond fund). I do not hold all my bonds in tax advantaged accounts but treasuries are exempt from state tax and I am in a high income tax state.

Again I welcome any kind of question, comment, or suggestion. Thanks!",finance,1379636866

I haven't contributed my limit of 5500 to the bank this year and they asked me if I would like to. I believe I should but need a second opinion since interest rates are very low right now.

Since 2009, I have contributed around 25K into the account at the highest risk, lots of fluctuation, but I I'm leaving it in there for at least another 10 years. All of the funds are in the Canadian Dividend, which are all invested into the top 6 banks. Currently, the account is under the principle amount, sitting at 24 000, which means that I've lost money. I also have a high risk retirement fund which is also in the same plan but I only put $30 a month into it and it's currently sitting at $1500.

A bit about me. I'm 22, No kids, and work for $25/hour full time. I live with my parents so all my expenses are around $300 a month. I make $4K a month before taxes and 3K afterwards.

personalfinance,Change credit card limits prior to applying for mortgage?,"Is it worth lowering my credit card limits to increase the amount of mortgage I could qualify for?

I have 5 cards with a combined available credit of about $130k. Their balances are $0 - and will stay that way for the foreseeable future.

Let's say I'd qualify for a $350k mortgage. But because I already have $130k in available credit, the bank only wants to give me $200k. But if I lower the limits on my credit cards to $10k - then my utilization goes up (I also have car and student loans) and my credit score will go down. As a result, I may again only qualify for $200k, and my interest rates may be higher as well, correct?

How do I determine if lowering my credit card limits helps or hurts me?

personalfinance,"Just starting my career, want to save for a house, but have questions about mortgage qualifications","My situation is thus: last year I started into what I hope will be a long term career, and I'm making just a smidge under $70k a year pretax.  My wife just finished grad school, and while her job search has been difficult so far I would be surprised if she doesn't get a job pulling in $40-50k within the next year.  My financial house is relatively well in order; 401k contributions up to the company match, student loan debt paid nearly off with the help of parents, and just a car payment in terms of outstanding debt.  My wife's situation is a bit rockier; between undergrad and grad school, she has a little under $100k of student loans.  We're managing to pay those down, afford the essentials, and still have a little in savings at the end of the month on my salary alone.

After taking a financial planning workshop on homebuying through my workplace and doing some market research, we've decided that we would like to start saving up for a home.  Through our credit union, we would probably be able to get a mortgage with no private mortgage insurance with a 10% down payment.  A nice cozy starter home would probably run us in the 150K range, and we're aiming to have the down payment within the next 2 years.  We could scrimp that much together in that time frame even if my wife doesn't get a job, or is only working part time.  We both have reasonably good credit according to our last credit reports.

Here's where the problem comes in, though.  According to the workshop we attended, to qualify for a mortgage with most lenders the payment has to be below a certain % of your monthly income, and below a higher % when factored in with other outstanding debts.  The numbers they used in the workshop were 24%/36% respectively, which seemed quite low to me.  As it stands, my wife's student loans take up nearly 40% of our monthly income (more than rent and utilities).  I guess what I'm asking is, would we have a snowball's chance in hell of qualifying for a mortgage, even if the monthly rate were equivalent to what we pay now in rent?  If we wouldn't qualify, would we be better off putting together a larger down-payment, or paying off some of the student loans to make us look more attractive to lending agencies?  Would it be possible for me to apply on my own, and would it increase our chances?  Obviously my wife getting a job would increase our likelihood of being approved, but would it be enough given our salary estimates?

While most things in life are looking pretty spectacular right now, I've got a sinking feeling we won't be able to snag a house before interest rates and housing prices start to start ratcheting up again.  Any advice would be much appreciated.",finance,1379737569

What would happen if the Fed keeps hinting that they'll ease of QE3 but they keep postponing it because they don't see the economic measures as robust as they want?

I have a take home (not including 401k or health insurance) of $3150 a month. I am living in the cheapest apartment where I feel safe. It is $900/month. My utilities are minimal. I have $2000 of emergency money right now, with that growing at $1125 a month.  I have only been working a short time, and I had to buy a lot of appliances/furniture. My coworkers are trying to convince me to get a $180k house, which I told them hell no.  They insist on a mortgage that is available here for zero down, closing costs rolled into the loan. Still said hell no. 

I did find a condo closer to work, though, that is $78k that would reduce my gas bill significantly. I do not want to buy it now. I want to wait until I have at least 8k in my emergency fund.  But I hate the idea of going into debt. The taxes here only start after the first 100k of worth, so no property tax. PMI is small on that small of a place. Insurance is cheaper for it, too. I would be looking at $750-$850 a month all included (HOA, mortgage, PMI) depending on what happens to interest rates/if price goes up over the next 6 months. 

I really hate debt. I graduated college debt free because I work two jobs all the time. I hate the idea of getting a huge debt. But the payments are smaller, which means I could pocket the difference incase something were to break. I have my own appliances, so that isn't an issue. 

I have a stable job right now (possibly getting a promotion next month) but who knows how stable things ever are. For all I know, the company could go under suddenly and I have a huge debt I can never pay off. 

My skills are very marketable, and I was lucky enough to pick from my offers, but none of those other offers were in this region of the country. I have no idea if my skills would be marketable here. I need to do more research on that. 

I expect to be living in this area for at least 4 years before the company moves me. It is a company that values movement and diversity of employees. If they moved me and I couldn't sell it within three months, they would buy it from me for an average of three appraisals. 

Also, my friend down here just bought a new car and a $140k house. I am not that kind of person. I have a paid for car and no debt. Any advice for how I can keep her from buying more stuff?  I know she has no emergency fund or savings.

 - My employer matches 7%

 - I put another $400 / month into mutual funds (did my homework on these, no load)

investing,textbook for starting from the ground up,"Can anybody recommend me a book or series of books that really explain investing from the ground up? I've gotten some other books that were recommended to me as ""beginner investor"" books and I really liked them, although at many points the topics just went over my head. I feel like I need to get a much deeper understanding of the basics before going back to re-read those books or learn more advanced things.


I know the basic things like what stocks/bonds are, the difference between ETFs and mutual funds, basic options and futures, etc. but for our purposes lets pretend I don't know anything. I don't mind re-learning those just in case I missed something important about them them. However, I don't know more complicated things like why quantitative easing decreases interest rates, and how corporate or junk bonds function. I've heard the word derivatives thrown around a lot, but I'm still not sure exactly what they are and how they come to be. I'm also very curious about the law behind a lot of these things, and why some are legal and some aren't and how they all fit into the big picture. Things like macro econ and micro econ have come up, but I don't really know about them either. I also have other questions like what are the basic tools to analyze financial statements like PEG or market cap. I just have so many questions to ask, and don't know where to start!


So, are there a couple textbooks that would allow me to get from complete noob to intermediate investing knowledge (like if I were thrown into a conversation with financial gurus I would at least know what they're talking about, regardless if I actually were smart enough to contribute)? I have read some books like ""taming the beast"" and ""the physics of wall street"" and frequently use Investopedia to research things I don't know, but I just feel like that's reactive learning, not really structured learning.


I want to really have a good understanding of the whole picture and how all the little pieces fall together before I go off to start reading advanced books and articles and eventually get myself into the investing game.


Also, just for reference I'm a 20 year old student who has approx $30k in capital from working jobs and savings, and have about $7k invested into a target-retirement fund with vanguard, and some $3k in other miscellaneous ETFs and mutual funds.

I make no secret of my views on consumer spending and unnecessary luxury. I feel like we know the secret to financial happiness and I have a tough time not distributing unsolicited PF advice to friends and family. 

My friend and her partner have been pretty broke most of the time I've known them. They're in their late 20's like us and own a home in a low-income neighborhood, not a bad neighborhood though. They each make about $30k/yr, drive 72-month-financed cars from 2006, and struggle when unexpected bills crop up. They tend toward I-Can-Afford-The-Payments-So-I-Can-Afford-It-Thinking, but they're gettin' by. 

Fortune favors them, though. She just got a promotion and will now make about $45k. He is in the final stages of getting a new job that will pay close to $100k. I'm almost as excited for them as they are for themselves. 

In past casual discussions I've talked about how important it is to save for near, mid, and long-term goals. They said they get it but didn't have the money at the end of the month. Not wishing to make a big deal of it I dropped the subject.

Now I'm a bit worried though. In her head they money's all spent. Last we talked she wanted two new cars immediately, a big house in the 'burbs in two years, a fancy vacation that's already ready to book, furniture, electronics, the works. I tried to explain that, while huge, this increase in household income is not infinite. Taxes (federal, state, and city) will eat more than 30% of the increase right off the bat. I tried to explain that this is a tremendous opportunity to get on the right track instead of being a debt-loaded wage slave for 40 more years. If mishandled she'll be where she is now, fretting over an unexpected expense, but the numbers will be larger.

I want to help them see the light and not be a dick, a tough order, I know.  I know it's none of my business but I can see where this is going and I'd feel terrible if I did nothing while they make the kind of mistakes that grace this sub everyday.

My girlfriend tends to lurk a lot on this subreddit and suggested I posted my loan situation up here to get your advice.  Thank you ahead of time.  This post is a bit long, but I'd really appreciate if you guys would take a look.  

I have both federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans along with two Sallie Mae loans.  One of those is parent cosigned and the other is parent plus ( I know that this second one is strictly under their names, but I'd like to include it in my debt as well.)

Here are a list of the federal loans, and their minimum monthly payments as of now.  I assume they'll be slightly higher than this when the deferment period ends.  I technically graduated in August, though I only took one class this summer, so I'm not sure how those periods typically work.

Great Lakes-Owned Federal Loans:

1. $7,009.60 
     Principal:
      Subsidized: $4,500 (5.6% Interest)
      Unsubsidized: $2,000 (6.8%)

2.  $21,143.34
      Principal:
       Subsidized: $3,299 (3.4%)
       Unsubsidized: $15,701 (6.8%)

3.  $6,148.72
      Principal:
       Subsidized: $3,500 (6.0%)
       Unsubsidized: $2,000 (6.8%)

Unfortunately, I can't get to the info for my Sallie Mae loans because as I said they're under my parents.  They are still under their bankruptcy term which happened sometime around 2009-2010.  I think that's five years.

I think I have between $40-50,000 from Sallie Mae.  I'm not sure of the interest rate on those, but I think it was somewhere between 7% and 9%.

My girlfriend and I are trying to plan to move out together, but we're both terrified over this debt.  I don't want her to have to pay for my mistake of going to an expensive college (2 years and then I went to the state schools when the debt factor really sunk in).  She's been out of school for about a year now, and as I said, I graduated in August.  We live in Maryland right between Baltimore and DC.

I really just don't know what to do.  While I don't have a payment, I'm trying to build a savings account up to around $10,000, and then put the rest of the money to start paying down the loans.

My current plan is to pay the minimum on the federal ones (about $450) when the time comes and then start directing the extra money I can afford for them to the one with the highest interest.  If it was just the federal, I don't think it would be much of a problem, but I eventually do have the Sallie Mae ones to worry about too even if that may be 2 years away.

What can I do in this situation?  I really could use any advice you could give me.  I refuse to see this as a hopeless situation, and I also don't want to be paying this for the rest of my life.  I don't want my girlfriend to have to suffer so much because of an 18 year-old boy's rashness.

Thank you again and have a wonderful night!",finance,1379823489

personalfinance,"Wannabe homeowner here, what non-obvious things to get best deal on mortgage?","So my wife and I would like to buy a house.  We're sick of renting, and at 28 I think I'm getting too old to not be building equity.  Edit: We think we're going to stay in this area for a while.  I've been at my current job for 5 years and my wife's job prospects look good in the surrounding area when she graduates.

I'm suspicious of banks in general and don't want to get screwed (or at least, get as minimally screwed as I can getting a mortgage).  So I don't just want to go to my bank and apply for a mortgage without shopping around a lot.

A friend of mine that bought a house a couple years ago says to go talk to a local mortgage broker, but I want to know if thats a good plan to trust the local guys or if the internet offers potentially better deals.

Some info about our situation:
My wife and I are both 28, married 3 years.  We have minimal savings ($&lt;2000) as I've been trying very hard to pay off my student loans to free up an extra $150/mo (Went from original 17k to under 10k and will be paid off by or before Feb 2014 at the rate I've been throwing money at it).  My credit score is in the high 600's and my parents have offered to cosign for the mortgage to help us out (My parents house is paid for, credit is strong and their combined income is ~$135k).  I'm hoping that the payoff on my student loan will help push my score over 700.  My wife's score is in the low 500's as last I checked thanks to a delinquent account that is in repayment.  The homes I have been considering run anywhere from $80-130k to get in the area I would like to live.  I work full time and bring home 36k/yr salary but expecting a raise this fall plus another 5-10k a year in side work, my wife is a full-time student with about 60k in mostly federal student loans (in deferment so long as she's in school) and works part time during the summer and winter break so all my budgeting is done around my income and not expecting or depending on any of hers.  I have 3 credit cards with 3300 combined limit that I have carried some balance in the last couple months in order to throw as much money as possible at my student loan debt, but prior to my determination to pay off the student loan they were paid off every month.  We live in central Iowa and I currently have bank accounts with USAA and USBank and credit cards with USAA and Capital One.

I'm a very DIY guy and have my own tools (job is a maintenance mechanic) so a fixxer-upper is not out of the question but the town we want to live in has a large college and very high home values even for pretty decrepit buildings or bare land.

I'm not wanting nor ready to buy tomorrow, but I would like any relevant advice for selecting a mortgage broker or company.  I'm hoping to purchase a house before my wife graduates so we can put our combined incomes towards paying her student loans off completely before having any kids.

I do have some saleable assets (vehicles) that total maybe 7-8 grand that I planned to liquidate to come up with as big a down payment as possible for a house once the student loan is paid off, as mentioned above this will be no later than feb 2014..  I figure if I sell them now I'll put them towards the loan and have nothing to sell and not much saved.

Bitcoin,Asked Sr. Director Brian Bieron of eBay About Bitcoin at LPAC2013,"His bio [here](http://www.netcaucus.org/biography/brian-bieron.shtml).

Brian was speaking at LPAC 2013 about the *Internet Tax Mandate*.

A few interesting points on this:

1. This law would grant federal, local, and state IRS's the ability to pursue out of state customers for tax obligations.

2. This would likely end up being used as a *catch-all* for the government to find a reason to go after you for something (they have all your info and purchases, so they can do this).

3. This could also be used as a way to punish businesses that pack up and move to another state, taking their tax dollars with them, i.e. gun manufacturers that left their home states after new gun laws were passed.

4. Amazon was against this, until they changed their business model to a Wal-Mart style local distribution center model. Now Amazon is lobbying for this law because they know it will screw their competitor, eBay, more than themselves.

What is interesting about this:

1. I think Bitcoin and virtual currencies will ultimately end up tied to this issue, whether we like it or not.

2. Here is an interesting case where a major corporation may end up on *our side* of the issue. eBay has a mutual interest in protecting their business, and that of their customers. Bitcoin adoption would make sense for them, and could invigorate their business model.

Now to my question for him:

I caught him after his speech and hit him with the question as to whether eBay was planning to adopt it at some point.

He said he hadn't heard anything definite on the eBay side, but that the Paypal branch of the company is  examining it *thoroughly* and they have ""some kind of plans"" for it at some point.

He admitted he was not very well-versed in the *mechanics* of it. He commented that he understood it as ""*basically like digital gold*""

He mentioned that his son talks about it and has some.

Anyway, not any giant revelations here, I admit, but it is worth noting that corporations are *definitely* taking notice, even at the senior level.

Perhaps we have a future ally in eBay.

personalfinance,Collections attempt but I disagree I owe the amount they state.,"Long story short. 

Rented an apartment, then moved out. I was away on business and couldn't be there for the after move out inspection. I took a video of the apartment before leaving. 

Received an email and call from the apartment stating $200 in damages for the walls requiring paint. In no way were the walls damaged or scuffed enough to require that amount of money to paint/repair. My entire deposit was taken up by my water bill and pre paid cleaning fees I agreed to pay. So they were asking for another $200 in addition to my deposit.

I told them I didn't agree I owed that much, they then sent some very fuzzy pictures that show absolutely nothing besides a couple nail holes. I told them I still don't agree I owe them that amount and they said they would send the amount to collections.

A few weeks later I receive a collections notice. I followed the recommended path of sending a debt validation letter. They responded with all of the information the apartment had originally. I have been to claims court before so I have no issue with that, the question is how do I phrase the response to the debt collector that even though they have the information from the apartment, i still disagree it is valid? 

Something like ""I see you have all of the information the apartment originally provided me with, however I still disagree the debt is a valid one. As the amount requested by the apartment complex was to high for the listed items.""",finance,1379971404

personalfinance,Looking for some advice on re-distributing my 401K investments and whether I should be doing more.,"So I'm currently 24 years old and work in consulting in the Bay Area. Not many expenses since I live at home with my parents. I'm planning on saving for graduate school in the near future and if possible, wish to set aside some income for spending. Graduate school is probably a year out.

I'm currently maxing my 401K (have about 38K in there), have about 9K sitting in IRA, and the rest is going into a checking. I'll need to double check the IRA part.

When I first chose the investment %'s for my 401K, I distributed all of it into Pimco Stable Valued, Pimco Total Return and Vanguard Inflation Protected Securities. This was more done out of ignorance and no real planning.

Returns were not too great and over the last year I actually saw a negative return. Last week, I decided to move my 401K into stocks/growth: Vanguard Institutional Index (S&amp;P500), Vanguard midcap and Vanguard smallcap.

Again, this was done after looking at the overall performance of these funds over different time scales. They had better returns than the Pimco funds. 

Questions:

1. What factors, news should I weigh when allocating my 401K investments. I'm aware that the Fed's announcement of pushing back tapering may adversely affect the market (if it isn't already being reflected in the market). Should I move my investments back into stabler vehicles until this blows past? Is it too risky for me to put all my money into stocks/growth? How do I measure the level of risk I'm being exposed to right now?

2. What else should I be doing with my income?

economy,Series EE saving bond question.,"I am a little confused right now. I own four Series EE saving bonds in denominations of $1,000 bought in the year 1996 month of September. According to the bond calculator the bond was bought for $500 and has earned $500 interest. The interest rate according to the calculator is .65% it says. These bonds are older than 17 years, therefore did they go into an extension period for bonds?  So in this extension period. Is the rate set differently every 6 month now? I know the fed is keeping rates at record lows hence the .65%. Should i just sell these things? Or if interest rates skyrocket will my bonds skyrocket and adjust with those rates? I'm really confused about this paragraph. EE Bonds issued May 1995 – April 1997:  Interest rate

For six-month rate periods that start during the time period from May 1, 2013 through October 31, 2013, the annual interest rate that applies to EE Bonds with issue dates from May 1995 through April 1997 is 0. 65%.

EE Bonds issued from May 1995 through April 1997 earn a variable rate of interest. Treasury determines the rate each May 1 and November 1 and applies that rate for the next six months.

The rate that applies to a particular EE Bond with an issue date from May 1995 through April 1997 changes on the 6th and 12th month anniversaries of that bond's issue date. For example, for an EE Bond with an issue date of October 1996, a rate change announced in May takes effect on the following October 1 and a rate change announced in November takes effect on the following April 1.

personalfinance,Front-loading a 401(k)?,"This is more for curiosity than anything else. I'm 25 years old, just started a job with benefits, including a 401(k). I'm not really in a position to contribute a ton to it—or so I think—but I was just learning more about the way it all works (I'm reasonably bright, but personal finance is *not* my strong suit), and something occurred to me: While I'm young and have time, energy, and no family to support, would it theoretically be beneficial to contribute massive amounts to my 401(k) with this job, and if needed take a second, part-time job to bring in a source of income that keeps me afloat and adds to my rainy-day fund?

The maximum annual contribution right now is $17,500, which would be more than half of my income from this new job (I didn't say it paid great…). On the surface I know it doesn't make sense to throw all of that into a fund meant for retirement, which is why I'm asking this more to satisfy my curiosity than anything else. If in theory I did put in the $17,500 every year for five years, and lived frugally on the meager remains of my income and/or my second job, by the time I'm 30 there would be $87,500 in the 401(k), even before any interest caused it to grow. At 5% annual growth, let's say that is about $100,000 at the time. So, $100,000 is sitting in my 401(k) and ready to collect interest for the next 30 years, and I don't have to contribute anything to it anymore for it to substantially grow over that time period—it would be at least $300k by the time I'm 60, if it grew at a modest interest rate.

To me, that makes a lot more sense than contributing small amounts right now and increasing the contribution amount over time. What good is it to contribute $10,000 a year when you are 50 years old and can finally afford to do so, when that $10,000 a year is only going to be growing for 10 years (assuming you cash out when you can)? Yes, you're hopefully in a position to be able to contribute that much at that age, but in theory you were much better off making those huge contributions 20 years earlier if you could. Most would say that they couldn't afford massive contributions like that in their 20s, but in reality you'd be paying the same amount, just with a displaced frame of when it occurs in your life… In other words, if I maxed out my contributions for the rest of my 20s, it will delay me from being able to afford a house and start a family, and set me back to the point where I'll financially be at a place at age 50 where I could have been at age 45 if I hadn't lived so income-less those five years, but the difference now is that I paid in and invested early, and that five years of delayed financial progress is going to pay off huge dividends compared to if I had just played the ""slow and steady"" game consistently throughout my working life.

So, what are the reasons I *shouldn't* max out the $17,500 contribution right now and take a part-time second job to afford living and saving for an emergency? I can always wait a little longer to buy a house or a new car or start a family, but I'll never get back the time lost that could have otherwise been used to facilitate compound interest growth. But again, finances are not my bread and butter, so I'm sure I could be missing something obvious. What do you think?",finance,1379996078

2. I've been thinking about opening a brokerage account to do some long-term stock investing (&lt; $1k) in both domestic and foreign stocks (maybe ADR). Any opinions on this, and in particular regarding Scottrade as a broker? Or should I open another brokerage account in the UK for foreign stocks (not familiar with US tax implications)?
3. I have a UK account that I don't know what to do with. Should I just leave it, or move the funds to the US, taking into account forex risk?

- I don't owe anything on student loans until fall of 2014. (total I owe is around $9,000)
- Although it exists, my retirement plan is pitiful thus far.

My plan was to keep making payments on the car note since it's such a low interest rate.  Take $5,500 and max out a brand new Roth IRA since my retirement funds could use a major shoring.  Take the remaining $2,500 and throw some at the idle student loans.

I've been looking for alternatives through my bank, but for student loans they can't do a damn thing for some reason. Then I stumbled on [custudentloans.org](http://www.custudentloans.org/), I've heard great things about credit unions. So I went through the application process requesting an amount equivalent to just take care of the two Smart Student Loans, reconsolidate them together and hope for an interest rate around 6 to 7%. So I wrap up the application, but there is an interesting note in this summary PDF that says my starting variable rate will be in-between 4.25% and 7.03%, but every three months my rate changes based on the Wall Street Journal Libor Rate and that my rate will never extend above 18%. 

So my questions are:

Has anyone ever used this site before?

What is the Libor Rate and how much is a usual 3 month fluctuation?

The only credit unions the site offered me are not in the state I live in, has anyone had any experience with [Andrew Federal Credit Union](https://www.andrewsfcu.org/)?

I'll be netting around $1,000 a month extra.  On my current budget I'm sure I could trim some fat, but my main goal right now is to not let much of that $1,000 extra get used irresponsibly by me.  I want to ""assign"" those dollars before I get a chance to waste them.  Here's my current financial picture:

**Immediate situation**

My current job is going to withhold my entire final paycheck and PTO payout because I am leaving within 12 months of using their tuition assistance program.  Even after that I will still owe them $1,500.  The new job won't give me my first paycheck until November.  I also am in the middle of some housework that I have to pay for.  In short, I expect to *get by* until November, but I'll basically be starting from financial scratch.  Probably under $500 in an emergency fund by the end of the month.  This sucks, but at the same time it's kind of what my emergency fund was for, so I guess it's okay.

**Financial Profile**

* 45K Mortgage (4%)
* 60K Federal Student Loans (2.5% to 6.8%)
* 4.5K Private Student Loan (8.5%)
* 15K 403(b)
* &lt; 1K in a 401(k)
* no other debt

There's 3 ways that I'd like to use the extra money I'll be making.  I'm not sure how to divvy up the money between these categories, though.

* **Retirement** -- Obviously I need to roll over my old 401K and 403b.  My new employer does not offer matching funds.  Should I even bother with the new employer's 403b before my debt is paid off?  It seems like the tax advantages are good, so I should...but I'm not sure how much to contribute since every dollar contributed is a dollar that doesn't go towards paying off debt.

* **Paying off debt** -- I'm thinking of automatically depositing $500 or so into a separate account each month, and every few months raiding that to pay off my student loans in a debt avalanche.

* **Fixing up the house** -- As you probably noticed, I have a very cheap house.  It's a bit of a fixer upper.  Some things can wait, some can't, and some things are in between.  Honestly I have no idea how to prioritize this in my budget properly.

I am canadian and recently invested in NCT (NYSE) does senior housing, D.UN (TSE) does a variety of corporate and residential and have a standing buy order for MRG.UN (TSE) similar, corporate and res, I live in a morguard building myself and even with all the little things that are shitty about this place, the turnover rate is extremely low and the rent is quite high.

Given the fluctuation in interest rates, these are one of the only things in the market (besides precious metals) at 52 week lows and I think some time over the next few months (including right now) we will see a significant opportunity to add passive income to your portfolio.

Reits are like the stock equivelant to owning and operating a rental building, without the hastle of tenants. 

Right now the price to earnings and the debt/equity ratios for a lot of the reits I've looked at is VERY favorable and I would recommend to anyone that they make contributions now and perhaps keep some cash to average down in the near future.

I'm not saying REITS are at the bottom, I think they still have a little room to fall, but the rental markets (at least where I live) are very popular as people fear entering the housing market even in a fairly low interest rate environment.

&gt; Minimum Payment: $353
&gt;
&gt; Current Payment: $360

As you can see, I'm paying more than the minimum but not by too much. Basically just rounding it up a bit.

I just bought the car recently and I'm not concerned about those payments or the expenses associated with it. I'm most concerned about abolishing my student debt as quickly as possible.

My first thought was that if I try pay $1,000 every month into my Private Student Loan, I can bring the payoff date down to early 2015 at the latest. This is my highest interest loan by close to double, so getting rid of it would make the most sense.

From there, I would then pay $500/mo. to my Federal Direct Loan to try and pay it off as soon as possible.

My question is: is there a better plan? 

Should I be paying this monthly, or saving all my money to hopefully have larger payoffs--that way I can have a large emergency fund just in case?

Instead of doing $1,000/mo. extra in one loan, does it make sense to split that between multiple loans?

In my situation, I'm living very comfortably and have a stable job. Is it worth it to get a side job or do some side work to pay off the loan earlier, or am I just being more worried about my debts than I should be?

personalfinance,"Consolidation, then PAYE + PSLF: Success? Critique my plan, please","Current situation: I have subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford Federal loans, both eligible for Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE, similar to IBR but 10%, not 15% of income) and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). I also have a ""Loan for Disadvantaged Students"" , a federal loan that I am considering consolidating, albeit at a higher interest rate (5%-&gt;6.8%, plus losing my deferment benefits).

Here is my plan: Consolidate my Disadvantaged Student loan into my Stafford loans asap. I'm not sure how long this will take, I've heard anywhere from 2 months to 6 months, I would like to have it lined up before my Stafford loans start requiring payment (January). Then, I will apply for the Pay-as-you-earn program for all three loans, work for 10 years at a eligible nonprofit, and get the remainder forgiven at the end. Success?

Questions: Am I making a huge mistake consolidating several months before my grace period ends on the Disadvantaged Student Loan? I'm also jumping up from 5% to 6.8% interest on it by consolidating, but the forgiveness should more then make up for that based on my rough calculations. I could simply consolidate closer to the end of my grace period, but by then my other loans would already start requiring payments and those months of payments wouldn't count towards my 10 years under PSLF if I consolidated.
Finally, has anyone else applied for Pay As You Earn? Just wondering how long that will take.

personalfinance,"Interest rates are hiking - is it going to sink us? (30m+32f,NZ)","So we had a bit of a good run with my mortgage, when we first bought our house we got a loan off my parents trust(basically because they could use their house, worth in excess of 900k, 1m even, as collateral to get a smallish overdraft at a very good rate, 250k-ish, plus some of their cash, 100k-ish along with our deposit 130k-ish and got our house at 480k. this was in 2011. earlier this year they wanted to help my sister as well, so i offered to refinance with a proper bank in our own name. based on my income at the time 57.5k(wife is not working) the bank will only give me 300k, so i took that as a mortgage. i still own my parents about 26k but seeing as they have that much in cash anyways its somewhere in between an interest free loan and a gift. i doubt we would need to pay that back at any stage anyways.

we fixed our mortgage of 300k earlier this year (april), interest rates were pretty rock bottom. we fixed 140k at 12 months at 5.15%, 140k at 24 months at 5.25% and the last 20k as a revolving at market minus 0.1% (something like 5.35% when we started). the two fixed parts are interest only, we make repayments through the revolving part.

2 months ago i got a new job, bumping my pay to 85k. right now (end of september) we now owe about 10k on the revolving, so by my forecast we are on track to have paid off the 20k by april next year, when the first 140k comes off fixed. i was hoping for interest rates to stay low-ish until then but it doesnt look likely now when a 24months fixed is more like 5.7%, so it could very well become 6.0% by the time comes for us to refix. 

so yeah anyone got any clever suggestions as to what i could do to mitigate this situation?

at the moment my budget per month is:

take home pay : 4500 (this is after tax deduction, student loan repayment deductions, retirement scheme deductions)

mortgage(fixed) : ~700 and ~690 respectively

mortgage(unfixed) : ~60-70

creditcards : 1000 (i basically use creditcard as a debit card and i put EVERYTHING i can on it, petrol, groceries, utilities, insurance. i am current and up to date on payments. i basically use it for the rewards, about $200 cashback each year)

personalfinance,Need some advice for a friend who has ~$40k to invest,"My friend recently asked me for advice on what to do with $40k. There are no imminent plans for the money, though down the road they would like to potentially use some of it towards a house down payment.
  
The $40k has been sitting in their savings account for the past two years, collecting a very low rate of interest. I gently suggested they move it into equities two years ago, but they never got around to it. Fast forward to today and they said they realized they were losing out on potential growth and had taken action of transferring money to their brokerage!
  
I'm not a fan of ""timing the market"" though I do acknowledge they missed a big run up in the stock market in 2013 YTD. There's a lot of uncertainty with the fed, tapering, foreign markets, etc, but when is there not? Here is what I plan on suggesting to my friend (BTW they broker with Fidelity and unlikely to switch to vanguard or another brokerage since they were so stubborn to start with):
  
* select 3 index funds that get them fairly well diversified. I'm thinking one that tracks the S&amp;P 500, one that tracks international and one that tracks bonds.
* start off by investing the bare minimum required by fidelity in each of these ($2500 per fund).
* on a monthly basis do auto investments in each of these to the desired asset allocation (total of $1000 invested per month, split across each account). this likely comes out to ~50% domestic, 30% international, 20% bonds.
* I figure that by dollar cost averaging, they will hedge against the potential of a sudden market pullback/correction, while still giving them the opportunity to gain some exposure to equities.

investing,Trying to understand bond fund performance with relationship to rising interest hurting NAV,"Many people are suggesting that it is a bad idea to invest in bonds right now because when the interest rates go up money will ""be lost.""  After a lot of reading, it is obvious that the NAV of a bond fund will drop in the short term.  But, it does not seem that this will really cause a long term investor to lose money.  What am I missing?

My rationale for thinking that it won't lose money in the long run has to do with the mechanics of why the bonds' values go down.  It seems to go down due to the future value changing as described here:

http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com/2010/09/yield-to-maturity-interest-rate-risk.html

The bond fund might hold the bond to maturity, at which point it the bond's contribution to NAV will increase as the bond's remaining term goes down.  So the NAV will bounce back.

If the fund doesn't hold to maturity,  I assume it will replace the bond with another at the new rate.  In the example from the previous link, it could replace every 1000 of the old bonds with 957 of the new bonds.  If that happens, the fund will have generated the same amount of money for the investor as dividends by the end of the term of the bonds.

So, NAV change does not matter in both cases.  It's as if every dollar put into the fund (including reinvested dividends) is locked into the interest rates prevailing at the time of the investment, which is not nearly the same thing as losing money due to NAV drop.

Will it make my monthly payment lower in January.
 
 Also, would it be unwise to use her school refund to payback my loans if she has subsidized loans? If they are subsidized does it matter if her loans are at a slightly higher interest rate?

personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation Walkthrough,"I'm going through the Student Loan consolidation process and it can appear rather overwhelming, but its merely a time consuming process. I searched through the FAQ but there was nothing that explained it all, so I figured I would show some initiative.

This is where you find all your student loans in one place: 
http://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA/

I'd recommend taking a look at this about 3 months prior to your grace period ending (which is typically 6 months after you graduate). 

Go through each loan and write down the servicer (Great Lakes, Sallie Mae, UAS etc.). Go to their website and create an account, write down the account number for each loan (or each loan servicer as some loans are pooled together by them), how much you owe with interest, and the contact information (address, phone number).  I've learned some of the websites have my account number in the top right corner of the screen by my name. Others such as for Perkins loans were a little harder to find.

Now you want to go to here: https://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/AppEntry/apply-online/appindex.jsp and fill in the promissory note. Make sure you read through it to make sure it is what you want to do. 

Fill out the personal information section.

You have all the information necessary to complete for the ""Loans you want to consolidate section"", (assuming you want to consolidate them all). 

If you had a shitload of loans like I did, you can go here: http://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/forms/forms.html to get an ""additional loans"" form. You can also find the ""repayment plan selection"" form here which is necessary for them to process your request. 

As far as which plan you should select, I would suggest you post your loan amounts and interest rates here and ask for help with that. If you select the IBR plan though, you will need to also include your last tax return as proof of AGI (adjusted gross income). 

If someone can provide a breakdown of each plan in simple terms, I'll edit it in. Any additional information would also be helpful.",finance,1380290758
investing,Personally held mortgage?,"I have a rental house I bought for $15,000 (in cash) earlier this year (yes, the number seems low to you, but it's in the country in a slow market). I have had some electrical upgrades and roof work performed on it, but it needs $6,000-$9,000 in additional rehab work before it will be rent-able. I don't want to spend that cash as some personal circumstances have arisen since the purchase that have changed my financial outlook for the next 12 months.

Anyway, my question isn't on the sale price (which is $22,000).

My question is, does anyone have recommendations on interest rates I should charge the buyer I have who is interested in meeting my price if I hold a 10 year mortgage?

I personally know them and trust their ability to repay. They own several other investments in the area. Him and his partner are in their 50's...I'm debating asking them to add me as a tertiary for the principal owed on their life insurance policy(s) (or asking them to pay for some sort of insurance policy).

I ran some numbers at a 6.875% interest rate (because I needed to pick a number) and come up with a $250 mortgage/interest payment. This, minus the $150 I put aside for taxes/insurance each month and the $40 in utilities I am carrying each month leave me about $440 ahead each month compared to my current situation.

I'm a little concerned about capital gains tax, but with my relationship with this buyer, we'll just schedule the sale for after the anniversary if my tax guy suggests waiting. But having already spent $3,000 on the property I can write off, it isn't a lot of money being made here. And I wouldn't be taxed on the gains until they are received from the loan proceeds anyway. Taxes are neat to try to understand yet suck at the same time. lol

Does this sound kosher to y'all? Is it a fair sounding interest rate? Am I missing any details? It'd be my first paper holding experience.

My alternative is to put it for sale, post it on the MLS, probably involve buyers/sellers agent commissions and probably price concessions...so making a small net profit (real small once we pay doc taxes) and beating the going rate on the market (with a 6.875% vs 4%) is appealing.

financialindependence,Questions on a Small Personally Held Mortgage,"This is the subreddit I feel is best able to offer an answer to this as my fi plan involves real estate.

I have a rental house I bought for $15,000 (in cash) earlier this year (yes, the number *seems* low to you, but it's in the country in a slow market). I have had  some electrical upgrades and roof work performed on it, but it needs $6,000-$9,000 in additional rehab work before it will be rent-able. I don't want to spend that cash as some personal circumstances have arisen since the purchase that have changed my financial outlook for the next 12 months.

Anyway, my question isn't on the sale price (which is $22,000).

My question is, does anyone have recommendations on interest rates I should charge the buyer I have who is interested in meeting my price if I hold a 10 year mortgage?

I personally know them and trust their ability to repay. They own several other investments in the area. Him and his partner are in their 50's...I'm debating asking them to add me as a tertiary for the principal owed on their life insurance policy(s) (or asking them to pay for some sort of insurance policy).

I ran some numbers at a 6.875% interest rate (because I needed to pick a number) and come up with a $250 mortgage/interest payment. This, minus the $150 I put aside for taxes/insurance each month and the $40 in utilities I am carrying each month leave me about $440 ahead each month compared to my current situation.

I'm a little concerned about capital gains tax, but with my relationship with this buyer, we'll just schedule the sale for after the anniversary if my tax guy suggests waiting. But having already spent $3,000 on the property I can write off, it isn't a lot of money being made here. And I wouldn't be taxed on the gains until they are received from the loan proceeds anyway. Taxes are neat to try to understand yet suck at the same time. lol

Does this sound kosher to y'all? Is it a fair sounding interest rate? Am I missing any details? It'd be my first paper holding experience.

My alternative is to put it for sale, post it on the MLS, probably involve buyers/sellers agent commissions and probably price concessions...so making a small net profit (real small once we pay doc taxes) and beating the going rate on the market  (with a 6.875% vs 4%) is appealing.

And yes, I will be involving my attorney as this gets more serious.

personalfinance,"Kid, 23, thinking about buying a house but knows nothing about anything.","Using a throwaway account since I don't want to reveal personal financial information on my primary reddit account.

Anyway, here's me.  I'm 23 years old, still living at home with my parents and 4 (yes, 4) younger siblings.  Since I do have my own room and space, this arrangement is tolerable, but obviously far from ideal.  I want to move out for greater privacy and independence... basically, I'm eager to start ""being an adult,"" instead of feeling like an overgrown teenager who somehow ended up as a working professional with a college degree.

Financial situation: I'm fortunate enough to have a stable job that pays, without revealing my exact income, ~50K per year.  I have no debt that is actively accruing interest (modest federal student loans are paid in full), but I am making monthly $250 payments on an interest-free tuition+car loan from my parents.

Savings-wise, I have ~9000 split between a checking and savings account, as well as ~1000 more in a savings investment bond that I can cash at any time. Since my monthly expenses are very low, I'm accumulating additional savings at a good clip.

Am I crazy for wanting to just skip the ""living in an apartment"" phase of life and just looking to buy a house?  I'm not very bright and I don't know much of anything, but I do have common sense and I'm very financially responsible.  There's no big rush either, I plan to keep living at home at least through this winter and think more seriously about moving next spring.  (Where I come from, trying to move during the winter would not be a smart plan, trust me.) Plus, this a huge step in life, obviously, and I want to take my time and make sure I do this right.  As I understand it, an FHA loan for a first time homebuyer would make it possible to buy a house with a minimal down payment, but I'm terrified there's got to be some kind of a horrible catch that will ruin my life.  Basically, it's like a roller coaster... I want to do it... but I'm so terrified by the very idea that I have no idea if I can actually go through.  But living at home forever simply is not an option, even if my parents are apparently willing to let me.

On the other the interest rate is 8%, principal is 50,000 with 5000 in accrued interest.  Normally I would say, pay off the highest interest rate first.  Say I had 1100 dollars.  I could knock off the entire lower interest rate loan at once, forever preventing 1000 dollars from accruing interest.  If I put 1100 dollars towards the higher interest loan, it will continue to accrue interest at the same rate, until I've paid off the interest that has accrued, plus the new interest that accrues.

politics,A Letter from Ladar Levison and Campaign for Liberty.,"Dear ,

Say what's really going on, and go to jail!

Ever since I made the decision a few weeks ago to shut down my secure email company Lavabit - instead of becoming complicit in our federal government's crimes against the American people - that's the situation I've been living under every day.

Unfortunately - even with all the media attention - I have to answer most questions about what our federal government is up to (and what I'm facing) with an ""I'm sorry, I can't tell you.""

Of course, the First Amendment should protect my political speech so our government can't commit crimes in secret.

But it seems the statists in Washington, D.C. have targeted every last bit of our Constitution for outright destruction.

I'm determined to FIGHT back. I'm determined to defend the Constitution and restore our Fourth Amendment right to privacy.

But going up against the full force of government power is hard.

If there's anything the Feds have, it's no shortage of lawyers!

And I can't tell you what it would mean to me to have Campaign for Liberty's members and supporters standing with me in this fight.

That's why I'm hoping I can count on you to sign your Statement of Support for my efforts today.

I'll give you the link shortly . . .

My hope is, once other tech companies see hundreds of thousands - or perhaps even millions of Americans - standing for privacy, more will be willing to stand alongside me and say ""NO!"" to crimes against our Constitution.

Thankfully, Campaign for Liberty is already fighting in Congress for the protection of our Fourth Amendment freedoms.

They've also graciously agreed - with your generous support today - to rush to my legal aid, as well.

My attorney and I couldn't be more grateful.

Since shutting down Lavabit, I've lost my main source of income.

Without the financial support of good folks like you, I have no idea how I'll be able to see this legal fight through.

But I'm not walking away. I can't.

It's just too important.

I'm counting on you to sign your Statement of Support today to show you agree.

Turn on Images

I'm fighting back because it's the right thing to do.

Not only that, but it could provide the spark you and I need to create a massive grassroots fire under Congress to get them to finally start respecting our Constitution once again.

In 2004, I started the company that would become Lavabit because I believed then, as I do now, privacy is a fundamental and important right for any free society.

Like many Americans, I believed our right to privacy was being slowly eroded.

Only now are you and I seeing how true those concerns were.

As of just a few weeks ago, more than 400,000 people used my email service.

10,000 of those paid for my company's enhanced security features including encryption.

Today, that number is ""0.""

I wish I could explain more . . . I wish I could explain why.

But ""thanks"" to the Obama administration's iron-fisted bullying, I can't.

I know the national security statists tell us - as they DESTROY every last bit of our privacy - ""if we're not doing anything wrong, we shouldn't have anything to worry about.""

Yet, they keep every detail of their massive, ILLEGAL, and growing surveillance program hidden in secret.

If they have nothing to hide, why not allow for transparency and civilian oversight?

It's so secret, much of what our federal government does now has never been exposed to Congressional OR Court oversight.

I believe that's for good reason.

Once exposed, it would only be a matter of time before the American people said, ""NO MORE.""

, for the sake of our Constitutional Republic, that's exactly what we must do.

We must say ""NO MORE!"" to the constant erosion of our freedoms.

If you agree, please stand with me by signing your Statement of Support and by contributing as generously as you can to Campaign for Liberty today.

I've already mentioned how I hope seeing so many people signing Statements of Support for my efforts will embolden more tech companies to say ""NO!"" to government bullying.

There's no doubt, this will be a crucial step to winning this fight against violations against our Fourth Amendment freedoms.

But ultimately, the ONLY way you and I can restore our Constitution's Fourth Amendment is to fight both in the courts and the halls of the U.S. Congress.

I believe my legal battle is a key part.

Thankfully - with your help - Campaign for Liberty has generously agreed to help out in any way possible.

In fact, your generosity today will help my legal efforts AND Campaign for Liberty's ongoing legislative programs, which are every bit as important.

Campaign for Liberty is the one organization with the principles and the tenacity to finally repeal statist schemes like the so-called ""PATRIOT"" Act, which lies at the heart of all this madness.

But they're counting on your help to make it possible.

The good news is, the political environment to restore American freedom is finally being created as new NSA abuses come to light, including:

*** NSA analysts spying on lovers, former spouses and love interests;

*** Nearly 18,000 domestic phone records were checked by the NSA, but ""only 1,935 were based on a reasonable suspicion standard"" the agency purports to abide by;

*** Roughly 90% of the phone numbers on the daily ""alert list"" constantly under watch by the NSA DO NOT conform to the NSA's own standards for suspicion;

***Reports indicate the NSA has collected information on 75% of domestic Internet communications.
Worse, many of the NSA's abuses were ""self-reported,"" meaning we only know about the illegality they want us to know about.

What else are they hiding?

Just in the past few days, news broke the NSA shares raw spy data on American citizens - perhaps even including government officials' communications - with at least a half dozen foreign governments!

I know there's more to come.

With this kind of spying power, the NSA can create massive databases including personal information on EVERY single American . . .

Political leanings. Religious beliefs. Gun ownership.

You name it.

Is this the America we want for ourselves, let alone for future generations?

This madness has to stop.

Our Constitution must be saved.

But , I'm counting on you.

So won't you please sign your Statement of Support and please contribute as generously as you can to Campaign for Liberty TODAY?

Your contribution - in addition to helping Campaign for Liberty fight for us within the halls of Congress - will also be used to help me legally take the fight to the NSA.

I'm willing to stand up and fight. I've proven that.

Will you stand with me?

investing,"I believe the market is moderately overvalued, what do you think?","With the Federal Reserve unwillingly to taper off its bond buying, we continue to see a market that is rising as investors seek higher yields in equities that fixed income can’t provide. I have decided to reevaluate the American market as a whole to determine if its current level is it at an attractive level. My first assumption is that federal bond buying has elevated the overall market. With treasuries and fixed income at record lows, I believe it has caused an environment in which investors are reaching for yield. They will continuously bid up prices on equities, based not on fundamentals and proper valuations, but because they need prices to rise in order to gain an “acceptable return”. It has created a virtual bull market. People aren't necessarily bullish but the Federal Reserve’s actions have caused investors to act bullish.   It creates a sense of uncertainty as we can’t be sure of the repercussions and consequences once the reserve finally ends its bond buying. Though I am convinced that once the program ends, we will see a systematic drop in asset prices as investors are finally pulled back down to earth and valuations will begin to matter

My favorite way to evaluate the market is through taking the total market value of the American stock market and dividing it by the GNP (Gross National Product).  We can expect the market to accurately represent the GNP, but occasionally it can be lagging behind or way ahead. When the market is 70-80 percent of the GNP, you have an attractive market in which you can invest in at a good price. Anything lower is an obvious discounted market in which most equities are most likely trading below intrinsic value. Anything between 80-90 percent can be fairly priced but you wouldn't be receiving a discount. Anything over 100 percent is relatively on the higher side. It is during extreme bull markets and irrational exuberance that the level of the market can even raise to 200 percent of the GNP. This occurred during 1999 in the internet bubble, and did so with devastating effects a few years later. 

To calculate our current levels, I use the value of the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index which should give us a good idea of the present market value. It is currently valued at about 19.9 billion dollars which is up from 19 billion a few months ago. The total GNP as of Q2 is 16.9 billion. This gives us an approximate 117 percent. This means that the current markets trade at 117 percent of the total GNP. 

The current P/E of the markets is at about 19. Note that historical P/E falls between 10-12 and for the past few decades, it has averaged between 10-20. But bonds historically average about 11 percent return and bonds average about 6-7 percent returns. Looking at the average P/E for the market, I can automatically see that investors may be taking extra risk in investing in the current market.

We can calculate yields based on the markets current P/E by calculating 1/19 and adding on the historical inflation rate of 1.5 percent. We come to about 6.7 percent return based on the market’s current P/E.

Thus we have to evaluate the current numbers.

Current Yield on Stock: 6.7% vs. Historical Yield on Stocks: 11%

6.7% vs. Historical Yield on Bonds: 6-7%

It is important that we take a look at these numbers. Stock yields are at an historic low, but so are bond yields. Thus investors need to really think hard and assess their situation. Do they wish to invest in an inflated market with historically low stock/bond yields? Or should they look elsewhere?

Overall I think the market is moderately overvalued, and there very few bargains available, what is everyone else's view?",finance,1380391238

personalfinance,"Will probably need to take out some student loans in the coming month, where do I start?","Wall of text below, just a fair warning. (Skip to 5th paragraph if you don't care about background info).

Background info: I'm 20 years old, in my third year of university (CS major), taking 18 credits this semester and on track to graduate in December 2014 (assuming I fail exactly 0 of my classes in the next 3 semesters). For the past two years of my education, all educational and living expenses were completely paid for through savings my mom gave me, savings from my summer job, and grants from the state and school. Last semester's expenses used up the last of my mom's college savings for me (only had about $10k to start with, but I'm grateful I had it!).

Cut to now. Like I said, taking 18 credits this semester. The remainder of tuition/student fees that was not paid through grants I paid off out of pocket. Currently, my financial situation is that I have enough money in my bank account to pay rent and utilities for next month (due on the first of the month) as well about $100 for groceries and such (I can stretch my grocery money pretty well). Rent and utilities are $740 total per month (it's pricey, I know, I opted to live in a studio alone this semester to avoid roommates after last semester's experiences). I have no debts whatsoever, one credit card which I pay off religiously, no car or insurance, and I don't pay for my health insurance or my cell phone plan.

Currently I'm looking for a CS internship that I can fit around my 18 credit schedule and that pays well enough and offers enough hours to cover my monthly expenses. This job search isn't going too spectacularly right now. I have an internship assessment lined up for tomorrow morning (where they'll gauge how good of a fit I am for the company to narrow down the amount of applicants) but I'm not too confident about it for a few reasons.

**So** seeing as a job likely won't come my way soon enough to pay for rent/utilities on November 1st, I was thinking of taking out a small student loan (somewhere between $1-2k) just to allow me some money for living for the next month(s) while I search for a job that will fit my needs. The problem is, I have never done this before. Where do I start? Do I go with a federal loan or do I use a private lender? Do I do subsidized or unsubsidized (I heard one of these was a big no-no when it comes to student loans, but I can't remember which!)? I don't know what my credit is so far (I have had a Discover card (Cashback bonus, not a student card I think?) since October 2012 which has had its credit limit bumped up twice, bringing it up from $900 to $1300 a month. Also lived for 10 months in another apartment complex last year, all rent payments on time and paid gas separately through Xcel always on time) so I don't know how that will affect things. There is NO chance for a co-sign on the loan, before anyone asks. I won't go into details but just know that I will be taking this loan out completely on my own.

I guess that's all the text I'll throw at ya for now. Hopefully I provided enough information for anyone that's willing to help. Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any advice!

finance,Can someone please ELI5 Put-Call Parity arbitrage with synthetic options?,"I'm struggling through this and I'd really appreciate if someone would ELI5 the logic and correct steps.  Here's the question along with what I've got so far.



6-month European call option (C) is currently selling @ $1.75 with a strike price (K) of $50.  The stock price (S) is $51.75.  The risk-free interest rate is currently 1% per annum.  Arbitrage opportunities?

**Here's what I have:**

C - P = S - Ke^-rt

**So to create a synthetic put:**

P = C - S + Ke^-rt

**Solve:**

P = 1.75 - 51.75 +50e^-(0.01)(.5)

P = - 50 + 49.75

P = - 0.25

**Now, determine arbitrage opportunities:**


Because the synthetic put is negative - buy the put. (this is where I'm getting caught up)

     -Create Position
          -Buy call
          -short stock at 51.75
          -Use 1.75 to pay for call and lend 50
     -After 6 months
          -if S &lt; 50
                -get money back from bank PV = 49.75 (?? this doesn't seem rational)
                -do not exercise call
                -return stock
          -if S &gt; 50
                -get money that was lended
                -exercise call
                -purchase stock at 50 and return other stock to previous owner (for a profit??)

That's what I've got, but a few things that don't make sense to me are: 

I can just short a stock and pay nothing to the previous owner when I'm unwinding my position?

If I do borrow the stock and the price drops/rises, I can return it and the owner pays the difference?

business,"CELLULARE ABBINATO ALLA TARIFFA, GLI ITALIANI VOGLIONO RISPARMIARE","Non ci si lascia più convincere dalle offerte  con smartphone incluso: il 61%  degli italiani  tiene il vecchio modello e cambia tariffa

Quando cambia tariffa per il proprio cellulare, il cellulare incluso non serve. E' il pensiero del 61% del campione esaminato dall'Osservatorio SuperMoney nell'ultimo studio sulla telefonia. Sui 12 mila utenti che hanno cercato un confronto sul portale alla ricerca per la migliore offerta relativa al proprio telefonino, oltre la metà ha dichiarato di non voler abbinare uno smartphone al nuovo piano tariffario. È la tecnologia che è diventata troppo 'fast' o siamo diventati meno influenzabili sulle novità tecnologiche? 

Cambio tariffa cellulare, ma è necessario cambiare anche smartphone? Gli italiani dicono di no. Lo sottolineano i dati dell'ultimo studio dell'Osservatorio SuperMoney, unico sito italiano accreditato da Agcom per il confronto delle tariffe di telefonia. Gli italiani non vogliono cambiare smartphone,  è la conclusione a cui sono arrivati al momento di scegliere una nuova offerta per il proprio telefono mobile (http://cellulari.supermoney.eu/). Il 61% delle 12 mila richieste di confronto tariffe pervenute al portale da gennaio 2013 ad oggi, dichiara di non volere un cellulare incluso nella tariffa telefonica.

Il restante 39% della richieste di confronto dimostra che Samsung e Apple sono i marchi più richiesti e voluti da chi sceglie di cambiare cellulare. I modelli della casa sudcoreana prevalgono col 48,1% delle preferenze, fra tutti i modelli disponibili in abbinamento alle tariffe, seguiti nell'ordine dal rivale di Cupertino (31%), poi da Nokia (11,4%), BlackBerry (2,5%) e infine HTC (2,2%). Rimane l'iPhone 5, con il 23% delle richieste, lo smartphone più desiderato; mentre i due modelli top di Samsung, il Galaxy SIII e SIV, guadagnano rispettivamente il 18,8 e il 9,5% delle preferenze.

In tutte le Regioni italiane la propensione a conservare il proprio smartphone è la stessa; i dati raccolti riportano solo lievi oscillazioni sul territorio nazionale. Al Nord si resiste di più alle “sirene” delle nuove tecnologie, con il 63% degli utenti che preferisce non cambiare cellulare. La percentuale supera la metà anche al Centro e al Sud, con il 62 e il 56% di consumatori “fedeli” al proprio telefono.

Gli italiani sono sempre stati  affascinati dalle novità tecnologiche, in particolare ai nuovi modelli di smartphone che si susseguono molto rapidamente, cosa gli è successo? Ci risponde Andrea Manfredi, Amministratore Delegato di SuperMoney : “Le case costruttrici hanno adottato un ritmo troppo veloce anche per noi , la nostra nostra curiosità non è scemata, ma il problema la sostenibilità economica”.

“Scegliere una tariffa abbinata ad uno smartphone, vuol dire impegnarsi in un vincolo troppo costoso per il consumatore – continua Manfredi – È vero che il costo dello smartphone, viene suddiviso in rate, ma si è costretti a rimanere fedeli alla stessa compagnia telefonica per almeno 24 o 30 mesi, evitando così penali salate., Oltre ad essere indispensabile la carta di credito, sulla quale viene addebitata automaticamente la quota mensile. 

A conti fatti, se si ha un modello di smartphone non ancora obsoleto, per molti non è conveniente”.",finance,1380489812

2) Should paying debt in collections in full take priority over credit card debt?

Forex,"USD/CHF breaks year long trend line, H&amp;S neckline, and looks set for further declines.","Hey everybody, I'm back! Been inactive for a while but I thought I'd do some old fashioned TA on my favourite pair to get back in the game.

There was a notable lack of action in the last week - especially since it's the week after Nopetaper.

The Swissy, however, was quite active. One of the reasons I've heard for this, which I quite like, is that The Swiss Franc was simply the best looking safe haven, given no tapering from the Fed and the impending government shutdown on the US side of things, and the Japanese tax break vote which has made at least a few participants hesitate in buying Yen.

Here's a look at the USD/CHF Weekly chart, to get some perspective. Ignore all the junk at the end.

http://i.imgur.com/zuMAepi.png

The pink line is the 200 **Week** moving average - possibly the strongest dynamic supply level I've ever seen. Following two failed attempts to close above this level, price retreated to the medium-term trend line extending off the February lows. Price tested this trend line 3 times quickly, before breaking it on FOMC day.

Next support was the longer-term trend line off the Feb 2012 and Feb 2013 lows - a very important line.

Here's the daily chart:

http://i.imgur.com/zQ2Goe7.png

That line forms the **neck of a complex head and shoulders pattern**, going back to the beginning of the year.  The level broken on Friday was the year open, the monthly S1 pivot and the neckline of this H&amp;S pattern. The pivot I have on there is a monthly pivot, because this is the scale of the levels we're dealing with.

The moving averages have all turned very negative, and all that's needed is for the 100DMA to cross over the 200DMA to give us a Death Cross. MACD is very negative, though most oscillators will be giving oversold readings on Daily charts, and extremely oversold on 4hr and lower timeframes. 

Lastly, for the trade setup, here's a look at the 4hr chart:

http://i.imgur.com/SzwUUzY.png

**The measured target** of the break is 0.8000 (give or take 100 pips). 


**Entry:** While I'm already short from 0.9250 on a small size, I will look to add on a retest of the broken neck-line at 0.9100. There's nothing stopping you from getting in short here (or long, I'm not judging) but what will make this trade great rather than average is being able to have as low a risk on entry as possible, allowing a larger position (and larger profits) - and that means getting in on a bounce if possible. I might scale in using up to 5 or 6 small lots, taking advantage of every bounce I can get. However, this requires an increase in the size of your testicles.



**Stop losses** should probably be above the monthly S1 pivot at 0.9160, though I'd be interested to hear where you guys would place your stops? My rationale here is that if we pass this level, the breakout will be a failure and the whole reason for the trade is gone.


**Targets** are simply the pivot levels, which coincide nicely with the areas of demand I've highlighted (black bars). These come in at **0.8935** (Feb 13 low and equal to 2x risk) **0.8800, 0.8550** (monthly pivots) and 0.8010** (the measured target) 


**Time frame** for the trade is 3 to 6 months

personalfinance,"Made A Budget, Freaking Out and Could Use Some Advice","So I recently made my first real budget, and I am freaking out. 

Some background. I am 32 (I am obviously late to the party, parents never taught us how to manage our finances), and bought a home 18 months ago. When I bought the house I was with my long term girlfriend at the time, and we had bought the house to begin our serious future together. Not even six months later we split up, and I was left carrying the load by myself. After two months alone I brought on a roommate and this brought quite a bit of relief, but I still found myself paying bills a paycheck late. 

I am currently debating doing a heavy renovation in part of my home. My house was built in 1950, and the den, dining room, and kitchen look it. I do not like a third of my house, and it just kind of depresses me because I chose this place as a compromise with my ex. So I looked into it, made an extensive budget for the renovation, and looked into rental prices as they would be with the renovations. I live in Houston and rent is going up quickly, and I could get another $200 a month after the renovation for a roommate. 

Now, with all that said. My personal budget. After taxes, 401K, insurance, etc I bring home $3,090. My monthly budget is $3,012. This purely covers my bills, with zero room to maneuver for going out, dating, taking care of my dog, etc. My roommate currently pays $550 a month, which is all of my ""spending"" money, which obviously I am overspending. 

I have examined my bills, and I have nothing to refinance. I have a car note and personal loan that will be paid off in April 2015, so about 19 months for both of those to be paid off. I have a credit card that I had to get when I moved into this house for emergency repairs that were required, and I plan on paying it off when I receive my tax return. 

I will have an extra $160 a month with that card paid off, and in April 2015 I will have an incredible $700 a month additional with my car and personal loan paid off. That leaves me with cutting cable, which is $100. Not much relief, but a tad bit. I've already changed my grocery habits, and cut it in half. My 401K is at the bare minimum to get the full 100% match from my company, and I've refused to go below that and basically lose free money. I considered taking a 401K loan (no penalties, very low interest rate) to pay off my car and get that payment to a lower monthly rate but I just don't know if that would help. 

My roommate may move out next month, and if I go through with the renovations the additional rent I would bring in would cover the cost of the renovations plus give me some relief. I plan on keeping a roommate, but I fear not finding one quickly, or finding an awful roommate. 

I'm not sure what I am looking for here. Any advice on how to last until April 2015? Words of encouragement? 

TL;DR - I'm at the absolute maximum budget for my income, save for roommate income. I want to crawl into a hole. Help?

**EDIT** More details - My mortgage/escrow is $1,100, and I have an incredibly low interest rate. This is a few hundred less than I was renting for two years ago, and was part of why we decided to buy a house. Rental rates in Houston are skyrocketing. The days of $600-700 nice rentals are long gone. 

My car note is a whopping $536 a month. My two pieces of debt are a personal loan for about $90 a month, and the other is the credit card which minimum payment is $155 a month with 8% interest, an annual balloon interest payment of 30%. I plan on paying this off with my income tax to not be hit with that balloon payment. 

I am using the ""You Need A Budget"" software to help me track where my money goes. 

**EDIT 2**

Looks like a solution has been found. My dad has a ranch that needs a ton of work. He's going to pay me $150 per weekend to go out there and do work such as mowing, tree care, fixing fences, etc. This covers my car and then some.

My girlfriend brings home about a 1000 a month and I bring in about $800 side income.   I have credit card debt of $17,000 with very high interest rates (minimum payments are 350), I have $50,000 in student loan debt, my vehicle is paid off.  I also have a house that I inherited about six years ago which zillow says is worth 154,000 on the low end.  The estate owes 27,000 on the house.  I have tenets and receive 900 rent from them.  Unfortunately, the house has ongoing problems as it is nearly 50 years old and the mortgage is about 950.

Those are the specifics.  Now the problem.  Obviously, the credit card debt is killing me.  I accumulated it in my last year of graduate school and knew better but it happened.  The incidental expenses are also making it unsustainable.  Let alone I'm unemployed and can't find a job.  I feel like I'm on a collision course with foreclosure and want desperately to avoid such a blunder.  

I don't believe I'm able to refinance because I haven't had sufficient income over the past years while I was in graduate school.  A lender said that if I could find something in my field they would refinance against that, I can't.  I'm panicking.  

If I notify my tenets I intend to sell I'm afraid they'll move out.  I could move back into the house since I'm unemployed and my spouse could transfer but that is not ideal.  Should I try and sell it while the tenets are living there, should I put it up for fire sale. I would appreciate a candid discussion with almost anyone about this.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/riskmap/2013/09/25/the-harsh-new-reality-of-doing-business-in-china/

HONG KONG-een verraderlijke tijdperk voor buitenlandse bedrijven die zaken doen in China is begonnen, onderstreept het belang dat bedrijven hun activiteiten, informatietechnologie en de mensen die werken voor hen grondig dierenarts.

De hydra-headed dreiging begon vorm aan te nemen in juli wanneer de nationale ontwikkeling en hervorming Commissie (NDRC) geëist dat 30 multinationale ondernemingen ondergaan ""zelf-kritiek"" voor oneerlijk domineert markten. In medio augustus, de staat Administration van industrie en handel (SAIC) gelanceerd sondes van vermeende zakelijke vergrijp. Vervolgens, op 28 augustus, het Politbureau van de regerende communistische partij van China gewogen in, lancering van een vijf jaar durende programma uit commerciële corruptie te roeien. Chinese autoriteiten hadden eerder de neiging om doel personen of kleine groepen. Doelstellingen zijn nu meer in het algemeen gebaseerd. Buitenlandse kaderleden geconfronteerd met een gastheer van nieuwe risico's, zoals de mogelijkheid van forse boetes of strafrechtelijke vervolging voor activiteiten ze nooit vergoelijkt of zelfs wist over.

De typische in China bedrijfsomstandigheden zaken verder compliceren. Contactpersonen in het algemeen uitgaan van een vertroetelde netwerk van persoonlijke vrienden en familie. Het bijhouden van verschillende sets van boeken is gemeenschappelijk. Omkoping en cadeau geven zijn gemeenschappelijk. Evoluerende wetten tegen corruptie en verzamelen en verspreiden van gegevens staan open voor losse interpretaties.

Dus, wat moet u doen als autoriteiten zijn kloppen op de deur? En plotseling dat, hoe kan u voorbereiden op de dag die knock macht komen?

Als de onderneming het onderwerp van een onderzoek of gezichten kosten is, is de eerste stap om de realiteit. Leidinggevenden moeten ervan uitgaan dat hun interne communicatie in het gedrang komt. Regering invallen van verscheidene verschillende agentschappen kunnen vegen over veel kantoren. Onderzoekers kunnen verlangen uitgebreide documenten die moeilijk te verzamelen snel.

In dergelijke gevallen moeten de bedrijven onmiddellijke hulp van binnenlandse Chinese advocatenkantoren en buiten adviseurs zoeken. Een verstandige strategie, is echter te benaderen het nieuwe regelgevingskader Pro-actief voordat er iets gebeurt, zelfs als het nooit doet.

Dit betekent dat het uitvoeren van een nieuwe evaluatie van de naleving in het licht van de nieuwe realiteit. Zelfs bedrijven die hebben gedaan om te voldoen aan de Amerikaanse federale Corrupt Practices Act en/of het Verenigd Koninkrijk omkoping Act legwork, kunnen kwetsbaar zijn. De nieuwe omgeving, na alles, is ingegeven door de Chinese autoriteiten, niet het Amerikaanse Congres van Britse Parlement.

Om te helpen begrijpen van een bedrijf waar situatie, kunnen leidinggevenden willen overwegen doorlichting van operaties en personeel via een misdrijf paradigm-wij bij het beheersen van risico's gebruiken het model bekend als ""de fraude driehoek.""

Ten eerste moet er een kans voor collusie vanwege de zwakke interne controles. Wie is om te weten als niemand kijkt? Ten tweede, werknemers kunnen rationaliseren dat zelf-behandeling is aanvaardbaar omdat, misschien, deed ze niet krijgen een promotie. Tot slot moet er druk op te treden, dergelijke het verlangen naar geld te betalen voor een auto, een vakantie of een kind collegegeld.

Werken door de driehoek presenteert haar eigen problemen. In Azië, geschenk geven is een gemeenschappelijk kenmerk van het bedrijfsleven en vervaagt lijnen van wat te veel is. Financiële draagkracht en boekhoudkundige documenten kunnen ook moeilijk in te schatten.

Juridische technologie kan worden van het management ace-in-the-hole. Bedrijven kunnen interne China-gebaseerde e-mail servers voor tekenen van problemen schuren. Moeilijker is inspectie particulier laptops, telefoons of personal assistant apparaten. Bedrijven zijn onwaarschijnlijk voor toegang tot de persoonlijke apparaten die Chinese werknemers, zoals hun tegenhangers elders, door elkaar met corporate geleverde apparatuur voor zakelijke communicatie gebruiken.

Doen gegevensgerichte enquêtes kan worden problematisch op andere manieren. Gezien de vaagheid van de regels inzake geheimhouding en privacy van gegevens, moeten bedrijven nadenken inhurend een binnenlandse Chinese law firm. Internationale bedrijven de neiging om meer vertrouwd met vennootschapsrecht dan lokale realiteit worden en ze zijn niet gekwalificeerd om te adviseren over Chinese wet.

China's gegevens wetten navigeren is hachelijke, vooral wanneer het gaat over het verplaatsen van gegevens uit het land. Wat wordt beschouwd als open economische informatie elders kan worden geacht een ""staatsgeheim."" Verhuizen van dergelijke informatie van het land kan brengen enorme boetes of erger. Zelfs over te dragen van het vasteland aan Hong Kong of Macau kan leiden tot problemen. Gewoon wordt in het bezit van dergelijke gevoelige gegevens kan worden belastend.

Sociale media is een favoriete manier van communiceren van bedrijfsgegevens particulier. Facebook is niet een waarschijnlijk binnenlandse locatie omdat het niet toegankelijk is op het vasteland van China. Meer kans om te worden gebruikt zijn dergelijke binnenlandse webmail-sites zoals 163.com, instant messenger-diensten zoals QQ of sociale sites zoals Sina Weibo en Tencent Weibo. Gebruikers kunnen denken zij had permanent verwijderd verhaal-vertellend communicatie, maar ze kunnen hebben ingesteld vallen voor zichzelf doordat ook candid of onzorgvuldig.

Kortom, China de regels veranderen, en op vele manieren, verharden. De oplossingen, zoals de problemen moeten in China om te voorkomen dat vallende octrooiconclusies nieuwe regelgeving berusten.

personalfinance,Living overseas and need help planning for the future.,"Hello PF, thanks for reading my question. 

I currently live in Japan. I have plans of moving back to California in 2 or 3 years. I would like some input about what would be the best way to set my budget. After I pay my monthly bills (minus debt) and put a little aside for some fun I have about $1,100 left each month. I have a mix of private and federal student loans that are around 40k, and 2k in CC. A few months ago I started a direct deposit savings account. My current monthly breakdown is as follows.

Savings(to return home) $350 
CC                              $50
Student Loans              $ 350

I recently paid off my car so I have an extra $350 that I can allocate.

My Next goal is to pay off my credit card.So all my extra money will go there. After I have paid that off I will have an extra $400 a month to allocate.

I can  use the extra 400 to either toss on to my debt. Or increase my savings. I also plan to take any extra money I have after I move back home and put that into debt.  Should I :

A. Keep my savings the same and use the extra $400 a month on debt. 

B. Pay minimum on student loans and add the extra 400 to my savings.

C. Keep my savings the same. Take $100 a month and open a ROTH IRA. (I know it is not alot now but I heard it is better to start early.) Put the remaining $300 onto my debt.

What do you guys think would be the best way to set up my budget so that I can have a solid financial footing when i decide to go home in 2/3 years. Thanks in Advance.",finance,1380513522
personalfinance,Federal workers: Are you moving your TSP to the G fund before the shutdown?,"I've got a large percentage of my total TSP in the L-2040, and I've been making some nice gains this year. I want to protect my retirement earnings from this recklessness, and tomorrow is the last day to move it before the shutdown takes effect. What are other Federal workers doing with your TSPs? Is anyone going to ride it out? I do plan on restoring my investment in the L fund when the government reopens.",finance,1380510400
personalfinance,"I'm terrified of my student loan debt, still have another semesters worth to add on...","21/m student in my 4th year at college. I have already built up about $60k in loans (private - parent+, and fed sub and unsub.) I make just under what my rent costs me currently, and have no other form of money coming in to even think about saving. I don't know what the hell i'm going to do when I graduate.

**Bit of backstory:** For some reason, when I was a foolish 18 year old high school senior, I thought that art school was a good idea. I was well know throughout the town I lived in for my drawing skills, and so I figured ""what else am I going to do?"" So off to school I went, only taking out about $5,500 my first year due to scholarships and pell grants and whatnot. I switched majors half way through the next year, which is what tacked on the extra semester i'll be taking. Unfortunately for me, my parents started making more money, and the government figured that they should be able to help pay for my college. The following 3 years ive had to take out close to 20k each year, resulting in my now $61k worth of debt, with another ~8k for the extra semester i'll be taking next fall, adding up to a grand total of **~$70k** in college loan debt.

 I am a drawing-fine arts major, and I absolutely loathe the fine arts aspect of it. needless to say, I continued on and I feel as though i just need to finish this year and a half to get the degree and be on my way with whatever the hell is suppose to come next. I am currently working in the I.T department of the school as a work-study, at a pathetic $7.40 an hour, 20 hours a week. I feel as though working somewhere else will benefit me now (in terms of a pay bump,) but I think staying might help me out in the long run. Currently there are 2 guys working what is now 3 buildings, and around 1,500 students. They are in desperate need of help, and have frequently said that I am a great asset, and that they don't want to lose me when I graduate. I am honestly happier when i'm working then when i'm in class, and would like to pursue a career in I.T when i graduate.

This all leads me to where I am now. Barely able to make ends meet, working part time minimum wage, and feeling utterly depressed and disappointed about my ""degree"" choice.

**Here is a basic overview of my monthly expenditures:** 

* Rent: 510
* Internet: 40
* Phone: 45
* Everything else: 300*

(* includes:gas, art supplies, random expenses, fast food...)

Writing this out has made me realize how much i live beyond my means, and how the junk food (which i buy when I get depressed...) adds up...

I'm just not sure what to do, and could really use some advice or guidance or something... anything.


**TLDR; Graduating in a year with $70,000 of debt, currently not making enough to save, and unsure where I am headed or what to do.**",finance,1380505814
personalfinance,After some advice/opinions on consolidating my CC debt into a personal loan (AUS),"Heres the story.
 
I have approx 18K in CC debt partly due to some shitty choices in my early 20's and partly because expensive necessities sometimes just happen. 

Anyway after a few years of not really getting anywhere towards paying it off I am thinking that I might consolidate all/most of it into one loan. My reasons for this are:

- A few of the cards have shitty interest rates and in a loan it would be less.

- My line of work means I dont have a consistent paycheck, so knowing exactly how much I have to pay off would help with budgeting.

- With a loan I know that the amount will be paid off in the time frame allocated for the loan.

- I think having less payments to deal with will be a big mental thing for me, as opposed to having 5-6 different min payments a month.

I know I need to take startup fees and monthly fees into account but my bank actually has a promo atm where there are no startup, monthly admin, or early exit fees so im thinking now would be a good time to get it sorted.

1 or 2 of the CCs have a slightly lower interest rate currently so I was thinking I might even get a loan for the ones that are higher than the loan rate then play the balance transfer game with the rest and just focus on smashing it as fast as I can where possible.",finance,1380502920
personalfinance,"Young professional making real money for the first time, goal is to bank $100K, is my plan(enclosed) reasonable?","My plan to bank $100K:

Suppose you desire to bank $100k. This is an achievable goal, albeit there are many different means to achieve such a goal:  
* Save directly!  
* Invest in stocks!  
* Invest in physical assets!  
* Any combination of the above three.  
  

Considering the above, the easiest in terms of work/effort is direct savings, also it involves the least financial risk.  

Saving ~$500/month, assuming 0% interest, yields a savings 
of $100K after 16.6 years.  
  
This is longer than desired. Saving at a rate of $1000/per month would have the time required, thus reducing the time to 8.3 years. A savings rate of $750/month under the same assumptions would yield 11.1 years to reach the goal amount. This shortest time frame would be most desirable, and most likely easiest to stick with due to the end being in sight. This is do-able if I live in a frugal manner.  
  
Due to the near zero percent interest rates of most savings accounts at most banks, this likely would be the longest route, but it would also mitigate the most financial risk. This brings us to the next option.  
  
Investing in stocks. Regardless, stocks will be more work than a direct savings. They can in fact be much more work than any method listed above. Really what it comes down to is research, and level of involvement you desire to maintain. I do not care for being an active investor, continuously monitoring, buying, and selling. Index funds sound much more attractive, a buy and hold strategy would be easiest. A fund such as the Vanguard 500 seems like a good option, it exhibits slow steady growth (following the market), essentially providing returns at a higher rate than a savings account. It would also help to account for some of the effect of inflation. The intent would be to essentially treat it like savings account, buying and holding. The benefit of index funds vice traditional stocks/day trading is a lower operating cost/fees and ease of investment. EFT funds are also a viable option although trade continuously throughout the day, versus daily like an index fund.  
  
The last option that exists is investment in physical assets, such as property/houses/materials/commodities/etc. This option would most likely pose the most work, and also require the most capital to get started. It has its benefits however I do not yet desire to embark on that endeavor. It seems like this would be a more reasonable approach, later in the game, when some initial capital (~$100K has been amassed).


What are your thoughts/recommendations?",finance,1380500216
