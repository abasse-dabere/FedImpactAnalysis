Ive heard talks about the US defaulting. What would that mean and what would need to happen for that to occur? If I understand correctly, the United States loans out massive amounts of money to other countries as well as obviously selling treasury bonds, which Ive heard called the safest and most reliable investment in the world.

personalfinance,Should I keep my car loan around in favor of credit history?,"I moved to the US about 2 years ago. I had no credit history at that point, so it was hard to even get a credit card.

Given that I plan to mortgage a house in the next 5 years or so (currently renting), does it make sense to drag on my car loan so that I build up my credit history, and as a result, get a better mortgage rate?

I'm considering opening multiple savings accounts for the following goals:

1. Roth IRA contribution: $5,000 every 12 months
1. Vacation funds: $4000 - $5000 every 10 - 12 months
1. Holiday spending: $500 - $1000 every 12 months
1. *List could keep growing depending how granular I want to be...*

Previously, I kept everything in Chase and externally budgeted the account for various savings goals. After switching to Schwab and opening a Mint.com account (love it), I want to exploit its ""Goals"" feature (which has to be tied to an actual account, ergo my wish to open multiple accounts).

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on:

1. Is it worth it to make the switch to play nice with Mint features? I've never had budgeting problems in the past, but I find the idea of physically partitioning my savings goals to be oddly satisfying.
1. How should I setup the auto-transfers? Should I schedule a monthly ACH push from Chase for every savings account? Is there a limit on how many I can do? Or can the receiving bank handle one transfer and distribute it appropriately over each savings account?
1. Is my paycheck -&gt; Chase -&gt; multiple savings accounts proposal overly complex? Should I just direct deposit to each savings account?
1. Finally, which bank should I go with? I hear Ally, Capital One 360, and USAA (I qualify) easily handle multiple accounts. I'm not in it for the interest rate race, so I want to focus on how easy it is handle transfers as described in (2) and how well it integrates with Mint.

Albemarle &amp; Bond Holding: 
https://www.google.com/finance?q=LON:ABM&amp;ei=ScdJUqDLG5TEwAPF9wE
and H&amp;T Group Plc:
https://www.google.com/finance?q=LON:HAT&amp;ei=CeNJUsCNOoKGwAPCfw

**about the business**
They are both pawnbroking companies in the UK, which means the biggest part of their business is making small loans with relatively (compared to bank loans) high interest rates. They take gold items, jewelry and watches as collateral. They also have a retail business and gold buying business, but that is much smaller. 

The loans are always really small and never more then a few hundred pounds. So we dont have to worry about regulations here. The interest rates are high, but still within reason given the target group. and their target group is 65% women of lower income ofcourse. They have very similar businesses, very similar size, but ABM has a bigger gold buying business of the two. 

As you maybe noticed already they have both very low price earnings multiples, and H&amp;T actually dropped almost 50% in the last few days. You might think it might be interesting to buy one or both of them because they seem undervalued. This isnt exactly the case, since earnings here are very deceiving. 

here are their numbers:

**put them in a link:**
http://img407.imageshack.us/img407/8653/iv0z.jpg


If you add up those numbers, ABM claimed to have made **77m** in net income the last 8 years, but only a little over **40m** in free cash flow and little over 10 million if you also substract acquisition of business. 

H&amp;T claimed to have made **74m** in net income, but only **21m** (LOL) in free cash flow, and also only about 10m if you discount acquisitions. So clearly they deserve their low multiples. 

**The cash flow problems of both companies explained:**
THe reason they actually make less then they say is because they have higher capital expenditures (necesairy to upkeep stores). It is in fact twice as high as depreciation. The other reason is that their receivables have been building up over the years. Their receivables are basicly the collateral items that are not redeemed by the people making the loans. This value is then moved to receivables. 

But there is something weird going on, since they seem to have problems exchanging these items (mostly jewelry, watches and diamonds) for cash. If you look in the annual report of ABM you will see that their retail business is declining and their jewelry business not growing. So they seem to have problems selling those collateral items for the price they want. 

ABM has a redeem rate of 75% (meaning that most people pay back the loan), H&amp;T doesnt mention this, but given the fact that they generate much less cash means this number must be lower.

There is probably some shady stuff going on here, management wants to prop up earnings to make the business look good, and doesnt want to sell the collateral for a discount. The ramping up of cap expenditures might have something to do with this as well. If they write down some of their receivables, it means that earnings are actually much lower, and that means a lower stock price. 

**troubles with gold price falling**
Recently the gold price fell, and that means problems for ABM (for both companies really). They recently appointed a new CEO, and basicly on the same date anounced this:
http://ww7.global3digital.com/ab/regulatorynews_item.jsp?ric=ABM.L.TK&amp;ref=66795

Meaning a rights offering of 50p a share for 35m pounds total. This caused the price of the stock to drop almost 50% in the last few days. To explain this, here are both balance sheets:

ABM:                                         H&amp;T:
**non current assets**                  

goodwill:           23m                     18m

other intang.     4.5m                     1.2m

and equipment:  16.5m                   14m

Current assets:

Inventories:       18m                      26m 

Receivables:       67m                      64m

Cash:                5m                       6.4m
___________________________

total:                 91m                     97m

total assets:       135m                    130m  


Liabilities:

bank debt:           44m                     34m

other:                 11m                     9m


net tang assets:   53m                      69m


If the rights offering goes through, it would remove the debt and there 
would be 88m of net tangible assets.

Because numbers are messed up, this is 53m net tangible assets for ABM and 69 net tangible assets for H&amp;T. 

Market price without offering is 40m for ABM and 52m for H&amp;T. 

**short thesis**
Now my thesis is that H&amp;T is a shitty business with heavily overstated earnings.  and is still overvalued. They will have some serious problems with that declining revenue and paying off debt and also paying dividends. I believe this is not fully reflected in the price. I also believe that ABM is slightly undervalued at current price. So we have a overvalued and slightly undervalued business here that are pretty similar. So a arbitrage opportunity exists. 

If we value ABM here, there will be 88m of tang assets after the offering. But since receivables are probably worth less, lets discount them 35m = 88-(69-35)=53m of  tang assets. 

They generated about 44m of FCF, 35m of that in the last 4 years. So lets make that 50m over the next 10 years. Which seems very conservative, since they actually generated about 40 over the last 4 years. that is about 100m in value, you will get it for 75m after the rights offering. Note that im v conservative here. They also have a new experienced CEO that might actually improve the situation with the building up receivables (and also the increasing cap expenditures). 

If we value H&amp;T, they have net tang assets of 69m. lets also take about 35m from those receivables, then we have 34m in net tang assets. 

They only generated about 20m in FCF in the last 4 years, and 24 in the last 8. They also had a much sharper revenue decline this year. So lets say they will generate 25m in the next 10 years. that is 35+25= 60m in net present value. which costs 52m. My expectation is that these guys will be in trouble within a few years with their renewed bank debt of over 30m expiring in about 3.5 years. (means they have to pay it off). They might also have some problems with receivables going down in value, and they might also announce a rights offering. There is also a bigger chance they will have to cut dividends. so even tho market value is still lower, it seems the risk is bigger. I also didnt discount their bigger inventory here. 

So what we do is, we buy ABM and we short H&amp;T. If there are tailwinds in the pawnbroking business and H&amp;T does better then expected , ABM will also do good. If tough years are ahead then ABM is in a better position if they have no debt and better cash flows and there is not much more downside. There is more downside and negative catalysts here form H&amp;T in that case, so thats why i like to short H&amp;T. 

Even if you dont invest, i think you can probably learn something about  investing from this write up. I know i did from writing it up :) . If there are questions please ask. Would love to hear if im wrong on this one as well.

personalfinance,Loan payoff -- should I spend most of my savings on this?,"Hello r/personalfinance,

I am seeking some advice on spending my savings on a loan pay-off. I currently have $2,387.01 in my savings account which is a miracle for me, since I am historically terrible at saving and I'm in horrible debt ($80K+ in federal student loans, but that's another story).

On top of that, I have two private loans: one for $946.45 at a 4.46% interest rate and another for $1,722.57 at a 5% interest rate. I am thinking of paying off the first loan because I've had it since 2007 and I'm ready to be finished with it. The second loan I've had since maybe 2009. If I pay off the first loan, I'll have $1440.56, which is still a good amount of savings to build on and to use for emergencies if need be.

The $946 loan's minimum balance is $7.00/month and the $1722 loan is $120.00 quarterly.

What are your thoughts? I am also trying to take my last graduate class to qualify to teach dual enrollment, and that would be approximately $1050.00, which would be due at the beginning of the summer in June. If I pay for the $946 loan, I would still have enough money for the class, but then I would be down to $300 and I'd have to save up longer to be able to pay off that other loan for $1722. I am also concerned about having some savings for emergencies.

Oh, and one last thing: I've been saving $500/paycheck for the last two months and I think I can manage putting that amount aside from now on, or at least $200. I also have a second job that goes directly into savings that adds up to at least $70/ month (a small gig).

I'm a 24 year old student in a professional program. Due to my past frugality, generous scholarships, living with my parents (in the past), and luck (mostly luck), I've amassed $150k in assets with no debt. Due to my massive stupidity, laziness, and apathy, it's mostly sitting in a savings account with a poor interest rate and is being eaten away by inflation. 


My current income is about $30k per year (after tax and tuition) and in 2 years it should be about $50k for a few years and then $200k onwards. This is all assuming I stick with my current career path. I'm a neurotic mess that's already had to change career path once, and I hope I don't have to again, but part of the reason I like to keep a massive emergency fund on hand is because I always view the future with uncertainty ( to an excessive degree)

So, that's my current situation, I'd be curious to hear about your thoughts and general advice, because I've never shared this with anyone, so chances are it sounds crazy to all of you.

But I'm mostly posting because I want to buy a car, and I am wondering how my finances should factor into it. My car needs for the future:

For the next 12 months: I will use a car regularly but sparingly, probably less than 2000 km (1500 miles) for the whole year.

For the following 12 months: I will need to use a car regularly (like a normal person basically)

For the following 12 months: I will be flying all over the country doing numerous internships (it's a big country), so for the most part a car will not be practical(I'm not really too sure at this point, i may spend quite a long time in my current location as well)

Beyond that: I will probably need a car regularly, though it may well be in a different part of the country (or even in the US).

I'm an experienced driver (for my age) and I have bought a car before (paid up front, cheap pos given my past frugality) I'm wondering if I should buy or lease this time around, given my needs and current financial situation? I am totally clueless about leasing. 

Also, this is kind of a personal preference thing I suppose, but any thoughts on what sort of budget I should aim for the car?

Thanks for any advice or comments!

worldpolitics,"Why I, a member of the American far left, stand in agreement with the Republicans on their final amendments to the Affordable Care Act.","From its inception, the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. ""Obamacare"") was a terrible, terrible plan to suck ever more wealth out of the pockets of the American middle and working classes, while redistributing that wealth into the pockets of powerful insurance industry interests. Sure, it has some good provisions in it (protecting those with pre-existing conditions, youth under the age of 26, women's health freedom, etc) and its market-based insurance-exchange plan should certainly allow for some number of uninsured Americans to bargain on the open market for a plan they otherwise would never have been able to afford.

But we cannot forget that the ACA was based on a plan written in the 1990s by Republican-funded research institutes like the Heritage Foundation as a market-based alternative to the so-called ""threat"" of a real national healthcare system in the form of what they deemed ""Hillarycare"" at the time. Of course, by ""market-based"" we mean a perpetual system of economic slavery for all citizens without the means to afford to buy into a system that the government will not allow them to opt out of without threat of legal penalty. 

And so here I sit today, looking out over a grand opportunity for this nation to move forward on a real national healthcare system, one free of the chains of a fascist public-private insurance scheme to latch onto the weakest and less fortunate among us.

The Republicans got it wrong on most of their attempts this week, but on their last offering of the day they got it right. Allow the ACA to go into full effect with the exception of two sections: A] the individual mandate which guarantees an expanded customer base for our vampire insurance system and B] a section that allows lawmakers, Congressional staffers, and administration staffers to receive federal subsidies for health insurance under the law.

I think everyone should agree on B, that members of the Great American Plutocracy should not be sucking even more money out of the nation's empty pocketbooks. They can certainly afford to pay their own way or simply continue to suck at the teat of the incredible government healthcare plans they already receive.

As for A, this is where I smell opportunity for this nation to move forward, and it is a sweet, sweet smell. Without the enforcement mechanism that requires all Americans to buy into the ""private"" insurance system at cost, the other provisions of the ACA will cause an eventual collapse of the entire system. The payouts will exceed the incomes, and the balance books simply will not support an Act that doesn't force all Americans into forever-slavery at the point of the tax man's gun. And this is where the United States of America will be forced to abandon a private insurance industry entirely. Oh sure, there will always be private companies to provide ""Cadillac Care"" to wealthy benefactors, but the system as a whole will be destroyed, and will exist as a mere shell of its former self. In its stead we will open Medicare for all, and we will join the rest of the civilized world as a nation that doesn't allow its citizens to slowly rot away or perish because they couldn't afford to buy into a system that was always rigged against them.

So for this reason, I stand tonight with the Republicans in supporting their continuing resolution. May God bless them, and may God bless the United States of America.",finance,1380609111

If I'm only going for the auto loan and don't need a bank account, does this mean I'll get hit with the auto loan hard pull AND another hard pull to become a member? I know multiple auto loans within a 14 day period are fine, I'm worried about that membership hard pull.

personalfinance,Advice on taking a 401k loan to wipe all of my other debt,"I've been on a really aggressive debt reduction plan through Consumer credit counseling services over the last three years.  After loosing a job, it was the best way for me to manage to meet my obligations.  Yesterday I realized that through a combination of debt payment and steady employment, I'm to the point where I could wipe out all of my unsecured debt with a 401k loan.  

I like the idea a lot.  It would add about 2 months to my payment plan to be debt free, but it would add a much $200/month to my budget.  As it is, I have about $100 of expendable income that's usually eaten up by unplanned groceries and putting gas in the car (I'm in a big city, so I mostly use public transportation).  The interest would go to me instead of creditors.  I'm aware there are risks if I loose/change my job, but I'm comfortable with those.  Unless the market goes absolutely crazy, The lack of the $50 monthly administrative fee would more than likely make up for the difference between the interest rate and the market rate of my portfolio.  I'm excited, but want to take some time to evaluate this before I pull the trigger.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin wil crash, Silkroad has been shutted down","""Federal agents have shut down the underground Silk Road, a website used by dealers to buy and sell illegal drugs using virtual currency, and arrested a Texas man who they say operated the site.


FBI agents arrested Ross Ulbricht, 29, allegedly known as ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" and ""DPR,"" Tuesday in San Francisco. Ulbricht appeared in court briefly Wednesday morning, said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney in New York.


Ulbricht is charged in New York with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking, soliciting a murder-for-hire and money laundering, according to a complaint unsealed Wednesday. Court documents allege that Ulbricht owned and operated since January 2011 an underground website known as ""Silk Road"" that gave drug dealers around the world a platform to sell heroin, cocaine, LSD and methamphetamine.


Ulbricht allegedly asked a Silk Road user on March 29 to murder another user who was threatening to release the names of thousands of Silk Road users, court papers say.


""Ulbricht has been willing to pursue violent means to maintain his control of the website and the illegal proceeds it generates for him,"" court papers say.


Users of the site on Wednesday saw a banner announcement with the logos of the Justice Department, FBI, IRS, Homeland Security and Drug Enforcement Administration and a message: ""This hidden site has been seized.""


FBI Agent Christopher Tarbell in an affidavit called the Silk Road website a ""sprawling black-market bazaar where illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services"" are regularly bought and sold. In 30 months, the FBI estimates the site generated $1.2 billion in sales and $80 million in commissions for the operator.


The website operated on an underground computer network known as ""The Onion Router"" or ""Tor,"" a special network of computers around the world that use complicated algorithms to disguise the unique internet addresses of each computer. Communications set through computers on the network bounce through a series of encrypted relays to make it extraordinarily difficult to trace the origin of the message.


Website users conducted transactions using an anonymous form of digital currency called ""Bitcoins.""


""Silk Road has emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today,"" Tarbell wrote. ""The site has sought to make conducting illegal transactions on the Internet as easy and frictionless as shopping online at mainstream e-commerce websites.""


Federal agents say Ulbricht, under the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, a reference to a character in ""The Princess Bride,"" controlled every aspect of the site, including the programming, maintenance, customer service and the massive profits.


FBI and other federal agents first tapped into the site in November 2011 and have made more than 100 undercover purchases of controlled substances, including ecstasy, cocaine, heroin and LSD, on the network. The drugs came from vendors located in the United States and at least 10 other countries, court papers say. Agents also purchased hacking services, including malicious software such as password stealing programs, the court papers say.


The site included listings for ""illegal drugs of nearly every variety,"" Tarbell said in court papers. As of Sept. 23, FBI agents counted nearly 13,000 listings for items such as marijuana, ecstasy, opioids, prescription drugs, heroin and cocaine. One seller advertised ""high quality #4 heroin all rock,"" court papers say.


FBI agents also found 159 listings for computer hacking and other services, such as hit men for hire and stolen credit card information.


Federal investigators also gained access to the site's servers to conduct forensic analysis that could trace buyers, sellers and the operator, court papers said""

personalfinance,Should I take a loan out on my 401k to pay off other debt before I purchase a house?,"TL;DR I'm selling my current house and buying another, I have more debt than actual money. 

I bought a house back when the market hit rock bottom. Recently pulled a CMA on my house and noticed I could list it around double what I paid, so my little investment worked out and it's time to sell. However, I wasn't expecting this so soon and I don't believe I'm in the best financial spot to do this. 
I have a few thousand in debt between a credit card and a motorcycle loan. The debt out weighs what I have in the bank and I know that effects credit score a good bit. The ball is about to start rolling on selling my current house and there's a high chance it will start rolling very quick. My credit card and bike loan are both pretty high interest rate at around 10-15% (that's high to me) but a loan from my 401k would be about 3%.
Is it advisable to take out a 401k loan and pay off the other debts at this point? I view it as a good thing because I'd have 1 consolidated payment with a much lower interest rate...credit scores could speak differently but I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to that. So hear I am. 
If I do this, would it be advisable to take out a little extra for my bank account or just the needed amount to pay the existing debt?",finance,1380731833

personalfinance,"Financial Pro-Tips: Make sure your W-4 withholdings are correct, and make use of Volunteer Income Tax Assistance programs if you are low-income!","It seems that I and a few other /r/personalfinance redditors have noticed that people seem to be over-withholding on their paychecks.  This will result in a refund on one's federal and/or state tax return. Any refund you receive is basically income that you let the government keep for your for free. Its an interest-free loan to the government. 

If you are a person who cannot save for their life and needs that refund in order to save any money, then fine, over-withhold. For those who would like to take home the maximum amount of money, listen up:

If you notice that you get a refund each year, you may want to adjust your withholdings on your W-4. This is a form you filled out when you began employment at your current job. You can change your W-4 withholdings at anytime. You will likely need to speak with your HR or Payroll department in order to obtain a new W-4. To assist you in properly filling out your W-4, check out the [IRS Withholding Calculator](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/IRS-Withholding-Calculator). 

If you are a low-income individual or family (you make approximately less than $51,000 annually), and would like assistance in filing your taxes, check out this IRS webpage on [Volunteer Income Tax Assistance](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Free-Tax-Return-Preparation-for-You-by-Volunteers). The volunteers at these sites will help you prepare your tax return for free. Just keep in mind that they are very strict on the rules, so make sure you bring everything they say to bring, otherwise they will turn you away and make you come back. Also, their sites tend to be very busy in January/February, so if you want a shorter wait time, go in March/April. This saves you any money you might need to spend at HR Block or on Turbotax, plus, the Volunteers are trained and all returns are reviewed by experienced preparers, often retired accountants. Also, if you would like to volunteer to help prepare tax returns, see the above link for more information (you don't need to know anything about taxes or finance or business to be able to help). 

So hopefully by reviewing your W-4, you can take home the exact amount of money you need to. The ideal withholding is that you owe a small amount or nothing come tax time. Use this extra money each paycheck to pay off debts, save up for something special, or just have a bit of extra spending money each month. 

Lastly, since I am a tax accountant myself, I cannot go without saying that if you can afford it, I would like to encourage you to go out and find a knowledgeable tax accountant. Not only will this person or firm prepare your tax return, they will also keep you up to date on tax planning strategies and possible saving tactics you can make use of. 

Although I am a tax accountant, I am by no means an expert and I'm sure I've forgotten something important. If anyone would like to chime in here, feel free!",finance,1380685774

My total payment amount doesn't change, but the principal appears to be going up while the interest amount drops. I'm confused on the Owed column though, which should be for payment 1 the (Original-Loan x 1.interest rate)-(principal+interest), and for payment 2 it would go (payment#1 owed x 1.interest rate)-(principal+interest), etc...

Unfortunately this doesn't work because by the time I get to my current payment #22 I owe more than I was originally loaned. How can I fix this?

Bitcoin,I'm a newbie - I'm a Libertarian who loves the idea of decentralized money - I have a few extra bucks to invest - But here's a list of 5 reasons why I haven't bought Bitcoins yet.,"1.  I can't easily buy them with a credit card or check.  The whole idea of wiring money scares me because I've never done it before.  (The key word is easily, without paying way over value.)

2.  I am afraid of losing my money.  I'm not afraid my money will lose value - I'm afraid of physically losing my key/code/wallet.  I buy new computers all the time.  I can't keep track of paper or usb sticks.  I know how easily data is lost.  Those digital pictures of my mom and dad I took 5 years ago - now that they've passed away I'd give almost anything to have them back - but I can't find them on my computers.  I'm afraid the same thing would happen to my bitcoins.

3.  I'm afraid of my government.  My senator is Chuck Schumer (who has spoken out against bitcoins).  I'm afraid that many people in the the federal government think like he does.  And I'm afraid that bitcoin transactions will be outlawed.  (However, I feel a little better about this now that silkroad is gone.)

4.  I understand bitcoin, but not as well as I'd like to.  I've watched dozens of ""What is bitcoin"" and ""Introduction to bitcoin"" videos.  I've read articles.  I read threads like this one on reddit.  But I'm still not confident that I know what I'm doing.  If you showed me a bitcoin address and a bitcoin key, I don't think I'd be able to tell you which was which.  And how is a wallet different from an address?  I'm embarrassed to admit that I am not entirely sure.

5.  I can't explain it to my wife.  Or friends.  Or family.  My wife - ""You want to spend several hundred dollars on money that's not real?!  And you only get like three coins... and they aren't even coins?  We need a new washing machine instead.""  My financial advisor -  ""Way too risky.  I would not recommend.  Sounds shady.""  Family - ""Isn't that the online money people use to buy drugs?  I read about it in the newspaper.  Are you buying drugs?""  *sigh*  Nobody understands why I'd want money that's based on deflationary system and that's not controlled by the government.

Bitcoin,SR truthers?,"I need to hear more people's input on this.

**The domain**  
The domain leads to an image which resembles the familiar DHS seizure image[1], but is not the same[2]. You know what's really weird? There's a cute little SR camel in the background of the image. Would law enforcement really take the time to personalize the image and advertise the brand they just killed?

**The bust**  
So they traced back to the founder via the clearnet. Using very unsophisticated analysis of forum and stack exchange posts and an email address, they discovered who founded SR. In a recent interview[3] DPR claims to have bought/obtained ownership of SR from the founder, meaning that supposedly the site's operation switched hands at least once. Whoever operated SR during the seizure is supposedly not whoever LE traced back as the founder.  
If they couldn't reveal the IP addresses via exploiting a weakness in Tor or related encryption they must have physically gotten to the servers via the operator, by raiding and arresting SR HQ. But if they raided the founder and not the operator, how did they access the servers?

**Sloppiness**  
Turns out (according to the information we have before us) DPR was a pretty sloppy dude. Really? He's running the most notorious online black market in history and he's sloppy? Sounds convenient.

**What happened?**  
All we actually know is that SR domain leads to some image, and some dude named Ross Ulbricht has charges pressed against him related to SR. How much can you conclude from that?  
My guess is that it's likely SR has been busted by feds, but the nature of the matter is extremely unclear. The most likely scenario is that what we know and what the media is reporting on is not the way things actually unfolded (either parallel construction or different guy or remote control of server or whatever). Another possible scenario is market manipulation: have someone get charged for being DPR, post an image talking about a seizure and reap XBT at low prices. The bitcointalk forum hack fits nicely with that theory (take down SR + forums = mass panic).  
If it's parallel construction to hide the fact that the NSA could compromise Tor hidden services, I think the world has bigger issues than SR.

Bitcoin,SR truthers?,"I need to hear more people's input on this.

**The domain**  
The domain leads to an image which resembles the familiar DHS seizure image[1], but is not the same[2]. You know what's really weird? There's a cute little SR camel in the background of the image. Would law enforcement really take the time to personalize the image and advertise the brand they just killed?

**The bust**  
So they traced back to the founder via the clearnet. Using very unsophisticated analysis of forum and stack exchange posts and an email address, they discovered who founded SR. In a recent interview[3] DPR claims to have bought/obtained ownership of SR from the founder, meaning that supposedly the site's operation switched hands at least once. Whoever operated SR during the seizure is supposedly not whoever LE traced back as the founder.  
If they couldn't reveal the IP addresses via exploiting a weakness in Tor or related encryption they must have physically gotten to the servers via the operator, by raiding and arresting SR HQ. But if they raided the founder and not the operator, how did they access the servers?

Also I'm sorry for the horrible format, I'm currently writing this at school on the iPads they gave us during class so I can't do the best. Anyways I'm interested in how econ works and how to make money. I don't particularly like economics but I want to be very smart with my money, invest and make smart choices.  I'm  a 17 year old who is still going to highschool and I'm in my junior year and still have my senior year to go. I plan to go to the college where my dad works so I'll get in there cheaper, I will still try to get scholarships to minimize any student loans I need to take. Hopefully I won't have any at all so it will help. Anyways I just got my first job, I work at publix, and I get paid $8.00 an hour. I'm trying to work about 16 hours a week with school. So far I've saved up $300 in my savings account ( I'm not sure in the interest rate on it, but it's not good ) and about $200 on my checking for spending whenever. 

Here are my questions:

1. I have a debit card, and I understand how it works. You have money on it and you spend it. Simple. What I don't understand is credit cards, I don't understand how they work or why you'd want to use a credit card and spend money you do not have on things instead of just waiting and getting with your own money and not paying interest.

2. Should I start investing or saving money in aggressive savings accounts? I don't know where or how to do this.

At what point should I pay off the loan? $200 is a big chunk of money when my other monthly expenses are only $700. If I pay it off before retirement it would really reduce my investment principle (assuming $120k at retirement). Should I continue paying the 200 each month during my first few years of retirement and let my investment grow more? Pay off before retirement? Continue paying minimum for 30 years?

* This has been a joint operation run the cybercrime squad within the FBI's New York field office. It involved the **FBI, DEA, IRS and Homeland Security's investigative unit**.
* ---
* It's unstated from when the investigation started, but they received a **complete copy** of the Silk Road web server on the **23^rd of July 2013**. This was all done under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which implies that they had access to current site information up until the point they shut the site down.
* **This included user account and transaction information**. It's unclear whether or not this covers addresses and other sensitive transaction information.
* **This also apparently covers at least 60 days worth of messages from the period where the site was copied.
* From February 6, 2011 to July 23 2013, **9,519,664BTC was generated in sales**, 614,305BTC going directly to DPR in the way of ""commissions"". This comes to a total of 1,229,465 transactions.
* Based on the copy of the site which the FBI received, they believe DPR to have been the sole operator and owner of SR, handling all aspects of the site himself and delegating only user affairs to appointed moderators.
* ---
* In March of this year, a SR user/vendor called ""FriendlyChemist"" attempted to extort DPR via SR's private message system, providing proof that he had the names/addresses of thousands of vendors/users after having allegedly hacked a bigger vendor. He demanded $500,000USD, saying that he needed the money to pay off his supplier. DPR then stated that he wished to speak to FriendlyChemist's supplier.
* A user called ""redandwhite"" then proceeded to contact DPR, stating that he was FriendlyChemist's supplier and also the owner of his debt. **DPR then solicited redandwhite to ""execute"" FriendlyChemist**, supplying redandwhite his full name and address. After having agreed on terms, **DPR sent redandwhite approximately $150,000USD (1,670BTC) to have FriendlyChemist killed**. redandwhite later provided photographic proof of the alleged murder.
* Investigators could not find any record of somebody in that region being killed around that date or matching that description. This possibly implies that DPR was duped/scammed, **but**, DPR is also quoted as having told redandwhite the following: ***""Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for 80k.""***
* ---
* **DPR has been identified as Ross William Ulbricht.**
* &gt; ""He is 29 years old, graduated from the University of Texas with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics in 2006. From 2006 to 2010, he attended graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania School of Materials Science and Engineering.""
* His LinkedIn profile is at: http://www.linkedin.com/in/rossulbricht

## Now, onto how he got caught...

* An agent involved in the investigation (""Agent-1""), found the first few references to SR on the internet from somebody only identified as ""altoid"", attempting to promote the site in its beginning days, in January of 2011.
* In October of the same year, a user also going by the name of ""altoid"" made a posting on Bitcoin Talk titled ""a venture backed Bitcoin startup company"", which directed interested users to **""rossulbricht at gmail dot com""**.
* That email address is what led to DPR's downfall.
* ---
* After identifying ""altoid"", they started connecting the ""DPR"" identity to Ulbricht pretty quickly.
* Ulbricht's Google+ page and YouTube profile both make multiple references to the a website dubbed the ""Mises Institute"". DPR's signature on the SR forums contained a link to the Mises Institute.
* DPR cited the ""Austrian Economic theory"" along with the works of Ludwig von *Mises* and Murray Rothbard, all of which are closesly associated with the Mises Institute.
* Server logs show that someone logged onto the SR administration panel from San Fransisco around the same time that Ulbricht was staying in San Fransisco.
* Multiple fake IDs were intercepted by U.S. Customs &amp; Border Patrol while on their way to an address which Ulbricht was living at the time. These IDs all carried photos of Ulbricht but had false names and details. This was around the same time that DPR stated in a message that he was acquiring some fake IDs to buy new servers.
* When questioned by Homeland Security about the fake IDs, he refused to answer any questions but then stated that anyone could purchase such things using ""Silk Road"" and ""Tor"".
* The address which Ulbricht was staying at was being rented in cash and he was living with housemates who knew him under a name which corresponded with one of the fake IDs.
* He posted on StackOverflow using his real name, inquiring about how to use curl/PHP to grab things off Tor, before quickly changing the name to ""frosty"" (with a fake email: frosty@frosty.com)

## Second murder conspiracy allegation

* A [superseding indictment was filed in federal court in Maryland](https://ia601904.us.archive.org/1/items/gov.uscourts.mdd.238311/gov.uscourts.mdd.238311.4.0.pdf) less than a day after Ulbricht was initially arrested and charged. **This details DPR attempting to have somebody tortured and murdered** for $80,000.
* This is likely the incident which he referenced when speaking to ""redandwhite"" about having ""FriendlyChemist"" killed.
* **He has been indicted in Maryland for charges stemming from these allegations of murder for hire.**
* The charges are as follows: **Attempted Witness Murder, Use of Interstate Commerce Facilities in Commission of Murder-for-Hire**, Conspiracy to Distribute a Controlled Substance and Aiding &amp; Abetting.
* It is alleged that in February of this year, **undercover agents approached DPR** claiming to want to sell large amounts of cocaine, with DPR acting as a middle-man to facilitate the finding of a buyer for the drugs.
* One of DPR's ""employees"" then agreed to receive the drugs and was then apprehended by police upon receiving a package which he believed to be a kilo of cocaine.
* This employee then allegedly stole money from some SR users and went missing, which led DPR to believe that he might talk to the police.
* **DPR then solicited the undercover agents to have the employee tortured** to give the stolen Bitcoins back.
* **A day later, DPR changed his mind and requested that they kill him** after torturing him, stating that he *""was on the inside for a while, and now that he's been arrested, I'm afraid he'll give up info.""*
* They agreed on a price of **$80,000** for the torturing and murder of the employee, with $40,000 paid in advance and $40,000 paid on proof of completion.
* DPR then sent $40,000 from Technocash Limited to a bank account at the Capitol One Bank in Washington D.C.
* The undercover agents provided DPR with photos of the employee being tortured, then finally, dead.
* DPR then sent another $40,000 using the same method.

## Miscellaneous notes
* His Facebook URL is at: https://www.facebook.com/rossulbricht/

* There's a pretty lengthy ""interview"" with him and a friend, discussing their lives available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olib3jnvSmw (doesn't reference SR at all)

Bitcoin,"Some of my big concerns with bitcoin in the wake of Silk Road, from an experienced real world trader fairly new to the bitcoin concept.","There are many things about this I could go into after commenting, studying, reading, and thinking much about bitcoin and silk road today (after hearing about it some time ago).

Few thoughts:

I think a lot of the technology &amp; cryptography geniuses (not being sarcastic) involved in bitcoin and various spinoff ideas need to study markets, trading, fiscal policy and currency in depth.  Especially the history of trading.  See a book called ""Extraordinary Popular Delusions &amp; The Madness Of Crowds"", among others, for example.  See the internet bubble late 90s/early 2000s.  See the Mortgage crisis, where risky mortgages were packaged as safe ones.  Many many examples throughout history going back to the invention of money.  The many flaws in the current bitcoin system are fairly clear to me as an experienced trader in the ""real world"".  

One main red flag thing to look into is ""how easily can I cash out my bitcoin holdings for real US/Euro/Pound currency if I need/want to.""  Seems extremely illiquid on the cashing out side (similar to how some sports betting and poker sites have been in the past).  A true ""run on the bank"" would cause immediate panic and market shutdown -- look at the what the ""flash crash"" did today to the infrastructure of the bitcoin market, not to mention the prices.  And a lot of ""banks"" would disappear into the night, not redeeming/cashing out.   

#2 Was there ever a currency, commodity or anything else that was issued with a strict calendar time limit of when they would stop producing it?  That inherently promotes hoarding and artificially boosts the value.  Why would you spend the currency on goods instead of saving/investing it, if the supply is limited and will eventually stop (because it is then destined to be in shortage).  The only place really worth spending it is illegal markets that don't accept credit cards and established currency.  It likely will collapse on its own weight, otherwise 1 bitcoin would end up equaling $1 million or $1 billion or more (good luck cashing that out for real legal goods or an accepted currency).  Talk about inflation.  It actually reminds me more of a global electronic version of Beanie Babies and baseball cards that were issued in strict limited edition amounts - not a currency.  You could perhaps compare it to diamonds (rather then gold), where a couple of producers attempt to strictly limit the supply each year in order to (in my view) artificially maintain high prices) -- but diamonds are a beautiful rare gem (and a real thing) that has held value over time (and women like them, they are sparkly).

#3 Despite the bells and whistles of the various entrepeneurial websites, the regulations and rules that make for organized stock/bond/currency markets around the world are not present at all in the bitcoin ""market"".  Among other things, there are no put options available to bet on downside, no short selling, no margin, no interest rate on holdings (that might be a good thing) ... but the biggest problem is no liquidity, oversight and established legitimate places of trade.  Hence why ""exchanges"" and websites go belly up, are fraudulent, get hacked, have 7 day delays when the market gets busy, etc.  There are prices 10%, 20% different on different websites at the same time ... not to mention the massive (and probably hidden) buy/sell spread price these ""exchanges"" are charging.  In modern world liquid markets trading, any real arbitrage is usually immediately closed for example.

There's much more I could pick apart in it, but I'm tired.  Bottom line is that currently bitcoin is a wild west hacker's and scammer's paradise and buyer beware (if you ever want to cash out).  Creating a virtual mountain of virtual gold out of thin air that is pre-determined to be ""tapped out"" of gold in 40 years (or whenever) sounds like the Wizard of Oz to me.

personalfinance,"Any credit card ""gotchas"" to look out for?","Hi, I'm fairly new to credit cards, having spent most of my life believing they were the devil.

I have one card now and enjoy getting cash back, which is basically free money. I wanted to look into getting more rewards cards, since different ones will offer more on certain types of purchases. I saw that the Chase Freedom card offers 5% cashback on Amazon purchases, more than the 3% offered on Amazon's own rewards card. How are they able to do this?

Before, I was only looking at annual fees (I don't really care about interest rates since I pay the entire balance each month anyway), but now I'm wondering if there may be other hidden fees or costs that I need to look out for, that enable them to offer these seemingly-better rewards.

personalfinance,Should we consolidate our credit cards?,"Hi PF. I've been lurking and reading for a few months now (this is a throwaway acct) and I've been motivated to become debt free in two years.

I plan on paying down the credit cards my spouse and I have aggressively with whatever spare money we have. I've made a complete budget that my family of 3 can live comfortably on while cutting costs as much as possible, and have budgeted out how much spare money we can throw at our cc debt (which was surprisingly quite a bit). The interest rates on the cards are super high with the highest being 29% and the lowest being almost 22%. Between my spouse and I, we have 9 credit cards with the total debt of 17k. (average apr is 25%) If you need more info, I can list the cards here and the total amount of debt. I've gone to unbury.me and put in the cards, and the snowball method seemed to mathematically make more sense to do since we'd pay less interest on it and get it paid off only one month later, though my spouse and I aren't opposed to paying off using the avalanche mode. 

We have decent credit scores with my spouse being in the mid 700's and mine being in the low 700s. 

We will be keeping the cards open after the debt is paid, but we won't wrack up more than what we can pay off at the end of the month anymore. I grew up in fear of owning credit cards after seeing my parents go through bankruptcy because they couldn't control their spending and I got my only two credit cards last year (when I was 28) to build up my credit. They happen to be the ones with the lowest balance and the lowest aprs and will be paid off through minimum payments within 4 months. I want to work with my spouse to totally kick our combined cc debt in the butt.

I've been entertaining the idea to see if my spouse and I can get the credit cards consolidated into a lower interest loan and pay it off aggressively through that so we aren't getting hit with over $350 a month in interest. We have not used our credit cards in half a year and we do not plan on using them any time soon. I am just not sure if this is a good idea, but with our amazingly high interest rates I'm very tempted to do it and store the cards away until we've 1. paid the consolidated loan off and 2. need to put a minimum purchase on it to keep the card open and build credit, paying the card off at the end of the month. 

We have a savings of $800 and by the end of the year it'll be over $1000 since we auto deposit into our savings.

I apologize for the novel and if any clarification is needed I'll gladly give it. Consolidating the debt has been something I've been hemming and hawing over for a long while. I'm just not sure if it is a good idea and need insight. 

Thank you!",finance,1380764367

personalfinance,Buying a Car? Get GAP insurance!,"Just wanted to share this because it can save your wallet; When you are forced to get a car, in order to make money on the loan, get the lowest interest rate you can and then BUY THE GAP INSURANCE, and then re-invest the money you would have spent on the car (An investment returning  0% interest) in something more lucrative.

Don't know what GAP insurance is? Basically, it pays off your car if it gets in a wreck.  This stops you from having to pay off a car loan for  car that was wrecked in the worst case situation, because the instance the insurance company says ""oh crap, its a total loss,  we don't want to pay you"" the insurance pays the car loan in full WHILE YOU STILL HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY A NEW ONE AND DO IT AGAIN.

More details here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAP_Insurance

Edit: Getting people commenting who mistakenly think you should pay cash for a brand new car. Not true, only do that for used cars you cant get gap insurance on, as otherwise you can spend a full $25k on new car that makes you no money, or you can spend almost nothing, get the gap insurance, then invest the same 25k in something that makes you a nice least 5-8% annual return (REIT ETF's with vanguard, for example) while paying at most 3% (unless your credit sucks, the its more expensive)  on the car that will be FULLY PAID OFF if something happens to it... aka I'm MAKING MONEY by financing it at a low rate, and letting the money I would have spent on it make money instead, and fully have mitigated the risk of having a debt with no asset via getting the Gap insurance.",finance,1380930025

personalfinance,I am a financial MESS.,"I'm in a slump!

Here's my story. My mom passed away last year. I'm 20 and now own a condo. I make $743.57 every 2 weeks. ($12 an hour) I also have a roommate/tenant that pays $400 a month.

I have $4,200.00 in a savings account that earns .75% interest. (yay!) But this is my ""emergency money"" as I have no family and need it in case of a real emergency.. not a ""I need a new couch emergency"".

I take classes at the local community college, which actually pays me almost a grand more than my tuition and book cost is, but I wasn't able to go for this semester because their financial aid office is slow and I didn't have the money to lay out before the semester started. 

I had a tenant who owes me ~1k and I'm in the process of taking him to small claims court. He got a $70 parking ticket in my car, which I had to pay, and left the room a complete mess and I had to have the carpet ripped up, and will need to get a new one installed soon. Around the same time this happened, I had to have a service guy come in for my washing machine,($60) had to buy 2 tires,($130) went to see a useless doctor that I have to pay $150, and had to have the cmc replaced on my car, ($150). This set me back a great deal and I'm trying to get back on track. Especially because I have to pay to get my mom's headstone engraved shortly, and need to pay an attorney to go through the will/probate process with shortly. 

I owe a credit card ~$500, yes I make all my payments on time. Sometimes the minimum, but it's on time. This was from school expenses and it accumulated back when I lost my job. (18% interest rate)

I spend ~$60-$80 in gas per week.


I pay;

*$980 quarterly for property taxes

*~$50 quarterly for water

*$208 monthly in maintenance fees

*$54 monthly for internet 

*$47.50 for gas at a fixed monthly rate

*~$108 a month for electric (this varys)

*$130 monthly for car insurance ( I live in NJ and have 4 points, full coverage)

*$56 monthly for condo insurance

*$65 monthly for phone bill

*(edit: I forgot this) $46.00 Security system 

*$8 monthly for some dumb stupid six flags season pass that I didn't even use 

I also forgot to mention that I'm a spending ADDICT. Especially when it comes to eating out. And buying clothes. It sounds silly, but this is a MAJOR lifestyle change for me.  I've opened a separate account for spending in which 10% of my check gets deposited, and that's my ""spending money"" for the week. I haven't really gotten adjusted to using that yet, but I'm working on it.  

In January I qualify to be a part of a 401k program, which I plan to get into, right now I just don't know anything about it.

I also use apps like Receipt Hog and AppTrailers to earn ""beer money"" but it's literally pennies compared to what my spending habits are. I'm looking into getting a second part time job, but only until January as I plan to go back to school for the spring semester.

I am an absolute financial MESS. I know the first step is to stop buying clothes and stuff. I especially need to start cooking, but cooking for one person sucks. What are some things I can do to help curve/cut my spending habits and eating habits? Do I even make enough to be living on my own like this? I attempt to crunch the numbers but end up getting frustrated.",finance,1380908481

personalfinance,Is this loan for medical school from a family member a better choice than government loans?,"My husband's grandmother is offering him a loan for medical school at 3-4% interest for up to $11,000 per year, and it's at no interest while he is in medical school. The loan comes with a condition that we pay the full amount within four years of him leaving med school. These are very strict terms, and she has written an official legal contract that he would have to sign.

We can get a government loan alternatively at 6.8% interest for the entire amount we need. It accumulates interest immediately, but we would have a much longer time period to pay it off.

The family loan seems like a better deal, but I'm worried about our ability to pay it off so quickly. In the four years we would be expected to pay it off, my husband would make about 40-50k annually if he graduates. Of course there is no guarantee that he will graduate and make that much. I am working towards a job that will make us 50k -100k annually during this time period, but certainty is low and I could end up making minimum wage, for all I know. We will also begin making minimum payments on another loan from his mother during this time period for 70k at 5% interest. 

If our career plans fall through, we will still have to pay his family loans, as his family are not the type to back down from a contract, or have sympathy if we failed at our career progressions. This could leave us in a vulnerable position. Not being able to pay it back could also damage family relationships. Doesn't the government loan offer forgiveness after a certain period of time? By the way, I'll have no loans of my own to pay off during this time period. Which loan seems like the better option?

EDIT: Talked more with my husband, and he seems to think his grandmother will have more leniency in loan repayment if events happen beyond our control. I'm still hesitant to deal with her though, because of negative prior experience with her ""deals"". (She made us a deal that she would pay for his med school if and only if he went to a school in our home state. After he enrolled in a home state medical school, she told us by ""pay"", she meant she would only provide a partial loan)

EDIT2: We are going to try offering this deal to his grandmother: In the event that my husband does not graduate with an MD, with have 10 years to pay off the loan. If he does graduate, we get deferral during the four years after medical school in residency, with interest accumulation, but no payments due. That seems like a reasonable offer, given that this is what federal loans offer. I'm not convinced that mixing finances and money is necessarily a bad thing. Either way, we have already mixed blood and money, since we are already in debt to his mother.",finance,1380904747

http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/news/2013/10/02/economist-us-labor-market-recovery.html

University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith has this to say about the current labor market recovery: It’s a fraud.
That’s because there’s more to assessing economic recovery than just monthly payroll job gains and a declining unemployment rate, he said.
“You need to look at the number of jobs being created in the context of the potential number of workers in the U.S. economy,” Snaith said. “The gap between payroll employment and the Congressional Budget Office estimates of the potential number of workers in the U.S. economy is pretty darn scary right now.”
If payroll job growth were to persist at the average level of the past three jobs reports and increase at just 148,000 jobs per month, it would take until December 2021 for employment to reach its CBO estimated potential, he added.
In his 2013 third-quarter U.S. forecast, Snaith explains that by just focusing on the unemployment rate, many analysts erroneously are predicting a fast recovery that’s simply not there yet.
That’s why it’s not surprising that consumers are holding back on spending, which in the past has brought the economy out of the doldrums, he said.
Snaith was only one of four national economists to predict that the federal Reserve Bank would continue to funnel billions of dollars into the market on a daily basis as a way to help stimulate the economy and not begin tapering that process until 2014.
“Will the Federal Reserve’s exit be more like Ginger Rogers gliding across the dance floor or Miley Cyrus awkwardly twerking remains to be seen,” Snaith said. “But given the phony labor-market recovery it could be some time before the Fed hits the dance floor.”

Bitcoin,The possiblity of rescuing permanately lost coins,"All of you should know the feds have seized over 4 million USD worth in Bitcoins. These Bitcoins are permanently lost (as far as I can tell).

However, suppose we update the client with a protocol as such

    A) Every month that a UTXO is not used, it must broadcast a signal to the network that
        1) Confirms the activeness of the UTXO's
        2) Confirms the good use of the XBT
    B) If a UTXO is not marked as active for 2 months it will
        1) Be marked as trash
        2) The equivalent amount will be distributed as genesis XBT
            a) %1 of trash marked coins will be distributed each block
            b) Once distributed will mark as ordinary coins again
    A) Each block will contain a transaction moving trash marked BTC to the miner.
        1) This will require no ""private key"" like genesis transactions.

It's a rough idea, but I think it's a good idea.

* In the future when mining is very unprofitable (considering the block reward), this will add some extra BTC to it

* In the future if XBT becomes very popular, many, many coins will be lost, reducing the actual value of ~21m XBT to much less.

Some might argue the limited supply would help XBT, I argue that it would damage the scalability. Especially if we have to switch to using, for example, 16 decimals.

Unilever frågor vinst varning över kollapsande valutor i ""framväxande marknader""

Unilever, Magnum glass till Dove tvål jätte, utfärdade en vinst varning i natt, skyller de kollapsande valutorna i så kallade ""framväxande marknader"" som Brasilien och Indien.

Samtidigt trots varma ord från västerländska politiska ledare på att förbättra ekonomiska data, sa det utvecklade marknaderna förblev ""platt ner"". Som ett resultat, varnade det för en €500m (£417m) brist i försäljning detta kvartal.

Framväxande marknaden valutor har rasat under de senaste månaderna i väntan på Federal Reserve avsmalnande av dess kvantitativa lättnader program. De med stor budget och bytesbalansen underskott har drabbats värst.

Unilever sa det nu förväntas det aktuella kvartalet underliggande försäljningstillväxten för att komma in på 3 till 3,5 procent. Investerare hade tidigare förväntade tillväxt på 5 procent.

Valutorna i Brasilien och Indien, som ha krossat särskilt illa av oro för deras ekonomier, har ont Unilever särskilt dåligt som de är två av sina största globala marknader. Indonesien är en annan stor ekonomi som har uppträtt dåligt för företaget.

Unilever har lidit av utländsk valuta flyttar till stor del eftersom dess framväxande marknader regioner köpa råvaror i dollar med sina lokala valutor.

Unilever förutser att den framväxande marknadsekonomier BNP-tillväxt, en omvandlad till årsplanet 9 procent under första halvan av året, nu har sjunkit till 6 procent.

Även om Unilever är först i sin bransch av snabbrörliga konsumentvaror att varna på dess tillväxttakt, grupp sport Adidas knackade ut en liknande alert i mitten av September, med hänvisning till av samma skäl.

Marknader är chockade av tillkännagivandet, till stor del eftersom det inte har utfärdats tills efter aktiemarknaden hade stängt för kvällen.

Siffrorna hade bara kommit till ljuset från sammanställa alla septembers månatliga Försäljningsstatistik från dess olika divisioner, sade källor på företaget.

På den positiva sidan sa Unilever fjärde kvartalet borde vara bättre på ett antal enstaka faktorer som lanseringen av flera nya produkter som skulle förstärkas av extra marknadsföring investeringar. Unilever VD Paul Polman, bilden till vänster, räknar fortfarande uppfyller hans woolier mål att slå marknadens försäljningsvolymer.

Graham Jones, analytiker på Panmure Gordon, sade: ""Unilever är skickliga på att hantera volatiliteten på tillväxtmarknader. Fram till nu hade styrkan i tillväxtmarknaderna maskeras verksamheten nedslående utvecklade marknader. Uppdateringen flaggor som på utvecklade marknader måste arbeta hårdare. Vi hade förutspått framväxande marknader kommer att ha försvagat men vi hade också väntat några tillväxt i de utvecklade marknaderna men detta inte var fallet.""

Aktierna förväntas öppna kraftigt ner i morse.

Jim Armitage: Detta är hur det börjar
Detta är hur det börjar. Om du hade några tvivel Storbritannien skulle påverkas av bristningen av den framväxande marknader bubblor pumpas upp av QE under de senaste åren, här är beviset. Fed körde spekulanter att låna löjliga summor pengar, på löjligt låga räntor, dåligt köra länder som kunde dåligt råd att låna. Nu när QES kranar är inställd på Inaktivera, västra pengar kör hem och dessa ekonomier är kvar för att lida. Våra största och bästa företag känner bakåtblåsning, utan real tillväxt på utvecklade marknader att kompensera. Utdelning, och med dem, våra besparingar, kommer att skadas. Håll i er.

personalfinance,Sell our house to pay off debts?,"Based on some market research it looks like we could probably sell our house for about $100k more than we owe on it. We have about $50k in unsecured debts (credit cards mostly). Would it be a good idea to sell our house, pay off our debts, and bank the balance? 

My thought is that the market will probably go down again in the next 3-5 years. We could rent for that time period, or buy a smaller house a little further from ""town"". 

Has anyone else done anything like this?

UPDATE: Thanks for all of the great advice. I am most interested in looking at refinancing our house and cashing out or getting a HELOC. With that said - does anyone have a recommendation for a good mortgage company to work with? The guy I used to refinance a couple years ago turned out to be more expensive than I had anticipated. 

UPDATE 2: I spoke w/ a mortgage person from Quicken Loans. They seem a little pushy but I understand the business. This is what I was offered. $232k mortgage (I owe $189k) with $43,000 cash out. There would be no fees or closing costs. Interest rate 4.99%. A little higher than I expected on the interest but I understand with cashing out it might cost more. The payment would be $1437/mo including P+I, homeowners insurance and taxes. I currently pay $1265/mo to the net would be $172/mo more in mortgage payments and $1500/mo less in credit card payments.

Like NZDJPY  higher.  Divergent policy (RBNZ looking to tighten, BoJ easing) is the best reason to be long for me.  Even given risk of sustained USD weakness should the shutdown drag on, debt ceiling get out of hand or FOMC taper schedule continue to be pushed out, it is likely that the NZD will strengthen faster than the JPY would.  This was evident post-FOMC in Sep, NZDUSD rallied harder than USDJPY fell, and USDJPY even made up the fall the next day … After the FOMC no taper announcement, NZDJPY put on 30 points that day, then 130 the next day as USDJPY rebounded.  So not too worried about the USD … 

Earning positive carry also, so no problems if it muddles for  a bit before going higher.

personalfinance,A question about the financial feasibility of attending medical school in the caribbean.,"A lot of people these days who apply to medical school and are rejected time and time again are considering applying to schools in the caribbean. One of the most well known schools, SGU, would cost approx. US $350,000 over the course of 4 years (including all expenses). At the end of those 4 years, you would have an MD degree, but then you would have to complete at least 3 years of specialty training (a residency) before being able to practice in the US as a family physician. You are paid during residency, but not very much. So I doubt you could do more than pay down your interest during this period. You would be ~30 years old when you start practicing, with $350,000 US of debt.

Family physicians in the united states are paid, on average, $175,000 per year. However, they have overhead operating costs ranging from 25-35% and then of course there is income tax.

From my calculations you would be lucky to take home $90,000 per year after overhead and taxes. 

I figure you can count on contributing at LEAST $30,000 / year to repaying your loan ($2500 per month). However at this rate, with an interest rate of 2.5% (this is how much I am looking at) it would take you 14 years to pay off your loan.

So my questions are:

Does my math make sense? and
Is this a manageable financial situation?

news,Never Cry Wolf,"It's been a long time since I've seen such oppression of free speech.  This is an attempt to conceal evidence and silence people of the like used only by the Obama administration.  Why is there such fear of the citizenry from the local council to the Federal levels?  What are the politicos trying to hide?  Confidential information being leaked.  False reports filed to blog sites.  People removed from committees that serve the city.  The tyranny that reigns is out of hand.  How can people get away with it?  Simple.  They are aided and abetted by the media.  This post was removed from an Oshawa Newspaper to prevent information from getting out to the populace.  Here is the article.  An article that was shut down and deleted to protect one city councillor who has been alleged to be leaking confidential information in exchange for favours.  The People of Oshawa and area need to see this.   Please like and share.         Marvin Whinden, Metroland Blogger


There has been plenty of discussion over the last week about councilor Amy England and issues on Facebook. Here is my take on it all.
From what I gather it all started with a photo of Amy and a photo from a cigarette pack placed side by side. I fail to find any sexism with this photo, I don’t see how it can be considered bullying, in my opinion, it was childish at best. 
But true to form, Amy wont let an opportunity to be in the press pass her by. Instead of just shrugging it off for what it was, she cries sexism, bullying and people still talking about her looks instead of “real” issues.
I find all these statements absolutely bizarre as the councilor was quoted in the Toronto Star as saying “She applied to the makeover show to get the look that would pique voter’s interest”
When it comes to online bullying, I have to shake my head. Teens are committing suicide from real bullying and bullying is getting quite the attention as of late, as it should. For Amy to throw herself in this same category is disgusting and a slap in the face to those that are true victims of bullying. 
Make no mistake Amy gets what she deserves. She manipulates and dominates her “terms of friends” or whatever she calls it to allow those to comment on her Facebook. Almost a year ago I wrote a blog on politicians, Facebook and censorship, so this is nothing new to me. 
The problem with Amy, is Amy. It’s no secret that people are now coming out and saying Amy has offered confidential information to them in exchange for advice. 
During her fainting episode at a council meeting she joked about waking up to the people who provided her with assistance, in what I thought was a tasteless joke.
If she doesn’t like what you post, she will ban you from her Facebook. Just the other week she was discussing Oshawa returning to the ward system. Apparently she didn’t like my comment and told me not to comment, as I don’t live in Oshawa. Shortly after that I was removed from her Facebook. Funny enough, a few days later I received an email saying she was now following me on Twitter.
Am I the only one that thinks that is just a little weird?
Which takes me to the Oshawa Facebook groups. Although I do not belong to any of them, I do read them often. Quite a few of these people that post there are very knowledgeable when it comes to Oshawa politics, some of these folks are former councilors who provide very informative information. There are over a thousand people belonging to the four pages that I read and from what I sense, most of these people have had enough when it comes to councilor England. 
Councillor England is the one who should stop playing games with people on Facebook. She needs to worry more about the issues facing Oshawa than playing on social media. Most of us as a child were taught about “crying wolf” that lesson could prove valuable for her right about now.

You may not be from Oshawa.  You may ask yourself, why does this matter to me?  It should matter to you.  This could be your town.  Your city.  Where the voices are silenced, tyranny and treachery are allowed to take root and grow.",cryptocurrency,1381085781

U.S. housing regulator files paperwork for new securitization firm
WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The regulator overseeing major mortgage finance sources Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Monday said it filed legal paperwork to create a common platform for the two firms to issue mortgage-backed securities.
The regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said in a statement it established a new company called the Common Securitization Solutions, LLC, as a limited liability company with the state of Delaware. The joint venture is intended to help securitize home loans and consolidate some of functions currently replicated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.


That press release follows along with Berkowitz's predictions for a restructuring. I'm wondering that since this is a subsidiary, this could create a secondary market, creating competition, which would allow parent companies to take profits.

personalfinance,"I am unemployed, and I'm not sure how to organize my financial mess. (CA)","I'm in my 20s. I'm trying to just be organized as I have been laid off and I've never really organized myself in terms of my money. Let me rephrase, I have zero working knowledge on personal finance.

I just want to work with a method where I can quickly be caught up with and update my finances. I wasn't sure where to begin. 

I don't want to make a sob story, as I understand now that I'm responsible for where I am. But for context, currently I have no income, I have 3 credit cards at about 5K in total (interest rates are 8, 19, 21, but all are maxed), and 1 item in collections for 1500 (a phone bill that was left on me, tried arguing it with rogers, it's a no go).  So my total debt is apprx. less than 7K. 

I am presently living with relatives for no rent, and my bills are a cell phone (80), contract ends march 2014 $200 to end early), internet (55), medication (100), groceries (150 flexible), pet expenses (50-80), and transportation/gas (not sure how much I spend).  
My monthly credit card minimums are about 90 per month. 
So I suppose my monthly expenses (and of course this is a ballpark)
total apprx. $550. 

Right now I have only 1K in the bank, and I've paid my bills for the month, trying to figure out what to do next. 

What would be the best way to organize this mess so I can streamline my finances and try to get back on my feet? 
I know I need to find an income which I'm trying to do, but even after that, I'm not entirely sure how to handle my debts and my expenses. I have never budgeted, I have zero savings. 

I would appreciate any help or advice, I take complete ownership for the situation I'm in, but I do feel like I have a chance to get out. 

My biggest goal is to move out to my own place (not sure how to work towards that). I am okay with renting for now, but I feel like I should not be staying with relatives for too long as they have their own struggles.

As of right now, my g/f and I are living together and plan on marrying in the near future. She just graduated college but accumulated $120k worth of student loans at 8% interest which she needs to start paying come December. I have no debt besides my monthly credit card bill, which I pay in full, and have $80k banked. 

I obviously don't want this debt hanging over us for the next 30 years. I know I need to talk to a financial adviser about this soon. I am assuming the best way to handle this would be to put a large sum of money to pay off the loans (50k or so) and then pay off as much as we can each month. Would you guys agree with this?

The 8% interest rate seems really high as well. Should I consider taking out a loan to cover the rest at a lower interest rate (seems logical to me or am I missing somthing)?

We currently save about 700 a month when we stick to our budget (Which were pretty good about). I don't want to leave my account empty, using all 80k of it.

personalfinance,An advisor’s rant about this subreddit and some advice for those willing to stop down and hear me out…,"Hello, r/PersonalFinance!

I’ve been lurking on here for a while reading posts and reading the responses from, for the most part, a well-intentioned, educated community of personal financers, but something bothers me and I thought I’d share my opinion if any of you are open to listening to it.  First of all, I’ll preface by saying I’m a RIA at an independent, fee-only wealth management firm.  I’m a fiduciary, meaning legally I have to do what’s in my client’s best interests at all times.  You may be thinking, well, duh, don’t all advisors?  “No” is my short answer and I’ll elaborate later on.  I mention this so you at least know where I’m coming from with this post.

Now then, what made me want to reach out is that I see the same things over and over again on here.  99% of the time it’s a question somewhere between “I’m X years old, what should I be doing” and something much more specific like “beyond my employer match in my 401(k) do the high fees justify the tax deference or would it be better to invest after-tax with better investments in a brokerage account?”  Regardless of where the question falls within this spectrum, it hurts me knowing that questions so important (it’s you and the people you care most about in the world’s financial well beings we are dealing with here) are being asked in a community forum despite how awesome reddit and its members are. Knowing that hotdog_butt answers and gets one or two upvotes without knowing really anything about the uniqueness of your financial situation beyond the short summary you provided is a scary thought to me because I know the repercussions of poor advice - I see it every day.  But, will you really take action on that advice?  Even if it’s sound advice like the market is efficient at setting prices to the point that picking individual stocks and timing the market is futile, and you completely get it, what will you do next?  I’d be willing to bet that nothing happens as a result of most posts on here.  Feel free to tell me I'm way off.

But wait, I’m sure very educated finance people have at least organized the sidebar linking to articles from respective professionals, right? When I go to the first link “OK, So …I Have X Dollars – What Should I Invest In?” despite this question still getting asked at least 5 times a day in here, the advice in the link is simply bad advice; yet, it is probably the go-to bookmark for all the great visitors to this community.  Take for example when the article talks about building up reserves, “Tip: consider I Bonds, but be wary of the one-year period in which you cannot redeem them and hold other cash while these mature” I bonds for reserves?  Sure, if you don’t mind a 3 month interest penalty.  I bonds aren't appropriate for cash or cash equivalent reserves.  Oh, but it gets better, “Tip: tax-exempt bonds work well for non-retirement goals as they are generally free of federal, and sometimes state, taxes – just be sure to match duration to need.” Again, poor advice, especially considering a 21 year old or a 52 year old with varying risk appetites and income brackets are reading this article.  A tax-free bond like a muni should only be considered in unique situations like high income tax bracket individuals and families living in high state tax states.  This excludes tons of people immediately that wouldn’t know that they should have been excluded.  Regardless, muni’s don’t make sense even in the other cases.  Why?  Because the after-tax yield that is so appealing that seems to beat the higher interest rate, of say a taxable government bond really doesn’t because nobody ever liquidates their bond fund to pay for the interest on those bonds.  They either increase the amount they owe or reduce their refund.   Meanwhile, the higher interest rate SAFER bonds are compounding at a higher rate than the tax-free muni.

I can go on “…could suggest a shift away from stocks and toward bonds – or call for an annuity of some kind” and “Tip: put the money in a CD for the short term while you consider your options – this automatically defers the decision to avoid rash choices.” – ahhh it makes me want to pull my hair out, yet I think I know why this article is posted here.  The article contains this all too popular r/personalfinance line, “find a diversified, balanced and risk-suitable allocation and stay the course – set-and-forget is a great approach to simple investing.”  This probably made the entire article seem really credible given that is actually pretty good advice despite again, not calling for action (hell, I wouldn’t know what to do next if I read that and I am a busy structural engineer).  Which leads me to my next point:  I see the answer to most investment-related questions here being something along the lines of, “get in Vanguard this and this and buy and hold.”  While I completely agree that a passive portfolio “will” (should) beat an active portfolio in every instance after costs, simply telling someone to buy and hold an index doesn’t get them very far.  I’ve done tons of apples-to-apples comparisons on prospect’s investment holdings and the story is always the same – over concentration in large, domestic stocks and risks being taken in the wrong places (usually on the bond-side).  Vanguard asset classes will likely still not provide the broad market exposure and diversification to get the expected return maximized given any level of risk.  Consider for a moment that Vanguard has multiple levels of fund share classes with expense ratios ranging from 0.57% down to 0.02% that are based on how much a person is able to invest in each fund.  I'd say most people here fall on the higher end of that fee spectrum.  Also, Vanguard does not offer index funds for international large value, small cap, or small value, emerging markets value and small cap asset class funds.  Tack on the fact that individual investors don’t know how to evaluate their risk appetite, they usually still let short-term volatility dictate their long-term performance by being emotional, and they lack a proper investment philosophy and it’s not really a mystery why the average individual stock investor earns 3.2% and the average individual bond investor earns 1% of what the market has to offer.  But let’s say they do actually hold the portfolio and do get broad asset class exposure correct (so very unlikely), they won’t rebalance correctly or prudently.  

Thus, and I sort of alluded to this earlier, why would you get advice from random internet people knowing this?  Well, I don't think most people do know this, but my other main suspicions are 1) you don’t think you can or don’t want to fork over the money to pay for advice from a professional; 2) you don’t know where to get help; and/or 3) it’s convenient and relatively risk-free and it at least makes you feel like you’re not procrastinating on an important topic.   I’ll end my rant with advice on these last 3 points so at least we can all be happy.  

1) For I'd honestly say 90% of people, the DIY decision will cost you much more than what you would otherwise pay to an advisor.  I say this not even considering investment performance (which will actually make thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars difference over the course of a lifetime.  Why earn so little when you could earn what the market has to offer minus 1% or less in a management fee while taking the stress off of owning a properly diversified portfolio in the first place?).  I’m referring to all the categories within wealth protection, wealth enhancement, wealth transfer, and charitable gifting for the philanthropic type.  These include, but are not limited to property and casualty losses, lawsuits, divorce, disability insurance (wow, that’s something I’ve never seen mentioned here yet it’s what protects your most valuable asset – your ability to produce an income) and identity theft; employee benefits, reducing tax liability, paying down debt vs investing, and liquidity planning; life insurance and life insurance trusts, updating your estate plan, gifting programs, powers of attorney, and anything else involving a dollar sign in your life.  It really takes a personal CFO to ensure that all of this is accounted for the same way a doctor or a dietician accounts for all available information before providing a solution.  If you’re thinking, this is way beyond the scope I’ll ever need, you may be right, but there are things that a professional can still help you despite your situation being less complex as the next person’s there is still value to be added.  If you find the right advisor, they will take this into account in their fee.

2) To find the right type of help, there are two things you should do – seek an independent, fee-only, fiduciary advisor.  If you’re unsure, have them sign this fiduciary pledge:
""I, the undersigned, pledge to exercise my best efforts to always act in good faith and in the best interests of my client, _______, and will act as a fiduciary. I will provide written disclosure, in advance, of any conflicts of interest, which could reasonably compromise the impartiality of my advice. Moreover, in advance, I will disclose any and all fees I will receive as a result of this transaction and I will disclose any and all fees I pay to others for referring this client transaction to me. This pledge covers all services provided.""  

Next, go to http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/(S(xruhx5mjvgsw0evxdx2vuvwl))/IAPD/WebLock/WebLock.aspx and look up the firm in question.  Scroll down and go to Part 2 Brochures.  Read the section on compensation and see if they receive compensation from a third party.  Also, go to Section 5: Methods of Analysis – if you see anything about fundamental or technical analysis or anything else that eludes to them doing research on the market and them having “skill” in finding mispricings or knowing where the market is going ahead of time, walk away.  

For a starting point, you can visit www.napfa.org , but I still encourage you to go through the steps above because many advisors will do active investing (picking stocks).

The best decision, IMO, is to go to http://www.dfaus.com/find_advisor/ .  If an advisor is DFA approved, then I would be 99% confident in saying they are going to have the correct methodology in place.  Getting the full scope of compensation will be the last step.

3) Procrastination is the worst decision you can possibly make regarding your financial situation.  I’ll give you a numerical example from Ric Edelman’s book, “The Truth About Money”:  If person #1 begins investing at age 18 and puts $5K in their IRA for the next 8 years to age 26 and stops, they will have contributed $40K.  Say person #2 begins investing $5K every year in their IRA at age 26 to age 65, they will have contributed $200K.  Assuming they both put their investments in the same investment earning 10 percent annualized, person #1 will still have accumulated $2,587,899 compared to person #2’s $2,212,963 (~$375K more despite contributing $160K less).  That’s the power of compounding interest on interest.  It’s more important to have your money working for you than it is to be working harder for your money and delaying planning. 

Here’s another secret, you’ll never be less busy than you are right now despite what you may think.  In your 20’s you think you have plenty of time to save.  In your 30’s you likely have kids, a house, and you’re spending money more than ever.  In your 40’s despite your higher income, your kids are going to college likely at your expense and you’ve lost 20 years of compounding.  It’s a tough cycle to get stuck in.

I hope this is taken the right way because I really do want to help because there are good people here and also good people trying to help.  

TL;DR:  Seek help from an advisor, not a public forum for finance inquiries regardless of how cool reddit people are.  The implications of poor decisions or bad advice doing it yourself will be much costly than seeking the right kind of help in many instances.  If you don’t know where to look, read point 2 above or simply PM me (or both) – I’d be happy to help point you in the right direction.

personalfinance,$220K in loans; $150K annual salary-- how do I handle this?,"I know, I know. I'm in a ridiculous amount of debt. I went to an Ivy League undergrad and an Ivy League law school, which are both super expensive and so I currently have about $220K in federal loans. It's a combo of Graduate PLUS, Stafford, Perkins loans with varying interests rates 6.8, 7.5, 6.8, 8.5, (consolidated would be around 7.4%). Fortunately, my starting salary is $150K. My montly expenses (rent, food, cell phone, internet, etc.) are around $1600 per month. After NYC taxes, I'll be taking home around $100K per year.

So I'm trying to figure out the best way to handle this. Ideally, I don't want to throw every penny I earn at my loans; I would like to have an emergency fund and some savings as well. 

* So what's my best course of action?
* Should I consolidate my federal loans? (Any negatives to consolidation?)
* Should I do Income Based Repayment (IBR) the first 2 years? (I was in school in 2012 and 2012 and made very little money during that time so my payments under IBR would be very low the first two years allowing me to save. I figure even if the required payments are low I could throw more money than required at the loans.
* Any other advice at all would be great.

personalfinance,Need a car loan with bad credit and low down payment,"So here's the deal.

I worked an under-the-table construction job for the past three years. I need to finish my degree (roughly 30 credits left for my BA) and needed to get on the books for both obvious reasons and health insurance. I recently turned 26, so my parent's awesome (health insurance) rates are gone. I was promised this by my previous employer, but figured out it wasn't happening so I moved on.

A friend gave me a reference at Wells Fargo for a teller position, it's a huge pay cut, but between the benefits and the ability to return to school, it'll be worth it. My dilemma is they need me at a different location than I had been applying for, and public transportation won't make it there. Plus, my training is a 3.5 hour public trans ride which isn't possible since it doesn't run early enough. My previous vehicle was a company work truck, which I no longer have access to, obviously. 

EDIT: I should add that I have the job, I'm getting my offer tomorrow and finished my background check. 

**TL;DR** I need a car. 

My credit score is 620, and I've been working to get it on track. My savings have been depleted. I started the interviewing process around September 5th and will have burned up what I have left by the time training starts on the 22nd.

I only want to get a cheap used car for a few months (hopefully a year or two) until I'm back on my feet, I'm thinking the $3-5k range. I obviously don't want to consider any loans from a dealer. 

Can I even get an auto loan that small, with bad credit and no down, that also has an interest rate that won't bleed me to death? Should I even bother with my credit union or should I try my luck with an online auto lender? I'd like to try and do this without a cosigner, if possible.",finance,1381354496

Moody's offers different view on debt limit

One of the nation’s top credit-rating agencies says that the U.S. Treasury Department is likely to continue paying interest on the government’s debt even if Congress fails to lift the limit on borrowing next week, preserving the nation’s sterling AAA credit rating.

In a memo being circulated on Capitol Hill Wednesday, Moody’s Investors Service offers “answers to frequently asked questions” about the government shutdown, now in its second week, and the federal debt limit. President Obama has said that, unless Congress acts to raise the $16.7 trillion limit by next Thursday, the nation will be at risk of default.

Not so, Moody’s says in the memo dated Oct. 7.

” We believe the government would continue to pay interest and principal on its debt even in the event that the debt limit is not raised, leaving its creditworthiness intact,” the memo says. “The debt limit restricts government expenditures to the amount of its incoming revenues; it does not prohibit the government from servicing its debt. There is no direct connection between the debt limit (actually the exhaustion of the Treasury’s extraordinary measures to raise funds) and a default.

The memo offers a starkly different view of the consequences of congressional inaction on the debt limit than is held by the White House, many policymakers and other financial analysts. During a press conference at the White House Tuesday, Obama said missing the Oct. 17 deadline would invite “economic chaos.”",finance,1381343071

personalfinance,Consolidate CC debt with loan from LendingClub?,"So here's the deal - I have a little under $12k worth of credit card debt that I've been dragging around for years, and I'm intent on getting rid of it as soon as possible. I make pretty decent money (six figures, but I have a family to support and a mortgage so I can't reasonably throw everything at it), so I can probably get that paid off within a little under a year without breaking the bank. However, the interest rates are absolutely ridiculous (the highest being 29.99% and the lowest around 15.99%...the average between them all is somewhere around 22.5%) and I know that I'm getting raped on that while trying to pay everything down.

I was irresponsible with my finances in my early-20's, so now I'm ""paying for it"" as I approach 30.

Would it be reasonable to consolidate that debt into a loan from LendingClub? The interest rate that I can qualify for seems to be about 11.99% (14.85% APR) (which is a bit high, but lower than my CC interest rates). I have pretty decent credit (&gt; 710), so I should be able to get the loan funded, but I've never used LendingClub, and I've never consolidated my CC debt before, so I'm a little wary. The minimum payment will be a bit more than what my minimums are for all the CC's, but that's irrelevant because I plan on throwing 5x the minimum to pay it off ASAP. I just don't want to keep getting charged this ridiculous interest while I'm paying it off.

The plan is to get this debt paid off, cut up the cards (but keep the accounts open for credit score reasons) and get a lower interest rate card that has rewards for business use (I usually have a few hundred - a thousand-ish dollars of business expenses every month that get reimbursed immediately by my employer). I'm trying to boost my credit score as much as possible, and getting this debt paid off will give me about a 50 point bump (sending me closer to the 800's).

Edit: also, consolidating the credit cards by transferring the balances to another CC w/ a 0% rate is pretty much out of the picture, since I doubt I can qualify for a $12k card while carrying the debt that I currently have.

personalfinance,Cash Accumulation Fund (US),"Searched through the archives for advice on this but couldn't find anything, so I'm throwing this out there for r/PF to chew on:

I'm going through annual enrollment at my job for 2014.  One of the options is a Cash Accumulation Fund that's attached to the Group Universal Life option (which I already participate in).  This is not a new option, but I didn't participate in the past because the specifics were not really easy to find.  Recently some coworkers mentioned it and from what they described it sounds like a tax deferred savings account.  Does anyone here have any experience with these?

Here are the relevant sections from the GUL SPD (with some bits bolded for dramatic effect):

-------

You must choose GUL insurance to make deposits into the cash accumulation fund. On a monthly basis, the value of your accumulation fund is determined as follows:


* Net contributions received on your behalf by the insurance company as of the current date
minus
* Monthly withdrawals to the current date, state premium tax and any unpaid cost of premium due
plus
* Interest credited to the current date


If you make a cash withdrawal, the cash accumulation fund defined above will be reduced by the amount of that withdrawal. The insurance company will invest your deposits, and you will receive tax-deferred interest on your account. **Your interest rate may change annually but is guaranteed to be at least 4 percent annually for the life of the contract.**


To participate, you must deposit at least $10 per month into your account. The amount you choose will be deducted evenly from your paycheck throughout the year. You can start, stop or change your contributions at any time. Please note that if cash contributions (including lump sum deposits) exceed certain limits and your GUL insurance becomes a ―Modified Endowment Contract‖ (MEC), less favorable tax rules and, in some cases, penalties apply for lifetime distributions such as loans and withdrawals. You may contact the Program Manager to determine the maximum amount you can contribute without incurring a taxable event.


**The Program Manager will deduct a monthly expense equal to a percentage of each deposit to the cash accumulation fund – for example, 2.25 percent for each deposit to the cash accumulation fund.** This pays a state premium expense tax.


Under current tax regulations, **you will not pay federal taxes on the interest that builds in your account until you make a withdrawal and the withdrawal includes interest earned on your deposits**. Any benefit paid to your beneficiaries, including income earned from the fund, is tax-free.


You can make a full or partial withdrawal from your cash accumulation fund for any reason. You can make up to 12 cash withdrawals per year. You can withdraw a minimum of $200, or your total balance if less.



-------

So aside from the front-loaded fee, are there any other catches I'm missing?  I can contribute up to $450 per week (not like I'd be able to set aside that much...) so it seems like a good way to build up my cash savings while earning a decent interest rate.",finance,1381299959

business,What is Tor and why does it matter?,"We all live in public, at least as far as the US National Security Agency is concerned. As Internet users and global citizens become more aware of surveillance activities that the US and other countries are doing on the World Wide Web, there are those who seek to ensure that privacy and personal freedoms aren’t trampled upon.

Tor technology aims to help appease privacy advocates and offer a way in which the Internet can be enjoyed without the prying eyes of surveillance programs or other tracking software. This free piece of software has certainly become mainstream in light of recent events, but what is Tor and why does it matter to you, your family, neighbors, co-workers, and the rest of the Internet?

Peeling back the onion layers

It might surprise you that the Tor Project, originally an acronym for The Onion Router Project, was initially funded by the US Naval Research Laboratory and helped launch the development of onion routing (anonymous communication over a computer network) on behalf of DARPA. It had also received the backing from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

When users installed Tor software onto their computers, it would conceal their identity and network activity from anyone spying on their behavior. This was accomplished by separating the identification and routing information. The data is transmitted through multiple computers via a network of relays run by like-minded volunteers — almost like how users installed SETI software to look for extraterrestrial beings.

Tor isn’t the only service that helps you hide in the shadows away from the prying eyes of the federal government, or any other person who would do it for malicious purposes. However, some say that it’s better because it works at the Transmission Control Protocol stream level.

I have random amounts on a bunch of different cards, but the total of the payments on the cards together is really stretching my budget so I decided to try to consolidate.  The rate I was offered was an insanely high 24%, is this likely because I opted for a 60 month loan for the low payment or is it more likely that I just dont have ""enough"" credit history?  The only major issues Credit Karma said was total accounts and age of credit history, I have perfect payment histories and no derogatory marks.

My biggest worry is that Australia won't be in the top 20 economies by 2050. Our primary sector is fuelled by mining, and our secondary sector (manufacturing) is non-existent. It's up to politicians now to work out a way to begin the growth of our secondary sector, and to find a replacement for mining in our primary sector. 

My business advisor was talking about the fact that Australian labour is too high priced for a secondary sector to emerge in current conditions, and for the primary sector to develop. He gave me the idea that we should be using international workers from countries such as Indonesia, so that we can finally pay for things at an international price level.

I am a member of the Labor Party (centre-left) myself, and I feel as though importing foreign manpower is against everything the Labor Party is, but if Australia wants a chance to remain a good country to live in in 40 years time, we need to change a lot of policies.

**edit: Kinda lost; questions are unclear. 

ok. so the money came from my mother's insurance after she passed away. She passed away when I was in high-school. So one day I was told that she has left me some ""money"" for my college. When I turned 18, I went to a CPA with my aunt to get the money.
The CPA suggested that I invest the money at the insurance company if I won't need it anytime soon, to which I replied, ""ok"". I had no idea what he was talking about, honestly.

So since then, I had the money at the insurance company that is currently being invested. I've withdrew a little here and there for school purposes. I think about 3k, I'm not so sure. Last week when I called to check up on my balance they said I had about 46k. Originally it started with 45k. Basically, if i didn't pull out the 3k, it went up 4k.
My question is... is it a good idea for me to just leave it there and let it invest? I feel like i could invest it somewhere else better with a higher interest.

I'm going to call them tmrw and ask them about the surrender per., interest rate. are there any more questions that I should ask them that I need to know? I want to get more serious about this and do something about it if I can, but i don't know where/how to start.

He passed away last fall and I (trying to do the right thing) contacted Sallie Mae to notify them of this. 
Within 2 weeks of them getting this information, I received a letter telling me the entire amount was due, in full, immediately. Numerous calls have indicated they are completely unwilling to yeild on this, and they refused to set up any kind of payment plan. They literally suggested my only 2 options being refinancing my house (I don't own a house), or borrowing the money from a family member (I wouldn't have needed loans if I knew anyone with that much money).

I admittedly don't know the exact details of my loans off the top of my head. There are multiple loans, a few federal, most private, with all different interest rates. One had become due BEFORE my grandfather's death, and I had been paying, regularly and on-time. However, after Sallie Mae refused to budge or work with me at all, I told them they wouldn't see ANY money from me until and unless they either were willing to work with me, or took me to court.

So $65k in student loans has now become over $70k in loans over less than a year due to interest and I have NO way of paying it back.

ANY ideas on how best to manage this situation? As of now my only thought is to wait until they take me to court; which will hopefully be a long time from now, and that when that DOES happen, the judge will be reasonable and rational, and the judge will be willing to mediate a payment plan.

Edit: Thank you all for your helpful responses! It does seem there are solutions, which has made me feel infinitely better and lifted an enormous weight off my shoulders.

Bitcoin,How DPR might spend his millions from inside of prison,"I spent some time thinking about how DPR might spend his millions from behind bars.  Here's what I came up with.  Can you do better?
***
Imagine that DPR is in prison and he's got 80 million dollars worth of BTC in a [brainwallet](http://brainwallet.org/).  For example, all stored with the passphrase ""correct horse battery staple"" (c.h.b.s for short).  The Feds want that money and they're definitely not going to let him send it to anyone so they're not letting him use a computer, especially not one connected to the internet.

If he had access to a computer, he could write a transaction from behind bars and pass it on a piece of paper to someone on the outside.  But he doesn't.  And if he did, that computer would have a keylogger.

His next alternative is to write c.h.b.s on a piece of paper and pass *that* to someone.  But he'd then be trusting *all* his 80 million to one person.  That's not safe, either.

Assuming some planning, maybe he divided up his money into tens of thousands of bitcoin addresses, each one with, say, 20BTC.  Now he can give out private keys as needed, written down, and spend money in increments of 20BTC.

The problem with that is that he has to memorize thousands of passphrases.  One option, he could use:

* ""c.h.b.s 1""
* ""c.h.b.s 2""
* ""c.h.b.s 3""

In prison he might have books.  Instead of numbers, he could use the first letter of words in a line from a book, like Romeo and Juliet.  Like this:

* ""c.h.b.s IfVwwlos"" (In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,)
* ""c.h.b.s Fagbtnm"" (From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,)

Harder to crack but it's just obfuscation.  If someone figures out the book, he's screwed.

Ideally, he would have a hash function that could be computed with innocent things that you'd find in a prison: a deck of cards, a book, maybe a calculator.  [Bruce Schneier invented a cryptographic algorithm that uses a deck of cards.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_(cipher\))  If you had a good hash function that you could do mechanically, you could use those outputs at http://brainwallet.org:

* Hash(""c.h.b.s 1"") -&gt; 0101010100101... (many, many bits)
* Hash(""c.h.b.s 2"") -&gt; 1010101110100... (etc)

A deck of cards is surprisingly strong.  The order of a random deck of cards is about 200bits of entropy, even more than a 160bit bitcoin hash, so a deck of cards could be useful.

In a New Orleans courtroom this week, BP and the federal government are arguing over how much oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2010.

Oil flowed from the out-of-control well for nearly three months. Just how much oil spilled will be key in determining the amount BP will have to pay in federal fines and penalties.

Attorneys for both the U.S. government and BP told a federal judge in opening statements Monday that they have estimates for how much oil spilled into the Gulf after the accident, but their numbers are different. The government says it was about 176 million gallons; BP says it was closer to 103 million.

""I think the damage is in the billions of dollars so I think the penalties and reparations should reflect that,"" said Doug Meffert, executive director of Audubon Louisiana.

Speaking outside the courthouse, Meffert said he hopes the judge decides the higher government numbers are more accurate. He said damage from the spill is still occurring. Every time there's a storm, he said, more tar balls show up on beaches. It doesn't even have to be a strong storm.

""Tropical Storm Karen completely missed Louisiana — it skirted Grand Isle — and we had tar balls coming up on Grand Isle this weekend as well,"" he said.

A BP spokesman said it will be a few days before tests show if the tar balls are from its well. In any case, BP said, it remains committed to its ongoing cleanup work.

Department of Justice attorney Steve O'Rourke told the court the amount of oil that flowed from BP's well was the equivalent of 16 Exxon Valdez oil spills. He previewed the work government scientists have done to arrive at their estimate; it shows that oil began flowing at one rate and then slowed over time.
But BP lawyer Mike Brock said the oil company's models show the opposite, that the flow started slower and then increased. He said the government reached a spill estimate before all the information was in, but the government said BP was cherry-picking data to arrive at a lower number.

Over the next three weeks, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier will listen to the evidence in detail. At stake are up to $18 billion in fines and penalties under federal environmental laws. Ed Sherman, a Tulane Law School professor, says Barbier has some discretion.

""That $18 billion upper limit doesn't mean that he has to award it,"" Sherman said. ""He can consider the negligence of other parties, the difficulties that they encountered and so forth.""

Sherman said this trial is probably one of the most complex in legal history and that Barbier was smart to divide it into segments. An earlier phase explored the initial explosion and who was at fault.

Even after the weeks and weeks of testimony already heard, the parties could still reach a settlement.

""You never know what might happen in a case like this,"" said Montre Carodine, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law. ""We may get to the very end and there may be a settlement, and ultimately we may never hear Judge Barbier's determination.""

This second phase of the trial is scheduled to continue through Oct. 24.

Come year end I will be getting a 10k bonus from work - after Uncle Sam takes his cut, I'll be looking at about $6,500 from the calculators I've seen online. I'd like to use the entirety of the bonus for paying off debt. Here's what my debt looks like (rounding to make it easier to read with some additional info):

* Debt 1 (Auto): $8,400 @ 1.49% - Monthly Payment of $307 (on track to PIF by Feb. 2016, vehicle is MY 2008 w/95k miles presently)
* Debt 2 (CC): $816 @ 0% - Monthly Payment of $91 (on track to PIF by July 2014; 0% ends Nov. 2014)

* Debt 3 (Student Loan 1): $5,150 @ 4.2% - Monthly Payment of $95 (minimum - payoff in 2018ish)
* Debt 4 (Student Loan 2): $3,460 @ 5.55% - Monthly Payment of $63 (minimum - payoff in 2018ish - rate to drop 1% in 3 months)

Other things:

I do not currently have *any* retirement savings. My employer does not offer a 401k, and rather than funding a Roth IRA, I have been focusing on building my emergency fund. I'm 24.

I am presently growing my emergency fund to an amount which could comfortable sustain me 6 months without having to make any changes (of course, should I run into a job loss, I would cut non-essentials (cable, lowest tier internet, eat out less). The target date for saving up my desired amount is Sept. 2014 and am contributing $500/mo presently.

My thinking is to put all of the bonus toward the auto loan so I can pay it off quicker and then use that $307 payment towards other things. Even if the interest rate is so low, it's eating up a lot of my take home pay. If I did, the car could theoretically be paid off by April 2014. That frees up $307/mo for accelerating my emergency fund which could then be completed by July/Aug 2014.

Is that the best option?

Finally, after that's taken care of at what point should I focus entirely on retirement savings and only paying minimums on my student loan balances? Once the car is paid off and emergency fund fully funded, I can spend $800/mo toward either a Roth IRA or student loans. Would the best plan of action be to fund up to the $5,500/yr and use the rest toward paying extra on the student loan or pay off the student loans until completely gone?

His theory was that money market accounts are particularly interesting because the portfolio contents are often not (easily) public, and the government defaulting could potentially impact the value of these accounts in ways most account holders would not anticipate.

His plan therefore is to pull his money out of his money market accounts before these securities mature, then put it back afterwards, in the hopes of avoiding the defaulting securities and re-entering the money-market with these securities now at a lower price.

I'll confess I'm not 100% certain I understand the ramifications he was describing, but I'm curious what people think of this theory.  In particular, I have a money market account through Ally which I use as my primary savings account.  I'm unsure if I should do anything with this money, or if there's even anything I *can* do.  The account is FDIC insured and the interest rate is set by Ally, so I don't know that pulling my money out would have any impact.",finance,1381378371

I posted this in /r/realestate, but thought I'd get your take, also.

I'm in the process of buying a home for $109,900. I'm buying into a market where I'll assume the value will remain flat for some time (if it increases, bonus).
I have plenty of cash for a 20% down payment (and still have a very significant emergency fund), however, I've been considering putting down less (I just hate to come off my money)!
The interest rate will be 4%, regardless if I put down 20/10/5%.
Obvisouly my payments would be a tad higher using 10 or 5% down.
PMI would be as follows:
1) 20% down, loan amount at $87920.00 – no PMI required 2) 10% down, loan amount at $98,910.00 – $36.27 PMI monthly 3) 5% down, loan amount at $104,405.00 - $51.33 PMI monthly
In addition to the mortgage/interest payment, I'll be looking to put down an additional monthly principle payment of $400, so the PMI shouldn't be an issue after 2 1/2 years or so (when I'll have 20% equity).
Outside of the PMI, are there any good reasons I should put down 20%? I like the idea of building equity over time (using 5% down), rather than throwing a bigger chunk of money using a 20% down payment.

Nicolás Mendoza, Sept 2013


**The New Zealand Panel**

It has always been surprising to me to read hateful comments or articles about Bitcoin that abound online. Although Bitcoin is far from flawless, the hate with which it is attacked by some is extreme and disconcerting. In some cases the hate is merely the condensation of jealousy for not entering the Bitcoin economy when bitcoins were cheaper, a feeling that only grows deeper as the price rises. However, the main source of Bitcoin hatred and polarization is not so much jealousy but ideology. 

In general, one could say that it is about the conflict between Austrians and Keynesians, Libertarians and Liberals, Capitalism and Socialism, etc. Perhaps one could say that, but understanding the debate in such a simplistic Manichean way impoverishes the conversation, leading inevitably to sterile name-calling. The image below serves as a metaphor of the whole situation: it shows a panel of New Zealand 'experts' that hit the news earlier this year. They decided to call Bitcoin “libertarian, individualistic, sinister!”. The screenshot, however, shows the video framed in a YouTube page calling *them* “socialist, propaganda!” (with the unstated implication that 'socialist' is an insult).

***Img. 1*** “Anti-Bitcoin Socialist Panel Discussion Propaganda in New Zealand”
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=zHU298wcLGw

For this reason, in an effort to expand the conversation, in this article I will try to offend the maximum possible number of people at the same time, by blurring the boundaries that have been drawn between the two teams. What I want to argue, mostly, is that there are some aspects of Bitcoin that should in theory appeal to keynesians. This means that, conversely, there are some aspects of keynesianism that should appeal to bitcoiners. 


**The Old Bottles**


Our New Zealand friends, as they sat on the tacky, designed-for-celebrity-gossip-TV set, inarticulately referenced Paul Krugman, today's most visible keynesian, and an advocate of *“turning on the printing presses”*. Roughly, the argument for this is that by manipulating interest rates, governments through central banks can encourage investment and thus reduce unemployment. Later on, when/if this fails, money can be printed; after all, the state's monopoly on violence can be used in diverse ways to avoid the emergence rogue currency.

With time, the quality of the debate deteriorates, the original goals of the whole operation are forgotten, a sort of blind belief on the methods sets in, fundamental changes in technology and the world are overlooked, and name-calling begins. But, lets pay attention again to the argument: printing money is a solution to the problem of already-too-low interest rates, which are a solution to stagnated investment, which is problematic because it hinders employment. At its bottom, the macroeconomic question is employment, and so the question that should be asked to Bitcoin, to avoid falling into sterile name-calling, is: what does Bitcoin do to employment?


Although the first thing that comes to mind when one asks this question is Bitcoin's alleged deflationary nature, starting there is exactly falling in the usual ideological trap. I think it is more interesting to focus first on the topic of mining. After all, Bitcoin mining is a job.



In a passage that vividly reminds of Satoshi's design, Keynes suggested that even burying old bottles with money would be enough incentive for *“private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire”* to drive prosperity:



&gt; *If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coalmines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again (the right to do so being obtained, of course, by tendering for leases of the note-bearing territory), there need be no more unemployment and, with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is.*
&gt; 
&gt; -Keynes, *The General Theory of Employment, Interest* and Money (1935),
&gt; Book 3, Chapter 10, Section 6



The parallels, I think, are clear. Indeed, Bitcoin mining is a rapidly evolving field that has even sparked the evolution of new computer chips. Thousands round the world, even at these early stages, mine, as evidenced powerfully by the information presented at *www.bitnodes.io*. Guilds agglutinating miners have been formed, and the real value of ASICMINER shares has increased by a factor of about twenty since IPO (as of the time of writing of this article). Moreover, the overall Bitcoin economy is now consistently attracting investment capital in growing numbers. Programmers, designers, consultants, accountants, electronic engineers, lawyers, conference venues, catering services, and so on, are getting employed by the Bitcoin economy. Even the very magazine that you are holding right now is proof of Bitcoin's economy-stimulating side. 


Keynes sees the 'buried bottles' in part as a metaphor for gold, but also as a solution to its random availability:


&gt; *The analogy between this expedient and the goldmines of the real world is complete. At periods when gold is available at suitable depths experience shows that the real wealth of the world increases rapidly; and when but little of it is so available our wealth suffers stagnation or decline. Thus gold-mines are of the greatest value and importance to civilization. Just as wars have been the only form of large-scale loan expenditure which statesmen have thought justifiable, so gold-mining is the only pretext for digging holes in the ground which has recommended itself to bankers as sound finance; and each of these activities has played its part in progress failing something better.*
&gt; 
&gt; *-Ibid.*

Two things of interest should be pointed out: Keynes's remark on the importance of the availability of gold at 'suitable depth', and his previous mention of 'the Treasury' as the agent who could bury the 'old bottles'. 


The question of whether the depth at which Bitcoins are buried is 'suitable' (i.e. the mining difficulty) is interesting. On the one hand, it is possible that increasing difficulty could 'bury' the Bitcoins too deep, strangling currency availability, which is what keynesians fear the most. On the other, such increase, in Bitcoin, is the result of an increase of the demand (and hence the value) of bitcoins. In this sense the automatic adjustment of mining difficulty embedded in the protocol might guarantee that Bitcoins are always 'buried' at the right depth.


The second point of interest is how Keynes assumed that the burying operation would be done by the treasury. Now, the interesting question is: would he have proposed differently had he been born after the invention of distributed networks? Keynes was a man from another era, where the state was the way forward. Indeed, his work can be described as central to the formation of the twentieth-century-style liberal nation-state. But, provided the availability of a global and self-regulating mechanism to bury wealth had been even conceivable then, would he have considered the idea of releasing this function from the control of the state? In short, to advance the debate it is important to account for the assumptions the keynesian argument is based on, and to realize that many of them are assumptions that are no longer valid.


If the idea of an ‘anti-government keynesianism’ wasn’t so deeply contradictory, perhaps it could make a compelling way to describe Bitcoin, and, perhaps, the deep contradictions are no longer necessary.

business,Justice Department rests in second phase of BP oil spill trial,"Justice Department attorneys rested their case Wednesday in the federal civil trial of BP and Anadarko Petroleum Corp., as the firms and the government continued to argue over how much oil was released into the Gulf of Mexico in the 87 days following the April 20, 2010, blowout of BP's Macondo well.

Justice attorneys finished questioning experts who support the government's contention that the oil spill resulted in the release of at least 4.2 million barrels of oil into Gulf. BP and Anadarko have maintained that only 2.45 million barrels of oil were released, and are set to begin making their case Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier is presiding over the trial without a jury, listening attentively and interrupting at times with his own questions about the often mind-numbing testimony describing the physics and mathematical equations that experts from both sides have used to estimate the flow of oil.

BP's estimate would result in maximum fines of $2.7 billion, billion, if Barbier decides the company and its drilling partners acted with simple negligence, or $10.5 billion if the companies committed gross negligence in their actions during the drilling of the well and in stemming the flow of oil after the blowout.

If the government's estimates are adopted, the maximum fines for simple negligence could rise to $4.6 billion, or $18 billion for gross negligence.

Testimony so far, and the questioning of the government witnesses by BP attorneys, indicated Barbier will be relying largely on educated guesses in determining how much oil was released.

Mohan Kelkar, a petroleum engineering professor at the University of Tulsa, in Oklahoma, testified that Kelkar concluded that between 4.5 million and 5.5 million barrels of oil were spilled by the time the well was finally shut down on July 15, 2010. Kelkar used information about the physical size of the Macondo oil reservoir, BP's pre-drilling estimates of the amount of oil in the reservoir, and pressure readings in the well as it was being drilled before the accident and when it was capped to arrive at the estimate.

But the numbers Kelkar used for each of those factors, and the assumptions he used for the way the oil flowed to the surface were questioned carefully by a BP attorney.

As is often the case in civil trials, BP used its questioning of Kelkar to lay out parts of its own case for the smaller flow rate, pointing to what it contends are incorrect assumptions. See full post: http://www.nola.com/news/gulf-oil-spill/index.ssf/2013/10/justice_department_rests_in_se.html

personalfinance,Wanting to pay off my credit cards and need advice on the best way to do it,"Hello everyone! Just another person looking for advice on the best way to go about paying off my credit cards. I want to get these suckers paid off and never have to deal with them again.

Here's what I'm currently dealing with:
1. US Airways Master Card - $6600, $210.00/month minimum payments, I believe the APR is about 23.24%. I called regarding this card last night and they were able to lower the APR from 24.99% to about 23.24%.
2. Wells Fargo Credit Card - $2500 balance, $52.00/month minimum payments, 12.35% APR. I called yesterday and they will not lower the APR, nor do they have any promotions available right now such as a new credit card for me to do a balance transfer to, to get a special interest rate (supposedly).
3. Home Depot Credit Card - $930 balance, $30.00/month minimum payments, 25.99% APR.

I went to Wells Fargo yesterday and inquired about a consolidation loan. What they would be able to do for me, would be a ""line of credit."" I could likely qualify for a line of credit for $10,000-$15,000. I could instantly use this to pay off all of my credit cards, and then make one monthly payment towards the line of credit. The banker is supposed to call me back tomorrow and let me know for sure whether or not I was approved, but once we went through everything on the computer last night, he was coming up with a preliminary number of 19% for an interest rate. I am really not liking that number, especially since it is higher than the interest rate on my WF credit card. He said that if I used about $10,000 on the line of credit, my monthly payments would be around $260. He tried to use that as a selling point for getting the line of credit, but that difference is pretty much negligible, and I try to pay over the monthly minimum payment when possible (though I am not able to go much over it).

I also checked with Lending Club to see what kind of rates I could get. I could get a $10,000 36 month loan with an 18.55% rate and 22.30% APR. This would give me a $364.29 monthly payment.

Another option I know of is a balance transfer. I know this wouldn't really work with the larger card, but I think it would be a no brainer with the two smaller cards, unless one of the above options would be better.

So, what would everyone recommend with this amount of debt? What can I do to get these cards paid off the fastest, while accruing the least amount of additional interest? The most I can afford to pay per month is $400.00 total, so it's not a whole lot more than the minimum monthly payments, but it's a little bit more. Any help is appreciated, and any questions or comments are welcome. Thank you.",finance,1381465207

politics,The Cost of the Government Shutdown on U.S. equity markets as compared to the cost of ACA,"On October 1, 2013, the United States federal government entered a shutdown after Congress failed to enact regular appropriations or a continuing resolution for the 2014 fiscal year.  Republicans shut down the government because of their insistence that Obamacare will be terrible for the U.S. economy.  ""I don't know of anyone who wants to shut down the government. The only thing we want to shut down is ObamaCare,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said. ""ObamaCare is the biggest job killer in the country,"" Cruz said.

Let's compare the costs.  According to a July 24, 2012 letter from the Congressional Budget Office to John Boehner, 

""What Is The Impact Of Repealing The ACA On The Federal Budget?
Assuming that H.R. 6079 is enacted near the beginning of fiscal year 2013, CBO and JCT estimate that, on balance, the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting that legislation would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013–2022 period. Specifically, we estimate that H.R. 6079 would reduce direct spending by $890 billion and reduce revenues by $1 trillion between 2013 and 2022, thus adding $109 billion to federal budget deficits over that period.""

If we concentrate on just the health-insurance coverage components of ACA, according to the CBO, 

""When estimates are compared on a year-by-year basis, CBO and JCT’s estimate of the net budgetary impact of the ACA’s insurance coverage provisions has changed little since February 2013 and, indeed, has changed little since the legislation was being considered in March 2010. In March 2010, CBO and JCT projected that the provisions of the ACA related to health insurance coverage would cost the federal government $759 billion during fiscal years 2014 through 2019 (which was the last year in the 10-year budget window being used at that time). The newest projections indicate that those provisions will cost $710 billion over that same period.""  

So in summary, ACA is estimated to, on a net basis, reduce the budget deficit by $109 billion over the next 10 years.  

If you look at just the estimated costs of the health-insurance coverage components over the next five years, they will cost $759 billion.

On October 1, 2013, the Wilshire 5000 broad market index was at 17732.40 (this is in $US Billions).  This index measures ""the performance of all U.S. equity securities with readily available price data.""  On October 10, 2013, after a hopes-of-compromise fueled rally, the index stood at 17667.87.  At its low during this period, the index dipped down to 17287.23.  Thus, period-to-date, U.S. equity markets have lost about $65 billion in value.  At the index's lowest point during this period, the total loss amounted to $445 billion.

So there you have it:  A loss of $65 billion in U.S. equity markets over 10 days versus $759 billion over 10 years for health-insurance components of ACA.  Note, this comparison doesn't include a number of other costs, on both sides, nor does it consider that other factors also affect market prices, nor the benefits of increased access to healthcare, but just thought it's interesting to compare the direct and easily measurable costs of the shutdown against the projected costs of ACA.",finance,1381608515

They're comparatively small—28k—and all federal, no private. I'm working on creating an actual budget because I make a small amount of money during the school year but I spend it on non-essentials.

However, I do have a nest-egg of about 5.5k sitting in my local-bank savings account, which currently has an interest rate of only 0.05%. On mint.com, I saw an ad for a CapitalOne 360 savings account which has a 0.75% APR. With only a year to go before I start drawing on that money, is it a smart idea to put my money in a higher-yield savings account? I estimate that I'll be able to add roughly 1k more to that account throughout the school year, and possibly more if I curb my frivolous spending. I don't want to tie it up in any investments in case I do need to access that money in an emergency.

politics,"Ideas on responding to popular anti-""Obamacare"" talking points without being a complete asshole.","First of all, full disclosure, I'm coming from a perspective that the Affordable Care Act is a necessary step towards fixing our nation's health care cost &amp; accessibility issues. It is flawed and does not get us to the end goal, but it is far preferable to the alternative of status quo, in my opinion. That's not to say there are no valid reasons to oppose the law - of course there are - but this post gets to my next point.

I've noticed for years that there are many very misleading talking points coming from conservative media and representatives, that rely on their audience accepting what they're told without doing any independent verification. While we are all susceptible to confirmation bias, I've noticed that the Tea Party anti-Obama movement is absolutely dependent on it (along with its cohort, fear). So how do you respond to folks who have been fed these disingenuous talking points?

If you are confrontational, nobody will hear you. 

If you are sincere and ask questions, they may not only hear you, but they may open their minds a bit, accept your discussion, and ultimately challenge what they've been told. There are some who are so consumed they will never listen. But there are others who, with the right approach, will actually hear you.

Before getting into any discussion, you need to make sure you know your stuff. That means digging to the root source in many cases - actually read pertinent sections of the law, or agency guidance on enforcing the law. If you're comfortable that you know your stuff, engage. If you're not, listen.

Here are three examples of good, non-confrontational responses. I'm sure there are others. I have used these in more than one occassion over the past two weeks, and with considerable success. Sadly, I've found that even folks who are not ""true believers"" are hearing and accepting talking points without questioning them. It's understandable, because we all have lives &amp; shit.

1. Congress and their staff are exempt.
Response: ""I keep hearing this. What exactly are they exempt from?""

2. Obama gave his big business buddies an exemption.
Response: ""What are big businesses exempt from that other businesses aren't exempt from?""

3. The government shouldn't be able to tell me what to do with my money.
Response: ""I think you're referring to the individual mandate. I'm curious, why is that provision there in the first place? Who came up with it?""

Have fun and ALWAYS stay calm. Share other ideas or report back on your findings!

I tend to do my riskier things here with extra cash after the conservative retirement accounts are fully funded.

* NLY  - 11.91 avg cost (Sold Nov covered calls @ $12 strike) 
* CLNE - 12.09 avg cost 
* AEO - 13.31 avg cost
* VMEM - 7.55 avg cost
* XOM - 87.50 avg cost
* MNKD - 5.10 avg cost (Sold Nov covered calls @ $6 strike)

As you can see I'm slightly down on most although dividends/income from collecting covered call premiums has offset that to some extent.

The thought process behind these plays are:

* NLY - Down a bunch due to potential interest rate rises.  Picked it up at a slight discount although I know it'll continue to drop some when the taper ends for real.  As long as short term interest rates stay near zero though they can still make plenty of money/pay dividends.  Congress has been screwing me here with potential default discussions which has caused short term rates to spike up this past week.
* CLNE - I love natural gas in the US, it makes so much more sense than using diesel for long haul trucking and other industrial/fleet uses.  They do liquid natgas which is competing with compressed natgas.  I think liquid wins out for the market they're targeting.
* AEO - I wear their clothes and they've been battered quite a bit in the market, typical value play
* VMEM - Flash memory arrays are going to replace hard drive storage at businesses that need performance.  There's a bunch of players in this industry, but I like their product.  I picked them up after they went down a ton after their recent IPO.  They should have cash now though to fund operations for a while.
* XOM - This one isn't very speculative, picked it up before Syria got bumped out of the news.  Energy usage isn't going down globally anytime soon.
* MNKD - Just picked this up yesterday, people hate needles so inhaling insulin seems like a great idea.  The stuff seems safe and the technology works so it's about to move into the marketing realm and we'll see how many people switch over.

I'm still about 1/3 cash so I might add to some of these positions depending on news over the next couple months.

We are willing to pay a premium for investment to build additional homes on our land, since financing through banks is excruciatingly slow.
-
---------

Do any redditors have any contacts or advice on how to get in touch with the kind of people who would be interested in this sort of investing? 

.


**Brief Story** 

We have 2 beautiful vacation rental homes sitting on 47 acres of gorgeous lake-front land outside Chicago. Each house has been generating over $100k per year for the past 3 years. 2014 is looking to be our best year yet, with 75% of the bookings of 2013 before the year has even begun! We are in a perfect position to build additional homes to serve the excessive demand for our properties.


.

**Here is the problem**

.


However, traditional banking is too cumbersome to finance our venture efficiently. Banks judge risk on a debt-to-income ratio and require 2+ years of proven income to even consider a construction loan. For us, that means tax returns. It takes us an excruciatingly long time - over two years - to secure a construction loan to build an additional home, even though every single indicator (see below) suggests a new home will provide income vastly exceeding its cost of construction. Since the opportunity cost of having to wait multiple years to build each home is astronomical, it makes sense for us to pay an investor an attractive rate in order to allow us to build at a more reasonable pace. We are looking for anyone who is or knows someone who would be interested in this kind of investment.



.


**A slightly more detailed story**

In 2008, my family acquired 47 acres of beautiful lake-front land near Notre Dame University, an incredibly popular vacation area for Chicagoans. This land came with one, moderately single family home.

We listed this original home on VRBO.com and, to our surprise, it rapidly booked all prime summer weeks (June-Aug 12 weeks) 2 years in advance at a rate of $4,000/wk. Additional weeks and weekends were booked for the remainder of the year at a lower $350/night rate with a 3 night minimum The annual income of this home obviously vastly exceeded the mortgage and has to this day, with no sign on slowing down. 

After a year of renting this property with unanimously positive reviews on VRBO and having to turn away 3x as many people as we accepted (because we were already booked) we decided to build a new, large vacation rental home on this land. For the past two years this property has proven to be even more successful and in even higher demand than the first home, filling prime summer weeks at $5,000/wk 2 years in advance and with even with contracts signed for 3 summers into the future. The success of this new home has only increased the success of our original home, which we have now added onto.

.

Since we have been in business for over 3 years, one of our banks has decided rule our rental income as acceptable and has given us a construction loan to build a third home, which we will be modeling after the one we built 2 years ago, which was specifically designed to cater to large groups of vacation renters. We have begun accepting private ""pre-order"" reservations for 2015 for it with a 20% deposit. Within weeks nearly all of Summer 2015 was booked at a rate of $5,500/wk, without being listed on VRBO.com 

What would be ideal for us is for an investment organization or venture capital firm to look into our business, audit us top-to-bottom, and make a decision to invest in our construction. 

.

At this point we are an established, incorporated family business with over 3 years of experience. We have the land, we have the relationships with builders, we have the experience, and we have the loyal customer base. We just need the capital to expand at a healthy and natural rate. And we're willing to pay the right firm an attractive interest rate for their support in helping us achieve our goals reducing our opportunity costs along the way.

.

**Do any redditors have any contacts or advice on how to get in touch with the kind of people who would be interested in this sort of investing?**

--------------------------------


**Some stats:**

1. 85 reviews on VRBO. 84 5-star and 1 4-star review.
2. Nearly a quarter of our guests return, often during the same year!
3. Each home appraises for more than the cost of construction!
4. Each home generates in excess of $100k gross annually.
5. Our guests SAVE MONEY by renting our homes instead of booking multiple hotel rooms for their 20+ member groups, despite the fact our accommodations are far more comfortable and intimate.
6. Costs are limited to mortgage, utilities, a small weekly cleaning fee, and basic repairs costs when we don't take from security deposits. 
7. Each home is fully booked for the summer over a year in advance. Many bookings over 2 years in advance.
8. Our 7+bed, 7+bath homes are exceedingly rare, especially in our area. Our homes comfortably sleep 20+ guests.
9. We are the first to fully book up all prime dates each year! There are many homes on VRBO in our area that are booked as heavily as ours, but almost none of them are our size and none of them offer our mix quality and affordability.",finance,1381537570
Bitcoin,Commentary: U.S. fiscal failure warrants a de-Americanized world,"By Xinhua writer Liu Chang 

BEIJING, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- As U.S. politicians of both political parties are still shuffling back and forth between the White House and the Capitol Hill without striking a viable deal to bring normality to the body politic they brag about, it is perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start considering building a de-Americanized world.

Emerging from the bloodshed of the Second World War as the world's most powerful nation, the United States has since then been trying to build a global empire by imposing a postwar world order, fueling recovery in Europe, and encouraging regime-change in nations that it deems hardly Washington-friendly.

With its seemingly unrivaled economic and military might, the United States has declared that it has vital national interests to protect in nearly every corner of the globe, and been habituated to meddling in the business of other countries and regions far away from its shores.

**Meanwhile, the U.S. government has gone to all lengths to appear before the world as the one that claims the moral high ground, yet covertly doing things that are as audacious as torturing prisoners of war, slaying civilians in drone attacks, and spying on world leaders.**

Under what is known as the Pax-Americana, we fail to see a world where the United States is helping to defuse violence and conflicts, reduce poor and displaced population, and bring about real, lasting peace.

Moreover, instead of honoring its duties as a responsible leading power, a self-serving Washington has abused its superpower status and introduced even more chaos into the world by shifting financial risks overseas, instigating regional tensions amid territorial disputes, and fighting unwarranted wars under the cover of outright lies.

As a result, the world is still crawling its way out of an economic disaster thanks to the voracious Wall Street elites, while bombings and killings have become virtually daily routines in Iraq years after Washington claimed it has liberated its people from tyrannical rule.

Most recently, the cyclical stagnation in Washington for a viable bipartisan solution over a federal budget and an approval for raising debt ceiling has again left many nations' tremendous dollar assets in jeopardy and the international community highly agonized.

Such alarming days when the destinies of others are in the hands of a hypocritical nation have to be terminated, and a new world order should be put in place, according to which all nations, big or small, poor or rich, can have their key interests respected and protected on an equal footing.

To that end, several corner stones should be laid to underpin a de-Americanized world.

For starters, all nations need to hew to the basic principles of the international law, including respect for sovereignty, and keeping hands off domestic affairs of others.

Furthermore, the authority of the United Nations in handling global hotspot issues has to be recognized. That means no one has the right to wage any form of military action against others without a UN mandate.

Apart from that, the world's financial system also has to embrace some substantial reforms.

The developing and emerging market economies need to have more say in major international financial institutions including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, so that they could better reflect the transformations of the global economic and political landscape.

**What may also be included as a key part of an effective reform is the introduction of a new international reserve currency that is to be created to replace the dominant U.S. dollar, so that the international community could permanently stay away from the spillover of the intensifying domestic political turmoil in the United States.**

Of course, the purpose of promoting these changes is not to completely toss the United States aside, which is also impossible. Rather, it is to encourage Washington to play a much more constructive role in addressing global affairs.

And among all options, it is suggested that the beltway politicians first begin with ending the pernicious impasse.

Background:

-I have a 1 year CD (3.44% rate) which is due to mature in February and is currently worth $2442.

-I am in the military which gives me flexibility with my savings considering my job security.

The way I see things I have two ways of taking out this car loan:

1. Continue making $800 payments on the car loan and just deal with the interest rate.  This plan has me paying off my car loan in April 2014. This plan also lets me hold on to the CD until its maturity in February.

2. End my CD early and use the $2400 on the car loan and continue making $800 payments until it is gone. This plan has my loan being wiped out around Christmas 2013. I can also re-coup the lost CD in 3 months if I continue to put the $800 payments back into savings.

My mom suggested I keep it for school-related expenses but I am wondering if I should just use it to pay off a little bit of my private loan so it accumulates less interest over the term of the loan.

Here are my loans so far:

* Federal Unsub: $1,000 disbursed @ 3.86%, $2 in interest accumulated so far

* Federal Sub: $1,750 disbursed @ 3.86%
(took max fed loans, rest is disbursed next semester. Will continue to take and be eligible for fed loans.)

* Private loan: $12,186 (half disbursed already) @ 8.25% fixed (15 year repayment). It's bad.

And my finances

* $2,000 in checking/$700 in emergency fund
* $2000 in graduation money (have not touched, do not want to touch)
* Credit card used only for online expenses/textbooks, paid off in full each month.
* Work study job earning $70/week pre-tax (it's bad, I know, but it's my first semester and it was the only job I could find. My financial aid office takes your work study away if you're not working by October and my schedule did not fit with higher-paying jobs. Next semester I will find a job with more hours).
* Spending habits vary a bit but I pay about $40 a month in bus fare for my job (will switch to a one-time payment of $250 for 4 month's worth of transit passes in January), and have been averaging $15-20/wk for all other expenses. I spent a lot getting settled in which has sucked massively and I feel like I'm in a crappy place finance-wise.

Logically, it makes sense to kill off the unsub loan if I do pay something off. However, when I graduate I will be eligible for multiple federal forgiveness programs (teacher in a critical shortage field). Even if those programs do not exist for some reason when I graduate, the rates are not bad (although they are variable rates now thanks to the government). 

Also, I am not sure why, but Nelnet (federal loan servicer) seems to think that I will graduate in 2018 and my first payment is not due until 2019. I graduate in May of 2017.

Anyways, that's where I'm at right now. If anyone has any advice, it would be appreciated. I looked at the sidebar but I didn't find it as useful since I already have an emergency fund and not enough money to do any major investing.",finance,1381677811
personalfinance,I think I did a great job buying a car. I financed it though.,"First of all, thanks for /personalfinance for helping me learn as much as I've learned about keeping my financial house in order. 

So, my recent experience:
As part of my new job I lost my company car. Therefore, I had to get another one. 
I think you all would be proud of what I did. 
I ended up buying a 2010 Ford Escape. Priced well within my means. I'm going to let my wife have that car while I start driving her '03 Impala. 
Here's what you'll be proud of, I had enough liquid assets to buy the car with cash. However I asked about financing options just for curiosity. After completing the application, the associate at the dealership said that it was a ""unicorn"" interest rate. 1.9% APR!
I ended up financing the vehicle and using the money I would have paid for the car to pay down student loans at 4.75% and 7.25%
My hard work at maintaining excellent credit has paid off.

investing,Preparing for end of FED bond buyback / low interest rates.,"Apologize if this was discussed before; didn't find anything through searching.

I'm interested in hearing what people think about the influence of when the FED stops the bond buyback program, and inevitably raise interest rates.

I think I'm with a majority that expect a slump in the markets when the stimulus stops.  Personally I'm expecting a drop of about 2k points.  Normally I would hedge against this by placing a higher amount in bonds funds (like VBTLX), but I'm worried that bonds are not appropriate due to the artificial interest rate.

[I've read](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/10/10/dont-abandon-bonds-rotate-them/) that junk bonds may be a good alternative, but I'm not familiar with the risks or implications of this approach.

So, what do you think?  Are you changing the typical ETF/Bonds approach for mid/long term investing due to the current financial situation?",finance,1381669586
personalfinance,"Buying a home, right now, with a 401k loan. Should I move part of my 401k to money market?","I recently had an offer accepted on a condo. For reasons that I have yet to figure out, the list price was way, way below market value. Seriously -- the Zillow estimate is 68% higher than the asking price, and 42% higher than my accepted offer. My mortgage payment will be less than 25% of what I'm currently paying in rent, for a place that's the exact same size and roughly the same condition.

All of that is just to say that, unless the inspection or resale certificate turns up something really suspicious, I'm highly motivated to close on this place, and I don't want financial issues to get in the way.

In the interest of getting the best possible mortgage rate, I'm making a 25% down payment. The down payment and all the closing costs will come from a 401(k) loan. Normally, I would be the first person to say that a 401(k) loan is a bad idea. But given how much money I'll be saving on a monthly basis, as well as the fact that I know that I'll be getting a huge tax refund and a huge stock vesting in the next year, I expect to repay the loan well before the end of 2014. Compared to the 3% down payment that I could currently afford without taking such a loan, it should easily pay for itself in terms of the avoided PMI and lower interest rate.

Here's the catch. With my plan (and maybe with all plans), 401(k) loans are secured against my remaining 401(k) balance. The maximum loan amount is 50% of the plan balance, since the other half is securing the half that's being loaned out. The loan that I'll be taking is about 44% of my 401(k) balance. Suppose that the government defaults, and the stock market drops by 50%. Then my 401(k) loan-to-value will become 88%. At that point, I'll have 90 days to pay back over 50% of the loan. I expect to be able to pay it back quickly, but not that quickly.

So, on the one hand, I don't want to time the market. But on the other hand, until I pay back that loan, I feel like I'm very, very risk-averse. If my loan is for $X, then my instinct is that I should change my 401(k) holdings to move an equal $X into a money market fund, to minimize the chance that my loan will get called before I'm ready to pay for it. Does that plan sound reasonable? Or is there some reason I'm not considering why it would make sense to stick with the target-date fund that I'm currently in?",finance,1381641802

Im working on a coilgun project, and to make it a bit more interesting I decided to wind my own flyback-tranformer with a couple extra windings so i can get it to self oscillate.


Here is a pic of it.. 
http://i.imgur.com/9IiSr3H.jpg

Anyhow, step one was just to wind the two main coils, fair enough. At first nothing was working whilst I was testing the transformer. This carried on for a few hours as I made modifications to my set-up. I'm running the flyback output through a large capacitor w/ a current limiting resistor. Right now I have basically nothing working so i'm just putting in a PWM singnal into the primary switch with no regulation....

Anyhow, i was checking singnals and I noticed my optocoupler is not being fed hard enough to pull down the PMW signal, so I reduced the resistor on it's end and turned my power supply on. I looked at the meter i had attached across the capacitor and holy shit it's reading several hundred volts, I guess I just assumed that the thing would not work! I guess this would not have been a problem, but i was using my hand to holding a couple wires in place instead of soldering them.. this could have ended really badly...

personalfinance,Taking out a Direct Federal Unsubsidized Loan,"r/personalfinance, 

I am taking out my first student loan for $7,500. I want to know if the repayment plans offered (copied &amp; pasted at the bottom of this post) are the only methods of repayment. I was going to try and pay back the interest immediately so that it does not accrue and compound, but they seem to have me strictly on a fixed repayment plan or the graduate plan. The first plan pays for the interest (but does not eliminate all of it when I do my calculations) and the second plan gradually increases over time after I graduate. 

Simply put:

1.) I want to pay off the interest during school, to minimize the amount of interest that I pay on the loan.

2.) I want to pay off the entire loan in three months, starting 6 months after I graduate.












Are these goals viable?

**HERE ARE THE PAYMENT PLANS THEY ""OFFER""**:

**Repaying your loan. The repayment period for each Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan that you receive begins on the day after your grace period ends. Your servicer will notify you of the date your first payment is due.**

You must make payments on your loan even if you do not receive a bill or repayment notice.

Unless otherwise restricted by loan type, you must repay all of your Direct Loans under the same repayment plan. You may choose one of the following repayment plans to repay your loan:

Standard Repayment Plan — Under this plan, you will make fixed monthly payments and repay your loan in full within 10 years (not including periods of deferment or forbearance) from the date the loan entered repayment. Your payments must be at least $50 a month ($600 a year) and will be more, if necessary, to repay the loan within the required time period.
Graduated Repayment Plan — Under this plan, you will usually make lower payments at first, and your payments will gradually increase over time. You will repay your loan in full within 10 years (not including periods of deferment or forbearance) from the date the loan entered repayment. No single payment will be more than three times greater than any other payment.
Extended Repayment Plan — Under this plan, you will repay your loan in full over a period not to exceed 25 years (not including periods of deferment or forbearance) from the date the loan entered repayment. You may choose to make fixed monthly payments or graduated monthly payments that start out lower and gradually increase over time. If you make fixed monthly payments, your payments must be at least $50 a month ($600 a year) and will be more, if necessary, to repay the loan within the required time period. You are eligible for this repayment plan only if (1) you have an outstanding balance on Direct Loan Program loans that exceeds $30,000, and (2) you had no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan Program loan as of October 7, 1998 or on the date you obtained a Direct Loan Program loan after October 7, 1998.
Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plan — Under this plan, your monthly payment amount will be based on your annual income (and that of your spouse if you are married), your family size, and the total amount of your Direct Loans. Until we obtain the information needed to calculate your monthly payment amount, your payment will equal the amount of interest that accrues monthly on your loan unless you request a forbearance. As your income changes, your payments may change. If you do not repay your loan after 25 years under this plan, the unpaid portion will be forgiven. You may have to pay income tax on any amount forgiven.
Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan — Under this plan, your required monthly payment amount will be based on your income during any period when you have a partial financial hardship. Your monthly payment amount may be adjusted annually. The maximum repayment period under this plan may exceed 10 years. If your loan is not repaid in full after you have made the equivalent of 25 years of qualifying monthly payments and at least 25 years have elapsed, you may qualify for cancellation of any outstanding balance on your loans. To initially qualify for this plan and to continue to make income-based payments, you must have a partial financial hardship. An IBR Plan calculator is available at www.direct.ed.gov. The calculator evaluates your eligibility for the IBR Plan and estimates your initial IBR Plan payment amount. The calculator is for informational purposes only. Your servicer will make the official determination of your eligibility and payment amount.",finance,1381793313
personalfinance,Am I Giving Bad Advice to a Friend?,"I'm not trying to use Reddit to influence her decision.  I just want to know if I'm giving bad advice.  Personally, I believe my friend is being too conservative, but my advice my not be entirely objective either.  

Here's the basic info on my friend: 

- ~30 year single female with no kids (no current plans for kids).
- Salary is $65K base with about $5K per year in bonuses.  
- Job status is early career professional with expected salary and position growth
- No debt
- Saves about 40% of income
- Current rent ~$800 a month
- Owns a older car which will need replaced in the next 12 – 24 months most likely.  Requires car for job.  
- Top marginal tax rate of 25%
- Preapproved for a $300K mortgage.  

She wants a cheaper condo with mortgage + HOA payments less than $1100 a month.  That will put her in a small attached house in a less desirable neighborhood that she would keep for 5 years or so.  However, for $1500 - $1600 a month, she can get a larger row home in a more desirable neighborhood that could be a forever house unless she has kids.  

I know you don't want to be house poor, but in this case, I think she should push her budget a bit.  Here's my thoughts.

- While money may be (tighter) for the next few years, she expects her salary to grow faster than inflation.  The pain will be short lived.  
- She won't pay off much principal in 5 years, and interest rates will probably be higher in 2018 than today.  That will make ""upgrading"" in 5 years more difficult.
- She'll have to pay 6% commission on a sale of her starter house when she upgrades.  
- I expected the more expensive house to appreciate better due to it's neighborhood.  

Am I off base here?  Can she afford the more expensive place.",finance,1381780832

energy,Transitioning to the Grid of the Future,"I'd love any feedback you guys have.  I know I didn't get into every scenario, but this was written for a broader audience.

The Power Grid of the Future
(Transitions are never pretty)

I’d argue that Mother Nature is the only one who can boast a track record of beautiful transitions, with spring and fall coming immediately to mind.  Humans, on the other hand, do a masterful job of making transitions as messy as possible; regime changes, coups d’état, and struggles for power in general.  

We have begun to figure out how to make big transitions through this democracy thing, but I doubt many would say it’s been pretty.  The Revolutionary War, messy; the Civil War, messy; women’s suffrage, messy; even transitioning the way we take care of other people through health insurance has become quite messy, leaving many of my friends with federal jobs at work without pay.  

So here’s what will happen during the biggest transition in the power utilities industry:  
1.	The old coal and nuclear companies will continue to see reduced revenues due to existing renewable energy sources, forcing them to increase rents to make up for reduced margins. 
2.	Customers will begin to look for cheaper alternatives thanks to those higher utility bills, making solar, wind, etc. more attractive.
3.	Most importantly, public sentiment against increasing power costs will push governments to further subsidize renewable energy, cutting legacy power generation even more deeply.  If you don’t believe that last part, you should.   It’s the reason why energy companies try to shift the blame for their inability to innovate and adapt to renewables.
4.	Utilities will have less and less capital to invest in the grid, thereby leaving a gaping hole in funding for the one thing we REALLY need to upgrade to make this transition work.

This is why the transition from legacy energy companies to more de-centralized and renewable power is going to be messy… like “trillions of dollars lost” messy.  It has already begun in European with energy companies actually having to PAY grid managers to take their electricity.  You see, nuclear and coal power plants can’t easily reduce their output to take advantage of reduced energy demand, and since extra energy from wind and solar power is free, the burden falls on those large and expensive power plants to cut back in order to keep from overloading the grid. 

I think this is great news and I don’t feel bad for the big power utilities in the least bit.  Why?  Because SOMEONE is going to make money off this transition, and it could very well be them if they decided to start innovating.  There’s absolutely nothing to stop them from moving into renewables themselves.  

The weak link in this transition is that right now power goes from one place to another without many sensors or switches or buffers along the way.  The Dumb Grid, coupled with utilities’ inability to efficiently decrease and increase power production to meet demand, means that we have a system just waiting to be overloaded the minute there’s “too much” power coming from renewable energy sources.  The Smart Grid will be able to move power around to where people need it and store it for later use for those who don’t; but with decreased utilities investment, where are we going to get that Smart Grid investment?  If utilities invest in the Smart Grid, they will be in large part paying for the system that will help to put them out of business as they know it.  So not only are they resistant to prepare the grid for the future, they’re going to have even less cash than usual to spend on simple maintenance because their customer base continues to shrink.  And like I mentioned before, pushing up prices to cover necessary capital spending will further incent customers to look elsewhere.  It’s obvious that utility companies are in quite a predicament.  

Fortunately, a smooth transition IS possible and Texas is a great example.  They kind of have their own grid, operated by a single Independent System Operator, so they are uniquely positioned to plan for integration without outside interference.  This year they achieved 24% power load through wind power thanks to a near real-time modeling tool, a level of integration many thought was impossible due to all of those big power plants that “have to” run at capacity.  The Smart Grid was able to effectively allocate power to keep things running efficiently. 

So it turns out humans CAN figure out a way to transition smoothly!  But America as a whole better figure it out quick, because Europe’s top 20 energy utilities are worth less than half what they were in 2008.",energy,1381777393

I was told by a few people that in order to do that, I need to be paying things off, so I got a new apartment a few months ago, and I got a car about a month and a half ago.

Just wanted to get a second opinion on my current 1-2 year plan and see if it makes sense...I know by paying off the highest interest loan first I save the most money in the long run, but I plan on moving in a years time and may have to take a pay cut if I go into software (45k might be a reasonable estimate) so I'm really basing my plan on freeing up money on a monthly basis by then (closer to a snowball) so that I won't be really broke if I'm making a lot less.

4k @ 0% in additional student loan, payments begin in November  
2k @ 19.99% credit card  
0 @ 19.99 credit card from a different bank



Right now, I'm paying rent and have moved out but I'm easily making payments...my question is whether the debt repayment plan I have is making sense. I mostly have a good budget I stick to and have reduced my costs pretty low, so I'm just planning on throwing the absolute most I can every month toward debt payment beyond minimum payments (seems to be around 1600-2k depending on the month)


Current plan:


Pay off credit card debt asap...I just maxed this out while doing some travelling and being jobless for a few months after graduating, and helping my parents out with some home repairs as they're terrible with money.


Make minimum payments on everything, and pay down my car loan as fast possible. The reason for this is that my monthly car payment of $250 is almost the same as what the student line of credit will be when payments begin next August. If I can almost pay down my car loan by then, then when I pay it off the additional monthly payment will effectively not change anything as it will just “replace” the car loan.


Also, I don't currently have money going towards an emergency fund, but I guess I kind of thought my car would hold value in the same way...that is, once I get my car loan paid down below what it's actual value is (I think around 11-12k, hopefully), then if I ever had a crisis situation I could always just downgrade my car and use the other 2-3k for emergencies. I'm on a year contract so my job security should be pretty good.


After that, I plan to use the avalanche method for the student loans unless the prime rate changes. I know you can deduct the interest on federal student loans, but my aunt who is in finances told me that this basically means the effective interest rate of the federal loan is 4.1% or something like that, so it's still higher than the 3.5% on the student line of credit.


Hopefully in 4 years I'll be almost debt free, with a car fully paid off, and be making a bit more than I am now.

If I can almost pay down my car loan by then, then when I pay it off the additional monthly payment will effectively not change anything as it will just “replace” the car loan.  


Also, I don't currently have money going towards an emergency fund, but I guess I kind of thought my car would hold value in the same way...that is, once I get my car loan paid down below what it's actual value is (I think around 11-12k, hopefully), then if I ever had a crisis situation I could always just downgrade my car and use the other 2-3k for emergencies. I'm on a year contract so my job security should be pretty good.  


After that, I plan to use the avalanche method for the student loans unless the prime rate changes. I know you can deduct the interest on federal student loans, but my aunt who is in finances told me that this basically means the effective interest rate of the federal loan is 4.1% or something like that, so it's still higher than the 3.5% on the student line of credit.  


Hopefully in 4 years I'll be almost debt free, with a car fully paid off, and be making a bit more than I am now.  

Any suggestions or insights would be super helpful!

personalfinance,"Personal finance issue with girlfriend (might be a bit of a relationship question, too)","I'll try to keep this short. My girlfriend and I live in NYC. I make about $70k/yr. She has a base of around $65k, but with overtime, she clears $90-95k or so (accounting busy seasons).

We've been living together for a few years now without much issue. I've been saving up my emergency fund which is now $10k in a MMA, and now I've got another $10k in my checking -- I'm keeping the $10k liquid and using excess to pay down my student loans more aggressively. About half of my total salary ultimately goes into bills, loans, rent, etc.

Anyway, the other day I learned that my girlfriend only has $2k to her name. This utterly floored me, because she makes so much more than I do, and she's listened to me ramble on and on about the importance of emergency funds and maintaining stability and 401k matching and paying down loans and paying off credit cards in full each month, etc.

She also has about $3k in credit card debt. I asked her what the interest rate was. ""It's low."" ""Well, what is it?"" ""12%"" I felt like dying. Maybe I am just being petty, but paying 12% is not something to scoff at. It's just money down the hole. I consider 6%+ too much, &lt;= 4% on the ""lower"" side. Any credit card debt I incur I pay off at the end of the month before it accumulates interest. The only debt I have is in the form of student loans.

""So let's say you get hit with a $4k bill out of nowhere. What do you do? What about whenever we've gone on vacation?"" ""If I don't have enough, I use the credit card.""

I don't know anyone else I can talk to about this but I am freaking out. It's hurting me because apparently she's just spending everything she's making. She doesn't seem to budget, and doesn't seem to save. 

She says she ""sends money to her mom"" (who is in a financial bind herself as a result of losing a family member and taking on a lot of medical debt) every month but I find it hard to believe that she's sending so much money that she _only has $2k to her name_?

Am I being too hard on her? Someone talk sense into me, here.",finance,1381756097
personalfinance,Advice on refinancing car loan,"Good morning r/pf,

My wife and I currently have a car loan through 53 bank (best rate we could get at the time - we do not bank with 53) which we opened in February of 2013.

The current total loan amount is $9,852.82 with an interest rate of 7.54%, maturing in January of 2018 and current monthly payment of $223.21.  Recently I have had a coworker tell me that her daughter's credit union is offering, for this month only, an interest rate of 1.74% on used car loans only.  My credit union is also offering an interest rate of 2.99% on used car loans AND no payments due for 3 months.  However, back in February when we were looking for a car for my wife, our credit union qualified us for a loan with an interest rate of 8.11%.

We currently have a credit card with a high balance of $4,930.00, which carries an interest rate of 17.99% that we are planning to pay off aggressively with ~$400 in payments, more if possible, per month.  With the lack of car payments for 3 months, I am 100% willing to put those payments towards this card, as, aside from our mortgage, it's our big demon.

My question to you all is, what would be the better route to go?  Please let me know if you need other metrics to determine this but I think I have them all covered.

personalfinance,I was excited to be approved for a credit card to do a balance transfer but my excitement soon went away.,"So quick review here... I have the following cards:
* US Airways Master Card - $6600, $210.00/month minimum payments, I believe the APR is about 23.24%. I called regarding this card last night and they were able to lower the APR from 24.99% to about 23.24%. I pay about $300.00 per month on this card since it is  my high interest card.
* Wells Fargo Credit Card - $2500 balance, $52.00/month minimum payments, 12.35% APR. I called yesterday and they will not lower the APR, nor do they have any promotions available right now such as a new credit card for me to do a balance transfer to, to get a special interest rate (supposedly).
* Home Depot Credit Card - $930 balance, $30.00/month minimum payments, 25.99% APR. My SO and I split $50.00/month payments on this card but it is solely in my name so I'd like to pay this off ASAP.

After some careful consideration, that doing a balance transfer would be the best thing for me. There are lots of cards out there with appealing features, but for my credit score (630), I wouldn't have been approved according to different sources I was looking at. I chose the Chase Freedom card because people with similar credit scores had been approved. It also has no annual fee and 0% interest on balance transfers for 15 months. Fees for balance transfers are 3% or $5 each, whichever is higher.

So, after choosing the card as being the best one for me, I went through the motions of applying for the card. I was pleased to see I had been approved... until I saw that I was approved for a whopping *$500.* I am really disappointed and wish that I could have turned down the credit card. I'll be getting my card in the mail within the next two weeks and intend on calling to ask for a higher limit, in order to keep it going with my balance transfer. Is there anything else I can do? What is the best way I can go about doing this? I just want to get my cards paid off ASAP and be done with them.",finance,1381723785

personalfinance,Buy home now or wait?,"I'm coming out of a 10 year funk where my credit score went to pot. It got really bad at one point but I've built it back up a bit by taking care of outstanding and past due debt. According to Credit Sesame it's hanging around 620. I have a car loan, credit card and student loan payments that I know will eventually increase my score, but it will be a slow process.  

My wife and I have been renting for 10 years and we would like to purchase a primary home. Our price point is &lt;$150k. We have more than enough savings for 20% down plus fees if any.  

Both of our credit scores are about the same. I've seen online offers (through lending tree and such) that would be acceptable. (30yr/~4.5 apr). Even if we wait, there doesn't seem to be a huge difference in APR until our scores reach &gt;760. I'm told that could take quite a while to get to for us.  

So my question is would it be okay to go ahead and buy now? A concern I have is that rates are going to go back up and any money I saved by waiting for my score to get better would be lost because I would be paying a higher interest rate anyway. I could see refinancing in a few years when our scores are high enough that it makes sense.

Bitcoin,My overview of Money2020,"Last week I went to Money2020 conference. I have already uploaded [some photos](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ob0xr/money_2020_some_photos_i_took_from_the_event_and/) from the event, but I would also like to do some write-up of my overall impressions of the event.

First of all, what was [Money2020](http://money2020.com/)? It was a conference for all sort of things related to money - payment processors, prepaid cards, online payments, POS, payment hardware and software, as well as things like identity verification, compliance, investors, Bitcoin and Ripple. The conference consisted of a lot of keynote speakers and discussions, as well as about 2.5 days of exhibit hall running for various booth. There were over 4000 people registered for the event, among them some big players like PayPal, eBay, Amazon and so forth. If you want to know more, go to their website.

As for panels, there were 2 Bitcoin-focused panels, ""Bitcoin 101"" and ""Bitcoin &amp; Beyond: Math-Based &amp; Virtual Currencies"". First was a general talk about Bitcoin and its future, not much new there asides Roger from Blockchain being as usual a strong proponent of Bitcoin, and Tony from BitPay asking the audience how many of them know of or have bitcoins - the answer was a big majority of the participants (I think the panel had well over 200 guests there, I'm bad at estimating really). So overall, Bitcoin was really hip during the conference.

The second panel featured 2 people from the Bitcoin community, as well as a representant of Canadian Mint - the guys behind the MintChip challenge from 2012. Since I was very interested in MintChip, I was listening very closely to what the person had to say - one funny statement was ""Canadian Mint is a for-profit organization, we make money literally and figuratively"" :) (meaning that Canadian Mint not only prints the currency, but also mints precious metal collectible coins and sells them at a profit). However, a very important point that the speaker mentioned, that the Mint would be holding 1-to-1 the currency to back any dollar on MintChips. I knew that that was a big thing, so I did ask about it during the Q&amp;A portion of the panel.

I had 3 question for the person from Canadian Mint. 1 - ""when will we see some new development for MintChip?"", he answered that the Mint will be testing it internally for its employees next month, and in 2014 will launch it to the public with partners. 2 - ""What is the algorithm behind MintChip, is it like Bitcoin, Ripple, or Open Transactions?"", the response was that that information is above his pay grade. Generally the algorithm in MintChip was developed by some professor as far as I remember and it is a secret. No new information there then. 3 - ""If the Mint will be holding the currency to back the MintChip deposit in a 1-to-1 ratio, does that mean the banks will not be able to do fractional reserve banking with MintChip?"" - surprising to me, the answer was yes - the banks would need to deposit the currency to back any MintChip balance, meaning they can't lend out money against that balance. Personally, I think this will be a really big deal once the MintChip launches - if the system will be widely adopted it will bleed the money from the banking system and credit cards into the MintChip. Can't wait to see how this will play out!

So, lets talk about the exhibit hall now. It was fairly large and there were a lot of booth for a number of different companies. When one would enter the hall from probably one of the most popular entrences, there would be the Kraken booth right there an then. On one of the far sides of the hall, right of Kraken, Blockchain and BitPay booth were one next to another. Back to back with BitPay, was Coinbase. Right still of that was a small elevated space with small stands - Ripple Labs had one in there. Around the centre of the hall, CoinX had one of the big booth, about the size of all other 4 Bitcoin booth put together.

Briefly about each booth. I visited them all and talked with the people there for a longer or shorter period of time. Kraken was giving away chocolates (although they ended up having too many - a box or two were still left for Ripple conference), promoting their business and debiuting their Ven integration as far as I remember. They were also signing up members for their Digital Asset Transfer Authority - a self-regulating body for digital currencies I believe. Blockchain was giving away stickers, buttons, t-shirts and Bitcoin Magazines. They were signing up people for their platform and explaining a lot about Bitcoin. BitPay was presenting a Lamassu ATM. Also at their booth was Tuxavant with his BitcoinBriefcase (although he was technically with Blockchain). Every time I came by this guy was explaining Bitcoin to a new group of people with a lot of passion :). This was probably the most crowded Bitcoin-related spot right there. I did play around with the Lamassu a bit, but I think the WiFi there was not very friendly so the machine hanged a few times. Coinbase booth was rather minimalistic, they were generally promoting their platform and that was about it. Ripple stand was also about promoting the platform, as well as their new integration with ZipZap. Finally CoinX where I was manning the booth most of the time along with a big portion of the team. The booth was all about the platform debut - people could go on, see how the system was operating on a test network and learn more about future plans for the exchange. On Tuesday there were a number of interviews shot there with people both from the Bitcoin community and outside of it.

What were my impressions from being at the exhibit hall? A lot of people know about Bitcoin, and a lot of big players are interested in it. We had someone from Coinstar talk with us saying that he would like to integrate Bitcoin (and that a ton of people ask about it), but since they are dealing with the Federal Reserve, there is a lot of FUD. Someone from Mastercard came over talking about their plans for their system that starts to resemble Bitcoin more and more (push rather than pull transactions, initiated by customer and so forth). There were also a lot of smaller people interested in Bitcoin - people doing some small prepaid cards, people doing remittance, and a variety of others. Generally, the financial people are looking into Bitcoin and probably we will be able to see more and more adoption soon.

On Wednesday evening the Bitcoin enthusiasts organized a dinner together. Tuxavant was the brain of the operation - ordering a big Party Bus (they take Bitcoin :) ) for the 10-15 of us, and we went to Cafe Berlin. It was a family restaurant that not only accepts bitcoins, but also saves some of their money in that currency - true believers in our cause. There we met with local Bitcoin enthusiasts and ate some nice German food.

Last day was the Ripple Developer Conference - all booths were already closed, there was only one other set of talks taking place at the same time, so it was officially a tail-end of the Money2020 conference. However, there were a number of people that came to Vegas just for this conference. I met a few people from Canada that did that. The conference itself was very interesting, at least in my opinion. I was interested in the Ripple technology for awhile, but haven't really looked into it for a few months. The presentations covered both the high view of how Ripple works, as well as went into some interesting technical details (at least interesting for a programmer ;) ).

So that's about it for the conference. My reflections so far are that Bitcoin will be seeing a number of bigger players look into using Bitcoin in the near future. Also, some advice for people that wish to be representing their Bitcoin companies at conferences - it really helps if the Bitcoin booths are close together. A lot of the times during this conference when explaining Bitcoin to people and telling them what would be the best for their business we had to reference them to other companies present at the conference. If we were all closer to one another that would be a lot easier. We could capture the attention of a lot more people than being separate.

personalfinance,Question on Investing $1200,"I'm 20, will be 21 this December. I'm an unemployed university student that pays for school through loans from the Fed and my parents. Fed paid for my first year of university. Parents paid for last year, and are paying for this year. After this year, I'll be taking loans again from the Fed. They also pay for housing I've done the math. I'll roughly who the Fed $60,000. And my parents about $35,000. 

Now, I'm not planning on dealing with that until I graduate and have a job (about the age of 24).

Now, with all of my other expenses paid, I also receive approximately $160 a month, spending only $25 a month. The rest I save by putting in  two savings accounts (one with Chase and the other with Barclays).

I'm expecting to have roughly $1200-$1300, this time next year. I was initially saving up to buy a badass gaming laptop. But after taking a PF course this semester, I'm considering investing it. I'd like something with a decent amount of yield (return)

Here's what I was considering:
1. an IRA.
2. a money market account.
3. stock

The thing is I don't know if I should get a Roth IRA or Traditional, seeing as I'm unemployed I dont know if I qualify for Roth since you have to pay taxes on it early.

Money Market Accounts have seem to have such a poor yield from where I'm looking at. Int. rates at .0%

I was considering online stock trading...but I dont know how.

Anyway, I was just wondering what you guys think I should do. Especially if there's an option I  havent considered yet. 

Thank you ahead of time for the help!

Edit: Sorry. Got the numbers a little mixed up. its $60,000 altogether in loans that I'll owe. $35,000 of which I'll owe to my parents.",finance,1381849068
personalfinance,My credit is finally above 700! I still have a lot of debt on a credit card.,"I started seriously working on building my credit two years ago when it was 630. I got a credit card, kept a reasonable balance I paid off each month, made on time payments for all my bills, and took out a small loan from the bank for a car, also paid on time. 

Then I moved out of my parent's place some months back and used my credit cards for a lot of the moving costs and furnishing expenses, so utilization shot up to 80%, and I could no longer pay off 400 to 500 at a time. It didnt help that I use it for grocery and gas when I dont have enough for that. I'm chipping away but its a struggle.

What did you guys do to reign in credit card debt? Do balance transfers help any? I have two credit cards with the same bank. The 3500 limit one is the one with the high balance, my 5000 limit one has no balance (paid off a few months ago). What about getting the interest rate reduced?",finance,1381846532

gaming,Rockstar Games' terrible customer service...,"Is anybody else a little miffed about the lack of companion apps on anything other than iOS?  Their post on the newswire for this now hasn't been updated in 3 weeks (not even to mention that the manual on Android HAS been released).  I and a few other people have posted on the the newswire asking for a little more details than ""we are working very hard to get that out as soon as possible."" but to no avail.  I actually don't mind that much that the app is not out yet, what gets to me is Rockstar's total lack of communication and care for its customers.  I have also tried to get in contact with people through support tickets which in turn have asked me to go through ""mouthoff@rockstargames.com"".  I have written a few emails there but most have been ignored but one (included a little further down).  I have always taken the time to let them know that they did put out a great game but wanted to give them some constructive criticism.

&gt; Hello Rockstar,
&gt;  
&gt; Let me first off by saying that I think you guys did a great job with the GTA 5 game.  In my opinion it is not only one of the best GTA games to have come out but it is also one of the best and most complete games period.  Where I am starting to get more and more dissapointed everyday is in the way RockstarGames is treating its customers.  Having put some features of the game in an outside app is a cute idea but it went wrong for two reasons.  The first problem is that there should still be an ingame way to do this stuff.  Its not everybody that has a smartphone, tablet, or portable gaming console.  At the very least a way to do this online (although being a developer myself I've learned that you still can't assume that everybody on the planet has an always on internet connection) such as on the Social Club site would have been better than nothing at all.  The second way things went wrong is when you decided to release only the iOS version.  Again, not everybody (and their numbers are in a downward spiral) has an iDevice.
&gt;  
&gt; Most people could have lived with the delay without much complaining if we would have only known whether this delay would have been a matter of days, weeks, months, years... but now for over two weeks all we have is:  ""We're working on getting it to you as soon as possible.""  That's it.  As I mentioned earlier, I am myself a developer and I know that usually if it is impossible to give at least a time frame for the ETA it is usually for one of a few reasons.... usually either because the project is not started at all or because the person working on the project is grossly incompetent.  Judging by the usual standard of quality of Rockstar products I'm guessing its the former but you never know.
&gt;  
&gt; To add insult to injury, the moderators of the Newswire section seem to have gone on a power trip and delete messages left and right of people asking for more details or venting some justified steam.  At this point, being treated like we are makes us feel that Rockstar simply does not care about its customers or at the very least those customers without an Apple device.  I have personally received a temporary ban from them but I think I'll recover my posting rights before the app is launched on any other platforms (oct 7th).
&gt;  
&gt; Regards,
&gt; X

&gt; Hello Y (couldn't even be bothered to spell my name right...),

I'm an attorney who graduated in May 2012.  Passed the bar and managed to get a job, though obviously it isn't the biglaw job everyone shoots for.  I began working 11 months ago, and since January I have been living with my parents.  I'm 25 years old, and this living situation is wearing thin, and though I count myself lucky that I was able to impose upon them for so long, I need to get out.

My parents live in the suburbs a 30 min commute from work.  There is currently a condo for sale less than one mile from work.  It is a foreclosure, but in fantastic condition.  It has only been on the market for 40 days, and is listed for 199,500.  Similar condos in the same building are listed for 250-300k.  HOA fees run $80/month, and there is a gym and doorman on site.  I would like to put an offer in on the condo for 165k, but I'd like input as to whether this is feasible given my current finances.  It is a 2bed, 2bath condo, and 2 reliable people have offered 500-600 to come in as a roommate, I'd just need to decide between them and both are willing to sign a 1 year lease. If I could get this condo at this price it'd be an absolute steal, and while it seems like a reach considering my student loan debt, it would be manageable with a roommate and the location is ideal.

So PF, please help me out and let me know what you think.

So I'm currently in a payment agreement with the IRS to pay my 2012 taxes.  It was my first time being self employed for the entire year and I did not properly save for April 2013 so I ended up owing the IRS ~$9,800.  I owe about $8,000 to federal and $1800 to state.

I was thinking about taking out a small loan to pay off the federal amount.  The interest rate the IRS offers is 3%.  If I were to get a loan from my credit union I assume they'll offer me 4-5% (recently applied to refinance my car with them which I owe $13,000 on, they offered me a 5% rate).  

I know the general consensus is since there is more interest that this would be silly, but I'm currently in credit repair mode and paying the loan off instead of the IRS would give me more positive credit history.

Although dealing with the IRS so far has been fine, I would rather continue to establish a good working relationship with my credit union and get the IRS paid off ASAP.

We've been living together for a few years now without much issue. I've been saving up my emergency fund which is now $10k in a MMA, and now I've got another $10k in my checking -- I'm keeping the $10k liquid and using excess to pay down my student loans more aggressively. About half of my total salary ultimately goes into bills, loans, rent, etc.

Anyway, the other day I learned that my girlfriend only has $2k to her name. This utterly floored me, because she makes so much more than I do, and she's listened to me ramble on and on about the importance of emergency funds and maintaining stability and 401k matching and paying down loans and paying off credit cards in full each month, etc.

She also has about $3k in credit card debt. I asked her what the interest rate was. ""It's low."" ""Well, what is it?"" ""12%"" I felt like dying. Maybe I am just being petty, but paying 12% is not something to scoff at. It's just money down the hole, especially when you make so much that you shouldn't _need_ to incur credit card interest like that. I consider 6%+ too much, &lt;= 4% on the ""lower"" side. Any credit card debt I incur I pay off at the end of the month before it accumulates interest. The only debt I have is in the form of student loans.

""So let's say you get hit with a $4k bill out of nowhere. What do you do? What about whenever we've gone on vacation?"" ""If I don't have enough, I use the credit card.""

I don't know anyone else I can talk to about this but I am freaking out. It's hurting me because apparently she's just spending everything she's making. She doesn't seem to budget, and doesn't seem to save.

She says she ""sends money to her mom"" (who is in a financial bind herself as a result of losing a family member and taking on a lot of medical debt) every month but I find it hard to believe that she's sending so much money that she only has $2k to her name?

personalfinance,Active duty military &amp; plan on separating with a federal job as a civilian. Confused on my options within transition period.,"Like stated, currently I'm active duty.  I have a Traditional TSP and no other retirement options.  Planning to separate in the next two years and landing a federal job, although there may be a 1-2 year window from when I get out to when I start that job; so I won't be able to contribute during that period.  Now, I was told by [/u/aBoglehead](http://www.reddit.com/user/aboglehead) not too long ago this statement:

&gt; once you're working your federal job, your TSP *becomes* your 401k.

This confuses me greatly, since I read all the time on here about people contributing to **both** a Roth IRA *AND* a 401k.

 - Should I keep my TSP Traditional since it ""becomes"" a 401k eventually anyway? Basically keeping it as a taxable account.  If so, then open a Vanguard target fund under a Roth IRA?

 - If I'm completely wrong, can someone ELI5?

personalfinance,Advice on Building Credit When Uncreditworthy?,"Hi PF! I'm a long time lurker, but recently have had a few questions regarding building my credit. Long post ahoy.

My mother decided to apply for a credit card in my name in the summer of 2012 without my knowledge, and I didn't find out for a while afterwards because she wasn't making any payments on it and they decided to give me a ring. Please note that this is the oldest/only account on my credit report. I have federal student loans, but they are not in repayment and thus haven't been really affecting my report (as far as I know?).

I spoke to her about paying off the card, as it was already way over the limit because of interest and had been closed by Chase, and she agreed to at very least pay the minimums. I spoke to her about it more than monthly, and she'd always said that she was making payments. Lo and behold, she'd been paying it off every other month if anything, until around June of this year when she didn't make payments until September and they called me again. 

Although they have my phone number, everything else is in her name, so I have not been able to find out the condition of the account without calling them. I'm currently a student, and work at least 2 jobs at once to build up my savings so that I can live comfortably (am living currently with my boyfriend who I split living expenses with). As such, I have not been able to make many phone calls because of my busyness. 

After the last call my mother and I had a huge argument, and I just decided to pay off the entire thing to just end it. I don't want to get her in trouble (after all, she is my mom), but she totalled my credit. Before the account was closed, my score was 525 (Experian)/564 (Transunion).

I was hoping to get a card to rebuild my credit because I will be graduating soon, may go off to grad school, and would like to be able to have this screw up be the only thing on my report when I venture out ""on my own"". I applied for the Capital One Journey and the US Bank Harley Davidson Secured cards and was denied to both. The latter I applied to a couple weeks after I paid off the Chase my mom had open, but was still denied because of my ""debt to income ratio"" exceeding established maximum guidelines. 

My question is, where do I go from here? I have a Credit Karma account to monitor everything, and have been saving my money efficiently (at least $200 a month into a savings account that I don't touch, if I make more more goes in) and have not been spending like many people my age (buying clothes and housewares second hand or getting them as gifts, along with buying food and other necessities from discount stores nearby then cooking bulk meals - although we get the occasional pizza, my boyfriend and I haven't been on a date in months, so we have a bunch saved up). I have always treated money responsibly, so it's frustrating that my only account is closed after many delinquent payments. Is there another secured card that I'm overlooking that may be good? Or is there another way to build up my credit? I know that my scores are now 598 (Experian - what a jump)/582 (Transunion).",finance,1381940400
personalfinance,"Learning the ropes between retail cards and credit cards, and revolving balances","I just started using Mint again. Last time I tried was years ago. It seems to suck a lot less now.

Last Monday I went through open heart surgery (6 bypasses.. fun fun.. no wait.. the opposite of that). I had waited for 2 weeks for my blood to thicken up for it. I say this to mean: All outstanding transactions have cleared and this feels like an ideal chance to start clean. I'm also bored.

There's an area I'm confused about. I have a WalMart Retail type card. It's not a Mastercard/Visa. Just a WAlMart card... it has interest. I had used it hoping to keep a cycle of debt running, just to make my credit happy (I'm told this is a good thing?)

Turns out... Mint doesn't support it.

My mother believes, because she plays a lawyer on TV kind of thing, that I should get a real credit card, transfer the money, then go off of that as it will help me.

My questions are this:

A.) Is having a revolving card with about $500-800 balance good? Or should I pay it off each and every month in full? I'm unafraid to get a personal loan to pay off and make this right... I'm paid well enough.
B.) Other than Mint can't handle it, is there a credit benefit with dropping my WalMart card and going with some other ""real"" credit card? I presume I would research interest rates and transfer rates.. and that some transfers count as cash?

I use Bank of America as well as Mid County Teachers Credit Union.
I like BoA because I can deposit cash at their ATM's and deposit checks via phone. I'm in the process of moving more to MCTCU as I can and I may just suck it up and just go handle stuff in person as a matter of principle.

personalfinance,SO has no income (yet) and a maxed out card and i want to help...,"i have a completely moronic question...
my girlfriend and i live together. she is finishing up her last semester of undergrad, and plans on applying for jobs in december/january.
we are open about a lot of things. she opened a department store card last year--her first credit card ever--spent about half of her credit limit, and with school and limited income, was unable to pay the minimum payments. now the card is maxed out (from late fees and interest charges), her credit report is probably (read: definitely) in the tank. i graduated a semester before her, and so i offered to give her money to pay off the dept store card. i found out she is not paying off the credit card, but instead she is ignoring it because of the (extremely) high interest rate, not to mention the multitude of late fees, and, from the sound of it, she just doesn't want to face the truth.

she keeps telling me that ""she will handle it on her own,"" but with a maxed out card and late fees stacking on top of high interest rates, i know she can't, she knows she can't, so what's the deal? should i continue to be supportive and ignorant? or confront her? if i am to confront her, is there a ""nice"" way of approaching the topic? (i'm typically far too blunt in situations like these...i hate beating around the bush...and it bites me in the ass)

personalfinance,Secured card for first credit card? Credit Card act? Help.,"Hey /personal finance. I really need a credit card but I'm finding it pretty much impossible. I'm a 20 year old college student, and work 30 hours a week. I need a card so I can establish credit as that's obviously pretty important for many aspects of life. So please don't judge me because I'm a college student and accuse of me of 'wanting a card so I can spend irresponsibly'. I'm an adult and like anyone else, I need good credit.

With that said, I have applied for several cards myself. I applied for a student card with my credit union, Bank of America, and Discover. I got denied on each because I have a 'lack of credit history'. No shit. 

So basically I would need to have a cosigner. I brought this up with my parents (divorced) and my mom flat out said no. My dad, on the other hand, brought up getting a secured card.

I have an account with Navy Fed, and I looked up their secured card. It has good reviews and stuff, but most of the people are rebuilding credit. I'm not rebuilding. I'm building from nothing. 

Now a couple questions about secured cards:
1) Does it make me look bad? Like do creditors lump all secured card users into the 'fiscally irresponsible/destroyed their credit' category?
2) How long would it take me to build enough credit to get a 'regular' unsecured card?

Lastly, I just learned about the Credit Card act of 2009 and not being able to obtain a card under 21 without a cosigner.

Is THIS the real reason I can't get a card? I turn 21 in a month, so if I waited until then would I get approved without needing a cosigner?

This whole thing is just frustrating. Thanks for your help!

*Also, it always asks how you pay for living on credit card apps. I don't 'own' any property. I live with my mom, and I don't pay rent. So I can't put that down either. So does this also just make me look completely unworthy of credit? Should I just put down that I pay several hundred a month for rent to my mom?

Right now I'm trying to save as much money on a month-to-month basis as possible. As part of that, I'm looking at refinancing my car. I currently owe $8640 on it at an outrageous interest rate of 11.68% with $188 monthly payments. The payments are doable, but if I *can* lower them, I'd like that.

I applied through lendingtree to get some quotes, and CapitalOne approved me for a 3.94% interest rate with $158 payments for the same term. Sounds great! But of course, when I looked at the contract, there *is* a $895 financing charge, plus titling fee, upping the amount financed to about $9560 as opposed to the current $8640.

I know that I'd still be paying less month-to-month, but it's only saving me $30 a month. The lower interest is great - but is it worth the almost $900 financing fee? I don't really understand too well how APR works with a car loan.

Some quick info about me that may or may not effect any advice is that I'm currently enlisted in the US Air Force and have little over two years of service commitment left.

**Debt:**

* Credit Cards: $884 out of a limit of $2700.

* Student Loans: One for $12,400 (at about 5.5%) and one for $11,300 (the second is deferred due to military service).

* Auto Loan: $6,125 at 13.88%.

**Income:**

* $2,800 per month.

**Savings:**

* I add $110 per month into a TSP Lifecycle Fund.

**Notes:**

* I currently pay about $750 in rent/utilities but that should go down when a new roommate moves in in the next month or two.

**My actions/thoughts:**

* I was paying two payments of $500 per month towards my auto loan but have stopped as I've built up some credit card debt in the past year.

* I've been given mixed advice on my auto loan. I've become aware that I have an absurdly high interest rate due to me making a poor decision upon buying the car and my poor credit three years ago. I've heard I should refinance to a lower rate but also that I should pay off the car as I wouldn't see any savings through refinancing. Not sure what to do there.

* I have thought about stopping contributions to my TSP, but have also heard to keep contributing as it's a good program to be invested in. I also am not 100% sure I will stay in the military nor that I will be able to obtain a government job if I do decide to separate.

* I recently made an effort (and some success) is decreasing the amount I go/eat out and prepare more meals and in general less hobby spending. I know there is still much room for improvement on this front.

* I'm unable to go without a car as I need it to get to and from work. (No bike/bus access to and from the base).

Not really sure how to go about attacking this debt. Is there any reasonable chance I can pay off most of this debt prior to my service commitment being up? Thanks for any and all advice, I just wish I had been smarter, more aware of this sub earlier in my adult life.",finance,1381905163

personalfinance,What to do with 401k from old employer/debt while in school,"A quick background:

I'm 26, married (wife 23), sophomore in college (wife graduates this semester), currently living off of savings and small income ($450 mo) from wife's part time job.

Finances:

I have enough in savings to last till January (already budgeted in YNAB/Does not include any money I make when I can). My school schedule limits my ability to work this semester, but I squeeze in a shift when I can (have worked three since Aug). All money I make goes to paying down CC debts (above the budgeted $100 mo ($50 per card) that is budgeted).

Debts:

My CC= $1,106.28

Wife CC= $350.39

I have a 401k with Vanguard through my old employer (FedEx). I currently have $7,500 (rounded down to the nearest 100th) in the account. I left this job just over a year ago now. I am not allowed to deposit in this account though it still acquires interest. I do not have any other form of retirement savings (Roth/IRA/401k) nor does my wife (she has been is school since the end of high school).

Neither of us have any other debts (auto/home/school loans/private loans) other than the CC listed above. My wife already has a job lined up with the school lab (a food sciences lab at our uni) that she works at for when she graduates. This job includes benefits (insurance/retirement) and a much higher pay than the minimum she currently gets. We cannot afford to put any money into a retirement account until she gets graduate pay in Jan (As stated above, all of our money is accounted for through budgeting). 

With the troubles looming in D.C. what should I do with the 401k? I'm sure money markets are a safer bet (though much lower interest rates) but I honestly do not know what to do with it at this time.

Thank you and sorry for the long post.

Yesterday we went out for some drinks together, and he bitched about his business and I tore into him

The manager is bitching that his business is down and he is operating in the red and he doesn't understand why and this why he's going seek out a $100,000 in funding to remodel the place put in some nice special affects and make it really pretty/jazzy/cool etc completely missing all the fucking points on why his place sucks. To which I go off on him

He has a really shitty band that plays on Saturdays they suck, I don't go to his place on Saturdays because they suck so bad I don't even want to listen to them. Next his food sucks, his steaks are dry, his pasta is overcooked, his cook can't even put out a decent burger and fries. Next thing his waiters are fucking bitches, they are slow incompetent and stupid and don't care. Why he hasn't fired them is beyond me.

Now onto him, recently I had the opportunity to fill his place of business with 200 some old patrons he normally would not get the chance to serve. Catch? Well he had to open at 5:30 AM his response ""Can't afford the staff?""

Excuse me? I'm about to fill up your entire restaurant to the brim with customers for for a pre golf game they will want lots of beer, breakfast, and food and are all willing to pay and you can't afford to open up your restaurant? We found another place willing to accommodate us and they made bank. In fact in a 2 hr period that place took in $5,000 (BTW this would equal approx 3 weeks of his avg revenue stream). After the people where done playing golf many of them went back to the same place and continued on their drinking/eating.

He WASTES MONEY that band I mentioned? He pays them $500 a night to play shitty crappy out of tune fucking music. The lead singer isn't even that hot.

He recently forgot an entire shipment of milk in the summer sun it spoiled over the course of a few days cause no one gave a shit to even look

He listens to his wife too much who is anti-alcohol, the one thing he does sell quite well is liquor! However he refuses to do drink specials, or promote his drinks.

Last year he agreed to allow an organization to use his restaurant for an event. The MAIN event organizer paid $7,500 to rent the place out for the night/feed everyone in there. The main event organizer wanted to eat some food EARLY because he was going be busy when serving time was on. HE WAS TOLD no he had to wait.

Guy just paid you $7,500 to fed him and his friends (basic food mind you) and you say he can't eat early? if I pay $7,500 for something like that I expect some fringe benefits like the ability to eat early.

Recently I was at his place to drop something off when I saw a lady order a screwdriver (keep in mind Vodka is like $6 a bottle and he sells screw drivers for like $5 a drink sell two drinks you've paid for your vodka and the orange juice is cheap. Lady tastes her screw driver and asks if they can add a little bit more vodka cause its a bit weak. He declines and pisses off the lady. The lady finishes her drink and leave.

Now I don't know how many shots you get out of a bottle of vodka but I imagine it's about 25~ so at $5 a pop thats $125 for a $6 investment (plus the cost of orange juice) 

Dude the laddy asked for a squirt of cheap fucking vodka. You make serious bank on vodka, give her the little bit extra of vodka (not even a full shot) she'll be happy and stay for more! So you saved yourself 10 cents and cost yourself a $30-$50 tab

And yet my friend wonders why his business is failing.

What should I do?,"**UPDATE: Manager contacted payroll, they will be giving me a check for back pay from the date my raise should have gone into effect. Best possible outcome! Thanks everyone for the help!**

I started working part-time as a salesperson at this company (retail chain) back in May 2010. I received between $8.00 and $8.25 an hour for the majority of my time there but we had a commission based bonus system that earned me a bit more plus good discounts on stuff I used a lot. I'm in college so it wasn't a big deal.

At the beginning of 2013 we were told that the bonus system was being taken away and that we'd all get higher hourly wages. I met with my then-GM in late January and she confirmed that she was raising me to $10.50 from $8.25. I never obtained this in writing however. She was soon after promoted to Operations Manager for the entire company and I was placed under new management. I have an excellent relationship with her though and I'm fairly sure she'll vouch for me. The raise should have gone into effect for the pay period from 2/4/13 - 2/17/13.

I was enrolled in direct deposit well prior to this change. My new manager was pretty bad about giving me pay stubs and didn't mail them to me either, and the website that we had previously used to check our stubs was not updated until very recently. As a result, I never saw a pay stub during this period. I just let the direct deposUpon checking it recently to provide income verification, I discovered that my wage was never increased and I have continued to receive $8.25 an hour.

I looked through all my previous stubs to get the amount I was underpaid. I worked 291 hours and 22 minutes total and was underpaid by $2.25, resulting in a **pre-tax total of $655.575**. I didn't have federal withholding so it should only need to have medicare, social security, and state tax deducted.

To further complicate things, I was recently offered a job at a different retail store of the same type (direct competitor of my company) with better pay and benefits and resigned with 2 weeks notice this past Friday. Due to my limited scheduling in the next 2 weeks my last day is actually this Friday, 3 days from now.

I don't really know the best way to approach this and would appreciate advice. Should I go through my current general manager or should I contact my former manager (current Operations Manager) directly since she gave me the raise? I'm very concerned since I don't have any written proof of the raise so I want to handle it as carefully and diplomatically as possible. I still have access to the computer system at work so I could stop in during the week and print off any relevant evidence (i.e. my time clock) if needed, and I am in the process of downloading copies of all my pay stubs from the website.

I'm hoping we'll be able to reach a quick resolution on this, but knowing the company I doubt it. If they don't give me the back pay, do I have any legal recourse or are there any actions I could take?

Thanks for any and all help!

personalfinance,"Realistically, how can I expect my student loan debt to impact me over the next decade?","Hey all, recently discovered this sub, first post here.

I'm a grad student about to finish in the spring with about $90,000 in student loans, all of it from the Feds aside from $3500 from Sallie Mae. Don't know if it makes a difference but the loans are being serviced by Nelnet.

I'm currently single with a long term girlfriend who I'd like to marry once I'm out of school. We're not crazy about starting a family so I'm not too concerned for that in the near future. I'm working full time in a business I cofounded, currently hitting about $36000 a year. I expect that to go up slightly after graduation, and then more income will be based on the growth of our company through profit sharing. If that doesn't happen soon, I expect to find other work that's more in line with my degree (MS Int'l Economics) and hopefully be starting around $50k a year.

I *try* to keep to a budget as best as possible; I have several credit cards but I'm very good at not carrying a balance and being responsible with them. My FICO is around 700 and rising. I don't have any financial assets to speak of, a couple thousand in stocks and a Roth IRA.

So how should I expect that amount of student debt to hold me back in terms of other credit opportunities? I'd like to get into real estate after I've some funds saved up for my first cheap property, and I'd also like to get a newer car after I graduate (for reference my current one has 260,000 miles and is slowly rusting away).

Is there anything I could be doing currently to help me in the future? I just got another credit card to increase my aggregate limit and lower my revolving balance ratio more.

EDIT: Numbers: For now, let's assume $90,000 in debt. All Direct Stafford/PLUS loans so interest rates are between 6.8 and 8%... call it 7.2% on average. Not sure what my minimum payments to be honest since I'm on deferment and am just paying off interest at the moment.

EDIT2: I think Mint isn't pulling up my numbers correctly. I've got to find the source of the discrepancy, but that site says I have $100,000 in debt *currently*, while checking Nelnet it says I'm at $76,000 at present, which makes more sense. I've updated the numbers here to reflect where I think I'll really be after graduation.",finance,1382048722
personalfinance,"Asset allocation question for retirement, need to buy bonds","I think I know the right thing to do here, but I want to double check. I'm rereading the Bogleheads' Guide to Investing now that it makes more sense to me, but I think I already have the answer.

I'm 27 years old. I have a Vanguard RIRA, and a 401k with Principal.  Last year, I was contributing to Target Retirement Date style funds with both, but I discovered that those funds with Principal had a high expense ratio. So, I moved all of my 401k capital into the low ER index funds, but they're all for stocks. 

This messed up my asset allocation, which was already aggressive as it is. I went from 90/10 to 96/4. This has been great in this bull run, but it's more aggressive than I think I want. 

Now I don't understand a lot, but I have heard that bonds typically move in opposition to interest rates, and since interest rates are so low now, it's not a good time to buy bonds. HOWEVER, I also understand that the ideal strategy is to pick my asset allocation based on a long term strategy and then stick to it, and this issue of me rebalancing back into bonds is a form of me trying to time the market. 

So clearly the thing for me to do now is to move my funds at Vanguard into a different Target Date fund with enough bonds in it to meet my desired allocation, correct? The logic being that even though this might not make sense now, I should move to the correct allocation for my strategy now and hold it long term, especially since during the next bear market I'm going to need to know I'm sitting where I need to be and to stay the course.

As I said, I could be completely wrong on some of this stuff, but this is my understanding, and I'm reading and doing research on my own to figure it out, but I'm feeling like I need to move to fix this situation soon. Thanks for reading!

**tl;dr I'm overweighting stocks in my portfolio right now, should I rebalance now to buy more bonds, even though bonds aren't a great deal at the moment?**

Here are the allocations for both accounts:

Roth IRA (Vanguard TR 2055): http://i.imgur.com/DngMd0r.png

401k (Principal Mix): http://i.imgur.com/Fjmur23.png

Combined: http://i.imgur.com/hN0aXCx.png

(I realize after taking these screen shots, I'm probably overweighted in US Stocks as well)



**With regards to my 401k...**

The target date fund I was in had an ER of 1.42%. I get 100% of 4% employer match, so contributing to this 401k is still a good idea.

This is that target date fund: http://www.principal.com/InvestmentProfiles/index.faces?symbol=L5533

I moved all my funds and set future allocations into a 50/30/20 of the following three funds respectively (ER of 0.72%):

[LargeCap S&amp;P 500 Index](http://www.principal.com/InvestmentProfiles/index.faces?symbol=NX033)  
[MidCap S&amp;P 400 Index](http://www.principal.com/InvestmentProfiles/index.faces?symbol=NXM33)  
[SmallCap S&amp;P 600 Index](http://www.principal.com/InvestmentProfiles/index.faces?symbol=NXS33)

These are the only low ER index funds that I can choose from, so even though they don't necessarily give me an ideal asset allocation within my 401k, all the other options are super expensive. I don't have enough money elsewhere to break out into separate funds, so I need to compensate with a target date fund.

I have two sources of debt right now. 1) my auto loan (~10k outstanding) which I make monthly payments of $350, and 2) my student loans (~20k, but super low priority on paying these off), which I make about $250/mnth on payments.

the other option I see is completely paying off my car sometime early next year, and them diverting the extra $350/month into savings along with my normal deposits, and start saving for a house again.

personalfinance,Feedback Request: Downpayment strategy if time horizon is a bit longer... and you may change your mind about buying?,"My current budget allows me to save ~$1k a month outside of retirement savings and I'm using it to save up for a downpayment on a different/other home. (I own a small condo. Think a small house would be better in the long run.) I'm currently putting it in a savings account (0.7% interest). 

At my current rate, it'll take me at least 6-8 years to save enough for a 20% downpayment on a house, and that's based on the current market. Might take longer if real estate keeps going up at the current rate and/or interest rates sky rocket. I think both of those are likely to happen in my area. I know that on a &lt;5 yr timeframe, it's best to leave the money in a savings account without exposure to market volatility. 

On a 5-10 year timeframe, however, that's becomes a lot of money to lose to inflation and lost opportunity cost. *Especially* when I consider that I'm not even that excited about buying a house right now and may decide in 6 years that I don't want to do it. If my money were to lose value in the market, I think I'd be okay just waiting (but honestly who knows what I'll want in 6-8 years; it's a long time away). On the other hand... if I were to invest the money and it did really well, I might be tempted to pull the trigger earlier than 5 years and go ahead and buy as soon as I got close to 20% down. 

My options, as I see them:

* Keep putting this money into a savings account and let it sit there
  
* Use this money to pay down my existing mortgage and so I can own it free and clear

* CD or I-bonds ladder until I'm ready to buy

* Put it into the market for now and pull it out once I'm closer to buying (understanding that there's risk involved and that I'll owe cap gains)

* Mix of any of the above

* Other?


I realize my not knowing exactly what I want to do is a complicating factor. I'm guessing some of you will say it's really up to me and my risk tolerance.

* $5.2k at 4.25%
* $5.1k at 3.15%

**Net Income:** ~$3600 permonth after 401k contribution, health and dental insurance, taxes, etc. However on a bi-weekly schedule so twice there is an ""extra"" $1800 paycheck. 

**Emergency Fund:** $6.6k in an Ally Bank savings account, Contributing ~$275/paycheck. Aiming at $8k by the end of December and will stop there.

**Checking Account:** Currently at $350.

**HSA:** Employer contributes $800 per year, currently at $752.32. I have used some of this for hospital bills.

**Credit Cards:** Discover Card with a $10,000 CL, AMEX Green Card, Capital One Card with a $1,500 CL. Started off with the Capital One about 8 months ago and got the Discover/AMEX 6 months later. I pay these off in full every month.

**Credit Score:** Creditkarma says 688. Has been coming up.

**401K:** Roughly $12k. I currently contribute 4% and my employer matches 3%. They also provide a supplemental 5% of my salary to a retirement fund. In effective total of 12% going towards this - TIAA-CREF Lifecycle 2055 Fund. Net Expense Ratio of 0.74%, which I think is on the high side?

**Roth IRA:** Opened up with TIAA-CREF as well, about $1k currently and contributing $250 per month to this. Just opend this up a couple months ago.

**Spend:** 

* I currently live with my parents, but I offer some payment - $550 per month. 
* Cell Phone - $35 per month. 
* Gas/EZ-Pass ~ $350 per month. 
* Food/Alcohol/Girlfriend Food Dates - last month I spent ~$275 for the month. I used to routinely spend around $450 but I started to bring a lunch to work as an effort to buckle down. 
* Car Insurance - I pay ~$515 for six months in one payment. 
* Student loan minimum payments are around $550 per month. 

Aside from these I try to put the extra money I have towards the school loan that has the highest interest rate. No payment on a car as I made sure to buy a used one off craigslist which is holding up well so far. I spent around $4000 on the car.

In a year or two I also plan on moving out with my girlfriend, probably to an apartment..or house if I can manage. I haven't thought much of it yet though as I am focusing on my loans.

Bitcoin,Deflation can cause economic lulls. What would the global economic landscape look like with a 50% gpd bitcoin?,"Any guesses? 

Deflation was present during most economic depressions in US history[22] Deflation is generally regarded negatively, as it causes a transfer of wealth from borrowers and holders of illiquid assets, to the benefit of savers and of holders of liquid assets and currency, and because confused pricing signals[citation needed] cause malinvestment, in the form of under-investment.


In this sense it is the opposite of the more usual scenario of inflation, whose effect is to tax currency holders and lenders (savers) and use the proceeds to subsidize borrowers, including governments, and to cause malinvestment as overinvestment. Thus inflation encourages short term consumption and can similarly over-stimulate investment in projects that may not be worthwhile in real terms (for example the housing or dot.com bubbles), while deflation retards investment even when there is a real-world demand not being met. In modern economies, deflation is usually caused by a drop in aggregate demand, and is associated with economic depression, as occurred in the Great Depression and the Long Depression.


Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek, an Austrian Economist, stated of deflation during the Great Depression:
I agree with Milton Friedman that once the Crash had occurred, the Federal Reserve System pursued a silly deflationary policy. I am not only against inflation but I am also against deflation. So, once again, a badly programmed monetary policy prolonged the depression.
Interview with Diego Pizano (1979)[23]


While an increase in the purchasing power of one's money benefits some, it amplifies the sting of debt for others: after a period of deflation, the payments to service a debt represent a larger amount of purchasing power than they did when the debt was first incurred. Consequently, deflation can be thought of as an effective increase in a loan's interest rate. If, as during the Great Depression in the United States, deflation averages 10% per year, even an interest-free loan is unattractive as it must be repaid with money worth 10% more each year.

Under normal conditions, the Fed and most other central banks implement policy by setting a target for a short-term interest rate — the overnight federal funds rate in the US — and enforcing that target by buying and selling securities in open capital markets. When the short-term interest rate hits zero, the central bank can no longer ease policy by lowering its usual interest-rate target. With interest rates near zero, debt relief becomes an increasingly important tool in managing deflation.

investing,Using loan to invest,"Hello everyone, just a little background information:

I am a cadet and will be graduating from college next May and I took out the Career Starter Loan from USAA for $25,000 and it has an interest rate of 2.99%. When I graduate I will have no debt and I will not have to start paying back the loan until 6 months after I commission. I really want to invest for the long term with a lot of this money so that I can get started on retirement. I don't have a job so I can't start a ROTH IRA. I want to know what some good options are for using this money to make at least a return higher than the loan's interest. I was looking at Vanguard and thinking of investing in some of their mutual funds, but I'm not sure if that is the best idea.

I was just looking for some guidance on what I should do and maybe what kind of funds would be the best option and if there is any other way I can use this money better than how I was planning on using it. Any help is appreciated.",finance,1382131081

Loan 2 @ 2.75% balance of ~11k

I don't own a home, and don't have much in a 401k to borrow against. The best they could offer was a personal loan of about $10k @ 8-12%.

personalfinance,"When it comes to debt repayment strategies, there is an often-forgotten advantage that the snowball method has over the avalanche method.","Many people come into PF asking how to get out of debt the fastest.  In regard to dollars and cents, the avalanche method will save you the most money and will pay off the debt the fastest.  /r/Personalfinance likes to advocate for the avalanche method as superior.  While I agree, there is an important distinction and advantage to the snowball method that is often overlooked.

Someone with more than one major debt and who has minimum payments to meet may be in a precarious financial situation.  When they have extra, they need to apply it carefully.  Using the avalanche method may be the fastest and save the most money, but it also incurs some risk, because it prolongs the life of the debts with the smallest interest rates.  

For example, consider someone with the following debt scenario:

* 10 year, $12,000 unsubbed stafford student loan @6% interest (minimum payment $125)
* 10 year, $17,000 subsidized stafford student loan @ 5.6% interest (minimum payment $191)
* 10 year, $36,000 graduate student loans @ 6.8% interest (minimum payment $450)

Using the avalanche method, the person should put any extra money toward principal on the graduate student loan.  However, if they do this, they extend the life of the other two student loans much farther out, meaning that this person will have minimum payments on those two loans due for a much longer period of time than if they had used the snowball method.

If they use the snowball method, they will be rid of the smaller loans much more quickly, **reducing the number of minimum payments they have to make every month.**  If the person has an emergency, or loses their job, or otherwise gets into hot water financially, having used the snowball method may eliminated one or two of the smaller loans.

If anyone needs clarification I'd be happy to try and explain further.  

TL;DR: Avalanche method saves you the most money and gets you out of debt the quickest, but you take on a higher risk of not being able to meet monthly obligations during emergencies, because you are extending the life of the smaller loans that could have been paid off quickly.  The snowball method will cost you more and take longer, but will reduce your number of minimum monthly obligations more quickly.  If you are comfortable with risk and steady financially, use avalanche.  If you are not on steady financial footing or uncomfortable with risk, use the snowball.  It is also entirely possible to switch halfway through and use a combination of both methods.

**EDIT:  For everyone arguing with me, let me clarify that I'm not here to pick a fight or to advocate for most people to use the snowball method.  In most circumstances, the avalanche method is superior.  But in the rare circumstances where your budget has little breathing room, you expect to experience lean months in the future, and it is necessary to avoid financial risk, I believe the snowball method has advantages that should not be overlooked.**

investing,Thought Experiment: Leverage to buy rental properties vs. leverage to buy a basket of REITs,"I've been thinking about this recently. 

Assume you are able to get a approved for a sizable loan (at ~4-5% APR) and are looking to use it to purchase an investment/rental property. If you were able to convince the lender to allow you to use it to instead purchase a basket of REITs, what kinds of additional risks/rewards are you getting and which are you leaving?

My take: You are picking up some decreased risk due to diversification with the REITs in that you aren't susceptible to local problems that you could have in buying one property (rise in crime, natural disaster damage, etc). You certainly have less upkeep with the RIETs. You would pay for ""hands off"" approach with the management fees in the REITs. In addition, you have the macro risk of rising interest rates, but I think those would affect a rental property and REITs in the same way, although the magnitudes may be different.

I'm not an expert on how to value REITs or investment properties, and I'm not considering doing either of these things anytime soon, so please don't bother warning me against them. I'm just looking for the opinions of others.",finance,1382209303

I just made this budget today based on our income and expenses as a couple (after everything is taken out of both of our paychecks).

- We try to follow a paleo lifestyle, so our food costs are higher than that of most couples.  We balance it by rarely eating out. Sorry, we could cut down maybe $25-50 a month tops, but we won't be going the baloney and beans route anytime soon to save more.     
  
- We have Comcast for cable/internet and we have a pretty good deal, I think? And in the last 3 months they screwed us over several times, so we have had no cable bills for 2 months and a $20 bill this month. Next month it will return to the $104 rate, assuming they don't piss us off again haha.  
  
- Our (mostly my) student loans are bananas and I can't wait to pay them off! That said, I would also love to buy a house and have a baby in the next 2 years, so I'm thinking minimums+any found money should be thrown towards them for the foreseeable future?

    AES @ 7.1%

I recently read Dave Ramsey's book, so according to his rules, I should be paying off lowest amounts first, and onward until debt is gone. Good plan? Those are also my highest interest rates too, so that would placate those in that school of thought as well.

In my area, it's feasible to find a fixer-upper 3bed/2bath in the $200-250k range. Should I be aiming towards saving 10-20% or more?

At my current rate of paying ahead, I should be able to knock out the $X loan in 2.5 years, so about half that for the $Y loans.

I was in a rush and to get him to stop annoying me, I caved in.  Plus, it appeared on the surface that it would be a good investment.  

After reading a few articles, I don't believe I have a need for the private life insurance (through New York Life).  The Fed. Gov't one should cover a majority of any unfortunate events and outstanding loans.

I don't want to bore you with my monthly finances, but if you need more details let me know.  I'd rather just cancel this $25/mth insurance policy and cash out, but if I can re-invest it into another product with NY Life, I would entertain it.",finance,1382375823

A Google search turns up this question several times, but all of the answers always just tell the OP the difference between interest rate and APR, and that's not my question. Since all mortgages have fees associated with them, I would conclude that all mortgages have a higher APR than they do an interest rate, but bankrate.com shows some mortgages that have these two numbers as equal and this seems to occur when ""Fees in APR"" is zero.

investing,What should I do? Stocks vs. Real Estate,"Hey, just looking for some feedback on my situation.

I'm 28, single and I live in Vancouver, Canada. I'm trying to decide whether I want to buy property now, or if I want to put my money in stocks for the time being. The real estate market is crazy expensive in Vancouver for those that don't know, I believe one of the most expensive in North America. There's no way I could afford a house, I'm probably looking at something around 300-400k for a condo. However, interest rates are so low right now that this might be an ideal time to buy. My parents keep encouraging me to buy now, but they're biased because they bought just before the Vancouver market exploded and their house is now worth 8 times what they paid for it.

I could afford a mortgage, but I don't really like the idea of such a huge financial commitment at this point in my life... What if I want to change jobs? My mortgage payments would become very difficult if my income suddenly drops to zero for a period of time. Makes it harder for me to freely make decisions about my career.

So I've been looking at stocks as an alternative. I've got about 30k just sitting in a savings account, which I realize is a bit of a waste. Most of that was made in the last year however, since this is the first time I've had a well paying job. I could probably put away another 20k or so next year if I don't move. My rent is cheap where I'm at now, but it's not the nicest place so I also want to get out of here...

The way I see it is if I buy property, then I'm committed to that until I pay it off or sell it correct? Like there would be no reason for me to get into stocks until my mortgage is paid off, and all available money should go towards my mortgage right? But I've also read that in the long run stocks outperform everything, including real estate which is why I'm having a hard time deciding.

Bitcoin,Question about switching wallets. Qt Client to Electrum because of recurring blockchain errors,"I am a Mac user who is relatively new to Bitcoin.  I recently set up an account on coinbase and purchased a small amount of BTC to start out.  While I waited for the transaction to show up, I downloaded the Bitcoin-Qt client, and set up my wallet and a new address.  I didn't run the client very often, so when my transaction finally went through on coinbase, my wallet was not in sync.

No worries, I'll just transfer the Bitcoin to my wallet and it will show up when the Blockchain syncs.  Since my computer doesn't have a ton of processing power, it took a long time to download the entire blockchain, and a few times during the process either the client itself or my computer crashed, forcing me to start over, and reindex the downloaded blocks.  After many tries and the use of intense ventilation to ensure the computer did not overheat, the blockchain synced, and my bitcoin appeared. PROBLEM SOLVED, I thought...

The next day I open the client to download the new transactions in the transaction history, in an attempt to stay up to date, and it says error opening block database, would you like to reindex the blockchain?  Exasperated, I agree, and the blockchain once again starts from zero.

So I am fed up and want to move my money to a different wallet without downloading the blockchain again, but I don't know if this is possible.  I downloaded the Electrum wallet, and set up my information and encryption codes.  I cannot send the bitcoin that is in my Qt wallet because it is out of sync, but I would like to transfer my money over to the new wallet ASAP so I can delete this horrid Qt client and forget about its existence.

**My question is:** Is there any way I can transfer my Bitcoin into my Electrum wallet without the Qt client redownloading the block chain?  I am not positive, but I believe that I can't export the address with its private key without the blockchain.  Is this true?  *I backed up my wallet.dat file in several places as soon as my blockchain synced up the first time, so bear that in mind, not sure if it's relevant or not.*

**Tl;dr:** Qt client took almost an entire day to download blockchain, and once downloaded and synced, an error occurred forcing me to redownload for Nth time.

gaming,"A sad story (Long, info inside).","So this story starts with my best friend Jake and I, when we were younger. As children, we were easily impressed by pokemon. Between reading the manga at the library, watching the shows on tv, or playing cards, pokemon was a sort of livelihood for us both. We were pretty much obsessed, as our parents said. Playing the handheld games were a little tricky though, since neither of our families were well off, neither of us had a GBC to play on. Once we were allowed to borrow our mutual friend's old OG Gameboy and Red version. We played it for hours together, trading off between gyms (although I usually had to do more of the training since he was lazier in the past than I). We even caught all of the pokemon that we could with only Red version. Needless to say, we played the crap out of that game, at least until our friend wanted his things back. We didn't have much experience with generation II games, but we watched our friends play from time to time.

--Fast Forward--

A few years later, I started getting an allowance (only in retrospect do I know it was because my father had received a promotion). I saved and saved it like crazy. All I could think about was buying a relatively new Gameboy Advance. After an extremely long time (it seemed so since I was still younger), I attained enough money to buy a see-through purple (Glacier?) GBA and Sapphire version. Ecstatic was an understatement, for the both of us. We played it together a million times over and then one more, and again we had all the pokemon we could at one point. We played it continuously, probably more than we played Red. There were some new things to us, but we understood some of Gen II and III from the show on TV. The rest of generation III was oblivious to us, because I couldn't afford to buy another game (probably because I can't stand saving money).
A few years later, it was early November and pokemon Diamond and Pearl had come out earlier in the year. Jake's birthday is in November 15th. He couldn't stop talking about how amazing it looked around his parents, he was dropping the hint pretty obviously. I was pretty content with Sapphire still but he was all about getting a DS and Diamond for Dialga (definitely cooler). One day, his dad got fed up with him talking about pokemon and said he wasn't getting it for his birthday. He was distraught, but he's always been a pretty good talker. He talked his dad into a birthday/christmas present of the DS and Diamond. Sure enough come December 25, he was the proud owner of the OG Blue Nintendo DS and Diamond. We had beaten the Elite 4 together by lunch time on the 26th. It was the most amazing game so far. The amount of time logged on that game read 999:99 before too long.

I received Black version a few years ago for christmas and we've been playing it ever since. We're both in sophomore year of college now and we're also roommates together. All the time we see the Pokemon X and Y commercials and he can't stop talking about how good it looks. And now that he can see all of this stuff on this sub about it, he wants it even more. Unfortunately, we still only have a DS to play on. And since we're in college, all of our jobs' and parents' jobs pay goes toward our education, so there's no extra $240 sitting around to go pick up a 3DS and X. His birthday/christmas is coming up and usually we just get each other little gag gifts, but this year I want to make it extra special for him since his grandfather passed away two weeks ago from an awful case of Parkinson's Disease at 76 years old. Unfortunately for me, I don't have the money either, so I'm turning to you, Redditors. I need your help to help buy my best friend a 3DS and game for his birthday/christmas.

TL;DR - My friend and I love pokemon a crap ton, but neither of us can afford a 3DS/game at the time being. His grandfather just passed so I want to make his birthday/christmas amazing. Is there anyone out there that is willing to pitch in and help make my best friend's holiday one he'll never forget?!

personalfinance,Always pay down credit card debt rather than direct funds to a savings account,"Reading through the threads, a lot of people are recommending that you always maintain 3+ (or 6+ months, whatever) in savings for emergencies, even if you maintain credit card debt at 10+% interest.  I've also seen articles written on how you should split a paycheck into savings, even if you have credit card debt.

I believe this is not ever an optimal choice.  I think you should always pay down credit card debt first if the interest you are paying exceeds the rate of return on a savings account.  This is because a credit card is a revolving line of credit that you can draw upon the credit limit less the unpaid balance at any time.  The borrowing capacity can be your lifeline in case of emergencies and is better than having excess savings.  

I understand some emergency expenses cannot be paid by credit card, such as rent if you lose your job.  However, wouldn't you still be better off paying down the credit card and getting a personal line of credit?  Bank charge an annual fee for a personal line, but you're still saving because the fee is typically less than $50 a year, and far less than credit card interest at 10%+ per year on a UPB of greater than $500.

Am I missing something here?

economy,Public Goods A Tax-Less Society: Practical Methods,"Premise: Public goods are essential to the functioning of human society and the advancement of the human condition.

Problem: Humans require sufficient incentive to create public goods, and in cases of large projects, require coordination and additional incentives between social groups to divide labor and complete the task.

* Solution #1: Voluntary participation. Low incentive effect outside of biological kin groups (kin selection bias). Significant free-rider effect possible. High liberty, unstable due to low participation.

* Solution #2: Coercive appropriation. High incentive effect. Free-riding becomes ""forced-riding"". Low liberty, unstable in the absence of force.

* Solution #3: Dominant assurance contracts. High incentive effect, free riders have increased opportunity costs. High liberty, stability unclear but appears solid.

I'd like to start a discussion about Solution #3, the Dominant Assurance Contract as a method of social organization to create and maintain a social group's public goods. See the following:

http://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/PrivateProvision.pdf

http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/05/assurance_contr.html

It seems to me that taxation is unnecessary with DAC's in place. The sole purpose of taxation in a democracy is to provide public goods to the electorate and because of the problems with free-riding, any kind of appropriation has to be coercive. DAC's may eliminate the need for coercion by increasing the opportunity cost of free riding (same as coercion) *but also making investing in a public good a dominant strategy, driving up participation and ensuring that the public good is produced and maintained*.

As a corollary to this, it occurred to me that simple government bond issues might easily fulfill the purpose of a DAC, as it provides a return for funding the government (public goods). As long as the government has currency issuing powers, the amount of bond issues is limited only by interest rates. Discuss?",finance,1382470096

personalfinance,[Link] Is it better to save money or pay off debt?,"http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/blog/save-money-pay-debt/

Quoted so that this isn't blog spam (it's not my blog)

&gt; Here’s an age-old, modern, first-world dilemma: Is it better to use your disposable income to pay down any debt you have or to [save it](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/10-easy-ways-save-money/) instead? That’s kind of a good situation to be in, to have extra money lying around that you have to question what to do with, rather than, say, spend it on an ox, the labor of which you will use to minutely increase the miniscule plot of land you work to grow crops to sell so that you can pay for your family to have enough food to not starve.

&gt; But since you’re all covered in the ox department and have a question such as this, we can help you out here. We should say first that we are not financial advisers in any way. You know us, we’re Josh and Chuck. But we are good at researching and so what follows is a sketch of what our research turned up rather than any kind of professional financial advice as, again, we are not professional financial advisers. We’re only podcasters.

&gt; As it turns out, the question of whether to pay off debt or save has a fairly easy answer at first blush: pay off debt. We should say that is technically the answer, not because paying off debt is always is the right answer, but because the global economy is pretty much still in the toilet right now. Were circumstances radically different, the correct answer could conceivably be to save instead. Let us explain.

&gt; If you look at the disposable income you have as something you can put to work in order to better your lot in life (very much like an ox, really), it becomes much readily apparent what to do with it. Say you have $1000 to work with, credit card debt on an account that charges 15% (sadly, an excellent rate these days) and a savings account at the bank that earns 1% (again, sadly, a fantastic rate currently). Your answer is remarkably simple: You would be much better served to use the money to pay off the credit card. Since putting it in savings could earn you a cool ten dollars over the course of a year, using that $1000 could save you $150 in interest charges over the course of a single month. Conversely, if your savings account offered 20% returns each month, you’d be smarter to save your money (although your credit score would suffer tremendously from simply ignoring your credit card bills, of course).

&gt; So the answer is simple, paying down debt is the clear and apparent winner. Hark! As in all things, nothing is so simple as it seems. For the most part, yes, the pay down debt camp (or, more to the point, the pay toward whatever offers the highest return camp) is by far the more populous one among today’s go-go consumer finance advice circles, but even among them there is a clear understanding that exceptions do exist.

&gt; Chief of these is the employer contribution to employee savings accounts. Pretty much across the board, personal finance advisers say that it’s better to use some of your pre-tax salary toward a retirement savings account that your employer will match, since using that salary toward anything else instead means you are giving up the free money your job is offering to you.

&gt; That exception is pretty obvious. The other one that’s most often touted isn’t quite as much. The point of saving isn’t for retirement alone. It’s a good idea to have an emergency savings fund (anywhere from six to 12 months’ worth of take-home pay is the recommended amount) to dip into only when you absolutely must (i.e., an emergency). So if you find yourself with that extra grand (or hundred or what have you), you may be better off socking it away for an emergency. Here’s why: If you pay down your credit card debt by $400 and your alternator craps out and you end up having to spend $600, not only have you erased the ground you gained by making that credit card payment, you’ve also introduced an additional $200 on which you will have to pay interest. This is, to say the least, an exercise in futility and one that will ensure you remain eternally and intractably in debt.

&gt; The entire point of an emergency fund is to have easily accessed money in the bank that will allow you to avoid using your credit card in such situations. This is how one gets ahead — by not only paying down debt, but also removing the necessity to rely on the vehicle that ties you to indebtedness.  So perhaps the best approach to debt and saving is to strike a balance between the two, by contributing a smaller percentage of any given lot of disposable income to a savings account and using the remaining amount to pay down debt. When the debt is paid off, all of that disposable income can be directed toward savings.

&gt; It’s also worth noting that being saddled with some debt is also an exception to the general rule. It’s a good thing to have some types of debt, low-interest debt, that is easily managed monthly and helps keep one’s credit score in good standing, like a mortgage or a car loan. The interest rates on these types of debts typically are far lower than the crippling rates of credit cards. This means they can be chipped away at over time rather than being paid down early; you can feel fine paying them off in the prescribed amount of time on the loan.

&gt; So there you have it, the answer(s) to at least one of life’s questions.",finance,1382459549

personalfinance,Paying down extra mortgage principal if selling house before 30 yrs?,"Hi There - trying to wrap my head around this and I'd appreciate any clarity.

I understand that paying extra towards your mortgage principal effectively 'earns' you your interest rate, minus your tax bracket (because of interest write-offs). So if you were paying 5% interest, and in a 20% tax bracket, paying extra principal 'earns' you 4% (.05 - (.20)(.05)).  Easy to take this number and compare it to what your after tax expected returns might be from the stock market, treasuries, etc.

My question is: does this same math still apply if you plan on selling your house early? Suppose one only plans on holding on to their house for 10 years (on a 30 year mortgage) before selling. Not factoring in price appreciation or anything like that, does paying extra toward the principal over the next 10 years still result in the interest 'earnings'?

I'm confused because as far as I understand, the realization of those earnings only comes at the end of the mortgage life. So if one were to pay extra toward their principal over the next ten years, (but not so much that their monthly payments were impacted at the point of reselling) then the extra payments wouldn't have earned any return. Is this correct?",finance,1382438272

personalfinance,How can I consolidate my loans?,"My wife and I have several sources of debt totaling just over $35,500.00. This debt consists of the remainder of our respective student loans and our two car loans. The interest rates range from 2.74 to 6.00. I want to consolidate all of our debt together into one loan, possibly with a weighted interest rate to reflect the pre-consolidated-loan-balance-weighted-interest-rates.

The main problem that I'm running into is that the student loans are each in either my wife's or my own name, and the consolidation mechanics which exist through government channels do not allow the consolidation of them together, let alone alongside autoloans.

Another issue that I'm encountering is the interest rates for personal loans. I'm not a very accomplished web detective, and economics is more than a little intimidating (even the relatively small portion that is consumer banking). I feel that I must be encountering sub-optimal interest rates because I would never accept a loan with a double digit interest rate and a great majority of the offers I've found are just that.

Some may wonder why I'd go through the hassle of consolidating the loans as I'm not having a problem making payments, and do not intend to submit an application for income based repayment. I want to consolidate my debt into a single payment for simplicity's sake and it doesn't make any sense to me why I shouldn't be able to. At the very least, I would suppose that I could consolidate my wife's three remaining student loans and my own remaining two because they do not have any sort of collateral attached to them.

In summation, I'm looking for information on how to go about consolidating all of the loans held by my wife and myself- both educational and vehicular.",finance,1382427350

personalfinance,I am 22/M/USA looking to move to New Zealand on a student visa. I have an offer of place. How to handle finances on my journey?,"This is basically a cross-post from a submission of mine at /r/IWantOut. I was recommended to post here since most of the concerns I'm looking to address are financial. I'll copy/paste the self-post here and edit anything that may need further clarification.

&gt;Hey all! I have been planning my move to New Zealand for a few years now, and I believe I'm extremely close to making this a reality! First off, the basics:

&gt;* I turned 22 a couple of months ago
* I have an associate's degree in IT and am now instead aiming for a BSc in computer science
* Personal funds are extremely limited due to difficult family finances
* I have no criminal background or convictions
* I am in good health
* *I currently have an offer of place at the university I desire to attend*
* The university I plan to attend participates in the [federal student aid programs](http://studentaid.ed.gov/prepare-for-college/choosing-schools/types/international#international-schools)

&gt;Since I currently have an offer of place I am now able to focus on finances and obtaining a student visa. To apply for a student visa I still need to obtain a police report from the FBI, obtain general medical documentation, and provide a recent chest x-ray. These should be no real issue, although I am trying to find out how to best obtain the medical records and exams at the lowest possible cost.

&gt;My primary concern at the moment is financial. I understand that tuition costs, the cost of attendance, and initial transportation are going to be expensive. My expected family contribution will likely also be moderately sizable, mainly due to my mother's income from working two jobs. She still has difficulty managing money, though, and will not actually be able to contribute anything at all.

&gt;I need to update my FAFSA (which I should be doing tomorrow) and will apply for whatever grants and scholarships I may be available for, although these are limited for international study. I can almost guarantee that I will max out my federal subsidized loans and will need to look into PLUS loans or private loans. PLUS loans are unlikely as my mother has a poor credit rating and my father is unlikely to cosign for a loan that he would be considered fully responsible for.

&gt;I plan to pay for all of my student loans personally. As implied/mentioned above, my parents are not willing or not able to provide any assistance, although my father will likely cosign if he can be released from the loan after I pay on time for a certain duration. [Sallie Mae currently has a private loan with this option.](https://www.salliemae.com/student-loans/smart-option-student-loan/)

&gt;I am ultimately looking at taking out ~$45,000-50,000 NZD annually for three years to cover all of my expenses. I will also research work-study opportunities and find part-time work while in the country to cover a considerable portion of the loan(s) before I complete my studies. Immigration New Zealand also [announced student visa improvements](http://www.dol.govt.nz/immigration/knowledgebase/item/12147) a couple weeks ago so that I will be able to pick up more hours of work when courses are not underway. I am confident that I will be able to pay back any loans I receive in due time.

&gt;Long story short, I need to borrow almost my entire way through international studies and will be exhausting my limited personal savings first, followed by federal loans, and covering the remainder with private loans. Are there any major holes in my plan? Are there other private or federal loans that I may have overlooked or that may provide a better interest rate and payment plan?

&gt;I would also like to note that, for what little it may be worth at this time, I plan to eventually obtain a work visa in New Zealand after my studies are complete. I would like to one day become a permanent resident, although that is still several years down the road and isn't particularly concerning for my current situation.

&gt;Thanks for reading, and more thanks for any input that you may have!",finance,1382415447
financialindependence,"How I was able to get a credit rating of 735 by the time I was 20, and over 800 now I'm 21","I enlisted in the military, Navy, 2 years 4 months currently. 

Opened my first credit card, which sucked at a such high interest rate, bought a car which was affordable. Crappy interest rate also. 

Bought small things with my credit card, barely let the interest build up, and kept paying on it. Let debt sit on the card but barely paying interest

Car loan, Paid double the minimum due for 1 month, and was always over paying by $30... Slowly the bank lowered my minimum from $205 to $170. I kept paying $235 on the loan.

Opened another personal loan to pay for some things cause I didn't have the cash for or $2500, low interest rate at this time. 

Got a new credit card for better long term benefits, and use the other one I opened back in 2011 as a emergency card... I did a balance transfers from the new one to old one because I have 0% APR for 18 months of a interest rate. I'll have that paid off way before 18 months. The current 2011 card paid off, credit limit increased and lowered interest rate

I also had 2 CD's open throwing money into there.

Pretty much, it's easy to this stuff, I may not have it done it properly like others, but for my age, the kind of crazy amount of crap I do, I'm doing so much better than the people I graduated with in high school and friends I know at my age who can't even get a loan of less than $500

So if any young people are reading this, think ahead of what you want. When I turned 16, I knew what I wanted. I didn't want bad credit like my parents and live day by day on pay checks. I want a stable life.. Now a days everything revolves around your credit score, vantage score, auto insurance score etc. 


If any others wanna chime in how you did it at a young age go ahead. I hope I give some insight to others",finance,1382408382

Bitcoin,"Why Bitcoin is Myspace, not Facebook.","Bitcoin is a valuable medium of exchange, but it will not serve as  money in the marketplace, it will be outcompeted by an alternative crypto-currency (none that currently exist fit the bill).  Why is this?  In 2140 the total quantity of Bitcoins will remain fixed at approximately 21 million.  Although this stops inflation it also stops a huge amount of investment in an economy.  Why?  Bitcoins, just as with any other type of money such as gold, silver, and Federal Reserve Notes, are valued not by their industrial uses, but by those goods and services which they can be used to purchase.  Therefore, if we assume a best case scenario under which Bitcoins become the universally accepted medium of exchange every increase in wealth in the economy must be accounted for by an increase in wealth of the Bitcoin market.  If the total wealth of an economy grows by 7% the total value of the Bitcoin market also grows by 7% and because the quantity of Bitcoins will be stable each Bitcoin directly increases in value by 7%.  Unfortunately for Bitcoin, this means that any businessman will have one of two options, continue investing in their business or put all of their wealth into Bitcoin and earn the average rate of growth of total wealth in the economy.  

Historically wealth has grown at around 4-5% per annum.  This means that no business will form unless it can see a real growth rate larger than that 4-5% and even if it sees a 6% growth rate it will most likely shut down, running a business is a lot of work for a 1-2% return on investment per year. This means that the amount of investment in an economy will rapidly decline and all those companies at or even a few percentage points ahead of the average growth rate in the economy will drop out and simply hoard bitcoins.  Supply and demand will equilibrate leaving the total amount of investment and growth in real wealth at a significantly smaller rate than before Bitcoin was used as money. 

Finding the ideal rate of coin creation for a crypto-currency is a bit complex as you must make sure that it appreciates every year so as to ensure that it will attract savers, however it cannot appreciate very much or it will create disincentives towards investments which are what makes an economy grow, but the proof for the ideal crypto-currency is too long to put here.  The main problem with Bitcoin is that although transaction costs are almost non-existent, it was aimed at attracting savers, but money is the most marketable good in an economy not the good with the most incentive for hoarding.  If you compare a Bitcoin economy to an economy that uses a crypto-currency that would retain stable value ""stablecoin"" (not ideal, but close) the amount of total growth in the stablecoin economy would be much larger than that of the Bitcoin economy because there would be no disincentive for investments or saving, the two drivers of an economy.  This means the total amount of goods that could be purchased with stablecoins will grow exponentially larger than those goods that can be purchased with Bitcoins.  Money is defined as the most marketable good and if stablecoins can buy an exponentially larger amount of goods than Bitcoins it doesn't really need explained which is more marketable.  

Let me know if I've made an error, but I don't see any scenario under which Bitcoins will outcompete a crypto-currency that has a very slow rate of appreciation.  Investments are what grow the economy and once the total quantity of Bitcoins stabilize it will make investing a bad decision financially.",cryptocurrency,1382568006
investing,Anyone else think the Financial Sector (and Consequently Stock Market) is being propped up by Fed QE?,"I was listening to an interview by Jim Bruce, the guy who made the new doc, ""Money for Nothing"" and in addition to a lot of criticisms of current monetary and fiscal policy, he basically said the above. 

Now I've been going around thinking the same thing in my head, but it wasn't until I heard him talk about it that it seemed so blatantly obvious. 

Hear me out: I'm not saying that QE is inherently bad, but it seems obvious that most of the banking profits are thanks to extremely low interest rates and the purchasing of mortgages. This, in turn, is allowing much of the private sector to operate with artificially low interest rates, increasing their profit margin. Now many company's sales have gone up this year, but the majority of our economy hasn't seen a job/wage growth to keep up the rate of spending increases (so it's just post-recession bounce back). So the increase in sales are going to flatline. 

All this, in addition to an interesting Buffet essay I read (on reddit) about how corporations often list their pension gains as an increase in profit, which would lead me to think that much of the gains in the stock market would make larger companies' books look better.

personalfinance,Canada Tax Question - Common Law Relationships,"I've been taking a tax course in university and I was thinking of ways to reduce my tax liability for the year. I had a good paid internship for most of the year so my income is fairly high and even though basic calculations have me receiving a refund for this tax year overall, it can still be increased.

My question is on common law relationships. Under my federal and provincial tax forms non-refundable credits can be claimed for a spouse or common law partner. For 2013 this will amount to 11,038 - the Net Income of said person. Technically I do not have a common law partner, just a long-term girlfriend who does not live with me (she lives at home and has very little income for 2013). If I were to claim her as a common law partner it would boost my refund by over 25% by my calculations. Would doing this be viable or is this something that can actually be audited by the CRA, what additional impact may this have on my return?

If you have any additional tax avoidance advice etc. for Canada that is also welcome! Especially thoughts that are not fairly obvious (like RRSP contributions).

Ill start by saying a few years ago I purchased a car from a used car dealership. Since I was a high risk, no credit individual they gave me a terrible rate (18%) on a 17,000 loan.

6 months after paying on that loan, I switched financial institutions to my local bank and got a much better rate of 4.9%. When I financed this vehicle, I took out an extra 3500 on it because I needed the money to consolidate debt into 1 loan.

A rough period happened where I lost my job and didn't have income so I was using my ""emergency"" credit card (1000.00 limit). Right now my credit card sits at $824.xx, this I can manage the payments on but its still an outstanding debt.

My real issue comes down to my vehicle. I traded the original vehicle into Honda and purchased a brand new 2012 Honda Civic. The negative equity from that loan brought over on top of it put the Final price of my civic at 26,000 (yes I know this is a ton for a civic). I retained my 4.9% interest rate and I felt good about myself.

I now have 34,000 miles on the civic and I am quickly depreciating its value more than I am paying off on it. What i want to do is get rid of this Civic, and purchase a used vehicle. My only issue is I cannot get a loan to pay off the ""negative equity"" in order to be able to trade this vehicle. Nor will any lendors put negative equity on a low cost used vehicle.

What are my options here, What should i do to try and get out from under this vehicle.

Currently owe 22,710.00 on a car, that has an estimated trade in value of 16,785.00. Private party is 18,500.00

Bills Total - $1636/month, $818 taken from paycheck, put into bills checking account

Leftover Money - $466/month, $233/pay check, ""Leftover"" money goes into separate checking account
  
A few notes:

-I have $818 pulled from every pay check and put into a specific checking account reserved only for bills. I don’t touch that account. The cash bills go into an envelope system I have. The rest of my paycheck gets split into that Ally savings that you see and my regular checking account for whatever is leftover.

-Utility bills are split between my roommates. Also while my rent is so cheap, $900/3 is $300 each.

-I KNOW that my car eats of 30% of my income and that it should be closer to 15%. I am well aware of that. However, it’s a three year lease that I cannot get out of until July 2016. After my last car died, I spent a month researching the right car for me. My last car was a money pit and I wanted something newer (not necessarily fancier) so that I wouldn’t have to worry about expensive maintenance. At the time I was also commuting via train to the city for my job. Since then, I was offered a wonderful job that required me to drive 20 miles, hence the added expense of EZ Pass and gas. When I bought the car I was expecting to be training into the city every day, but the job was something I couldn’t turn down.

-Food might be high, but that is groceries as well as restaurants and eating out.

-The PFCU Credit Card Loan is the result of racking up $5000 in credit card debt during college. Thankfully I stopped using them before it got too out of control and now I have one open credit card with a $0 balance that is there for my credit report. I live within my means. I’m throwing as much money at that loan as I possibly can with the goal being to have it paid off by next summer.

-I have ZERO savings. The savings that you see going into the Ally account usually gets pulled to pay toward something else. This is my ultimate conundrum. I am very good at budgeting and living within the budget. That “leftover” money goes to other expenses like birthday gifts, concert tickets, starbucks, etc. My problem is that when I come into extra money, I throw it at the credit card loan or at my student loan interest (p.s. $14k in student loans, in deferment, $800 in interest, trying to pay that off before it capitalizes, by that time I should have the credit card loan paid off and I’ll put the $400/month into student loans).

-I don’t have health insurance taken out of my paycheck (other than the HSA for prescriptions and such) because my mom works for the state, aka really awesome insurance so there’s not point in my paying for less coverage that I won’t use.

personalfinance,"Should I use money from a trust to pay off car loans, credit cards, and invest the savings?","I'm using a throwaway because my main account is too easy to find my real name, etc.

I'm 30, fully employed, married (wife is also employed) with 2 kids, 2 cars, and a mortgage. Some other outside debt, some small credit card balance usually from various medical expenses.

When my mother died last year, me and my siblings were given trusts from the inheritance. Mine currently stands at about $220,000, and is invested in many diversified areas, managed by an advisor and trustee. I generally do not touch this money as both my wife and I are employed and can pay our bills outside of it. We did use some of it to make a larger home down payment, but since then we haven't taken out a dollar. It tends to go as the market does, but thus far has been gaining money slowly and steadily. Since I'm not a finance expert I couldn't really figure out the overall rate of return on the statement, since it has a lot of varying assets.

We have a few debts- we both have cars under loan, mine is 4 years old and hers 2. My car is a little nicer, so we owe about the same- about $10,000 each, on our cars. Our cars would sell/trade in for about this much. My interest rate is 1.49%, hers I think about 2.5%-3%. Overall, this translates to about $300 a month for me, and $280 a month for her in car payments. We also have a mortgage of about $1,850 per month which we just started with earlier this year (bought at the ebb of home loan interest rates- win!).

Our credit cards, primarily used for medical expenses (which amazingly add up with children!) have between us about $2,000 total. We pay above the minimum, but do tend to keep a balance between $500-$2,000 between about 3 cards.

My question is, I'm trying to figure out if it would make sense for us to take about $22,000, give or take, out of the trust to pay off our cars and credit cards in totality, and then take the $600-$700 in extra monthly income between us and begin to invest in a 401k, college funds, life insurances, or IRA? Or, should I keep my (manageable) debts, and allow the trust to continue to earn on a higher amount of principal?

On the surface it seems like a good idea to pay them off, but it also might not be, as it may earn more in the trust as is than in a 401k or IRA, and I might be throwing good money after bad by ""investing"" in a car that's going to depreciate.

personalfinance,Your 401k and You: Basic Information,"There's been a bumper crop of questions about 401ks in the past 24 hours, so I would like to summarize some of the main things you need to know about your 401k.

**ELI5: How does a 401k work?**

In plain English, *a 401k is an account you put money into that receives favorable tax treatment*.  Each year you can elect to contribute money to your 401k plan through payroll deductions.  Elective deductions are usually specified as a percentage of your income, although some plans allow you to specify a dollar amount as well.  The annual contribution limit is $17,500 in 2013.  Do not go over this limit (some plans will not let you, and will simply stop accepting contributions once you reach $17,500).

401k plans come in two flavors:

* **Traditional 401k** plan contributions reduce your taxable income.  This is known as tax deferral - you are not taxed on the money you contribute now, but will pay income tax on your contributions *and* your earnings at your marginal tax rate when you take distributions from your 401k in the future.

* If you contribute to a **Roth 401k**, contributions have already been taxed at your current marginal income tax rate.  In exchange, all earnings may be distributed *tax free* if the distribution meets certain age and eligibility requirements.  Note that not all 401k plans have a Roth option.

Which one do you choose?  It depends on a lot of factors, but the big ones are:

* Income - High earners are usually better off contributing to a traditional 401k, as this allows them to avoid paying their current high marginal tax rate.  Conversely, those with lower incomes usually favor the Roth option, as they can pay a low marginal tax rate now in exchange for never being taxed on that money again.

* Your guess about your future income tax rates - Those that believe they will be in a lower income tax bracket when they retire usually favor the traditional 401k.  Those that believe they will be in a higher income tax bracket when they retire usually favor the Roth option.  Those that believe income tax rates will rise across the board in the future usually favor the Roth option.

Money you contribute to your 401k must then be invested in the funds your 401k provider offers you.  

**ELI5: How should I invest within my 401k?**

Once you have contributed to your 401k, you are still left with the somewhat daunting decision of how to invest within your plan.  For better or for worse, 401k providers typically ""help"" by limiting your choices to a small number of mutual funds (after all, the only true freedom is freedom from choice, right?).  

A good strategy that will serve anyone well is the [3-fund portfolio](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio).  In the 3-fund portfolio you aim to hold broadly diversified index funds in the three major asset classes:  US stocks, International stocks, and Bonds.  By investing in this manner you are instantly diversified across thousands of different securities, will never significantly underperform the market, and are mathematically certain to outperform most investors doing differently.

Identifying what asset class a fund belongs to can be challenging, especially if your 401k provider doesn't break them out for you.  Googling the fund name or looking up the ticker symbol on a website like Morningstar will usually make it obvious.  If you're not sure, ask /r/personalfinance.  Identifying which funds are index funds can be even more difficult, but in general index funds will have **expense ratios** that are much lower than the other available funds.  The expense ratio is the annual fee you pay for the privilege of investing in the fund.  **A low expense ratio is the single best indicator of superior long-term performance.**  An expense ratio of 1.5% may not seem like a lot, but when compared with an index fund charging an expense ratio of 0.3%, that 1.2% difference compounded over 30 years will add up to tens of thousands of dollars in lost returns.  Vanguard offers various tools to compare the costs of investing in high or low expense ratio funds ([1](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/retirement/cost-affect-retirement-spending-tool),[2](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/tools/costcompare)).

Unfortunately not all 401k plans are created equal, and some fund selections are truly horrendous containing funds with expense ratios in excess of 1.5%.  If this is the case for your 401k plan, consider [campaigning for improvements](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/How_to_campaign_for_a_better_401(k\)_plan).  While you're doing that, make the best of a bad situation and choose the lowest-cost funds in your plan.  You could also consider funding an IRA before contributing to your 401k (since this is a post about 401ks I will not go into the details here - see the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq) or Google ""IRA""), however, if you are saving for retirement you should contribute to your tax-advantaged accounts to their limits before putting money in a taxable account with no tax advantages.

**ELI5: Asset Allocation**

Your asset allocation is how you divide your money amongst the various asset classes and the various funds you've elected to invest in.  The literature on asset allocation is extensive - use Google if you want the nitty gritty details.  Here are some basic rules of thumb:

* The core of your portfolio should be the three major asset classes - US stock index funds, International Stock index funds, and Bond index funds.

* A good starting point for determining your bond holding percentage is [your age]%.  

* At least 20% of your stock holdings is recommended to be in an international stock index fund [[Source](https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/internationalbrief.pdf)].

* The younger you are, the more risk you can afford to take on in the form of higher allocations to stocks.

* Your asset allocation can and **should** change over time.  A 25-year old's investments will be very different than a 55-year old's.

* Target date funds take the work out of asset allocation for you.  Target date funds will automatically get more conservative as you age, reducing your exposure to major market movements as your ability to wait them out declines.

**Some other frequently asked questions**

1\. *My employer does not match my contributions.  Should I still contribute to my 401k?*

If your employer does not match contributions and you are looking to save money in a tax-advantaged account, most people will be better served with an IRA.  However, the IRA contribution limit is $5,500 per year and has income limitations.  If your income is such that you do not get the full tax advantages of an IRA, it is absolutely worth contributing to your 401k in order to save for retirement.

2\. *My 401k is crappy.  Should I still contribute to it?*

If your 401k has a poor selection of high cost funds, consider contributing to an IRA first.  You can open an IRA with whoever you want, thus allowing you to choose which funds you have access to.  If you have already maximized your IRA contribution for the year and still have money left over you want to put towards retirement, you should contribute to your poor 401k.  The effect of high expenses really only starts to bite after long periods of time, and 401ks are quite portable in that you can roll them to your IRA if you leave your current employer, or sometimes you can roll it into a new 401k with a new employer.  Bad 401k plans can turn into great IRAs in a heartbeat.

3\.  *I want to retire early.  Should I contribute to my 401k and lock up my money until age 59.5?*

You should take advantage of the tax structure of the 401k for at least some of your savings, assuming you are planning to live past 59.5 years of age.  Early retirement requires a lot of planning - you should project your needs before and after you're eligible to take distributions from your 401k and plan accordingly.

From /u/arichi:  If you plan to retire before 59.5, but close to it - say, at 55 or so - you can use 72(t) distributions to access pre-tax money without penalty. If you do so even earlier, you can access it with a five-year delay via a Roth IRA conversion ladder, although you'll still need the first five years' expenses available via taxable accounts, Roth IRA contributions, and perhaps part-time work.

4\.  *Pay off debt or contribute to my 401k?*

If your employer matches any of your 401k contributions you should contribute enough to get the full match.  This is free money that you should not leave on the table. After that, any high interest debt carrying interest rates beyond what you could reasonably get investing elsewhere should take priority.  Remember that paying down debt offers something that only scammers can claim otherwise - guaranteed, risk free return!

5\.  *I'm a young person and want to invest aggressively - why invest in bonds at all?*

Bonds provide a source of funds to purchase potentially higher-yielding investments when they can be had at discount prices during market downturns, reduce your portfolio's volatility, and usually offer a steady return themselves.  On the technical side, there are numerous studies that show that 100% (or more) stock investors are not compensated in proportion to the extra risk they take on by doing so.  While stocks have outperformed bonds over the long run to date, ""past performance is not indicative of future returns.""  Finally, the psychological/emotional effects of a severe bear market really cannot be appreciated until they're felt first hand.  It is one thing to say you're OK watching half of your investment portfolio evaporate in a few weeks.  It's quite another to watch it happen for real and have the wherewithal to stay the course.  Bonds offer some consolation in such a scenario.

6\.  *What is a vesting period?*

(By suggestion from /u/dgmachine)  Any contributions that come out of your paycheck are always 100% yours.  However, if your employer provides any matching contributions to your 401k, occasionally they become yours according to a *vesting schedule*.  A vesting schedule is essentially a time delay between when the money your employer contributes becomes ""yours,"" and is used as an incentive to keep employees with a particular company.  Vesting schedules can take many forms - some schedule vesting in 20% increments (20% the first year, 40% the second year, etc.), some have a set amount of time (100% vesting after 3 years), others do not have a vesting period at all and the money is yours immediately.  Your company's HR section should be able to explain the terms of your company's vesting schedule, if you have one.

personalfinance,Am I paying the right tax?,"Transplant from the UK to the US here so bit confused about the whole tax thing and the W4. 

Our online pay things for our jobs both show us as filing as married, but with two federal allowances. I was under the impression it should be just filing as married.

We use Paycomonline in my job, which shows ;

Federal Filing Status as married, and number of federal exceptions as 2 rather than zero. 

So I'm concerned I'm paying too little tax.

Similarly if I put my wifes wages into the tax calculators online with JUST filing as married as the status, it reads that we're paying about 30-40 bucks less than we should be in tax. If I put the two withholding items in, it's about 2-3 bucks off what she's actually getting paid.

We're married, both have jobs, and no kids or anything other than the standard stuff. 

Second part to this question.

I've created a spreadsheet in excel to work as a calculator so I can work out what we should be being paid manually. Kinda helps me understand it, you know?

If we ARE supposed to have those two federal allowances on top, how do I calculate that? How much is an 'allowance' ?

-------

So here's my calculation process
(I found out on the tax tables that the 'bi weekly' figures they gave weren't all that accurate, so I take the annual figure and divide by 26)

For my wife's income per pay packet, earning between $26,150 and $80,000 dollars a year with her gross pay being $1252.40 (As an example)

The tax table says that annually for income over $26,150 annually, the tax paid should be $1785 + 15%. 

To get the biweekly rate, $26,150 / 26 = $1005.76923077
So, for any income over $1005.76923077, add tax paid (So $1785/26 = 68.6538461538) then add 15% of that amount.

So, income of $1252.40 - $1005.76923077 = $246.630769

15% of $246.630769 is $36.9946153, then add $68.6538461538 which comes too $105.648461454, round it to 2 real money and that tells me that her Federal withholding should be $105.65

Is that.. even close? What about if I add two witholding items? How do I calculate that?

personalfinance,High earning couple with high big law school debt,"Alright guys here it goes:

Wife - 33 years old 130k/yr +~10k bonus  22k saved in 401k.  
Joint savings of around 12k from wedding gifts/etc.


Her debt:  Around 210k total: 130k in private loans (9%), 60k in federal loans (not sure on the rate of this one but I know its the lowest of the 3), 20k in CC debt (19%).  

Expenses: 1800/m in rent in Chicago, 150 for cable/internet, 50 for electric, 20 for gas, 130 for cell phone bills, ~300 groceries, ~300 restaurant expenses.  No car/transport costs since we bike everywhere year round.  

My wife and I are both putting in 5% to 401k for a 5% employer match. We are also stashing away 500/m into savings.  

All of the rest is going towards attacking the CC and the private student loan. It is looking like it will take ~ 5 years to pay all of this off sticking to our schedule.  

We are married and will file at the single rate for the upcoming tax season but unfortunately it appears as though  we do not get any breaks in student loan interest because we make too much according to the IRS.

I apologize if the following is stupid/obvious. I am in my early 20's and, as I suspect is common with many people my age, I don't really know what I'm doing with money. 

I inherited a large sum of money when my mother died - around $220,000. It is currently sitting in a high interest account in a Canadian bank account - interest rate is listed today as 1.1%. I do not currently have any money in GICs (the Canadian equivalent of CDs I believe).

I recently started grad school in the US. A family member who is involved in my money matters advised me to open student loans for tuition and living expenses. I did it without really thinking about it (stupid I know). I have paid for 1.5 years and right now I am sitting at $83,000 worth of debt (expensive school, out-of-state student). The principal was $79,500 and I have accumulated around $4000 worth of interest so far. The interest rate for most of the money is 6.33%, with about a third sitting at 7.9%. I do not have to start paying it back until 2016.

So, my dilemma is if I should keep the money in Canada and save it, or use it to pay my tuition and living expenses immediately so that I am not in debt. My family member led me to believe that it would be wisest to save my money and let it accumulate interest, as he believed I would gain more through it's interest than I would lose through the loan's interest. I am starting to doubt if that is correct, and would like to resolve the situation before my interest climbs higher and higher.

What should I do? What should I research more? My Canadian bank offers several type of GICs, but I would prefer something where I do not stand the chance to lose money. I would be willing to speak to a financial advisor, but I am not really sure how to go about finding one.

I have a financed 2008 Toyota Yaris. I've had it six months and there's nine grand left on the loan. The interest rate is an asinine 22 percent (I needed a car to be elligible for a promotion, no credit, minimal savings. Also I'm an idiot). The insurance is two hundred sixty a month through progressive. I have to have full coverage, and I'm a young male. I can make the $310 payments and cover insurance, but it puts me right on the edge of living paycheck to paycheck. I'm saving maybe a hundred dollars a month.

My grandmother is willing to basically give me her beat up old car in exchange for driving her around. I'd feel obligated to pay her something, probably a hundred a month for a year. AC doesn't work and it runs kind of hot, just shy of overheating, on longer trips. I live very close to work so that wouldn't be an immediate issue.

The dealership I bought it from has a trade in pre-approval form on their site that values my car at $5,360 - $7,280. So I'd be upside down, and still making payments if I just cut my losses and walked away from this. Assuming I got six grand and kept making my current payments of $310 I'd be out of this by next September. Until then I'd be pretty much in the same boat, plus an extra hundred or so saved from insurance.

I can probably refinance to a less terrible rate, but I can't see it freeing up more than a hundred or so bucks a month.

My tentative plan is to refinance, sell, pay down remainder as quick as possible, and hope nothing goes wrong with my grandmother's old car. Thoughts?

Bitcoin,US Banking System to take a bite of bitcoin exchange deposits.,"I went to my credit union (First Tech Federal Credit Union) to make a wire transfer to Bitstamp today. They told me that, beginning Monday, all foreign wire transfers must undergo a conversion to the local currency of the recipient (with the exception of recipients in Aruba, Brazil, China, Ethiopia, and Libya). In the case of Bitstamp (Slovenia) that means the funds will be converted to Euro. If your Bitstamp account is denominated in USD, there will be a further currency conversion. The banking system will, of course, take a cut of every currency conversion. These changes are due to recent changes to Regulation E going into effect.

The new regulations also provide for a 30-minute period of time in which the sender can cancel the transfer. I was very intrigued by the way my credit union is implementing this part of the regulation. They put it this way:

""**Please allow up to 45 minutes for us to assist you.** You'll now need to wait while we collect your information, create the disclosure you need to sign and provide you a receipt confirming your request.""

personalfinance,I desperately need serious advice: SHOULD I BUY A HOUSE?,"I have asked this of my parents, my bank, my friends--everyone I know. Everyone gave me different advice. My situation is below, any comments or suggestions or observations are welcome:

-I'm 24 and I net (after taxes, insurance, etc.) $3000 per month.

-I just ""soft graduated"" college (undergrad done) and am currently wrapping up an MBA but am working full time as well. As such, I am not making payments on my student loans because I am over half time (still considered in school) and get free tuition as I work a University.

-I will continue to not have to make student loan payments for the foreseeable future, as I am going to work towards a Master's of Accounting for the next 2 years and remain over half time. 

-I have negligible credit card debt and excellent credit (750+).

-I have $60,000 in student loans and a $15,000 car loan. Very low interest on both. I plan on voluntarily paying interest on the student loans as I THINK I can get back up to $2,500 back on my taxes.

-Out of the $3,000 gross, I spend AT THE MOST $2,000 of that (bills, payments, eating out/entertainment, groceries, gas everything), meaning I can save about $1,000 a month (likely significantly more). These figures come from my expense tracking excel sheet (yes, I like to track things down to the penny) and therefore know that I can easily save that much a month, more if necessary.

-My lease is up at the end of may, by which time I should have about $9,000 in a savings account. 

-I live with two of my brothers who will move into this house if I were to buy it for $300 a month each (which will about cover the monthly payments).

I want to buy this house because prices and interest rates are on the rise--I feel like it's now or never.I hate throwing money away when I could be gaining equity in something--partially on my brother's dimes (they will live wiht me for at least another 3 years, btw). I want to buy a $100-$150k dollar house, meaning that with escrow I'd be paying $700-900 a month in my area.

I can finance a house in that price range with 3.5% down for about $8,000-$9,000 (because I have to prepay escrow for a year).

IS THIS A BAD IDEA? I'd be cutting it so close, I'd be in over $200k in debt at 24. This is scary, but I need to invest. I'll never have a better time to buy a house. It's overwhelming and I have no idea what to do...

While we're on the subject--I have this myth in my head that the mortgage and student loan interest isn't that bad because the vast majority of it comes back to me in income taxes, is this a falsehood?

I also (god willing) will be making over $3,000 a month in a couple of years as well because I plan on getting a better job with two master's degrees and a load of technical experience, but I'm not COUNTING on that. My job security is nearly 100% at my current job, no worries there.

I have been monitoring my credit recently because I don't have much in the way of established credit. It has been steadily going up but one collection is seriously hurting my score.

Bitcoin,"Refuting the myth that a Bitcoin economy would experience ""deflation,"" causing depressions","With Bitcoin getting more attention, there has been more spreading of the myth that *any* fall in prices is ""deflation"" and thus the cause of depressions and low economic growth.

What you must be absolutely clear to distinguish are: **monetary deflation** and **falling prices**, sometimes called ""price deflation"". Most economists now use the word deflation simply as a synonym for falling prices; this however tends to be very misleading, since falling prices have no necessary connection to depressions. The original meanings of the words inflation and deflation were, respectively, an increase or a decrease in the **supply of money**; I will follow this usage.

Thus, it is vital to remember that, in the **monetary** sense, Bitcoin is *not* a deflationary currency. Nor is it inflationary (after its initial start-up period). It is invariable. That is, its supply is constant. (Sure, there may be a few coins lost here and there, but this is not significant.)

Price is essentially a relation of demand (money spent to buy goods) over supply (the quantity of goods sold). It is just a fraction: D/S. Like any fraction there are two possible ways that prices can change: a change in the numerator (more or less money spent) or a change in the denominator (more or fewer goods sold).

Prices can fall in two basic ways: either less money is spent, or more goods are sold. In a depression, prices fall because of the first reason: less money is spent. This can happen either because less money exists, or because the same money is not spent as often.

I am not going to elaborate this point (look elsewhere for a thorough explanation), but what precipitates a depression is that the quantity of money is artificially expanded, and the money that exists is spent more quickly because of ""easy credit"" policies. When these policies stop, spending slows down, causing banks to fail, which causes checkbook money actually to go out of existence. This causes spending to decrease even further, causing prices to crash and people to go bankrupt because they cannot pay back loans for a fixed sum of money.

**The destruction of (bank created) money seen in a depression is real ""deflation"".**

In a theoretical Bitcoin economy, there is no ""monetary policy"" (i.e. government intervention with the money supply). Or, to put the point a different way, there is an inherent policy of laissez-faire. Therefore, there is no tendency toward an artificial expansion of money and credit, and thus no ability for monetary deflation to occur.

The only possible source of falling prices in a Bitcoin economy would be from an increased number of goods sold: i.e. from increased production. This causes prices to fall. But wages stay the same, causing *real wages* (the goods you can actually buy) to increase. The only way someone will tend to earn a lower monetary wage (i.e. the same real wage) is if he does not keep up his own production to match the average economy-wide increase in production. Even though the money is more valuable, it is no more difficult for the average person to earn the same amount of money as he used to earn, since the increase in *average* productivity will necessarily cause the *average* person to be more productive.

Therefore, when you take out a loan of 1000 BTC and go to pay back 1100 BTC, it is no more difficult to earn back the principal that it was when you borrowed it. This is true even if 1000 BTC a few years later buys many more goods than it used to buy. The only difficulty lies in earning the interest, which is to be expected.

There is also no tendency to undermine savings and investment. In a Bitcoin economy, people would likely tend to keep more cash on hand, since it would be more valuable to hold and ""easy credit"" would not be available. But there would be no tendency to *keep* hoarding up *more and more* cash on hand (which is harmful). Bitcoin kept as cash on hand would, in a growing economy, gain value over time, true. But Bitcoin lent out to other people would gain *even more* on top of that. So everyone would rather loan out the larger portion of his savings, apart from the money needed for day-to-day expenses and for emergencies.

The average business, like the average worker, would find it no more difficult to keep earning the same amount of profit each year, even though that profit buys more goods. (Because to the very extent that money increases in value each year, the average business would find itself able to earn that money.) Thus, it would pay that business to take out a loan for 1000 BTC in exchange for 5% interest if it thought that it could make a 10% Bitcoin profit. This is true even if the *real profit* in terms of goods is 20% and the *real interest* 10%. The only thing that would be removed is the systematic tendency, in an inflationary currency, for profits to be overstated, since dollars earned at the end of the year are worth less than dollars spent at the beginning of the year.

In no respect would a Bitcoin economy have any tendency toward actual deflation (destruction of money) or toward economic stagnation.",cryptocurrency,1382578178

In a former life I didn’t bother to pay income taxes as a consultant, and that’s screwing me badly now. I’m working out a payment plan with them, and making that my top priority. I don’t have a 401k or IRA. I could pay off the collections, but I could probably negotiate paying a lower amount for a deletion.

I live by myself in a studio in Manhattan. Utilities are electricity (~$70 / mo), phone (~$60 / mo), FIOS (~$70 / mo). The biggest expenses I deal with are rent and taxes.

If I were to move into a place with roommates to reduce my rent, that might distract me from doing good work as a consultant. While I could do this, it seems like a net loss.

I pay big taxes living in NYC. Tax, social security, etc remove 31% from each paycheck. If I didn’t have to pay backtaxes, I would max $17.5k 401k, $5.5k IRA, and $50k self 401k, drastically reducing my immediately taxable income.

personalfinance,Need Advice For Personal Debt,"So, I'm looking for some advice from someone who is most likely more money savvy than myself.

I'm currently in debt.  For my current situation, it's considerable.  I'm trying to improve my credit score and reduce payments on what I owe based on interest rates and things like that, and I'm trying to see what options are available to me.

Right now, here's an approximation of my current debt:

$2000 on a 24.9% credit card
$3300 on a 14.24% credit card
$700 on a retail credit card currently not charging interest (and the current balance will not charge interest until November 2014)
$400 on a 22.9% retail credit card
$2400 at 7.75% on a private student loan
$35,000 in student loans currently in forebearance (until June 2014)

I also don't own any worthwhile tangible assets (I rent, and my car is a POS).  I do, however, have a 401(k) {more on that later}.

Now, let me make one thing clear: I'm getting by right now.  I'm making more than minimum payments on most of these debts, but I know there's a big ugly head looming for me in June.  The interest charges are substantial on some of these, and I know that's hurting me.  Addtionally, I'm looking to relocate closer to my current job in about 6 months, so my cost of living is definitely going to go up.

Right now, these are the following options that I see available to me:

Loan Consolidation:  I've heard mixed reviews about these, and I have friends who went through this years ago and are still a long way from paying it all off.  It seems like that, while it helps to reduce payments, you're making those payments for quite some time.

401(k) Borrowing:  I have the option of borrowing against my 401(k).  The full stats are the following:  I can borrow $3500 and use it to pay off high-interest loans.  Assuming a 24-month loan period, my APR would be 6.84%, and I would pay back a total of $3754.67 (this includes interest and fees).  The repayments are post-tax payroll deductions.

Normal Private Loan:  I would imagine that this would be more expensive than a 401(k) loan, though I'm not sure how feasible it would be.

ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Program):  In 6-month increments, I can invest money into a brokerage account.  Every 6 months, the money invested is turned into company stock, and is purchased at the lowest share value within that 6 month period.  I hear good news out of this practice from other employers, but this is 6 months down the road.

personalfinance,Question about overpayment on mortgage vs. investing,"So I've seen multiple posts regarding ""should I make extra payments to my mortgage or invest instead?"" The general consensus seems to be to invest if your mortgage APR is just barely beating inflation. However I feel like this will only work if you plan on living in the same house until the mortgage is paid off. If you have a 30-year mortgage at 4%, the general advice is to invest in S&amp;P index where average returns are between 7 - 10% rather than payoff your mortgage early which would be a guaranteed 4%. 

So what if you only lived in your house for 5 years (and then sold it) where most of your mortgage payments are front-loaded interest? Isn't the effective interest rate higher than 4%? If you end up paying 50k over the first 5 years of the mortgage, but only 10k goes to principle, the effective rate seems much higher.

politics,Rep. Derek Kilmer's Response to my letter concerning CISPA.,"Dear Mr. Redacted,

Thank for you for contacting me about your concerns regarding cybersecurity and online privacy. I appreciate you taking the time to write and share your thoughts with me. 

Internet freedom and online privacy are principles which have helped make the United States a global leader in technology. Internet freedom is one of the reasons our country continues to attract the best and brightest high-tech talent from around the world. With many significant computer software and Internet companies in our region, our local economy is dependent on making sure that we are able to protect online commerce and preserve the basic rights of Internet users.

At the same time, we need to ensure that law enforcement has the tools they need to keep our country and our infrastructure, including the internet, safe. Cyber threats exist, and it is important that private industry and law enforcement have the ability to share information to identify and guard against threats. In fact, we have already seen serious breaches of security in our U.S. financial institutions, private companies, and military. In addition, with potential cyber attacks on our power grids and our financial institutions, there is a real concern among the national security community that we could face a massive disruption to our nation that could impact our economy and safety. Cyber economic espionage could cost the U.S. economy upwards of $400 billion a year.

Congress must both protect our civil liberties and give our security agencies the tools that they need to deter threats to our safety. I will work to ensure that Congress conducts the rigorous oversight over our intelligence and security agencies that our democracy demands. 

Rep. Mike Rogers (Mich.) introduced H.R. 624, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, or CISPA, to enable the federal government to share timely information about cyber threats with private companies and allow private companies to share some cyber threat information.

I'm glad that this bill incorporates a number of improvements over the version that Congress considered last year. The bill now includes a number of important civil liberties protections. For instance, the bill:

    Requires the federal government to eliminate any personal information it may receive from private companies that is not necessary to understanding cyber threats;
    Directs the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to closely oversee how the cyber threat information sharing program is affecting our privacy rights and civil liberties;
    Requires the federal government to only retain information that is purely for cyber security purposes, investigating and prosecuting cybersecurity crimes, protection of minors, and protection of individuals from bodily harm;
    Prohibits the government from using personal information from library, gun sales, tax, educational, and medical records;
    Prohibits the federal government from searching or analyzing the content of an individual's email or loading any monitoring software on anyone's personal computer; and
    Provides a five-year sunset provision on the bill to ensure that Congress must review and evaluate the legislation before renewing it.

Sharing information helps keep our nation safe, but strong safeguards are essential to ensuring private citizens' information is protected.

I supported this bill because it provides a valuable first step toward protecting our country's cyber infrastructure. I am hopeful that as the bill moves through the Senate additional protections for civil liberties will be strengthened. I look forward to continuing the conversation with all stakeholders to ensure we are supporting innovation, keeping our nation safe, and protecting American's fundamental right to privacy.

I will be sure to keep your thoughts in mind as Congress debates this issue in the future. I encourage you to continue to share your views with me on this topic or any other issue. Thank you for reaching out. It is an honor to serve as your representative.

Sincerely,

Bitcoin,I am uncomfortable with ULBRICHT's indictment in Maryland Federal court.,"ULBRICHT is the guy arrested behind Silk Road.

In the Maryland Federal court case, undercover federal investigators created a situation and created hitmen that could solve the created situation. Ulbricht obliged and the undercover investigators staged a fake torture session and death, and Ulbricht paid them for their services. Feel free to analyze the court docket again to see who suggested what, I'm not trying to take sides here, even if my wording suggests that.

This is the first time Ulbricht paid for a hit. This is the first time Ulbricht became aware of the market value for a hit. Ulbricht thought that his business would make him eventually have to deal with these kind of situations to maintain his service, but he never actually encountered a situation to warrant it.

Fast forward to the second instance, in the Manhattan Federal Court indictment with different investigators, he is again encountered with a situation to murder someone for their noncompliance. This is the one that demonizes him because he mentions that ""the price of this hit is high, because the last one only cost [blah blah]"" the last one being the fake hit the others feds concocted in the other indictment. I have my doubts that ULBRICHT would have considered this a viable solution to a problem if he wasn't encountered with the first fake hit, and I believe he wouldn't have been scammed out of so much money if he wasn't given a market rate for the first fake hit.

This makes me uncomfortable with the federal tactics here. It will work perfectly for the courts, for the media, but it still makes me uncomfortable.",cryptocurrency,1382805727
personalfinance,Loan advice,"I'll be graduating in May with $28k in loans and ~$1200 in interest from my unsubsidized loans. I expect to have a decent job before I graduate. The loan breakdown (if it matters) is $16k at 5% with a 9 month grace period after graduation, $9k+~$1200 interest at 6.8% and $3k at 4.5% both with a 6 month grace period. My parents will be giving me ~$8k to help me pay off my loans although they trust me to use it however it would help me the most. My minimum yearly payment will only be ~$3700. I've had a credit card for ~2 years now and always pay it off on time (if that matters).

My question is, what's the best way to use the money from my parents? Should I put some in a Roth IRA before tax day since I assume I'm in the lowest tax bracket since I don't really make anything? Should I save it and use it for loans or at least pay off the accumulated interested? Especially if I have a job right away on top of the 6/9 month grace period is it necessary to save the money for my loans? I assume I should wait to start payment for the subsidized loans since (I think?) they wont gain interest during the grace period, but should I start paying off the unsubsidized right away? Or should I try and get rid of all my loans as soon as possible to avoid as much interest as I can and then start saving for retirement/other things? Should I do maybe half in a Roth IRA and half to start my emergency fund? Or should I save it since I have no idea what kind of relocation money I'll need depending where I get a job? I have a useful degree from a top school and I'll probably go into data analysis so I should get a decent starting salary.

I just have no idea what the best way to use the money is. I know it's not a lot, but it's still way more than I've ever had.

And in the order I should pay them off, I know I should get rid of the $9k first, but then should I work on the $16k or $3k? Assuming I have no issue making the minimum payment, should I get rid of the $16k next and just ignore the $3k until last? There's only 0.5% difference in the interest rates and it would be nice to just have the one loan leftover, but would it be stupid financially to do the $3k second?

news,Property Investment - Being a Good Manager,"Most investment property financing acts like a mortgage which allows you to buy a property when you don't have the immediate funds to cover it. You need to be sure that the interest rate on your property investment financing is not so high that after you've developed a property and sold it on you don't make a profit. This means that you need to research whatever property management involves.

news,Gold prices hit one-month peaks on Thursday,"Gold prices hit one-month peaks on Thursday on expectations the Federal Reserve would have to sustain its stimulus efforts owing to relatively high U.S. jobless claims, while technical support ended a rout in U.S. crude oil. 

Gold broke above US $1,350 an ounce for the first time in more than a month, on rekindled buying interest prompted by ideas that the Fed will continue its monetary stimulus after Thursday's disappointing U.S. jobless claims data. 

Bullion also rallied after the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell less than expected last week. 

U.S. gold futures for December settled up US $16.30 an ounce at US $1,350.30, with trading volume on track to finish near their 30-day average.

personalfinance,Could really use some advice/encouragement,"Hi guys,

I am really down about my situation.  I graduated pharmacy school and am now a pharmacist.  My wife is a nurse and makes good money too.  We have 2 little girls.  We have a horrifically giant student loan debt to repay now.  After looking at numbers I feel defeated.  I truly appreciate any advice you could offer.  Thank you!

Gross annual household income: ~$185,000 base or more with overtime.

My Income: 54.50/hr.  Net pay ranges from $3500 to $4500 for 2 weeks.  This could go down as I am claiming 3 dependents and plan to change to zero to avoid possibly owing in next year.  Also I get paid travel time but that will go away eventually.  Pay could realistically be $2500-3000 for 2 weeks. (idk how to determine this for sure).  This is after health/dental/vision removed at $200/check.  

Wife's Income: $40/hr.  She is moving to day shift after returning to work (we just had a baby 5 mos ago).  She will lose her night shift differential so we estimate her pay at about $1900/ 2 weeks.

Estimated monthly income: $8,000 - $11,000 (or more with overtime)

Student loan debt: $218,000  (160k fed 58k private)  Interest is probably about 7-8% average.

Our Monthly Bills:

Mortgage: $1150

Electric: $200

Cell phones &amp; useless Internet AT&amp;T: $230

TV: $90

Car Insurance: $100

Short Term Disability: $50

personalfinance,Credit card consolidation with no income,"I have around $10,000 in unsecured credit card debt spread around 6 cards. The debt was accrued while I was an undergraduate student a few years back--my parents couldn't afford much and credit cards became my only option to stay in school. I'm now a graduate student living on grants and student loans, and do not generally need to use credit cards. I still have the balance however, and the interest rates on some of the cards are well above 20%. I've really only been able to make minimum payments, so most cards are near their credit limit.

I'd love to consolidate these credit cards into one credit product with a lower interest rate so I can start chipping away at them. I have never made a late payment, but because I'm living on student loans I do not technically have an income. I do not have any assets to secure a loan with or a cosigner, and my academic program actually forbids me from having a job. My credit score is fairly low because of my high credit utilization and number of inquiries, but shows no late payments or adverse actions. I was recently denied a credit line increase by my credit union, on the obvious grounds that my debt to income ratio was too high. Is there any possible avenue to consolidating my debt?",finance,1382905785

My loan payments come to about $500 a month.

personalfinance,Need a furnace. Pay with emergency fund or get a loan?,"I'm in a a bit of a hairy situation. Our furnace is 18 years old and the induction motor seized when we turned on the heat for the first time this fall. The HVAC repair guy got it working but advised we either replace the motor ($580) or get a new system, as their are also cracks in the motor housing that could lead to carbon monoxide leaking.

I'm leaning toward replacing the furnace rather than fixing it for a couple reasons. First, the furnace is old. 80% gas furnaces typically last 16-20 years, and this one is probably ready to give up the ghost sooner than later. If we put $580 into repairing the induction motor, their are other more expensive parts that could break soon after. Second, we had a new AC compressor and coil installed earlier this year. A new furnace would save us money on both heating and AC bills, and we would be eligible for approximately for $300 federal tax credit and $350 credit from the power company. Third, while our carbon monoxide detector hasn't shown any CO in the house, I'm getting nervous about it because we have a 8 month old son.

The best quote I've gotten for a decent furnace is $4200. Minus the credits, net cost would be $3550. I'm considering a couple of options to pay for it, if we chose to go this route. 

Option 1 - Use emergency fund. We have $7000 in savings. However, my wife was let go from her job a couple months ago and her income is far less in her new position. Compensation is based on how many clients she can enlist in a service. She's making progress, but she's only brings home about $250 per month after we pay for day care. For this reason, it's possible we may need to draw from our emergency fund if she can't get more clients in the near future.

Option 2 - Secured loan from our credit union. The CU would hold our shares account as collateral and release it upon repayment. Rate is 5%.

Option 3 - Finance through the HVAC company. I'd rather not chose this option as I believe these are typically high interest. Doesn't seem worth it.

Option 4 - Use credit card. This would be the last option. 

Additional details. We have two car loans with balances of $1,170 ($147 per month) and $1,090 ($229 per month). The first is scheduled to be paid off June 2014 and the second will be paid off March 2014. My wife just paid off her students loans and mine ($6000) have been deferred as I work full time and am also working on a PhD. 

Tl;dr - We need a furnace ($3550) and I don't know whether I should use part of the emergency fund ($7000) for it, when there's the potential that we will need emergency funds for living expenses due to wife's lower income. We have the option of paying with a secured loan through our credit union (5% interest for 24 months). Unsure whether the entire savings account is held as collateral or only an amount equal to the loan. We continue to earn interest 0.75% on our savings account while the loan is in repayment.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the outstanding advice. I am going to sleep on what to do. I'm leaning toward purchasing another CO detector to place on the lower level of the house (current one is up by the bedrooms), pricing a new draft inducer motor, and figuring out if I could replace it myself.",finance,1382887631

Bitcoin,How to file a FTC complaint against BFL's illegal business practices,"Many of you are stuck in a position where Butterfly Labs has still not delivered their products to you and are refusing you a refund.  This is illegal in the United States under basic sales contract law.  You do not need an actual physical ""paper"" contract to be entitled to these protections.  The protections are automatic when a sale is made.

As I tried to explain this to Josh I was met with nothing but grade school insults.  You can view the conversation starting at this post if you so wish: 
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=278844.msg3418806#msg3418806

Anyways, there is something you can do today that will help put an end to BFL's illegal business practices.  If you have an order from BFL and you have been refused a refund you may file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.  This is actually very easy.  Go to the following site:

https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#&amp;panel1-1

On the right hand side of the screen, select ""Internet Services, Online Shopping, or Computers"".  For the subcategory, select ""Online Shopping"".  You will see the following options:
   I received merchandise late.
   I never received merchandise.
   I was not notified about a late shipment.
   I did not receive a prompt refund.
   I never received a correct refund.
   Other

Check all that apply, and continue to the next page.  It will now ask you for details about when you requested your refund.  Fill in the information on when you sent your email requesting a refund, the dates, and who responded (if you got a response at all).

Now continue to the next page.  It will ask you for details about the company.  Here they are:
Address: 10770 El Monte
Leawood, KS 66211 
Phone: 1-800-809-MINE (6463)

Now continue to the next page.  It will ask you for your contact information.  This is optional but I recommend filling it out so that they can call you to get more information so they can move forward on taking action against BFL.  However, even if you don't fill out your contact information you will be doing a great service since if enough people file one they will definitely open an investigation of the company.

Now continue to the last page.  This is simply a comments box.  Type all of the relevant information about your experience.  Additional information will help them greatly in their investigation into BFL's business practices and how they are violating consumer protection laws regarding refunds and late deliveries.

That is all.  Go to the next page and it will review your complaint and you can submit it.  The whole process takes less than 10 minutes.",cryptocurrency,1382852975

I relocated for school and a girl about 2 years ago. Long story short school is going well, career going better than expected, and the girl never came so she's out of the picture.

My feedback is more on my loan/savings habits.

I make 35,500 base + commission. Last year i did 88k and this year I'm on pace to do about 115k. I expect commissions to continue at this pace and possibly grow. I also expect a 5-10% raise come February. 

I've been financing school with loans and a small bit of my own capital.. School is about 8200 a quarter. Of that I'm paying roughly 1500 out of pocket. The rest is going onto graduate loans that I'm paying 375 a month on to keep the interest in check and chip away at what principle I can. 

I'm saving about 170 a month into a few mutual funds through an employee program at work. 110 a month into company stock at a 5% discount.(No holding period but if I sell it before I've held it a year I'm taxed on the 5%)

I'm putting 4% of each paycheck into a savings account through discover, 5% into a traditional 401k through work(they match 5%), and 1% into a roth at the moment


Currently have about 5000 in stocks/mutual funds outside of my IRA,
6600 in pension from work,
26k in 401k,
2800 in liquid cash between checking and savings,
Student Loan Debt of 52k(expected to be 65k by the time I graduate in May)

Monthly expenses include

1575 rent,
30 electric,
104 cell phone/internet,
400 to student loans(just increased it a bit this month effective Nov 1),
Credit Card spending... ranges from 2k-3k a month. Typically around 2400.

Should I cut back on my non IRA investments/savings to throw more at my student loans. The interest rates on the loans range from 5.9-7.9. I will be finished in May. I am 27 and will be 28 in Feb.

Obviously I should cut back on my credit card spending. I've identified that I have a problem here but since I've been able to pay it off while saving a bit on a monthly basis it hasn't set off alarms yet.

Starting 1/1/2014 I will have a salary of $64,000/year, it's currently 57k.

I keep ~4k in my checking account

I have ~35k in federal student loan debt at a 6.8% interest rate.

I have a ~12K car loan at 2.7% for 72 months - $200/month pmt.

I currently contribute 10% of my salary to a Roth 401(k) that, since 1/1/2013, has a ROR of 24%. My company matches 6% on my Roth 401(k).

I contribute 2% to an Employee Stock Purchasing Program.

My rent is $700 with about $800/month in other bills (insurance, phone, student loans, etc.)

What is my best move? Do I stop contributing so much to my 401(k) and put it all towards students loans? I feel like it's dumb not to contribute the 6% since my company is matching it, so do I take the extra 4% and put that towards my student loans? I'm just kind of at a loss for the best moves to make.

Could I take the 4% and put it in a more liquid investment to maybe make some cash and use it to pay off my loans quicker?

I don't want to continue with this obviously.

So far I make about $850/paycheck after taxes and such, every other Friday. Here are my expenses:

-$540/mo for rent

-$319/mo for car payment

-$110/mo for car insurance

-$30/mo for gym

~$60 roughly for shared utilities (gas, electric, and internet)


It also takes about $35 to fill up my tank every other week or so.

I want to pay off the card, get my credit to where it needs to be, and possibly refinance the auto loan to get a better interest rate and lower payment. I was also considering a trade-in with the dealership for a used car or one with lower payments, but I think the value of my car is less than what I owe currently.

I just want to get ahead. I currently have no savings, and usually don't have enough to really buy groceries after paying the bills. I need to start building my savings as well as an emergency fund. I have around $1,000 in my 401k at work which I have considered withdrawing for now, but I know that I'll take a huge tax hit and I'm not sure if its worth it. Any and all advice is welcome!

The issue is that my wife is currently pregnant with our first (any day now) and therefore decided not to continue her position as a teacher at the end of last school year (which paid around $43,000/year).  Our plan is to have her stay home with our child until he and any subsequent children are old enough to attend full day preschool.  

Since we would like 1-2 more, this will mean that she will not be working for the next 6-8 years.  With her working, the student loan payments would not be a huge issue, but with only my income, they seriously cut down on what is left after routine and incidental expenses.  

We have the option to get either reduced or graduated payments, which would lower our combined repayment to around $900-1000 a month.  Our thoughts were to do this for the time being and then accelerate our payments once she returns to work.  Is this a good idea?

personalfinance,Retirement account: rollover or refund?,"Several years ago I worked in another state for one year, then moved. I was young and forgot that I had a retirement account with the state I used to work in. I called them up on the phone today an d they said I have $2,976.99 in a defined benefits account at .5% interest. I also have $3,496.30 in a supplemental accountant at 3% interest. I do not plan on returning to work in that state, so I should either refund the account or roll over to another IRA. I'm a graduate student on the job market this year. I have $2,300 in CC debt at 22% APR. I also have between $10,000 and $17,000 in student loans. I don't have the interest rate with me or the exact numbers because they are deferred until I graduate, so I haven't bothered to look them up in a couple of years. 

So, PF, do I refund my account and use that money to pay off CC and student loans? I have no savings because my stipend is just enough to cover the basics.

I've listened to seminars from Robert Kiyosaki, who swears by these certificates, as well as others who tout them as fairly unknown but lucrative and interesting deals. So here I am, using my ""poll the audience"" chip. 

In your response, I'd love to know a couple things: 
1: What do you know about Tax Lien Certificates?
2: If you've invested in this before, what was the actual property? (Real estate/vehicle/etc.)
3: Who did you acquire the certificate from? (County, State, or Federal entity)
4: IN which case the person was not able to eventually pay the taxes, did the government offer to sell you the collateral? 
5: What average interest rate did you receive (should expect to receive) when investing in these certificates? 
6: Any words of caution? 

Thanks, I look forward to hearing from all of those who are much wiser than I (You know who you are). :)

personalfinance,"23M, will be an MD in about a year. No debt. How should I plan my financial future? (Norway)","Hello reddit. 

I'm a 23 year old male from Norway, and in a little over a year I will have finished medical school and will finally start to make some decent money. No kids, and single. I realize I've been quite fortunate as I have no debt at all (having lived at home for most of the time in school, and worked part-time to afford whenever I've been living abroad). What I'm coming here for advice on, is how I can make the best choices regarding my financial future, as I want to make the most ouf ot my money. I have big dreams of starting my own practice sometime in the future, and accumulating wealth for some years seems to be a good way to start.

Following medical school, I will be working as an intern for 1,5 years, with a yearly salary of about 85.000$. The year after that I will work as a lieutenant doctor in the army, with food and board paid for, and a yearly salary ranging between 85.000$ to maybe 130.000$ depending on where I'll be doing my service. These 2,5 years, especially the one in the army, allow me to save a lot of money. If you were me, what would you do to make the most out of this money? I also want to buy an apartment/house after the army and settle down somewhere, but I'm unsure how I should go about this. While working as an intern, I guess renting a cheap hospital-apartment would be the best choice? Real estate in Norway's currently really expensive. [Here's a graph showing how the price per square meter has gone up, with apartments shown in green.](http://www.ssb.no/priser-og-prisindekser/statistikker/bpi/_image/143362.png?_encoded=2f66666666666678302f35382f29303136286874646977656c616373&amp;_ts=141b607c6e8) Should I hope for the bubble to burst before I buy real estate, if there even is a bubble?

My current plan is to just save as much as possible and put it all into index funds once my emergency fund is ready (I'm thinking 2-3 months worth of living costs). Does this sound reasonable? I've already got 11.000$ in index funds, but my current money on hand total 26.000$, most of it sitting in a low interest rate bank for now. Should I touch this money? My philosophy on investing is that I should not invest money I can't afford to let be for 20 years. 

On a different note, I don't know if the same rules and advice seen on this subreddit all apply to me as I'm Norwegian. First of all I have to pay a 28% tax on any stock earnings (once I realize them), in addition to a wealth tax of 1% that starts ticking once I have a wealth of about 170.000$ (but our brand new government wishes to reduce this tax, so we'll see what happens). In addition to this costs of living are high, and my income tax I think will be arout 35-40%.

I'm quite new to finances, investing and what not. I come from a low-average income family where money's never been discussed. My parents refuse to consider anything else than their 2,5% interest bank account. But on the positive side, my upbringing has taught me to be careful with spending, and I can be a total cheapskate and live very frugally when need be.

So this is all new to me. I'd love any advice from all of you wise people that I've seen during my few months of lurking. I thank you all.",finance,1383072199

It was a parent plus for 17k. It's at about 22k now, and if I remember correctly they have fairly high interest rates, maybe 8 to 10%. I checked his account on nslds.gov and sure enough there it is in default. It looks like he consolidated all his and my sisters federal loans way back to 2006 and never got notified about this one.

I shouldn't have left this in their hands, but now they want to transfer the loan to me, once they get all the specifics. We don't know how much is in default (it looks like half on nslds.gov) and we don't know who else is servicing it. If it were my loan I'd know but now I have to go through them for every thing. Once we figure out the specifics I would really like to try and settle with the portion that is in collections. I only have about 5k to spare at the moment, so if the total in collections is 10k, would they maybe go for that? 

Also, I'm seeing on the parent plus site that they are not transferable. I know my parents intend to try and transfer it to me. If it was possible, could I some how incorporate it into my already consolidated federal Stafford loans?

Overall a fucked situation and any help or advice is greatly appreciated.",finance,1383063091
personalfinance,A basic guide to credit and credit reports [US],"In the business I am in, I look at credit reports all day and have had a fascination with credit since I was 18. I wanted to pass on some of the knowledge I have gained through years of experience. I have talked to many people in the finance industry over the years and have collated a basic guide for the beginner. Hope you enjoy it.

**HOW CREDIT WORKS**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Over the past 25 years, credit has become more and more of a household necessity for many consumers than a mere luxury it was seen as at first.  With the advent of the internet, wireless communication, and smart phones credit has been more easily attainable than ever. This has led to a sharp increase in credit utilization and as a consequence bankruptcies have also seen an increase. This does not mean, however that use of credit will always lead to dire financial straits. With careful planning and discipline credit can be utilized wisely and can be of great benefit to the borrower. This guide will give you a basic understanding of what credit is, what a credit score is, how it is figured, and the different types of credit.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It’s surprising that many public education systems lack a mandatory class on finance management as most of them are elective only; as a result many young people are at a total loss when it comes time to begin building credit. The question is often asked “What is credit?” Simply put, credit is the system of borrowing money from an entity with an agreement to pay it back in full plus a little more (interest). A lender makes money by charging interest, which is a percent of the borrowed amount. For example, if you were lent $100 from a friend with 10% interest, you would repay your friend $110 ($100 x .10 = $10). You are happy because you were able to borrow the money for whatever you needed and your friend is happy because he made $10 for doing nothing but hand you a $100 bill. This is the basic concept of credit; it gets much more complicated depending on the loan type as well as what kind of interest is being charged. These concepts will be covered later. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Credit scores are an evaluation of a borrower’s likeliness to repay the loan and not borrow the money and never pay back the lender. Think of it as a report card for being financially responsible. Financial institutions do not make up this number on their own; they rely on the credit bureaus to generate it for them using a mathematical model. The most common credit score model used in the United States is the FICO which is short for “Fair Isaac Company”.  FICO provides an mathematical algorithm to the credit bureaus which is then run against the information that is on file with that particular bureau. You will rarely find a lender that does not use the FICO model although there are a few that do not. For the sake of this guide we will use FICO as a basis. Generic FICO scores range from a low of 300 to a high of 850. The higher the score, the less of a risk of default (not repaying) you are. Banks will more easily lend to someone with a higher score, and are more likely to decline someone with a low score. It takes lots of time and work to build a high score, but only a few mistakes to drop it. The exact formula used by FICO is a secret but the main components are known and how much they affect you has been disclosed.  We will start with the most heavily weighted and work our way down:


*Payment History*: Payment history has a 35% overall influence on your score. This is an evaluation of if you make your payments on time. On time payments bring your score up, late payments bring it down. One late payment can swing your score wildly so it best to double check to make sure you have made your payment every month. Late payments can also be a sign of financial distress and many lenders will not loan to someone who has recent late payments because they are more likely to either be late on their payments or default completely. 

*Credit Utilization*: Credit utilization has a 30% overall influence. This is a ratio of how much credit you owe versus you maximum borrowing power. For example, if you have credit card with a $5,000 limit and you currently owe $2,500, you have 50% utilization on that card. The FICO looks at individual cards as well as an overall average. Lower credit utilization means a higher score.  The recommended utilization is 1-20%.

*Length of Credit History*: Length of history (also known as time on file) has a 15% overall influence. This is the time you have been on the credit file as well as how long each account has been open. This is especially important for mortgage and installment loan lenders to look at. If you have positive history over a long period of time, it shows the lender that you can manage your loans and payments responsibly and can handle a long term loan such as an automobile or home mortgage. Think of it this way: Would you rather loan $1,000 to someone who has a 10 year history of always paying back their loans or someone who has only 1 month on file? It is also important not to close accounts even if you aren’t using them because even though they have a zero balance, they still contribute to your length of credit history.

*Types of credit used*: Types of credit used has a 10% overall influence. There are four types: Installment, revolving, consumer finance, and mortgage. It is known which of these have a heavier influence on your score but the exact weights are not known. They are as follows:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Mortgages:  Loans for buying a home, these carry the heaviest weight

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Installment:  Fixed payment loans, such as automotive loans. These come in second.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Revolving: Credit cards are lines of credit that can be used anywhere such as credit cards. This also includes lines of credit that can only be used in a single place, such as a department store charge account. The payments change each month depending on the balance. Revolving lines of credit rank third.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Consumer Finance: These loans are loans such as title loans, cash advances, and extremely high interest mortgage and auto loans. These loans are typically given to people with very poor credit (also known as sub-prime credit). Having these loans can actually bring down your credit in some circumstances.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Credit Inquiries: Credit Inquires have a 10% overall influence on your score. A credit inquiry is placed on your credit when you apply for a line of credit, whether it is a credit card, mortgage, auto loan, etc.  An inquiry when you are applying for credit is called a hard inquiry. A hard credit inquiry shows that you are actively seeking credit and will usually hit you with a 5-10 point decrease.  If you are shopping for the best interest rate from multiple banks for the same purchase (such as a car) FICO will take all the hard inquiries for that time frame (usually 30 days) and roll them into one so as not to affect your credit nearly as much. A soft inquiry occurs when your credit is viewed for a purpose other than applying for credit, such as viewing your own report to check for errors, or when an employer does a credit check. A soft inquiry does not affect your credit or show on your report to lenders.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These are the basics of the credit system and how it can affect you in a positive or negative way. The good news is that how it affects you is entirely up to you, so choose responsibly when making credit decisions or when borrowing money. Be sure to check out the additional guides for more in depth information on the different types and strategies for credit development.

personalfinance,Is overcoming my current debt feasible or are there options? Should I go back to school?,"I've heard some not so great things about debt consolidating and of course bankruptcy, so I'm not sure what to do - but my financial situation is keeping me up at night.  I searched for banktruptcy but didn't see much similar to my situation - so I hope this is the right place, if not, my apologies!

Total debt:
15k student loans (on deferment thanks to being laid off) and
15k in credit card debt (averaging about $500 minimum/month, but I always try to pay more - this of course has been haulted due to unemployment)

Average income level expected when employed: 55-85k
Current rent: $1600

Savings left as of right now: $1k :(
No investment savings or anything

Aside from food, I have free transportation, and use cheap services like Spotify and Netflix for all my entertainment. 

Background:

Starting since 2007 -
At age 20, I held a medium paying job (40k) that was alright for no degree, along with my then-husband's salary, making our total income around 70k. We had modest debt - credit for wedding rings, car, small misc card, and student loans.  Unfortunately he was a contract worker with no insurance and a chronic illness up until we were married, so his treatments depleted most of our income every month. 

2009, my job was cut due to downsizing. I was in one of the major cities hit  hard when the economy tanked, so I picked up whatever job I could - making about half of what I was making and back to school full time. We also had to use credit cards through these small jobs to float on top of using my student loans. My family was going through a rocky period of finances, divorce, and health issues so I felt obligated to stay in the place without much opportunity.  
 
The majors available at the school didn't really fit my career - web dev, so I dropped out and learned on my own.  After three years of personal career development and family matters better off, I managed to secure a job away in an expensive city - I made 55k but it was fairly equal to my salary in the prior city with cost of living here.  My husband and I separated, and he ran out leaving me with the credit card debt.

I devoted most of paycheck to paying down cards after what was left from rent, figuring the interest on them was more important to address than money in the bank. Not sure if that's the right decision...
Fast forward to September of this year, my company is bought out and there's layoffs.  

So here I am in nearly the exact same position - using credit cards to float, barely any savings left, and now that I'm in a bigger city, the competition seems higher and most people have a college degree - something I worry is giving them a huge advantage over me. Most postings include ""or similar experience"" but the bigger companies (hint: Amazon, Microsoft) seem to have it as a bare minimum.

However, I know it's insanely expensive to go back but the schools here offer superior programs to my old city and degrees more specified to what I want to do.  But also not sure how I'd afford to go back with living expenses.  In the mean time, I'm stlil using the internet to keep up with web dev and trying to brush up skills.

I know you can't get out of student debt, but I feel like I keep getting into the same hole with the credit card debt that by this point has 15-20% interest rates.  I'm basically transfering it around at this point on one year no-interest to try to save some interest, but this is still delaying the inevitable. 

My boyfriend's salary is slim and also contract, our lease -and- his contract is up in December, and I'm genuinely worried we're going to run out of money with nothing left to move into a new place if I can't find work soon. 
 
What do I do? :(
Sorry this is so long!

TLDR: Due to continue string of layoffs and school loans, I have a decent sized amount of debt and no savings. I'm 2 years into school, wondering if I should go back, and wondering if I should consolidate or file bankruptcy to get credit card debt under control.",finance,1383056849
personalfinance,"In the market for new checking/savings account. Looking for opinions, thoughts, and experiences.","I'm thinking about moving from my current bank, and I was looking for some recommendations regarding which banks offer the best checking and savings accounts. I also want to take customer service into account.
  
My current bank has excellent customer service, but everything else about it is rather lackluster. The current interest rate on savings is absolutely terrible (0.05%) and the online banking has rather limited functionality. It is not possible to push money via an EFT, though pulls are possible. Convenience to ATM's is fair for the area, but if I travel anywhere outside the county, they are non-existent. Limited reimbursement of ATM fees requires a significant amount of liquid assets at the bank ($25,000 or $10,000 with direct deposit). As you can see, it's rather lackluster. The most significant features of this bank are that the employees are very friendly and helpful and that they offer a free $500 overdraft line of credit to all customers, which I've never had to use.
  
I've been looking at a local credit union that is better in some ways, but possibly not others. They offer a reward savings account with no strings attached other than requiring direct deposit into a linked checking account to avoid maintenance fees. The interest rate on this account is very good (4% up to $3,000). The offer reimbursement of other bank's ATM fees, but charge their own modest fees for using another bank's ATM. They do not have anywhere near as many ATM's as my current bank does. They offer an overdraft line of credit, but it requires a small annual fee. They also offer good rates on CD's (1.70% for a five year term or 1.80% for a five year term in an IRA). They also offer special savings accounts for goals such a Christmas or vacations. Lastly, they offer mobile deposit of checks with a data-enabled smartphone.
  
I've also been considering moving to an online bank. I already have an account with Fidelity, so I've been considering Fidelity Cash Management for checking. For savings, I've been considering Sallie Mae. I have a UPromise account and my student loans are serviced via Sallie Mae.

personalfinance,Is taking out shorter-term CDs pointless?,"I'm no mathematician, but I've been doing some calculations lately trying to sort out the best strategies for CDs. I think I've discovered that it may be relatively pointless to take out shorter-term CDs because their rates are surpassed by longer-term CDs, *even when factoring in the penalty for early withdrawal*. I'm not sure if this applies across the board, but I used Ally's CDs as a test case. Please correct me if I'm mistaken in my calculations. Here are the basic points:

* You can get a 12-month CD at 0.98%. The 5-year CD rate is at 1.59%.

* Early withdrawal penalties for all CDs are 60 days of interest. This changes in December, with higher penalties for longer-dated CDs, but for now they're all the same.

* By my calculations, if you put $1,000 in a 5-year CD and withdraw it at the one-year mark, you'd have $1,013.63. That's obviously a 1.36% return, which is much better than the one-year CD rate.

* You'd earn the annual interest rate on the one-year CD in just nine months in the five-year CD, even after factoring in the penalty.

Are these calculations correct? And if they are, what's the logic in taking out a shorter-term CD?",finance,1383031947

Bitcoin,A warning for users of Coinbase (or any other service that uses ACH transfers). Please save yourself a headache and some money.,"**EDIT:** Olaf from Coinbase just sent me $25 in Bitcoins, despite the fact that Coinbase had nothing to do with the fees I incurred.  Thanks, Coinbase!  You guys have got my business for the bright, bright future of Bitcoin!  :D

I got slapped with a tremendous amount of irony by my bank this morning.

&gt; Federal Regulation D limits the number of transfers from your savings account to no more than six per month. Your savings account (-000) is now in violation of Regulation D, and as a result, your account has been assessed the Regulation D violation fee of $25.00. Overdraft protection from your savings account and your ability to perform audio and online transfers have been suspended for the rest of this month. These services will be reinstated on the first business day of next month.

The **TL;DR** is that they're charging me $25 because I made more than six ACH transfers between my savings account and Coinbase this month.  I had absolutely no idea that this was something I could be charged for, and everyone I asked about it today was equally uninformed.  I thought it was hilarious how I was using the banking system to buy Bitcoin (you know, that currency where you can make an unlimited number of transfers across the world instantly, for next to nothing), and I got charged for making more than *six* transfers within *a whole month*.

Anyway, I just thought I should post here and hopefully prevent anyone else from getting burned.  I realize that $25 isn't that much for a lot of you, but for a college kid like me, that's a lot of food.

Note that this is **not** a problem with Coinbase.  Keep using Coinbase, they're great, but do note that if you have it hooked up to your savings account it could cost you.  Keep the ACH transfers per month capped at six.",cryptocurrency,1383165257

Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.

Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases. Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective. Asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Charles L. Evans; Jerome H. Powell; Eric S. Rosengren; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen. 

Voting against the action was Esther L. George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations.

I have $15k in income, paid $1500 towards federal taxes so far this year, can I change my self to exempt or put a high number of dependents for the rest of the year or would I risk owing? 

I have a 6 month old as well so I am expecting some hefty tax credits but they are all going to go towards my loans automatically as well. 

Would it be risky to cut off federal taxes the rest of the year? I was hoping to have a little extra cash for the holidays, that would give me an extra $200/month for 2 months. I hope this makes sense, please let me know if more details are needed. Thanks! 

More Info: Last year at the same job I got over $2k back in returns with similar income and taxes taken out, the same number of dependants. This year I will also have child tax credits, so I assume my federal tax liability will be so low that I am guarnteed a refund at this point. 

The way I see it why should I keep giving the federal govt tax money that I won't get back either way since they're going to be applied towards my loans? I am paying on my loans monthly already as well to get them out of default.",finance,1383161346

investing,Thoughts on where I think the market is going,"I decided that I would write a little write-up on how I think the market is going to play out in the foreseeable future (barring a Black Swan event). I like to know what you all think:

With Janet Yellen coming in as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, she brings with her a more pro-stimulus attitude (which I believe has already been instilled in the Fed). 

Continuing stimulus will accelerate economic progress in the short-term as rates will be lower so consumers will continue to spend and businesses will continue to invest as demand is high and money is cheap. We are already seeing this as the majority of firms beat their Q3 estimates.

We will continue to see this growth until inflation is in the 2% range for an extended period. Now, this is important as the Fed cannot allow inflation to get too high without limiting stimulus as the US could potentially enter a period of hyper-inflation. That being said, I trust the Fed's decision-making abilities and think they will be able to keep this situation under control.

Once the fed begins tapering, rates will begin to rise. This will have a negative effect of equities. It may not happen immediately (at least from an earnings standpoint - negative speculation may come into play though). This is because consumers will be able to afford less and it will also be more expensive for firms to invest in projects.

Market plays based on this situation: 

**Direxion Daily 20+ Yr Trsy Bear 3X Shrs (TMV)**

This security is a 3x leveraged 20 year US bond short. As rates increase, so does this security. In the long-term, I think this is a solid play as it is unthinkable for rates to not increase over time. You could even buy this on margin if you want to further increase your leverage. Just remember that leverage magnifies returns both ways.

**SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)**

This one's a little more risky. Typically, as inflation rises, so does gold. However, gold has not been trading on fundamentals lately. And when you think of it, gold has little true value - it's simply a store of value. So traditionally, this would be a good play, but this does rely on how gold has traded in the past, and not how it may be currently received.",finance,1383115789

My parents have a financial adviser who is advising them to pay off their mortgage...  I disagree, but I am no financial adviser, I'm just a mere mortal.  Please follow me through my logic....

The present loan amount is $252,881, interest rate is 5.25%, so monthly payment is ~$1,487.32.  Maturity = 11/2039

*Note, I used an Excel spreadsheet for all calculations... link to Google Doc file is below*

So if they have the cash to pay it all off.... as a rule of thumb, wouldn't they be better off to invest that cash in *any* investment that has an average expected return of higher than 5.25%?  I mean, even if they had an investment w/ an average expected return of 5.5%, based on my calculations, they'd end up approx. $26,000 richer in November 2039 than they would be otherwise.  At (God forbid) 8%, they'd be $463,000 richer.

Now, it should be noted that both parents are retired and collecting pensions, so the tax write-off for mortgage payment is not really benefiting them anymore.  I don't know if that effects things much or not... I'm thinking there must be some other factor/variable that I do not have the know-how to consider (while a financial adviser would!).

personalfinance,Need help setting up a payment plan to get my student loans paid off as soon as possible.,"My income is approximately $800/mo (sometimes I get extra hours, sometimes I don't, but I can reliably make a minimum of $800/mo). Now that I have moved back in with my parents, the only money I have outgoing right now is my student loans and incidentals.

I currently have my loans through three lenders, Sallie Mae, Fed Loan Servicing, and Great Lakes.

Sallie Mae: one loan

* $9,853.38 	at 3.75%


Fed Loan: two loans totaling (with currently accrued interest) $6,623.00

* $4,728.69 at 4.5% 
* $1,864.55 at 6.8% 

Great Lakes: 6 loans totaling (with currently accrued interest) $6,421.29

* $787.83 at 5.6%
* $1,352.48 at	6.0%
* $2,009.96 at	6.8%
* $2,265.33 at	6.8%


Most recently I have been rounding up on my loan payments. Sallie Mae charges me about $79/mo. Great Lakes charges $226.29/mo. However with my previous job this payment was too high so I applied and got an income-based repayment plan for a year, which deferred my loans so that I was only paying interest (apprx $100/mo, all I could afford at the time and even that was challenging some months). I have moved back home and also gotten a new job so I will be able to afford that minimum payment. Lastly fed loans charges me $82.21/mo. More recently I have been paying $100 to both sallie mae &amp; fed loans, and kept great lakes in deferment temporarily until I moved home (and therefor no longer have to pay rent/etc).


Other than deferring Great Lakes, I've been doing my best to try to stay ahead of the ball on the other loans, and would absolutely love if you guys could help me pay off my loans ASAP. I figure if I *must* live at home, I might as well use the situation to get out of debt as much as I can.

personalfinance,Questions on going to business school despite already repaying loans under IBR (Income-Based Repayment),"Hi,

I made the mistake of getting a master's degree that isn't really useful in my career. And I made an even bigger mistake of financing most of it with loans.  I now have about $100,000 in (federal) student loan debt. The only positive (if there can be one) is that I have *enough* debt relative to my income to have qualified for Income-Based Repayment, which caps my student loan payments at 15% of my disposable income, with loan forgiveness after 25 years, and I can't be kicked out of the program.

This situation has created a counter-intuitive incentive: given that no matter how much debt I amass, my payments will never be above 15% of my income and whatever I haven't paid off in 25 years will be forgiven, I can really see no downside to borrowing more (except that I will have to pay taxes on any amount forgiven.)

So, now I'm seriously considering getting my MBA so that I can try to land a higher-paying job. (Based on my resume, I think I have a very good chance of getting into a Top 10 business school.)

My questions:

1. If I'm already in IBR, can I go back to school and take out more federal loans to finance my MBA?

2. If yes, can I stay in IBR after I graduate (meaning my payments won't be any higher than now and loan forgiveness will still happen after 25 years)?

3. Would the amount I borrowed previously be forgiven at an earlier date than the amount I borrowed for business school, or would these separate loans need to be consolidated into one loan and would I have to re-enroll in IBR, meaning the 25 year clock would start over?

3. Is this a terrible idea?

Thank you!",finance,1383261030
personalfinance,Ally Bank changing CD penalties,"I just received notice that Ally Bank is changing their penalties on their Certificates of Deposit(CD) for CDs purchased after 12/7/2013.  

They currently have very favorable terms when in came to their early withdrawal penalties, only 60 days interest lost for all of their CDs.  This made it acceptable to plan on paying the penalty when interest rates rise.  I think that many people probably signed up with them for this reason.  If you still want the good terms, buy your CD's before December 7th.

The new terms are

* 3-Year CD – loss of 90 days interest
* 4-Year CD – loss of 120 days interest
* 5-Year CD – loss of 150 days interest

Currently they are paying 1.6% on their 5 year CD.  If you had a $10K CD, you would make $160 a year.  The penalty for 60 days would cost you $26.30 to withdraw early, reducing your yield to 1.33% for that year, if you canceled at the end of the year.  1.33% is still pretty good for a 5 year CD right now, so not too painful.

With the change the penalty would be 150 days interest, which would be $65.75, reducing the yield to 0.9% for the year.  0.9% is a little less than the 0.98% that Ally is paying for their 1 year CD right now, so maybe it isn't so bad.

I would like to hear your opinion on this change.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin: A BIT of a problem,"My name  is Joe Average. I am the 80% of people who found out about bitcoin. I found out last week that an ATM for a new type of special currency is being released in my hometown, Vancouver BC Canada. Like many others, I'm still clueless about bitcoin, despite spending my halloween weekend researching it, trying to find out whether it's a trick or a treat (sorry I had to).

In this post, I'll list what I know about it, then list the thoughts, problems, and barriers that I, and probably 80% of the population, feel about bitcoin. These things are probably most relevant to those of you bitcoin enthusiast that have a vested interest in the success of the currency/commodity, because the general public represents a population that will influence the capacity that bitcoin can have in society.

Bitcoin has many advantages. Here are the advantages that I came across in forums and news articles:
-free from government influence
-zero bank fees
-limited resource, naturally appreciating value
-relatively anonymous
-intangible, convenient to carry
-irreversible transactions

And here are some problems, starting from the most relevant one which probably everyone thinks of right off the bat:

1-Bitcoin or cash? Why should I bother using bitcoin?
Dozens of local merchants in my area are accepting bitcoin. Wow that's great! Now I can spend 2 hours acquiring bitcoin from a private, ungoverned, unregulated exchange (more on that later) and buy a medium belgium hot chocolate from waves (great drink by the way). Paying with card or cash? No ma'am, I'm paying with BITCOIN *big teethy smile, eyebrows up and down several times* Ok, bust out the ipad or whatever, spend 15 minutes waiting for the cashier to grab her ipad, unlock the screen, get a network connection at coffee shop network speeds, tap the bitpay app or w/e, load the app, scan my qr code, wait for the transaction to verify, blah blah blah, meanwhile, big ass line up forms behind me and I'm the big asshole who decided to pay with bitcoin instead of cash. 

Okay, in all fairness, I'm probably being ignorant to some bitcoin app out there that cuts this whole process down from 15 minutes to just 5 minutes, the time it takes to verify transactions. But if I have to use an app, that probably costs money. So now my $4.50 dark belgium hot chocolate now costs $4.65 + 5 minutes of my life.

Hmm maybe I'll just 1) whip out some cash 2) whip out my visa card and pay it off right away so I don't incur interest fees 3) pay for it with debit, my bank doesn't charge me debit fees for using my card

2-Sending bitcoin
So let's say what appeals to me is that bitcoin replaces Western Union, bank transfers, etcetc. I want to send $4,000 to Alice and Bob of ABC Co., payment for their work as hypothetical people in every accounting example I've ever read. For that amount, I'd have to pay &gt;$100 in service fees from a money company. Or I could save myself &gt;$100 by using bitcoin instead. 

Okay great! Where do I start? Download a wallet. Done, nice. Next step, synchonize 208 weeks of ledger. Great.. oh, hang on. It's been 4 hours and I've downloaded 3 weeks. What the fuck?! How long does this take.. it doesn't even tell me how long it will take or how big the file is! *computer left running overnight* Awesome, just 2 more nights to go then I'll be fully syncrhonized. *2 days later* hard-drive is maxed out? I needed a new one anyways. *4 days and a 500GB SSD later* Now I have my wallet ready to use. Time to purchase some bitcoin!
 
So I purchase bitcoin, send it to Bob and Alice, and since they own ABC Co., a massive enterprise, they employ an IT guy, and he is the only guy in the company who will ever understand how to securely use bitcoin. He's behind 2 juniper firewalls (for redundancy), we VPN tunnel'd the payment code over with the pass, that way I know it went to him and nothing's been compromised. Because once the funds are sent out, it's gone, there is no insurance. Which brings me to my next point:

Bottom line: requires a lot of time to SAFELY and SECURELY send bitcoin, FEE-FREE. But that's okay because I have nothing better to do. If I had kids, errands, work, non-IT hobbies to do, $40-$100 might be worth the time it takes me to research the process of sending bitcoin out properly.

3-Bitcoin wallet services
There's a whole list of companies emerging to take podium position in the race of the bitcoin wallet services world. Besides setting up a bitcoin exchange (which anyone can do in their basement), bitcoin wallets are the next biggest thing in bitcoin. 

In the digital world, about 3 companies take podium position in a certain thing. Like Android/Apple/Blackberry for cell phones, Windows/Apple/Linux, Chrome/Firefox/IE, etc etc. Right now, for digital bitcoin wallets, everyone's competing to be one of those 3 major companies that everyone will use. Companies like coinbase.

These companies cost money. Coinbase has a pretty impressive talent pool. Let me introduce them to you:

Barry Kwok- Holy shit, this guy has a Masters in Engineering?! No seriously, this guy is a master of engineering. He built teams of 5 to 50 people at Google (fucking google man!). This guy is the first guy on the list, how much does he make? I'd have to guess $120k

Craig Hammell- This guy built OK Cupid. I know a guy who uses that shit to get laid, it really works, so OK cupid is probably a well-established company. Because of Craig's success with OK cupid, and the fact he looks that young, I'd say he probably doesn't make that much, just a modest $90k

Olaf Carlson-Wee- Olaf does rock-climbing, enough said. $95k

Fred Erhsam- Traded at Goldman Sachs. $150k

Charlie Lee- Invented Litecoin, worked on google chrome, google play, and youtube. $120k

Brian Armstrong- This guy has experience with Fraud Prevention. Don't know why they hired him, because as everyone's been saying, you can't fraud bitcoin. Since they don't need him, he's probably an intern.

Let's run some quick numbers:
Total cost of salaries: $575,000/year
Other expenses including dividends to investors: $3m/year 

So this company has $3.6m a year to allocate to their consumer base of 329k of wallets, and 12k merchants.
That is roughly $10.56/year per wallet or merchant. (realistically, the portion of cost between wallets and merchants would be not be split equally, and of course all these figures are pulled straight from thin air, however, this is reddit, not forbes).

That is a very low amount compared to using VISA which costs merchants $0.25/transaction+monthly service fee. As we can see, bitcoin is a great! Save some money. 

But here's the problem: people fraud banks all the time. That costs money. Somebody puts $10k in their digital wallet, loses it, they're going to be pissed off. They'll start demanding it back from coinbase. The day coinbase pays 1 guy $10k compensation, the day they'll have to pay everyone that loses money like that, and that $3-mil figure I gave above will be much higher, and the fees everyone has to pay will go up. If coinbase doesn't compensate, then people will be reluctant to use bitcoin for anything other than small transactions.

This means bitcoin will not have the capacity to be adopted by regular people, like me. Either I lose big chunks of money at a time, when my digital wallet gets hacked, goes missing, frauded, etc, or I lose it in smaller chunks and frequency which is similar to a bank.

So digital wallet services are just like banks. Wait, I thought the bitcoin guys were saying banks were a bad thing?

4-Inflation vs Deflation
I see a lot of bitcoin enthusiasts talking economics, which really angers me. You should read some of the things they say ""inflation is bad, bitcoin actually deflates, so its good"" ""the government can't fuck with bitcoin, so its good"" ""bitcoin good, so it's good"". If you're a bitcoin enthusiast and discussed bitcoin economics, you probably need to trade your internet credit for some college credits. Because seriously, that is some retarded shit. For example:

Inflation is bad, bitcoin deflates = good / The gov't can't fuck with bitcoin so it's good
No. Inflation is good, yes I said it and you can quote me on that.
Inflation allows job creation through lowering interest rates which encourages people and businesses to buy things. When stuff is bought, things happen. And jobs are required to make things happen. So when the government sees that ""hey, our economy ain't doin too well, how bout we print some of ye ol' fashioned paper dolla bills"" that's a strategic move to lower the unemployment rate and increase GDP.

The US is in shambles right now for reasons beyond inflation. The #1 reason why is labour costs too much in the US. Shaquila and Billy Bob don't want to work in a factory for $12/hr, they're too in love with hollywood and liberty, thinking they're entitled to a high paying comfortable job. Half of America thinks like that. But guess what, the Chinese don't, they're happy to pick up where Shaquila and Billy Bob left off. And because of the economies of scale thanks to their large population, that ignited over night, and now the US is left with a population that doesn't want to work. There's also a bunch of other reasons like going to war, etc, but that's debatable because there's a cost/benefit of going to war (own all the oil rigs out east to pay for things because you lazy fucks can't be bothered to make money with elbow grease).

The point is, mind fuck #1, inflation is a solution to a problem that's not related to money. 

On the other side of the coin, deflation IS a bad thing.

Deflation, which bitcoin is designed to do, means that there will be fewer amounts of money to spend over time. That increases the price of things. That's good for people who are holding on to bitcoin. This encourages people to spend with bitcoin less, and save more. Mind fuck #2, saving money is bad, because it reduces GDP. It reduces the need for companies like coinbase to develop and create a product for spending bitcoin in the first place. So the more bitcoin deflates, the more its value goes up, the less people spend bitcoin on shit, the less merchants see a point in accepting bitcoin, the less merchants use bitcoin, the less people buy bitcoin, then bitcoins value goes down. 

5-Limited supply of bitcoins 
This title should read Diminishing supply of bitcoins, but it would then be misinterpreted without an explanation. 
Bitcoins don't diminish, they are simply unaccounted for. Meaning, if you have bitcoins, and forget the password, it is gone forever. And in case you didn't know, people are human, making them prone to mistakes. Forgetting, etc. So, over time, enough people will lose bits and pieces of bitcoin here and there. That's going to add up over the long run. Units of measure will start going to miliBits, Microbits, ultra micro bits, ultra ultra micro bits. etc. Kind of like fiat currency, it can inflate to be infinitely large, and with bitcoin, infinitely smaller. 

6-Exchanges and trading
When Silk Road went down, bitcoin went up. First, naturally and by way of economics, fewer bitcoin = increased value. The Silk Road guy had $26-million USD worth of bitcoin, more than enough bitcoin to raise the market price. Followed by that, we have news, and hype, which drove higher. Then the fact prices are going up, makes a nice news article, which drives it up even more. When prices went up because of the news, incentive went up. Now the prices are so high, some people have made fortunes off of it. And that makes the news too, which drives it up again even higher. 

That's a great incentive if you're a bitcoin investor. Hey, the winklevoss twins have 1% of bitcoin, all you miners go use your mining pools to break into the winklevoss account and delete the fuck out of their bitcoin wallets and backup, so you can raise the market value.

Just kidding. That's a lot of work. You know what's easier? This:

1) Start your own bitcoin exchange, no fees 100% free. 
2) People will start trading on it. 
3) ????
4) Profit!

Actually step 3 isn't a mystery, you set the fucking price level to whatever you want it to be. And because it's 100% unregulated, unsanctioned, not tied to any commodities, no authority, no referee, no consortium, you can do whatever the fuck you want on it. 

Without authority, believing that the prices on the bitcoin exchange is set naturally by way of price and demand is like believing in religion. You just have to believe.

Of course with public exchanges, there is some level of corruption involved, but that's why people get arrested and shit. Using bitcoin exchanges doesn't have that level of protection, and it never will. You think the governments own law enforcement is going to go after guys corrupting a private stock exchange, which trades a currency that negatively impacts their own fiat currency? Unless the government is somehow benefiting from bitcoin, which it won't by design, the police will simply have a good laugh at that.


In conclusion, there's so many flaws that I can see with bitcoin. But bitcoin enthusiasts will say otherwise. If I jumped on the bitcoin train 3 years ago, I'd probably do the same thing as you: make up some backwards economic reasoning it'll succeed, some backward political reason, etc. 

So Dear Bitcoin, you just don't make enough sense to us, the general population, for us to adopt you. A great substitute for currency in the underground world, but you just don't fit with us here on the mainstream. And if you did fit, you'll end up being regulated just like currency, so what's the point? You're the same shit as my cash or cards. Fuck off.

Bitcoin,PSA for all the newbies: There are viruses that can steal bitcoins and an up-to-date virus scanner will NOT always stop them! How to protect yourself...,"Luckily there are ways to keep your bitcoins safe. 

By far the *easiest AND most secure* will be the ""Trezor"". Unfortunately they are not out yet and have been delayed till at least January. These devices makes stealing your bitcoins pretty much impossible and are usable by the general population. You don't have to be a security professional and your coins are even safe if you lose the device somewhere!!


Bitcoins are at risk anytime a computer that contains your private keys (that's what allows someone to spend the bitcoins) is exposed to the internet. The only safe bitcoins are ones that haven't been exposed online. That's why people use the term ""paper wallet"" or ""offline wallet"". It's a method of storing coins in such a way so that the private keys only exist on a piece of paper or offline. There is no copy that can be leaked onto the internet and stolen. It is how all the major bitcoin businesses keep their bitcoins safe. They have a ""hot wallet"" with limited coins that are exposed to the internet while the majority is kept offline in a ""cold wallet"". 

If you are nervous about storing your coins yourself you can always have a major exchange store them for you. This carries two major risks:


1. The exchange could one day disappear with your coins - that is why if you choose this path to choose one that has a good reputation and a public face behind it. Coinbase is an example of a company that will likely never run with your coins and has a strong reputation.

2. Your log-in is compromised - viruses and spyware can steal your password. You MUST use 2-factor authentication. With 2FA your log-in can't be compromised with a virus. To use 2FA you get an app on your phone such as Authy or Google Authenticator. On the site you are using you then set up 2FA and there will be a qr code that you scan with your 2FA app. Once you scan it ALSO make sure to print the qr code in case you lose your phone and hide the paper somewhere. You will not be able to log in without it. That's the whole point. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use 2FA when you can when dealing with bitcoins. IT WILL SAVE YOU. 


2FA on coinbase is a pretty secure setup without having to learn too much. You can then send your ""spending bitcoins"" to the wallet app of your choice on your computer or phone. If they get stolen it's not a big deal as the majority of your bitcoins are somewhere else such as on coinbase.


To do a ""offline"" or ""paper wallet"":


1. Go to https://www.bitaddress.org/ and save the web page onto your computer or usb stick. 


2. Download a linux Live CD such as Fedora at: http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora and burn it to disk.

3. Reboot your computer with the live cd. And once it's loaded insert the usb stick. Play a game for a bit on the OS. This help generate better random numbers later. Open the html file with the web browser.

4. Go to bulk wallet and write down how ever many keys you want and write the corresponding address too. Copy CAREFULLY. You could print them if your printer is connected but printers sometimes keep a memory of printed pages so keep that in mind

5. Go to the ""wallet details"" tab AFTER and try inputting the keys you wrote down. This will catch if you copied a key wrong. If it worked and the address matches you are set! 

6. You can now reboot the computer. There will be no trace of those keys anywhere. All bitcoins sent to them are very safe. When you want to spend them you can import them when needed. 



Lastly another option is using a spare computer that you will never connect to the internet again. You then use Armory or Electrum and use them to do ""offline transactions"". Both packages offer instructions on their websites on how to do that. Just remember to write down the ""restore code"" when they tell it to you and store it safely. This code ensures that if your computer dies you can restore the private keys. 



Good luck and be safe. And remember when you can, ALWAYS use 2-factor authentication!!!!
