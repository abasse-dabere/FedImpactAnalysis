I'm going to be proposing to my girlfriend in less than three months.  I'm 22 and she's 20.  She'll be graduating from college in 14 months, and I expect we'll get married around that time - then again, that's winter, so we'll see what happens with the date.

The problem is that she has no credit history - none.  Never got a credit card, no student loans (her parents paid the tuition that scholarships didn't cover), nothing.  She doesn't want to get a credit card.  I think most of us will agree that this is a silly philosophy, as long as you have the willpower to not overspend, but it's the way she was raised.  It's really not worth arguing about at this point.  When we're married and I can more effectively make the point that this affects me as well as her, it will be a different story.

My credit score is in the high 700s, which I'd say is pretty okay for being a recent college grad.  I'm not worried about my personal odds for things like loans and interest rates, but once we're married, her credit score could be a problem for both of us!

Is there any way to game the system a little bit and ""powerbuild"" credit for her once we're married?  I expect that she'll get a credit card eventually, but that only helps so much.  I don't expect to ever take on massive debt, but if I do happen to get something like a mortgage in the future, I want to guarantee the best financial prospects possible.

personalfinance,For those who are interested IRS adjustments for 2014 are out,"On Thursday, the IRS issued the annual inflation adjustments for 2014 for more than 40 tax provisions and the tax tables for 2014 (Rev. Proc. 2013-35).

Among the inflation-adjusted amounts that have increased are the personal exemption, which increased from $3,900 in 2013 to $3,950 for 2014, and the standard deduction, which for married filing jointly status increased from $12,200 in 2013 to $12,400 in 2014. In addition, the adoption credit under Sec. 23 is inflation-adjusted from $12,970 in 2013 to $13,190 in 2014.

The revenue procedure also contains the inflation-adjusted unified credit against the estate tax, which is $5.34 million for 2014. The annual gift tax exclusion remains at $14,000.

The AMT exemption amount for 2014 is $82,100 for married taxpayers filing joint returns and $52,800 for single taxpayers. The Sec. 911 foreign earned income exclusion increases to $99,200 for 2014 from $97,600 for 2013.

Bitcoin,Community mixer / open source anonymity creation.,"I think that the future of bitcoin will become two divisions just as modern currency is.  One side will be very regulated just as credit cards, bank accounts, and all other forms of regulated currency have been.  

The other side will be the cash equivalent.  This represents the inpossible to regulate and impossible to track.  If things are done correctly, this distinction should be very clear.

To accomplish this, coders should open source the mixers and their methods for creating anonymity.  While this may be seen as adding to what the Feds tracking capabilities are, the combined efforts of the community will create an impossible to defeat encryption scheme eventually.  If we are not careful, honeypots will develop that are disguised as mixers.  To avoid this, open source should be employed to help develop impenetrable code.

Very well written article.  Thank you.

As a graph theorist, I think the DHS should really like bitcoin to become widely used.  Because all transactions can be seen on the public blockchain, investigators can learn a great deal about the financial inner-workings of illegal (and legal) operations.

There is an old investigative trick that is done with cash: record the serial numbers on a bunch of bills, then go spend those bills at local drug dealer.  Instruct financial institutions to report when those marked bill turn up.  By looking at where the bills ended up -- and how long they took to end up there -- an investigator can infer some things about the inner financial workings of the drug dealer's operation.  This trick has it's limits, though, because we only know two things: where the money started, and where it ended up.  We know nothing about what happened in between.

However, with bitcoin it's different.  If spend bitcoins with a local drug dealer who's running a bitcoin-based business, I can follow the flow of money the entire way. I can see how the money is moving.  I may not know who it's going to, but I can get an idea of how the internal financial operation works.... is the money consolidating at one address or being broken up and spent quickly?  If I spend coins with several local dealers, does all the money end up in the same address?  etc etc.  A lot can be learned by following the money trail, and bitcoin tells me more about the money trail than cash does.

Granted, tech-savvy users will try to mix coins... but that just gives the investigators another line of attack: infiltrating the mixing services, setting up honey-pots, pulling an (N-1) attack on a coinjoin mixer, etc etc etc.

tl;dr:  The DHS should get behind bitcoin... it will help them catch criminals.""",cryptocurrency,1383297847
Bitcoin,The most underrated aspect of Bitcoin?,"Is it just me or is the most underrated aspect of Bitcoin that it's open source?  All the talk about Bitcoin revolves around either it's price fluctuations or it's ability to disrupt the banking industry, and their ridiculous fees.

I know that the fact it's open source is touted, but I really feel like it's glossed over especially to people who consider Bitcoin a get rich quick scheme...

As an open source software developer there is nothing more important to me than shared knowledge, and an open source future.  I believe we should have open source education, but with the entrenched corporate interests that dominate school textbooks I don't see it possible to open source education in the near future.  

At least until we first make open source currency the currency of the future.  If our currency is open source I can't picture anyone fighting an open source education, and any related software like Linux...

The only thing I can think of worse than closed doors at the Fed making monetary decisions is a closed door approach to educating our children, and deciding the contents of their textbooks without a public forum.  There is no way states like Texas that want to make intelligent design, and other religious views mandatory in their children's textbooks would fly if there was an open and honest debate about the education of our children. 

So is Bitcoin's open source nature the most underrated aspect of Bitcoin?

Or do you think there is something more underrated than it being open source?",cryptocurrency,1383295550

personalfinance,One payment for several loans?,"I use Great Lakes to pay my student loans and it's fairly straightforward. They have a curious way of splitting loans, though. They hold five of my loans in two separate accounts, and all five carry different interest rates and balances. When I make payments, they are applied to the account and not the direct loan. So I have a payment of $80/mo for one account (two loans) and another for $165/mo (three loans). Payments go toward the interest rate of the account, then to the loan with the highest interest rate.
  
My problem is that this method prohibits me from using things like loan calculators or simple budget trackers. For example, I was trying to use the budget spreadsheet posted on this sub about a week ago (typing this on the subway so I can't look up the user or thread at the moment, but it was a popular thread). But like most other tools I've found, there is no functionality for loan payments with one minimum payment across several interest rates.

personalfinance,Do I need to increase my w-4 allowances?,"So in 2012 my allowances was 5. My actual salary income (gross) was ~ $85k. I sold stock options in the gross amount of $60k.  My total gross income was $145,805 which is far from my normal. With that said, if I removed the $6k I made with my freelance business, my Federal refund was ~$3,100. If I added the $6k I made on the side, my refund dropped to $900.

It sounds like my allowances are ""too little"". Do I need to increase to 7 if I want to get more from my paycheck, and less of a refund.  I do realize that by doing this, and entering what appears to be ~ 10k from side income, it may put me in a federal refund deficit (because of higher side income taxes)...but maybe not given the year is almost over.

My total gross income in 2013, thus far, is $107k.  $73k + $30k (stock options) and then some.  I am partaking a new job in 2 weeks, which will be paying me a salary of over 105k (as opposed to the $90k now) with a signing bonus of $15k. 

So regarding my gross 2013 income, I assume it will be  ~140k again.

investing,Story about how the Optionshosue outage on Friday afternoon almsot cost me a HUGE amount of money. And questions about brokerage liability.,"So on Thursday I made a fairly large options play on FB.  I sold a bunch of $50.5 puts and bought an equal number of $50 puts.  The trade was purely speculative, and structured in such a way that my max loss was &lt;1% of my account value, and max gain was a little over 1.5%.

The optionshouse site was down Friday morning.  FB was up where I had hoped it would be (this was the direction I was betting with my initial play), and I closed the short-put leg of this trade (over the phone with OH) and locked in my profit.  But I held on to the long-put leg of the trade, which had lost 90% of it's value, in pure speculative hope that I could make money going both ways.

The site came back up again in the afternoon, and I was even smart enough to put in an order to automatically close that position a few minutes before the market closed if it was still open.  I intended to close the position myself before then, but it was my ""fail-safe"" plan in case the site went back down.

I got fairly lucky and FB gave back all their gains in the afternoon.  So now I wanted to close the long-put leg when there was about 10 minutes left before the market closed.  So I cancelled my ""fail-safe"" order, and tried to place a new order to sell those contracts at the current bid price.  But...of course the site went down right at that moment.

I tried frantically to get the trade desk on the phone and close that position, but of course 10,000 other people were also calling at the same time and I couldn't get through.

So the market closed and I wasn't able to exit the $50 put position, which was now in-the-money.

I never intended, and had no desire whatsoever, to hold a short FB position over the weekend, but some quick math told me that I was about to be short an ungodly amount of FB stock.  It was nearly 4x my entire account balance, which is not an insubstantial amount.

After 45 more minutes of frantic calling and waiting on hold I got through to a representative that suggested ""we"" try to buy those shares in after-hours trading.  I put ""we"" in quotes because I was trying to be very adamant that this is their problem and not mine.  I did everything I could to get the rep to admit fault on their part and assume responsibility for assuring me that my account balance would be restored to where it should have been given the closing price of FB.

Anyway, I remained fairly passive and told them to do whatever they thought was best to resolve the issue.  So they connected me to the trade desk and I sat on the phone for the next hour while we tried to buy a huge number of shares in after-hours.

He kept asking ""do you want to go up a little on the offer?"" and things like that, while I kept replying ""I want to not be short FB stock, so do what you gotta do.""

We ended up buying all the shares we needed.  Again this was 4x my entire account balance, so they had to ""loan"" me a ton of money in excess of my margin amount to buy it.  It worked out very well for me because we got all the shares bought at about $.10 lower than the market close, so I actually made a little more money than I would have.

But it made me realize how vulnerable I may be to future outages on their part.  If FB had gone up in after hours instead of down I would have thrown a hissy-fit and called my attorney.  So it was super lucky it went the other way for me.

So now that you've got the story, can anyone answer me some questions?

Are they liable for my losses in an event like this?  

Did they handle it properly this time?  It seems like they set a precedent with me now so that if it does happen again and the market goes against me they can point to this and say it's always been their policy.

Do they have any type of insurance to cover this type of event?

etc...Any info is useful to me.  This was a legit scary event and now I'm wondering if I need to take more precautions or even change brokers.

EDIT:  Since almost every comment so far has been berating about ""why would OP think they have any liability"" and such, I thought I would flesh out why it seems reasonable to think this.

First off I know brokerages have to register with the SEC and other self-governing bodies.  And I know they have to maintain some forms of insurance.  And investor losses are insured in certain circumstances such as the brokers bankruptcy.  So it's not absurd to think that they have certain requirements they must meet in order to keep their license.

Brokerages are financial institutions very akin to banks, and banks have all kinds of detailed obligations they must meet, and catastrophes against which clients are insured.  The assumption seems obvious that brokerages also would have some basic requirements that must be met.

And this was not a ""market related loss"".  It's not as though I'm angry because I wasn't able to sell some stock at exactly the right moment and had to wait 5 minutes.  Their entire system was inoperable for an extended period of time and their phone service was unreachable.  Because of their failure I was exposed to enormous risk far outside of that of my initial position.  My risk went from &lt;.25% of my account balance to 400% of my balance purely because the service they offer was unreachable.  So I think all people that buy or sell stocks through a brokerage operate under the very reasonable assumption that their broker will continue to offer the services we pay them for.

Further, it seems to me that OH has already implicitly admitted some fault and assumed a portion of liability because of the manner in which they chose to resolve my issue.  We had to buy 4x my account value in stock in after-hours to negate my short position.  And under Reg T margin requirement, OH isn't even allowed to extend that much credit to me.  So they broke Fed regulations in order to purchase that much stock for my account.  That implies that they're either just the nicest people in the world, or they acknowledge that they may be held responsible for the potential losses so they decided to help close the position while it was still positive.

But hey, I'm the one asking the question so I don't know this area well.  So even if they don't have liability then just show me something that explains why and don't be a dick about it.",finance,1383428605

However, beginning in January we'll only need to invest $916.66/mo. to max out our Roth IRAs.

One was an Epson, the other was an HP. They were both printer/scanner combos. The biggest problem with both of them is they appeared to be nothing more than scams to sell overpriced printer ink cartridges. 

The biggest problem I had is that I only need to use a printer occasionally. So infrequently, in fact, that the ink cartridges dry up or clog between printings because I use print so infrequently. Which means half the time I wanted to print something, I had to buy new ink . . . which of course is ridiculously expensive. 

So I simply gave up on printers, and when I've had to print something I drive to the nearest FedEx Kinko's and print it there. Because it's *cheaper* to drive 30 minutes round trip, pay for parking, and pay for printing than to keep buying overpriced ink cartridges for these garbage printers. But I'm also sick of the hassle of having to drive somewhere to print out three pages. 

There *must* be a rational printer manufacturer out there that offers a quality product that's not an ink cartridge scam. Hoping Reddit can help me identify it. 

My criteria: 

 * Print documents. That's pretty much it. 
 * I don't give a rat's ass about printing photos. I don't even really care that much about printing anything in color; black-and-white would suffice for 85% of my printing needs.  
 * Ink cartridges that don't dry up from disuse. 
 * Built in scanner highly desirable, but I could live without it. The iPhone works fine as a substitute scanner, since I don't have complex or high-quality scanning needs. 
 * It's nice if the printer is wireless because that will free up space on my desk, but it's not required. 
 * Price that doesn't break the bank.

Bitcoin,What's preventing bitcoin from being banned by countries?,"I've been interesting in investing but the number 1 reason I've been holding off is the possibility a US government bans it and makes it a criminal currency.  The key reason is competition with the dollar and federal reserve system and lets just say they have a lot influence to get their way.  They've confiscated or banned alternative ways of storing wealth in the past like gold in 1933 and the liberty dollar in 2007.  They could confiscate gold again as the ""Affordable Care Act"" mandates reporting of precious metals transactions over $600. I just could easily see this happen and sold to the public as people start using it for money laundering, drugs, tax evasion, etc.  

I could see it start as outlawing exchanges making conversion to and from the dollar illegal.  Then lead to having ISPs sniffing out, blocking, and reporting illegal bitcoin transactions, likely hidden in a CISPA bill.  Even though it is encrypted that doesn't mean that it can't be recognized.

Bitcoin,Online wallet gotchas: looking like a potential criminal,"First some background on how most online wallets work. You are assigned an address (or multiple) that you can use to send BTC to so you can fund your account. But this address doesn't necessarily always contain your wallet balance. The online service owns this address and is free to do what it likes with it as long as it maintains your ""internal balance"" correctly. It might move some of it to cold storage, it might form part of a pool and be spent from when other members of the service make outgoing transactions (effectively becoming a mixing service).

This sometimes leads to surprises when a user looks up ""their"" address on blockchain.info. Often they'll see that after they deposited to the address, it was soon swept out to other addresses. Cue freakout. A recent example: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pquee/are_my_bitcoins_being_stolen/

This is not a problem for wallets like blockchain.info and Coinkite where the addresses are actually yours and used to hold your entire balance.

Today I decided to lookup one of the addresses from a wallet I use and was surprised to find that to an outside observer, I look like a Silk Road user. This is an address that I have published and given to people: [1HVyJgcZYkoPeUbAYf3XFsEXyzefyUYny1](https://blockchain.info/address/1HVyJgcZYkoPeUbAYf3XFsEXyzefyUYny1) You can see the [most recent outgoing transaction](https://blockchain.info/tx/f6b92c0c5c92a7dbc8819b4bd386f9e10c9d8a545424ae21c8e0c93feecd6be1) was directly to a Silk Road address that was seized by the feds. I never used Silk Road but obviously another user of the online wallet did (not surprising).

I kind of expected that a lot of Bitcoin users would be indirectly connected to Silk Road transactions given the volume involved, but never thought I could be connected so directly. I'm not worried at all, just thought it was an interesting anecdote to share :)

While I'm in PSA mode, another gotcha with these kind of wallets: you can lose money if you use them to send to services that (stupidly) send refunds back to the sending address. When you send, the funds can come from any address in the pool instead of ""your"" address. If the receiver tries to return to the sender, it could go to any random user. See http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1praic/beware_inputsio_sending_to_coinbase/ The same goes for SatoshiDice and other sites where winnings are returned to the sending address. The new payment protocol in Bitcoin 0.9 adds a refund address, so that will hopefully help with this problem in the future.

Can anyone think of any other gotchas with these kinds of wallets? Besides the obvious risks of your funds being lost/stolen/seized.",cryptocurrency,1383452521

investing,A retail investor's look at NQ Mobile vs Muddy Waters (Long report),"Hello, r/investing! I'm only a newbie that got into this study only couple months ago. I've learned a lot from this subreddit and I want to share what I gathered so far on the ongoing wall street drama, Muddy Waters vs NQ Mobile.

So as many of you in this subreddit are also aware, a short seller research firm, Muddy Waters, has accused of NQ Mobile of fraud last week. Combined with the inherent skepticism of wall street towards Chinese companies, and the NQ being a small cap growth company, Carson Block of Muddy Water had no problem sending NQ Mobile's stock plummeting towards bottom. The stock lost **70%** of its value in matter of days. However, due to NQ Mobile's fierce rebuttals and numerous PR efforts, it had recovered to almost 15 per share from its gut wrenching 7 per share bottom. The investors' cheer at the stock's recovery was short lived, as Carson Block came on Bloomberg once again. This time with another frightening statement, ""NQ Mobile will be de-listed within the year!"" The market didn't like that idea one bit, as NQ Mobile's shares gave out ALL of its 20% gain it had made that morning and went 12% under before the day's close. That brings us to today. 

So what is really going on here? 

Muddy Water's [**82 pages**](http://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/nq/initiating-coverage-nq/) report on NQ all really come down to three main points. 

1. NQ Mobile's accounting book shows its cash in Level 2 assets. This is some Chinese accounting trick and NQ Mobile's cash is likely to not exist.

2. NQ Mobile's biggest 'customer', Yidatong, its a shell company. Many of their office addresses are non existent

3. NQ Mobile's app is a malware, and its partnerships are fake.

Now, I'm not a wall street genius. I have zero knowledge of corporate accounting let alone how they are in China! I don't live in China either and I have no real idea of how things are over there. So pretty much I represent the majority of the investors. (probably why Muddy Water has such success every time regardless of wrong/right) But wait! I have the power of the internet! So I started googling. Let's take a look at each of these allegations;

* **NQ Mobile's accounting book shows its funds in Level 2 assets. This is some Chinese accounting trick and NQ Mobile's cash is likely to not exist.**

Level 2 assets pretty much means long term deposits in NQ Mobile's case, where they receive slightly higher interest. They have disclosed their [balances](http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/NQ-mobile-Muddy-waters.jpg), which turned out to be 280 million. Going out of their way to try to calm investors, [**NQ Mobile started transfering 100 million USD to a Standard Chatered Bank, a British multinational bank.** ](http://ir.nq.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=243152&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1869577&amp;highlight=) About 54 million USD has finished transferring as of today. NQ Mobile has authorized the bank to allow ANYONE to inquire and verify its balances. 

I don't know much, but to me that seems like a shit ton of cash for a fraudulent company, especially when Muddy Water accused it of not having any. I also refuse to believe Carson Block didn't understand what Level 2 assets mean. Another chinese company, BIDU, also holds a significant amount of its funds in level 2 asset. 

To an average investors like you and me who have no idea/cba to research what level 2 assets mean, it sounds bad! Muddy Water has clearly taken advantage of our ignorance. 

Furthermore, notice how Carson Block makes no mention of NQ's cash clearly existing on the second Bloomberg interview. 

* **NQ Mobile's biggest 'customer', Yidatong, its a shell company. Many of their office addresses are non existent.** 

Ghost addresses are apparently standard business practice even for US companies. Some laws require home offices in regions they want to do business in but it is not required to be staffed.  I didn't know that. Now I do. I don't think Carson Block didn't know this.

Also, NQ Mobile has provided Yidatong's HQ address on its [**90 page**](http://www.scribd.com/doc/179927824/NQ-Mobile-responds-to-Muddy-Waters-pdf) rebuttal. 

&gt; Tianjin Yidatong Technology Development Co.  
&gt; Beijing Fengtai District South 4th Ring, No 188 West Road  
&gt; Headquarter Center District  
&gt; 16 Number 20 Building 3rd Floor

On the last Bloomberg interview, NQ Mobile's co-ceo Omar Khan mentioned that many people have already visited Yidatong's home office, [**including bloomberg**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=vaA0edmTSZs#t=550). Notice how the interviewer doesn't even comment on that. Bloomberg is not releasing what they already know on purpose. I will go as far as to accuse them of trying to milk this story for views.

If Muddy Water does have its people on the ground in China and its allegations are true, why don't they simply take a camera and record their visit to this home office? An empty building on this address could throw this whole NQ fiasco off NYSE immediately.

* **NQ Mobile's app is a malware, and its partnerships are fake.**

[**Here**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nqmobile.antivirus20) is NQ Mobile's Security app listed on Google play. Go try it yourself. I did. It's a pushy sales app, but it certainly isn't malware. [**Here**](http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/security/3351950/nq-mobile-security-review/) is a review of this app by PC Advisor.com
Here's another [**review**](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404837,00.asp) by PC Magazine, where they include NQ Vault (feature of NQ Mobile Secuirty App) as among 10 best security apps for mobile. 

[**Here**](http://translate.google.com/translate?depth=1&amp;nv=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.cctime.com/html/2013-9-24/20139241040184045.htm) is a Chinese review of a ZTE phone with NQ software preinstalled.

[**Another review**](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/zte-blade-g2-review-1-439084) of ZTE phones that display NQ app.

[**Lenovo has confirmed NQ Mobile as one of its suppliers.**](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-31/muddy-waters-attack-forces-nq-mobile-ceo-khan-to-fight-tarnish.html)

Many of NQ Mobile's partners in China have declined to comment. Stating it is standard business practice to not disclose such information. If such relationships are indeed non-existent, what is stopping them from coming out to say we never did business with NQ? I think everyone is being super conservative and staying down in order to avoid bad press. However, many have come to defense of NQ mobile's legitimacy, including Toros, Topeka, and many buy side analysts calling this a rare opportunity to buy a growth stock at a ridiculous discount.

If NQ is a fraud, that means;

* PC magazine and numerous reviewing entities have gave out recommendations to buy a malware.
* Billionaire Steve Cohen of SAC Capital and its army of analysts have failed to notice that NQ was a fraud before investing in it. In fact, [**he proceeded to buy more as the stock crashed.**](http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2013/10/31/nq-mobile-rallies-80-as-billionaire-steve-cohens-sac-capital-gets-burned/) ^Somebody ^point ^this ^man ^to ^the ^sidebar?

* Various auditing agencies including PWC and SEC have failed to notice NQ Mobile's fraud. NQ Mobile has been audited 11 times since 2011. I gotta say, if NQ Mobile does turn out to be a fraud, we have a serious problem in NYSE.

The way I see it, there is *overwhelming* evidence of NQ Mobile's legitimacy. Muddy Water has taken advantage of concepts unfamiliar to US investors and their natural tendency to panic. This is a shameful, blatant market manipulation and abuse of power by Muddy Waters. [**Did I mention that Carson has 0-7 record on finding fraud in companies that were not formed in a reverse merger?**](http://seekingalpha.com/article/1782152-nq-mobile-behind-smoke-and-mirrors-lies-the-truth-part-1)

What does this mean for us? To put it simply, the stock was $25 per share before Muddy Water came in. It closed at 12 per share yesterday. There is a ridiculous short float and as NQ Mobile comes ahead, as truth always does, there will be a MASSIVE upswing. Not to mention there's an [**independent review**](http://ir.nq.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=243152&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1871308&amp;highlight=) by law firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling LLP to be released.

NQ Mobile is scheduled to release Q3 earnings on November 12 8PM ET. They have promised complete disclosure of their books and a $35 million share buy back following the call. 

Hopefully I have shed some light on this ongoing scandal. Please do your own research before making investment decisions. Good luck to us all on Monday.

My question is what the hell do I do with all this debt, what do I pay off first, and is there any point in trying to put any of my money into savings before I pay off the majority of the debt?

I just realized that the way I’m doing things now is really leaving me with about $200 less than I can realistically live on each month. In order to avoid going into more debt, it seems I need to pick and choose which things I should be giving less money. 

My current payment plan per month is:

$100 to my student loans (which gain about $90 in interest each month). I don’t need to payback these loans until I’m done with grad school but I’m trying to avoid gaining huge amounts in interest.

$200 to my computer loan (minimum payment is $100, but I’m doing $200 to get it out of the way asap, which with my current plan should be taken care of in 1 year)

$200 to my mom (this was the plan we set up, I’m sure she would be ok with it if I asked to pay back less each month but I’d really prefer to not do that to her)

~$250 to my credit cards (whatever the minimum payment is)

$50 to a savings account

$50 to a couple retirement accounts

---So, currently I’m spending about $750/month on paying off debt and $100 to savings. I would want to continue putting money into savings if possible, but is it even worth it with all this debt I have to pay off?

Bitcoin,Some perspective for the fence-sitter...,"Look at it this way. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence. There are more than 313,000,000 people in the United States alone. Now, Bitcoin is incredibly divisible, with the smallest (currently) being the Satoshi, of which there are 100,000,000 to a Bitcoin. So it's not a matter of there not being enough to go around. If it increases in value, as it seems it will, it will be common to think of millibitcoins and microbitcoins as units of purchase and exchange.

That said, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins. Ever. And some of those are already lost due to forgotten private keys or failure to backup wallets. If you divide the total number of Bitcoins, not taking into account lost or destroyed Bitcoins, and divide it just by the number of (just) Americans that would mean if every American owned exactly the same amount of total Bitcoins that will ever exist, that would be 0.067 BTC per person.

Think of it in terms of the global population, that would be 0.003 BTC per person if spread equally.

If Bitcoin succeeds as a global currency, it'd be a shame to be that person who didn't buy at least 1 BTC when they had the opportunity.

There will only be 21,000,000 Bitcoins ever. It's hardwired into the programming.

personalfinance,Questions about accomplishing goals in the next five to ten years,"I'm 23 and I'll be graduating in May 2014 with a $70k/yr (plus 10% yearly bonus potential that I won't be budgeting for) job in the DC area and ~$60k in debt.  My loans are all 5-6% interest rates.  I'll also be getting married soon after graduation.  My wife will have one more year of school/training left before she'll begin making money.  She'll probably graduate with $10k-$15k in loans.  There's no other debt.  We both have cars that are paid off and relatively reliable.  

That first year of marriage, we'll be living entirely on my salary.  After doing some research on rent in the DC area, I've constructed a budget that accounts for all of our expenses, allows me to make payments on my student loans, contribute to my 401k to get my full employer match, and put back enough money to have a safety net built up for us in case anything happens to my job.  We're talking to our parents now and trying to stay on their healthcare plans (both have plans that cost the same for one child or two and we both have younger siblings).

In our second year, when my wife starts her career, she'll be making around $50k/yr.  We will most likely keep the same lifestyle that we had before and we want to use the extra money she'll be making to pay down our debt, contribute to retirement, and travel.  Traveling is especially important to us.  We plan to have kids in the next five to ten years, so we want to take advantage of international travel in our younger, childless years.  

One part of me wants to just meet the bare minimums on 401k contributions and loan payments and spend the rest on exploring the world.  However, I don't want to put us in a bad position for the future.  So I'm wondering what your opinions are on this.  How do we balance making the most of our youth and this abundance of money while still putting ourself in a good place for the future?  Obviously, this is kind of personal, but I like hearing people's experiences in situations like this.  I don't really have anyone to talk to about this with any real experience.  My parents' dream when they got married was to not be poor and own a house.  Because of their success with their dream, I have the opportunity to live out mine, but they don't really have much relevant, non-generic advice to offer.

Other relevant information:  

* Neither of us care about owning a house any time soon as we don't really know where we want to end up.  

* Neither of us care about driving a particularly nice car.  I have a 12 year old SUV at the moment that I wouldn't mind trading in for a used car with good gas mileage (Mazda 3, Honda civic, etc), but at the moment, my plan is to drive the SUV into the ground.  I've been lucky in that it was given to me, I pay very low insurance, I don't drive much, and I've had to put very little money into repairs.

* We are both relatively frugal people (more like we save to do stuff we care about rather than we save to see our bank accounts grow).

* We both have degrees in highly employable fields.  I know nothing is guaranteed, but I would be surprised if either of us was ever unemployed for an extended period of time.",finance,1383524337

I've asked different people on how best to start off, but here's the thing: they all have their own ways of doing it.

Some people use their credit cards, and pay off the balance immediately when the bill comes so they don't get dinged interest. Some use the cards, leave out a little bit so when the bill comes it shows a balance, and then pay off the card before closing date so they don't pay interest. Some say it's all about utilization rates of the card, and that you're supposed to only use up to a certain percentage of your credit limit, and then paying it off slowly while you accrue interest. Some say the only way to get good credit is to suck up the interest rate and pay it off slowly, so the banks know they can make money off of you.

And then some folks say to just get a secure card since the credit limit is whatever your deposit is. And then some people say secure cards are bullshit since you don't make banks any money.

personalfinance,Best options for repaying these huge student loans?,"Hey PF!

I'm looking at a huge student loan burden and would appreciate some insight into ways to manage this.  Please see the italicized questions below.

I know this subject has come up before (and I've searched old posts and read through them).
I've tried to play around with unbury.me and other calculators, but I'm not sure if I trust myself with the results.  And I'm not sure I trust my loan servicer either!


Here is what I'm dealing with:

1) Stafford (T.H.E.) - $58k @ 6.8%


2) Consolidated (T.H.E.) - $52k @ 4.75%


3) GradPLUS (private bank) - $41k @ 8.5%


4) GradPLUS (US D.O.E.) - $41k @ 8.5%


5) Stafford (US D.O.E.) - $61k @ 6.8%


6) Stafford (private bank) - $65k @ 6.8%



**My goal is to get these paid-off ASAP.**



I estimate a pre-tax salary of approx $240k.  I think I could dedicate $5000/month to loan repayment (50% of every paycheck). (maybe more?)

The loan servicer gave me these payment estimates based on that salary level:


10-yr repayment monthly minimum = $3700


25-yr repayment monthly minimum = $2200



Right now I'm eligible for IBR and wonder if it's worth pursuing that for 12 months until I have to reapply (at which point I'll no longer be eligible).  Using IBR from last year's salary, I'd pay about $350/month.
  
**&gt;***Would it make sense to enter into IBR for 12 months (@$350/mo) in order to put LOTS of extra money toward the high interest loans, or does that idea generally fail because of the interest you continue to accrue on the other loans?*

**&gt;***Would the 25-yr repayment plan work to bring down my monthly minimum payment, again to free-up extra cash to throw at the big interest rate loans (in hopes of getting it all paid sooner than 10 yrs)?*

**&gt;***Would consolidation help for any part of these loans?*

I could really use some advice on how to get out the debt I'm in right now. I'm using a throwaway because I think that with my main account, it's pretty easy to figure out my real name and such.

The problem is this: I have $2400 on a credit card and the 0% interest ran up over the past year. The reason I have run up this high of a bill on my credit card is that last year I ended up in a really bad situation overseas and it was pricey to get out of and that took up all of my money so I ended up paying bills with my credit card for awhile while I was unemployed. It was not the best decisions that lead to where I am now but there's no changing the past. I just need to get it paid off. Now, I'm in a pretty stable situation. I live with my parents and I don't have a ton of bills (basically just my car, gas, insurance, food, personal stuff) month to month. But I only work part-time and I've been trying to get more hours at my current/interviewing for other jobs but I can't count on anything other than my current situation. I'm applying to grad schools and I hope to be debt free (other than student loans) by the time I enroll next fall, should I be accepted anywhere. But it seems like I'm just throwing away money on interest. I have maybe $200 a month free but that has to pay for student loans too starting next month. My thought was to open another credit card and use the introductory 0% interest rating to avoid paying extra but I can't get one with that high of a credit limit. Should I open multiple cards and do balance transfers or do something else? My current interest rate is 18.99% even though I have good credit so it's pretty painful to just watch nearly $40 go down the drain and it's hard to pay off the principal at this rate.

personalfinance,Wells Fargo doesn't want to take more money from me. Does this make any sense to anyone else?,"I had previously posted on an application I'm making for private student loan consolidation with Wells Fargo [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1pinft/can_someone_help_me_verify_my_math/). To preface, the sole purpose I'm applying for this is to lower monthly minimums due in order to lower my DTI in order to have the best application on a mortgage next year. 

I was under the impression (and nowhere in the loan application process did it state how it was chosen) that I would get to choose the term of the loan, 15y vs 20y. I get the loan documents back (after a clusterfuck of an application process that involved them not getting documents confirmed sent to them no less than 3 times, mind you) and the term is 15y at the lowest interest rate they offer on that. 

I call to ask if they'd re-review the application for a 20-year term. They call me back and say no. I ask them to escalate it. They escalate it and they say no.

So, basically Wells Fargo is now telling me that I qualify for their (harder-to-get) 15y loan at the lowest interest rate they offer (so, for all intents and purposes, I have the perfect credit they're looking for in a consumer) but that I don't qualify, under their policies, for a 20y term.

I've explained and explained and explained the reasoning behind it (lower minimum = lower DTI = lower APR on a mortgage) and that I, voluntarily, am willing to accept the potential burden of more interest over the term of the loan. They're saying that a 20y term is not in what they deem to be my best interests as I would be paying more interest in that case. No. Fucking. Duh. In turn, they won't offer me a 20y term whatsoever.

Does this make any sense to anyone else?

**TL;DR - Applying for student loan consolidation at Wells. They're telling me I qualify for a harder-to-get loan at the lowest IR possible, but not one with a longer term, as it's not in my best interest to pay more interest, despite me voluntarily agreeing to pay more in interest over a longer term in exchange for a lower minimum due in order to lower my DTI for a potential mortgage application next year.**",finance,1383677950

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, The Bigger Picture","I think people need to realize that the dollar fiat currency is getting less valuable every day until it is worth nothing.

Money is a medium of exchange that has INTRINSIC value. 

Intrinsic can be the value of the metal, typically a precious metal, in a coin.

Intrinsic value can be partially or entirely due to the desirable features of the object as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Examples of such features include divisibility; easily and securely storable and transportable; scarcity; and difficulty to counterfeit. When objects come to be used as a medium of exchange they lower the high transaction costs associated with barter and other in-kind transactions.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(numismatics)

Money does not equal fiat currency. 

Dollar Fiat currency does NOT have intrinsic value because it is not scarce. 

The dollar fiat currency is no longer backed by gold. 

Eventually we need to stop comparing everything to the dollar fiat currency. 

Yes Bitcoin could be worth $1,000 fiat currency one day or even more, but eventually that $1000 fiat currency will be worth nothing. However, this does NOT mean Bitcoin crypto currency will be worth nothing, it will work similar to how gold works, as long as people trust and believe in this new crypto currency.

Back in the old days, say in exchange for one gold coin you receive 5 cows. That still holds true today. 

Every man hour or man effort you could exchange for gold back in the past is the same man hour or man effort you can exchange for gold today.

Gold, Silver and other precious metals will always hold their value but the reason why we created paper ""money"" dollar fiat currency in the first place is because it was easier to trade then it was gold, silver and other precious metals.

Dollar fiat currency used to be backed by gold, but it is NOT backed by gold anymore. It is backed by government promises.

Now this is where bitcoin currency comes in. Bitcoins are a great means of exchange. No, they are not backed by gold either, BUT there are ONLY 21 million bitcoins that can ever be created, unlike dollar fiat currency where the Federal Reserve can print as much as they want creating INFLATION.

Switching from dollar fiat currency to this new crypto currency means there will be no inflation but DEFLATION.

Deflation is the decrease in the general price level of goods and services.

Prices have to fall because there is less ""money"" or Bitcoin crypto currency to chase those consumer goods.

There are many other benefits of bitcoin but this is one of the main reasons I think it is going to replace the use of dollar fiat money we use today.

The one downside is it will cause people to save bitcoin, gold, silver and other precious metals and spend their ever decreasing in value dollar fiat currency which will wipe out the poor...

The one question I would like to know is how many decimals can bitcoin go to. If you can keep moving the decimal over to the right isn't this the same as printing dollar fiat currency ?

[Edit]
Adding decimal places is not the same as printing money for the following reason:

When you print more money, the amount of money increases, devaluing the money people already hold.
Adding support for more decimal places doesn't add any more bitcoin, so the existing value is not effected by the additional decimal places.

Think of it this way. If we suddenly introduced a 1/10th cent piece (1/10th of a penny) along with our existing Canadian coins would it make the Canadian dollar you hold worth any less? No.

Also, the only reason you would introduce such a coin (or add decimals places to increase bitcoins divisibility), is because the buying power of the currency has increased to such an extent (deflation) you need smaller 'pieces' for the currency to still be usable. If a cup of coffee cost less than 1¢ who would overpay by paying a full 1¢?

Springleaf Holdings (NYSE: LEAF) combines a number of major themes emerging from the recent credit crisis, including the changing focus of ”too big to fail” banks, the overall deleveraging of household credit, and the falling and reemergence of the securitization markets, fueled in part by the portfolio rebalance effects of quantitative easing.

Springleaf sits right in the middle of all these themes as it funds its balance sheet through both securitizations of loans and the unsecured debt market — both areas revitalized with ZIRP (zero interest rate policies) and the chase for yield. Maybe most interesting is that this unit was previously owned by AIG, only to be sold in a fire sale to private equity firm Fortress in 2010. Piecing together these factors, Springleaf presents an interesting opportunity for equity investors that I believe will be rewarded over the coming years.

Executive Summary:

Conducive environment in which the Fed is accommodative and the credit cycle isn’t deteriorating. Typically, these factors don’t occur simultaneously.
A pure play on the subprime consumer lending segment in which most big banks have left the market because of tighter regulations.
Improved funding mix benefiting from a continued return of ABS securitization and refinancing of high-cost legacy debt in the unsecured market.
Springleaf’s credit quality will improve, and costs will fall as the legacy real estate segment runs off.

personalfinance,Simple student loan question.,"If I am eligible for federal direct subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans ($2750 and $3259 respectively) and I accept them, will I receive the full amount of both regardless of my school costs? For instance, if after a pell grant I owe $1000 for school, will I only get $1000 in loans allowed to me to cover it, or will I get the full amount directly in my bank account to help cover additional living expenses?

I haven't had to have loans up until this point, but my living expenses are becoming very difficult to handle while going to school, so I was wondering if I am allowed to basically get a check(s) in my name directly paid to me for the value of these student loans to help pay for everything.

As someone in their early 20's with a solid job, it's hard to imagine ever being able to save up enough for a down payment on a house. It seems most people I talk to are generally against the idea, but I struggle to see the downsides. If I take out the loan, the payments I make go back into my 401k, the interest rates seem competitive, and if the loan is towards a primary residence, you get an extended term to pay back the loan. Also, my company matches contribution to my 401k up to a certain percentage, so isn't that yet another positive to taking out the loan? My company would essentially be paying for part of my down payment. Is there a serious downside I am missing? What do you guys think?",finance,1383757695

Bitcoin,"Cavirtex - Stay away, Canadians.","LATEST UPDATE:

Both deposits have finally been credited.

---------


Canadians, stay away from Cavirtex.

TL;DR Version:  Registered with Virtex, verified. everything is fine, VirtEx changes their policy (in September), does not notify anyone, retroactively revokes verification status, and just as I attempt to deposit(in November), and now they tell me they need my landords photo IDs to verify _my_ identity. and preferably my full tax assessment as well....
.....

So, 

I registered with Cavirtex a while back, and as requested, I sent all the necessary documents to complete their verification requirements.

I signed their contract, the terms and conditions document. (That forces you into arbitration and releases them from everything, of course). 
I sent them a color copy of my government issued ID, front and back.

I was then notified via my account (verification status, screenshot attached) that it has been verified. 

This: http://i.imgur.com/0vWW41L.png, and then this: http://i.imgur.com/W2ys5ES.png

You would think this mean your account have been fully verified. Apparently not.

Everything was great until about a week ago, when I deposited a fairly sizeable amount of money to buy some bitcoins.
They not only took their sweet time in confirming the receipt of my payment, but went ahead and sent me a surprise request for more identification,  they for some reason needed  further proof of identity from me in order to release my funds.

Account Verifications

_____________________________________________________

Just in time, as I just completed a deposit! What a convenient time to change the policy! Did you notify all of your clients, because it sounds like I have been singled out.

Numerous requests to contact and to resolve the issue have been futile. In the time between me depositing the money and now, the price of bitcoin has gone up by $50 -60 a coin(costs me thousands by now.). Not only have they caused me to lose a size able amount of money as a result of their incompetence - which I in fact hope is just incompetence, and not an attempt to take advantage of deposits and give clients the runaround in the meanwhile, they have also managed to lock clients such as myself and thousands of others into unfair contracts which strip customers of their right to any means of legal protection other than an arbitration/mediation session. 

Here are my questions for Cavitrex, now that it seems so difficult to find a resolution to this issue:

1- Why do your customers need to send you a copy of their TAX ASSESSMENT ? Tax assessments contain an enormous amount information (including your family situation,married/divorced/etc, number of children, medical and disability status of yourself and your dependents, SIN number, various tax credits that reveal all sorts of personal information, etc) and can be used to commit serious identity theft !  

How is this document more verifiable of my address and identification than my driver's license, which you can directly call and verify, either online or telephone, with the Ministry of Transportation, branch of the Government ITSELF? The same database that is used by the police to serve summons, warrants, apprehend and arrest, and enforce law in general. Good enough for courts and law enforcement, but not Cavirtex. Why on earth should we trust a non-regulated, unlicensed company which doesn't even trust its so called ""clients"" ? The other ID was a federally issued identification card, which would really be enough identification to become eligible as a candidate in federal elections. I could run for the Prime Minister office, however, not solid enough identification for Cavirtex.

To be fair, it does cost a whole $2.50 to pick up and dial the Ministry's number, which I have even offered to cover. Cavirtex did not seem to be interested. Revenue Canada, however, will not verify my information for VirtEx, in case VirtEx will try to call them, not sure what is the motivation to obtain tax assessments from me, that they cannot even verify, yet expose me to major risks.

***Instead they suggest: ""If you do not have any of these documents we require a Tenancy Agreement, attestation of lodging signed by your landlord, ___your landlord's picture ID as described above___ and a third party bill in your name and address.""*** A third party bill, but in my name? What?

So now I need to get my  landlord's photo ID, both front and back, with edges clearly visible, of course. How does one obtain picture IDs of rental property corporations? Should their CEO send Cavirtex his driver license (with clearly visible edges, of course) would the CFO suffice? Or should I demand the property manager gets everyone on the corporate board/trustees to send Cavirtex all of their personal info, including their dental records, just to make sure? Are you really telling me to get the superintendent to give me a copy, back and front of his personal photo identification, so that I can ""send some money to Cavirtex in another province to buy bitcoins""? Really?

2 -What will happen to the losses you have caused my investments as a result of your tardiness, inefficiency, and lack of regard for customers, is this how you intend to treat anyone who dares to transact in anything larger than a couple of bucks? My transaction fees alone on this SINGLE transaction would be HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. Are you after repeat customers at all?

3- Why my request for a callback has been ignored? Is it that hard to tell me if ONLY TWO IDs (one federal, one provincial, with AN ACTUALLY VERIFIABLE ADDRESS) are sufficient?

4- You say this is because of increased fraud, then why am I being notified just as I deposited money, and not when your policy was changed? Am I being singled-out? How am I to trust your company with protection of my private information, if you cant even protect your own company from fraud and have to resort to such methods? Does not instill confidence to say the least.

No bank, brokerage, insurance or trust company has EVER demanded my tax assessments and my landlords photo ID, even though I've cleared thousands of futures contracts round-trip daily. They all honored the contract they were a party to, never applied changes retroactively, and provided ample notice on every future change of terms, instead of surprising me with some kind of unreasonable demands soon after I actually try to use their service. Instead it actually seemed they were trying to compete for my business, and I frequently received very, very deep discounts for repeat business, instead of sudden demands for full tax assessments and landlord photo IDs. Note, all of those businesses are tightly regulated. You advertise your company as an investment vehicle, I sure hope your investors read this thread. Is this how you treat investors also?

personalfinance,Tax question about direct conversion to Roth IRA [x-post from /r/tax],"Given this sub's higher readership than /r/tax, I decided to cross-post this question here.

I recently rolled over a 401(k) plan from my previous employer into a Rollover IRA. I am now in the process of converting that into a Roth IRA and today I received a form from my IRA custodian that has me a bit confused.

It is Form W-4P*, where I have to specify my withholding elections. For federal income tax, I can choose to have tax withheld at a specified rate or I can opt for no tax withholding. I have external funds set aside that are sufficient to cover the estimated tax. Thus, can I mark down ""no tax withholding,"" then separately make an estimated tax payment to the IRS by the appropriate deadline?

For state income tax, the same options exist, but for my state (Indiana) there is apparently a minimum withholding requirement of $10 for conversions. If I specify an amount to be withheld -- which it seems I am required to do -- is that amount considered to be an ""early withdrawal"" that then makes me subject to the 10% penalty on the entire conversion amount? (Nov. 6 edit: I called the IRS and they indicated that withheld tax is *not* considered an early withdrawal, so there is no penalty.)

I have read various IRS publications but cannot find clear answers to these questions. Thanks for any help you can provide.

*Looking at the full Form W-4P at the IRS website, it says:

&gt; Eligible rollover distribution—20% withholding. Distributions you receive from qualified pension or annuity plans (for example, 401(k) pension plans and section 457(b) plans maintained by a governmental employer) or tax-sheltered annuities that are eligible to be rolled over tax free to an IRA or qualified plan are subject to a flat 20% federal withholding rate. The 20% withholding rate is required, and you cannot choose not to have income tax withheld from eligible rollover distributions. Do not give Form W-4P to your payer unless you want an additional amount withheld. Then, complete line 3 of Form W-4P and submit the form to your payer.

&gt; Note. The payer will not withhold federal income tax if the entire distribution is transferred by the plan administrator in a direct rollover to a traditional IRA or another eligible retirement plan (if allowed by the plan), such as a qualified pension plan, governmental section 457(b) plan, section 403(b) contract, or tax-sheltered annuity.

Given that I did a direct rollover to the Rollover IRA, am I correct in assuming that this 20% mandatory federal tax withholding doesn't apply to me?",finance,1383699624

We have 20K in an emergency fund.

You would think that news like this would be wide spread and very important to the millions it will effect.

So why are we not hearing about it through our mainstream media?

Why were today's headlines about Lady Gaga going to dress like a freaky whore and sing a song in outer space rather than the global catastrophe that is ""95%"" emanate?

One would think that the whole world would want to do whatever possible to stop the release of megatons of nuclear waste and radioactive materials into the ocean and atmosphere.

Did you know that the Fukushima nuclear power plant has to pump cold ocean water into the reactors to keep the reactor from melting down and releases radio active waste into the ocean since the earthquake in 2011. 70% of the initial contaminated waste from the reactors went straight into the ocean in the days after the quake and has been leaking continuously since.

These aren't predictions here people. This has already happened, and it's about to get a whole lot worse.  Top Scientists say that the Pacific Ocean has been destroyed and the food it yields is contaminated with high levels of radiation. The levels are too high already and we haven't had the full meltdown yet.

What's worse is there are a multitude of things that could be done to stop this global catastrophe. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out, but it's not even a blip on the lips of our leaders. To top it off the only thing being done is to have TEPCO play a giant game of Doctor with the fuel rods. Exept you don't get a buzzer and a red nose light up when you touch the rods together, oh no, you get a major nuclear explosion. People are too concerned with distractions in media to see the real dangers unfolding in the background.

Who's going to need O-bummer-care when we are all horrifically contaminated with irreversible radiation damage and dead?

Some may say that I am a conspiracy theorist, but I don't think so...

personalfinance,Advice on refinancing/getting right side up in a car loan.,"Here's the problem. My (now wife, Fiance at the time) was driving an old Malibu in College, well it broke down and she had to buy a new car outright. She didn't have enough in savings to pay for anything outright so she had to take out a loan. Because she was a young woman with virtually no credit, she had a high interest rate on the new car, an 07 Focus. So, not long after getting the Focus, she gets in an accident and totals it. The insurance paid out enough to pay off the loan, but not buy a new car.  So, we frantically shopped around and after a day of shopping, I found nothing. Well she found in her hometown from the same place she got the Focus, an 05 Accord. She said ""Oh my family has been buying cars from here for years and they always give us a good deal"" so anyway, we find the car, I approve of it, it's got over 100k on it, but it's an Accord so I trust it. They want $10k for it. We agree on that and we go to do the paperwork, well I wasn't in the room when her and the dealer were discussing financing, so I go in, sign the papers and we're off. I ask her what the interest rate was, and she said 22%. I about shit myself at that point, however, me telling her ""no you can't have this car"" would result in her probably killing me, because she's prone to anxiety as it is, and she had to have a car. So we're stuck with this vehicle that we owe a shitload on. Anyway,  we bought it in February and we still owe over $10k on it and have 4 years+ left on the loan. We figured it was a good idea to refinance. Luckily I have good credit and so that shouldn't have been an issue, well we went to a local credit union and they denied us, because the car had some hail dents and had some tree sap on it. We were crushed. So we decided that we were just going to make extra payments, clean it up and try again. Well she decided she wanted ""Gap Insurance"" to pay for the Upside down portion of the loan, so we checked with our insurance agent (Farmers) and they don't offer it on used cars. Great.  So now we're stuck as to what to do and this is where i'm asking for advice. We screwed up on the Accord and are in a crappy situation because of it and we want to get out. We have tons of student loan debt and want to make a dent in it, but it's hard when you're making a car payment.  Anyway, should we clean up the sap, maybe fix some dents and try for another refinance? Should we pursue a bigger bank or financial institution instead of local places? Or should we just take the negative equity and buy a new vehicle and roll it into a new loan with a much much lower rate?",finance,1383847272

finance,How do you think it would work out in terms of finance/investing/wealth distribution if time machines were to be invented? (Explanation in comments),"EDIT: Meant to here in the title. not comments.

I know this is a sort of silly theoretical question, but I've been trying to think about it for a couple days. I actually made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DontPanic/comments/1q0ek8/something_i_thought_about_while_rereading_the/) that mentioned it in /r/dontpanic, but I figure you guys would be more qualified to speculate the outcome. I know that time travel and financial gain is not a new concept. (Back to the Future?) But it always seems to be with one person being able to time travel and getting super rich. Never heard of everyone doing it.

It came to me while rereading *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"" and I read this quote:

&gt;All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time the operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has been paid for. 

Then the idea is never brought up again. And I imagine that it's for good reason. The series couldn't function in such conditions. It would completely change everything. But I'm trying to imagine how.

I'm using the same version of time travel as is in the book. If you haven't read it, do it. But regardless, feel free to use any version of time travel that you think would make the most compelling story.

My first thought was that everyone would do it and all the wealth would become concentrated in investments at the beginning and/or end of time. Then I realized that that was stupid. Disregarding economic collapses and disasters and such, the influx of time-investors would have crazy affects on interest rates and TMV would become a completely worthless concept. But I don't want to sully your opinions with my own.

Does anyone have any thoughts? I know it's silly. 

BTW, the reason I'm doing this is because I've been trying to understand finance 101 for a while now and I've been stuck. Then when that thought popped up, one thing led to another and I realized I'd been studying finance unintentionally for like 4 hours. (usually something that pains me)",finance,1383844728

personalfinance,Given the run-around on my Perkins loan... No one seems to want my money!,"I pulled my credit report recently and saw that my federal Perkins loan had been sent to collections (I'd had it in deferment for a while, then never received further communication regarding it after having moved a couple times... so I kinda forgot about it.  I am an idiot.).  Wanting to clear this up, I called the university's Student Accounts Office, which was listed on my credit report as the holder of the debt.  Student accounts office says that I need to contact the company they use for loan servicing, ECSI.  Makes sense, as that's who I was making payments to before.  So I call ECSI, and they inform me that they transferred the debt to a collections agency.  No problem, I just ask for the agency's phone number so I can get ahold of them.  Call the number given, get an answering machine, leave a message.  Wait two days, get no returned call.  Call ECSI to ask about the collections agency contact information again.  They give me a different number to the same agency.  Call that number, person informs me that I've called the wrong department.  Gives me the number for the correct department.  Call THAT number, talk to a lady who pulls up my information and then informs me that they had transferred my account back to the university Student Accounts Office.  They advise me to check the NSLDS site to ensure who currently holds the account.  I check the site... No Perkins loan listed at all.  I guess I'll call Student Accounts again today, but I doubt they'll provide much more information this time than they did the last.  So how the heck am I supposed to pay this damn loan??

TL;DR - Student Accounts says to pay ECSI.  ECSI says to pay collections agency.  Collections agency says to pay Student Accounts.  NSLDS says the loan doesn't exist.  Credit report disagrees.",finance,1383840799

I didn't have a car for 5 semesters. I don't have many expenses as a result so I have been able to save money. I would love to enjoy my last year of of university, but to do so I would need to take out a student loan to finance it.

How stupid of an idea is it?

My friends and I plan to rent in a upscale ""penthouse"" apartment that was just built right across from campus (classes) and the bar/night club district. I will also turn 21 so I foresee going out to become an expense.

My scholarships have covered my tuition for the last four years. I currently have an income of 600$/month that I use for discretionary spending. My scholarships cover my tuition and my cost of living is funded through loans (room and board). I have 6000$ in my savings account.

I will have a B.S. in Petroleum geology and a minor in mathematics. My friends that are graduating next semester already have job offers in the range of ~65K +benefits. I believe I can pay off my student debt in a year.  I want to work for two years and then pursue a M.S. in geology (average petroleum starting salary is ~100-120k, median salary is 150k + 20-40% bonus ).

A couple of years ago I was working at a distribution center that set up a 401k for me with Diversified.

I recently got a letter from diversified saying that since the amount is less than 5k, they will be charging a fee every quarter of 8 dollars. The interest rate is so low that this 8 dollars is more than the rate of growth... so I need to do something.  

I could:

1) put in 2800 so the account goes to $5000 and starts earning the tiny interest rate again

2) wait longer to get a job and hope it doesn't take much longer 

3) take the money out of the account, suffer the 60% tax and roll the remaining 900 into some other investment...

personalfinance,"$120K in Student Debt, Just Finished Paying All Credit Card Debt - Advice &amp; Strategy Post for Paying Remaining Debt","Hello personalfinance!

I spent the past few days reading through discussions on general and student debt. I face $120K in student loan debt remaining (graduated w/ BSEE in 2008), have a steady job and small mortgage. My goal is to find the best strategy to pay off all student debt within the next 6 years (if possible). I would really appreciate any and all feedback and suggestions to accomplish my dream of being debt-free by my mid-30s.

Here is how my financial status breaks down:

* Total monthly income after taxes: $3,175.72

**Monthly Expenses**

* Energy: $125 (average)
* Water: $125 (average - yes, very high in my area)
* Food: $100 (significant other pays for most)
* Life Insurance: $62.66
* Internet: $74.95
* Phone: $45.00 (just switched to Straight Talk from AT&amp;T at $92/month - thanks Reddit!)
* City Tax: $41.25

**Mortgage**

* Principle: $34,273.67 / Interest: 3.75% / Min. Payment: $417.31
(Includes land tax and home insurance)

**Student Loans**

* Private#1 (Sallie Mae) - Principle: $16,327.86 / Interest: 7.75% Variable / Min. Payment: $188.09
* Private#2 (Sallie Mae) - Principle: $10,521.02 / Interest: 5.25% Variable / Min. Payment: $110.19
* Private#3 (Sallie Mae) - Principle: $10,316.99 / Interest: 2.25% Variable / Min. Payment: $90.64
* Federal Loan - Principle: $14,512.40 / Interest: 3.75% Fixed / Min. Payment: $82.93
* MI-Loan#1 - Principle: $15,586.08 / Interest: 6.95% Fixed / Min. Payment: $139.60
* MI-Loan#2 - Principle: $19,578.38 / Interest: 6.95% Fixed / Min. Payment: $169.16

**Totals (Student Loans):**

* Principle: $120,325.10
* Minimum Monthly Payment: $1,056.28

One comment directed me to [unbury.me](http://unbury.me/) where you can calculate pay-off time and interest saved by increasing minimum payments to one loan at a time. This seems very helpful and I was also hoping to different perspectives on pay-off strategy.

With an avalanch pay-off type, [unbury.me](http://unbury.me/) recommended closing loans in the following order:

1) MI-Loan#5

2) Private Loan#1

3) MI-Loan#1

4) MI-Loan#2

5) MI-Loan#3

6) MI-Loan#4

7) Private Loan#2

8) Federal Loan

9) Private Loan#3

One option I was considering was changing my payment type on some loans to interest-only to free up more to put towards other loans that should be paid off more quickly. Might this be a good idea or am I way off base? I also haven't considered whether it might be a good idea to try to pay the mortgage off before the student debt.

My significant other and I like to travel at least once a year and not feel too stressed about not having any buffer for the occasional night out or vehicle emergency. I have barely started funneling money into my savings account as I just spent the last 12 months paying off $3,500 in credit debt (feels good man).

In total, I would love to have at least my student loan debt paid off within the next 6 years if possible. Would this make me go hungry or generally miserable with no extra spending money until that time? Would I have enough to conservatively enjoy the things in life that I work to live for?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin's Intrinsic Value: Cryptographic Proof of Work,"This is a rebuttal to the Chicago Federal Reserve's conclusion that bitcoin has no intrinsic value in its Dec paper on Bitcoin: http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/chicago_fed_letter/2013/cfldecember2013_317.pdf

**Intrinsic Value and Bitcoin** - *I believe that this initial rejection of bitcoin on intrinsic value grounds stems from a lack of understanding of cryptographic protocols, specifically the mathematical integrity of the RPOW (Reusable Proofs of Work).* *For more elaboration on the topic of RPOW and bitcoin's cryptographic elements, see my article* ""Bitcoin: Timing is Everything"" : http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-timing-is-everything.html

*While bitcoin may not have tangible intrinsic value, it is still a binary display of a discreet and provably scarce cryptographic item. This is what imbues bitcoin with 'gold-like' qualities compared to a digital movie which has intrinsic value but is infinitely copyable.*

Read more:
http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-are-libertarians-against-bitcoin.html

*Bitcoin is measured by its own finite quantity and valued for its intrinsically valuable function. The Bitcoin protocol has immense intrinsic value as a self-regulating frictionless payment network affordable to almost anyone. Here is a technology that allows anyone to send any amount of money to anyone else in the world at virtually no cost with nothing more than an Internet connection or smart phone. Bitcoin, like the Internet, is one of those innovations that can break down barriers; information barriers in the case of the Internet, and financial barriers with Bitcoin.*

*What I mean when I say that “Bitcoin is measured by its own finite quantity” is that the value of a single Bitcoin is measured against the strict limit of 21 million Bitcoins that can ever be produced. It is true that there will ultimately be less than 21 million coins at the end of Bitcoin’s production (approximately scheduled for the year 2140) due to accidental loss or destruction of coins, but let’s just say 21 million to keep it simple. The total intrinsic value of Bitcoin as a self-regulating frictionless payment network is measured relative to the strict limit of 21 million Bitcoins and in fact contributes to Bitcoin’s value by limiting supply.*

to me..the bubble IS and always was the stock market and everything priced in their fiat dollars in the end. they would sacrifice stocks to save the dollar and bonds though...I think. These central bankers got nothing else but to prop that thing on a minute by minute basis and to suck all the retail in now with new highs every other days. The sheep actually think all these stocks up here again do not have cyclical profits!!!! LOL. It is NEVER different.

at least BITCOIN is a groundbreaking attempt at an end around the central bankers. its just currency form in the end, WHICH IS of the SAME Conciousness that we live under with fiat dollars in many ways..but at least its a groundbreaking innovation....

if they ever pay interest on bitcoin...well good luck getting in.

Bitcoin,"Real Chili, Real Money.","I have been blabbing about bitcoin in public to strangers whenever and wherever I please for almost a year now, but I experienced a first tonight.  Outside of PorcFest or some other related bitcoin event, I have ALWAYS been the first person to bring up bitcoin, but tonight... Tonight, I wasn't.  My friend and I had just gotten done hanging out at our local bitcoin meetup and we were hungry.  At his urging, we decided to walk down the street to a random business and pitch them on accepting bitcoin HARD.  We were a tad loopy so this seemed like a great flipping idea, if you know what I mean.  Went walked a few hundred feet down a city block and stopped at a place called ""Real Chili.""  A real dive, but totally charming.  

It was surreal.  We were the only ones in the place for a bit.  We placed out order and asked if they accepted bitcoin as though everyone was already doing it.  The scraggly 20-something server dude scoffed, and said the owner would never go for it.  ""But, wait..."" I started, ""you know about bitcoin?""

Oh, he knew.  He gave my buddy and I a knowing yet modest nod.  Cool as a cucumber.  We finished our deliciously divey chili, and as we were taking our last bites a group of yuppie 20-somethings sauntered in and sat next to us in the otherwise empty place.  At this point, we had been done talking about bitcoin for a bit, and were just enjoying our munchies.  Seriously, we said nothing.  Our mouths too busy wolfing down a Milwaukee pastime.  Presented with the bill, I made my usual gripe about the rapaciousness of credit cards for small businesses.  

Then it happened.  Not 20 seconds after I made my credit card comment, the yuppies did it.  The dude in the linen blazer and plum-colored polo shirt goes, ""Well, you guys should just accept bitcoin to save on your transaction fees.""  He continued, talking to the scraggly Real Chili staffer with his neophyte understanding about that which he had clearly only recently learned.  I chimed in to invite him and the Real Chili dude to our weekly meetups every Thursday.  ""Milwaukee has one of those?!""

I have recently discovered this subreddit - it is great!  


Over the past 6 years or so I have been paying the minimum payments on my student loan, which must have been consolidated at the perfect time.  My interest rate is 1.875%.  I have ~$14K remaining.  I have never considered making more than minimum payments as I get the 1098-E form each year and assumed I was able to collect that interest back via my tax refund.  Am I completely off with that assumption?  


This past month my husband's student loans (Sallie Mae) have come due and they have much much higher rates.  (Some are subsidized, some unsubsidized and some are FFELP.  All ranging 3.4 - 6.8% - only giving these details, as you all seem to like the details)  :)


Can I assume that we will be getting a 1098-E Form from Sallie Mae to claim back the interest on these new loans on our taxes?  (But don't worry - we will be putting more than the minimum on these loans - avalanche style, as I have been reading all of your good advice.)

All of them denied me because of a lack of credit history (duh) and I would need a cosigner.

I also have an account NFCU so I decided I would apply for their credit card and if I got denied I would just start with a secured card.

So I applied and they requested proof of income, etc. To my surprise I was approved with a 14.75% interest rate and a $3,000 credit line.

This makes absolutely no sense to me. I have no credit history. And I've been denied by every single lender. And even if I got approved I would have expected a 20%+ interest and more like a $500 credit line.

So this leads me to believe this was a mistake as there's no logic as to why I was approved. Does anyone agree? Should I contact them and ask them to review everything once more?

Otherwise I just plan on using it to pay for groceries, gas, and other things I can afford to pay off each month. And I don't plan on using more than 20% of the credit line.",finance,1384035793

investing,"Here are my thoughts on QE in a story/metaphor format. Enjoy, share and critique.","Let me tell you a story that's a metaphor for what is happening. Then I will tell you what I think will happen after QE.
In 2009 I went to a real estate auction for some acreage to build my first home. It was a great time to buy real estate with the huge correction. At this auction, though, there were only three bidders, me, a foreign guy, and an anonymous third bidder. There were several spectating realtors, who probably couldn't sell the land, the land being part of a development project of a bankrupt developer. I had bottom dollar price, and was quickly out bid. It came down to this foreign guy and the anonymous bidder. The foreigner was with a young lady who, it seems, he didn't want to lose his pride to, so the bank kept bidding him up, wayyy up, well beyond it's actual market value at the time, and the foreigner kept going for it, surprisingly. The realtors couldn't believe how much it went for. I seemed to be the only sober one there, and asked the anonymous guy a couple question after, like why he kept bidding. He told me he was a member of the fucking bank that owned it, and not to tell anyone. It was artificial! I couldn't believe what just happen. The poor guy just got raped by the bank that owned the depressed land. The guy was stuck now with his overvalued asset. I saw this repeat a few other times at other auctions. Fortunately, I found a house where this nonsense wasn't happening (paid $40,000 minus a $4000 tax credit, which was way undervalued). I get it banks don't want to sell their property if it doesn't reach a certain price. But this was a deceitful and artificial way of doing it.
This is what's happening right now. The Feds (anonymous bidder) are bidding up and buying their own issued bonds at inflated artificial rates and the bond buyers (foreign guy) are still buying them, bidding against the Feds. We the American tax payers (the realtors) are giddy and complacent because we think everything is hunky-dory now, so we go back to business as usual and buy our own inflated shit off these artificial valuations, houses, bonds, stocks, especially all these growth stocks and small caps. Hence the re-inflated valuations of equities, bonds, and housing. Nothing has been fixed! The only jobs added have been minimum wage, so real income is not there to afford all the inflated home prices and rates on everything.
So let's remove the anonymous third buyer, the Feds, and see what happens. You now have real price discovery, and it's going to be much much lower, scary lower. Everything will deflate again and probably overcorrect to the low side, and there will then be normal pricing over time but much lower than where we are now, hopefully not as low as the 2008 crash.
Thus, you may ask, why not just keep this artificial, 'incognito' bidder in there, the Feds? Over time values are going to erode anyway, and inflation will rear it's ugly head, and the foreigners will start to see they're being duped.
Taper needs to happen whether we like it or not. When it does, it won't be pretty. Thus, hedge against it with cash, gold and short selling. Wait for the correction and then buy.",finance,1384031913

However, they also added a couple of other Vanguard index funds, including:

* Total Bond Market Index Fund, VBTIX, expense ratio: 0.07%

Bitcoin,I have figured out what is wrong with Bitcoin.,"The problem is there needs to be inflationary control.  To fix that I propose we introduce inherent interest to Bitcoin. The original Bitcoin should be renamed to BitAlpha and Bitcoin's value should be set based on a consensus of amount of BitAlphas and interest rate to grow from there.  This would be re-evaluated periodically and the goal of the community would be to keep the worth of one bitcoin to around the worth of common goods like coffee. This enables the sellers to set stable prices for goods and services. And this also does away with the 0.00000001BTC readability problem or the mBTC, uBTC confusion.
Full disclosure: I own only .03BTC but I think digital currency is the future of money.

To emphasize the problem consider the scenario:  I walk up to buy a car in bitcoins, I know this new car should cost about four months pay.  But the car dealer has set the price at 100btc.

Bitcoin,A Scary Bitcoin Future - Solutions?,"Here is something that could be the future of the US banking system, if the US was to be a bitcoin based economy.   The US essentially has to build their own rules ontop of the bitcoin protocol, this is how it would be done (this actual works BTW)

Step 1) The US Government would wait until Bitcoin 1.0 software is release with multi-signature transactions.  Currently, just 1 private key will move bitcoin around the world, but with multi-signature transactions, you need any 2 of 3 private keys.  This is important to understand so if your reading this, make sure you understand it.

Step 2) The US Government then works with banks to implement the multi-signature transactions into the current banking system.   To create a series of signatures, a bitcoin holder would go into a bank and request a new bitcoin account.    The bank would keep one private key, and would send one the a US Government office(perhaps the federal reserve).   The account opener gets the third key

Step 3) When the account holder wants to spend money, the system uses the banks private key and the account holders private key.    This is no different than how checks work today.

Step 4) Nobody that receives bitcoins would be allowed to receive them into account that wasn't registered with the banking system

Step 5) If an account holder lost their private key, they would have to contact the government for a replacement, or a new account

Step 5a)  If a bank was compromised or robbed, the account holder would work the the government to replace the third private key.

Step 5b) If the account holder didn't pay his taxes, the bank and the government can move your money

Step 6) If the system recognized an input that wasn't part of the system, they would either hold it or just plain reject it.   This would be done at the banking level.  Again, the banks/gov hold the power to send and receive the account holders money, because they have 1 of the 3 private keys.

Step 7) If a account holder needed to take a transaction from an account not registered with the system, they would need to prove what it was, where it came from, and even pay a tax on it (or something).

Step 8) When the government needs more money in this case, they contact banks and take your money via a bail in.

Step 9) When the government needs to fund a war, they just take whatever money it needs.
__________________
Again, anybody receiving bitcoins has to register 3 keys with your local bank
Anybody spending bitcoins has to register 3 keys with your local bank.
Using an account not registered with a bank would be illegal, but 100% possible.

Now we all know we can bypass the system.   I can generate my own keys, and spend money outside this system.   There is no way they can stop this, but they can make it illegal to do.   It would be similar to buying drugs.  Because the blockchain is public information, the IRS would know if you sent money from your registered account to an un-registered account.  They would also know if you received money from an unregistered account with your registered account.    Registered accounts could not use mixing services because they would be un-registered accounts.

The only want to stay out of the system would be unregistered accounts to unregistered accounts.  The only way to get money into an unregistered account would be to mine it, or have it exist before the registration.
________
Sender - "" do you take outside transactions""
Receiver - ""yes, yes I do"" or ""no thats illegal i'm calling the cops and getting a reward""
________
The above system works, it allows the Government and banks to maintain control, but they can no longer simply print money.  

I will say though for myself, If they do implement the above in 10 years, bitcoin would be HUGE and i'd move to a more bitcoin friendly country.
___________
To implement this would be similar to Obamacare.   The US would pass a banking law, opening a new government office.   Banks would have a deadline to implement their system with the Governments.    Bitcoin holders would have a 1 year grace period to integrate their bitcoin, perhaps a 1 year period where unregistered bitcoin was taxed 20%, and another one year period where unregistered bitcoin was taxed at 40%, etc etc..

Its truly a scary system, and if implemented on a world wide scale, would be crushing.   Bitcoin would still be better than the current system, but it would lose most of its benefits.

When writing a press release try to think, ""what makes a great story?"". Think of headlines that are re printable.

""People now making a fortune on bitcoin backup plan""

Or 

""Homeless people getting fed with crypto-currencies"" And then go on about bitcoin and litecoin at seans outpost.

It is fine to talk about both bitcoin and litecoin but I would stay away from other alts.

Most Journalists take press releases and just re print them because they are lazy so write one that is ready to go. If you need tips on writing press releases please google it. If you find good tips then please post here and help others out.

As you can see I'm a shocking speller and thats why I haven't written a press release.


**Here are some points you could mention in a press release to the media**

* The creator of Litecoin Charlie Lee the brother of Bobby Lee the CEO of the biggest bitcoin exchange in the world, https://vip.btcchina.com

* Diversifying into another blockchain is a great way to diversify your risk that in the unlikely event something will happen to the bitcoin blockchain.

* The litecoins founder Charley Lee is not anonymous, is an ex google employee now working at one of the biggest bitcoin companies coinbase which might incorporate litecoin in the future.

* Confirmation times are faster (yes that means you need more confirmations but for small transactions which don't need much trust but convenience this is great.)
litecoin is backed by a different hashing algorithm than bitcoin which makes is harder to 51% than other altcoins because asic's cant just be pointed at it.

* Trading between blockchains is harder to trace making it more anonymous than just using bitcoin

* Get LTC while it is still so cheap and make a profit as it grows being an early adopter is a great way to reap rewards.

* Trading between crypto currencies is fast and a great way to arbitrage the price differences on different exchanges

* Trading between crypto currencies is not regulated by FINCEN and so allot of people that never want to have their crypto currency touch FIAT currency again would like to trade between crypto currencies.

* Litecoin is the oldest, longest running and most trusted altcoin.

* hundreds of thousands of people hold litecoin and would like to spend them at your store.

* Litecoin has been allot more stable than bitcoin making it easy to accept at your store as crypto currency without going through a payment processor. ""ok not lately but the last 6 months where nice""

* Businesses that accept litecoin will be getting allot of free press as they will be mentioned in news articles that talk about the rise of litecoin. (This is more if you are contacting business to get them to accept litecoin but yeah""

* It does no harm to accept litecoin as you will only make your market larger if you do. There are millions of litecoin out there ready to be spent so accepting them can only be a good thing for your business.

* Litecoin is being developed by a lot of amazing developers and also have the bitcoin developers by proxy and it is based on the bitcoin protocol.


* Instant world wide transfer of wealth that can be anonymous if needed.

* Available on mac,PC,android and Linux

* Litecoin is a great investment opportunity because it can double in value very easily. While bitcoin has to go to almost $700 to double your investment litecoin only has to go to $8
here is a good post on why litecoin is way undervalued http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bpml0/litecoin_4x_undervalued_at_4/
I think that anyone that buys litecoin bellow $50 is going to be very wealthy in a few years. 

* It is important that bitcoin has competition. Even a decentralised currency needs competition with another decentralised currency.

* Less fraud, litecoin payments are a great way to stop fraud. if you accept Paypal or credit cards you open your business up to stolen credit cards or Paypal accounts buying from you and then the funds being reversed by CC companies or paypal. 

* https://kojn-app.com/ Please let me know if there is another is a great way for your business to accept litecoin without opening your self up to the risk of price fluctuations as they convert the litecoin to FIAT at time of purchase.

* if you have a shopping cart http://litecoinsblog.com/free-litecoin-payment-processor-for-opencart/

investing,Understanding Long vs. Short Capital Gains,"Hey guys,

I have a quick question for you.

Scenario:


1. I recently got into a stock that has brought me quite the return. I'm currently up $30,000 and am looking to be up somewhere in the $40-$50k range if everything pans out. 

2. I have owned this stock for 2 months

3. I am leaving to go travel for a long time, so next year my income will be next to nothing (maybe 10-15k if I start working near the end of the next year

I expect this stock to be volatile as it is pending a merger (American Airlines if anyone is wondering!). My plan is to sell half of it IF the merger comes through and hold the other half. But my dad seems to think I'd be better off waiting until January to sell the first half. Reason being that I should be in a lower tax bracket. I made $45k this year in salary through October. 

Question:
1. Financially am I better off holding until January? Or are the brackets negligible to what I could lose should the pps post merger?

2. Capital gains are taxed federally, but do I also have to pay the normal state tax, social security, and other taxes typically associated with income if it's a short term gain? 

*Edit
I appreciate the insight guys I really do. The merger is set to go through now that the Justice Department settled. I'm going to hold until at least January 2014. I will try to hold longer unless I see the stock going down. Thanks again!

personalfinance,"High(er)-income, low-expenses. Advice needed!","I have been doing research on here as well as other sites for quite a while, but would like some personal feedback. Here is the current situation. I am in the military (reserve) and deployed overseas. I am in my early-mid twenties right now my only expense is a car payment of ~$350/month. I do not spend frivolously and save ~98% of my income while here. I am looking to capitalize on this situation where my income is maximized due to my housing/food/other expenses all taken care of while I am earning more than I would working back home. As of now, I have been putting a fixed amount from my checking/direct deposit into a high interest (0.90%) savings account that I do not touch. I have accumulated roughly $10k to this point, and plan to have around $25k saved by the time I had back to the CONUS. My main questions are:

* I believe in order to maximize my money's potential, I should be investing it and not leaving it all in savings. I have no idea how much of the money I should invest however? If I do invest, I plan on putting it into indexes/ETFs/mutual funds (specifically looking at a couple Vanguard funds ATM). I have looked at CD's but they don't seem feasible for the amount I would be investing. 

* My car is financed through the dealer/manufacturer at a high rate (right around 10%, I know. Don't even say it.) It is currently at a 6% rate while I am deployed. Should I wait until I come home to refinance?  When I do refinance, should I pay off some principal beforehand to get a better rate/actually be able to refinance in the first place? I am looking to refinance with PenFed or USAA.

* Is there anything else I should be doing to make the most of this opportunity where I can save/invest around 95% of my income? I have one credit card through USAA that I spend &lt;$200/mo with and have automatic payments set up. It is my only card and I have always paid it on time. Besides this, I have a student loan (deferred) of ~$3-5k,  and my car loan.

financial,Grant taken away from previous tax year financial question.,"I received a $200.00 SEOG grant for my fall 2012 semester and $200.00 SEOG grant for my spring 2013 semester. I signed up for classes this fall 2013 with no problems with my grants. However I received a letter in the mail from my college stating I owe back pay for previous semesters, because of this I am unable to sign up for mu spring classes. When I spoke to the financial aid office they stated because of federal and state cuts in the budget it affected SEOG grants. I was one of the people they took money away from so I am obligated to pay the $400.00 in order to sign up for spring classes.
My questions are these. First and foremost fall of 2012 would be on the previous tax year would it not? This would have affected my filings for 2012, in addition to this, they recently just made these cuts so why would they take the already distributed grant from the previous tax year? Second- how are they able to take grants back after they've been distributed in the first place??

personalfinance,Question about Roth IRA with no income,"Ok, so I'm in a very unusual position. I earn about $45 000 working as a researcher at a university. Because of some tax-dodging shenanigans that my university engages in, I pay $0 income tax. I know that that is crazy, but I did a lot of running around and worrying about this last year and it turns out that it's legit. My university has classed me as a ""trainee"" and uses a special type of funding to pay my salary. As a consequence of these maneuvers, my W2 says I have $0 income. For some reason, I still need to pay state and city tax. This is really counter intuitive for me. I either have income, or I don't.  

I filed a federal tax return last year that reflected that and kept waiting to get a letter from the IRS calling me on this, but it never happened. Literally all of my colleagues sitting around me day-to-day are in the same boat and consider it a perk of this particular job. So I've taken some of the money that I had sitting around and dumped it into a Roth IRA. 


My question is this: I just read that you can only open an IRA with income earned. Since I have $0 declared federal income...Can I still open the IRA or does it have to be in a taxable account instead?


EDIT: So one of my law-school friends asked a tax-law professor of his and other people in my position have talked to a CPA about this. I'm fairly confident that I won't get called out on this and am ready to pay up if I am. Maybe I could rephrase my question and get at some sort of answer: What if I wasn't working and had a bunch of savings? Would I be allowed to shift $5500/year of my savings into a Roth IRA, despite the fact that I don't have any federal income OR am I only allowed to do this if I have federal income that year?",finance,1384210953

There is literally no point to having my money in a TD savings account. The interest rate is 0.05% and not going anywhere. My plan was to just close my account and have them write me a check for the amount in the account (they can do that, right?) and then move my money to one of many online banks with a higher interest rate.

My partner and I plan on getting married this year and I have a few concerns about taxes and student loans. The majority of my student loans will have to start being repaid in December. I finished grad school last year and so my loan payments are going to be insane.

I currently make more than my partner, but not by much. I am worried, that by filing our taxes jointly, my loan payments through IBR will go up as the feds will be looking at both of our incomes. I have had friends tell me that it evens out because filing jointly will produce a larger refund. However, I'm just not sure it would be large enough to actually offset the larger loan payments. I am also not sure if I should immediately go to my HR and change my withholding on the w-4 to married from single for the rest of the calendar year.

personalfinance,A discussion about paying down your mortgage early,"So, I copy pasta a reply I put in another thread and made it its own thread because I wanted to toss out my thoughts and get input on paying down mortgages early from PF. 

Here are my thoughts of why paying down a 30 year note (at current rates) is not a great idea:

While there is certainly a ""peace of mind"" aspect to doing this, there are a few caveats, IMHO. As things stand now with rates so low, I am of the school of thought that you should keep that mortgage payment as low and for as long as possible. 

You are borrowing (in many cases) hundreds of thousands of dollars for a very long period of time at (currently) VERY low interest rates. You can put any extra money you have available to work in many other avenues than paying down a mortgage. 

Have a credit card balance? Pay that off first. You're ""earning"" the difference in interest you'd have to pay between your CC interest rate - your mortgage interest rate (also including tax write off) and putting your money to work smarter. This goes for any loan with a higher interest rate over your mortgage rate. 

Not maxing out your retirement plan or, at least, putting enough in for the match? Your money should go here. Compound interest and general market returns over time (~7% over 100 years or so) are higher than you're paying in mortgage interest. 

Saving for kids' college? Again, your mortgage rate is probably lower than you're gonna get for a student loan rate. 

Those are just a few, but I think they're the big ones. So many people get target lock on how much interest they're paying to the bank over 30 years (even as opposed to a 15 year), but it's (IMHO) a false reason to fear the longer term because it doesn't take into account the ""lost"" returns of not putting the extra money spent on a payment to work investing or paying down higher interest loans elsewhere. 

Anyway, any thoughts or input are appreciated. I hear this a lot and I am always curious if it is a common misconception, or if I am missing a bigger picture outside of the ""peace of mind aspect.""

Thanks for reading.",finance,1384182202
Bitcoin,That's not a Bitcoin bubble,"Bubbles are where some entity rapidly going up in price beyond what is reasonable and then collapsing.  However, not everything that goes up in value rapidly is a bubble.

When I see the charts of bitcoin priced in USD, I see a chart that looks just like a bubble about to burst.  However, if we invert the axes and look at USD priced in BTC, the true picture becomes clear.  BTC is not bubbling; the USD is collapsing.  In such a situation we would naturally expect for value to start flowing away from the USD and into whatever best currency is available.  

Additionally, in a bubble, the price of something goes up to a point where the supply is dramatically expanded beyond the need, so when demand is pulled away there is a price collapse.  For example, when home prices are crazy high, an excessive supply of homes gets built. When the artificially high demand is removed, the price fall is much more dramatic because of the excess supply.  This cannot happen with BTC as the supply is strictly limited.  

Paradoxically, bitcoin if used as a currency prevents the types of bubbles we normally see which are an obvious conclusion of artificially cheap money given out by a central bank.  Just my thoughts on monetary policy, and why I am here.",cryptocurrency,1384180623

Bitcoin,Could bitcoin be the catalyst that ends the manipulation of the gold and silver markets? Perhaps a year or two from now?,"People who regularly follow the precious metals markets understand it is highly likely (if not certain) that the Western central banks (the Fed, UK CB, ECB, &amp; others) in coordination with the Bank for International Settlements and the bullion banks (large multinational banks that maintain metals exchanges and custodian facilities) have been systematically suppressing the metals prices, for years, if not decades.  Why?  Because a fast rising gold price is like a canary in the coal mine or a blinking red light that indicates a major problem with the fiat currencies these banks issue.  The market manipulation mechanisms are fairly complex but the basic principal is to sell ""paper gold"" futures contracts in extremely high volumes at critical moments so that the bid just gets swamped with supply and the price collapses.  This is possible since the volume of paper being traded far outweighs the volume of physical gold being passed from seller to buyer.  To put it in perspective, over the past two years we have seen many occasions whereby in a few minutes time, paper metals sell orders are dumped onto the markets that represent a quantity of gold or silver equal to the entire global mine production for 1 month or 6 months or even more.  Obviously no rational seller is ever going to trade in that fashion.

Eastern central banks (mainly China but others as well) are very content to let this manipulation scheme persist.  They want to buy as much gold as they can, and artificially low prices are great for them.  On a gold per capita basis, Eastern central banks are still significantly behind their Western counterparts, though the gap is closing fast.  There is strong evidence for massive outflows of gold tonnage from the West into China.  

For more backround on metals manipulation see: the Gold Anti-trust Action Committee (www.gata.org); or Google search Max Keiser; Andrew Maguire, Alasdair Macleod, or Eric Sprott, among many other sources.

So, I am wondering, what happens if bitcoin continues to grow in value and popularity at the current rate and it breaks through major psychological levels like $1,000 and then the price of an ounce of gold, and then $10,000?  If I were an Eastern central banker I might start to get VERY nervous that my gold trove, which I have been carefully and silently building up, might get rendered obsolete by the new ""cryptographic gold"".  At that point what do I do?  Answer: whatever I need to do to unleash the price of precious metals to show the world that gold and silver are just as good if not better than bitcoin to store value and protect savings.  

At that point the Eastern central banks would have various tools at their disposal to get the price up to a free market level.  For starters, they could stand for physical delivery for huge quantities on the Comex or at the LBMA and force those markets into a flagrant, public default, which would bust the price wide open.  It would be a big win for precious metals and would not hurt bitcoin either.

I'm just thinking out loud here with a little ""game theory"" and feedback is appreciated.  Thanks",cryptocurrency,1384167693

I've been feeling bearish for a few weeks now, and hoping for some insight into if what I did was dumb or not.","So, for the past 2 years, I've had a very aggressive, securities-centered investment plan with my 401K. I am 31 years old, and plan to retire in 2045. We have a lot of options to choose from, and I specifically chose plans with aggressive growth strategies, and it's paid off quite well. I've seen an almost 30% across the board growth this year alone, and I'm feeling quite good about it.

However, lately I've come to understand that many economists believe that we are in a securities bubble, fueled by QE by the Fed, and that there is a feeling we may be in for a nasty surprise or at the very least a sharp correction.

Today I pulled about 80% of my assets out of securities and put them into super-boring, slow growth gov assets. Basically a plan designed to grow super-slow with almost zero risk.

I don't want to be short-sighted with my 401K, but I felt like locking in gains for a few months to reevaluate the market, specifically since my returns have been so good.

After the acquisition was complete I received a payment from those stocks of about $25k. They were subject to a disqualifying disposition, so I am expecting to pay federal and state taxes when I file for 2013.

The remaining unvested options were converted to ISOs under the same terms for the acquiring company. I will have about 20 shares of stock vest every month for the next 30 months. Currently the shares are valued at about $100 / share, and my strike is $20 / share, leaving a spread of $80/share ($1600 gain/month). 

I'm curious if this sort of gain ($3200 this year, $19k/yr for the next 2 years) will add enough to my AMT obligations, or if I can safely exercise and hold onto them for a year to benefit from the long-term capital gains taxes.

I've also been granted an additional $250k in RSUs which will vest over the next 4 years. I am expecting to just sell these immediately as they vest, so I'll just count these as ordinary income. Question about that though: Are RSUs also subject to FICA? I believe they are but I'm not positive.

gaming,I wrote an extensive player-review of CoD: Ghosts for anyone that would be interested in hearing about it firsthand. Enjoy!,"After much consideration on the topic and many, many rumors, I ended up hastily preordering Ghosts shortly before it released. Got it two days after release. Was excited once it arrived, and booted 'er up on PS3. ^**pre-TL;DR**--I ^wasn't ^disappointed. I'll continue to cover the rest of my experiences with it in this selfpost.

**Campaign** The campaign was overall enjoyable. Without trying to go into extreme detail due to spoilers, the storyline is not bad. It only is slightly unclear in the beginning what exactly the Federation [bad guy team] is fighting for, but it clears up as the game goes on. I played through the game start to finish on Veteran, and found it to be rather difficult at times. Not by mission, but by computer AI. Enemies shoot only at you it seems like, from all angles, take multiple bullets to kill, and your allies provide some help but not a lot. This is to be expected, nor is not a bad thing, it's better than showing no challenge. The campaign provides ample hours of play without needlessly dragging on, but that's not to say it couldn't be beaten in just two or three decent sittings. As far as the story itself goes, it is somewhat compelling and actually doesn't provide a large amount of unanswered holes. Also, the campaign brings in the one thing everyone was blabbing about--Riley the dog. The dog accompanies your player along a few of the missions. Not all of them by any means, but some. At times, Riley is also controllable instead of your player. I found it to be different yet fun to play from the dog's point of view, and hunting people down as him is fun as well. In the other missions involving him, you don't control him from first person, but he can be given command to attack someone down the battle area while you are controlling your main character. I never had the dog die on me, which is obviously a 'yeah, right' kind of deal, but he does get shot at occasionally. The campaign also spans over from South America to underwater to an ocean all the way to in orbit. This is a pleasant change of scenery from the traditional war fighting land, yet sometimes the unusual missions can prove the most difficult. And, also what many whined about, the ending is similar to the MW2 ending. Note that I used similar, not the same. It isn't the same. It's different in that [the main enemy doesn't die, and your main character is carried off with him, leaving your main NPC partner behind, also still alive. This implies that the game will have a direct sequel.] (/spoiler ""Story"")

**Multiplayer** I haven't logged extensive hours on Multiplayer, but I have logged a few. This is what I'e noticed so far: Connection Quality I have seen a relatively low amount of lag thus far. They seem to have made this game better about in-game playing quality, and that's with me judging upon it via shitty college Wi-Fi. As some have stated, this is no latency measure in the in-game score. This is a neutral change to me, as due to the seemingly lowered amount of overall lag. *TL;DR* I don't have a hard time playing multiplayer, even on a not-so-good internet connection. Maps As with previous games, the maps are based off of campaign stages [why I play through the end of the campaign before even playing multiplayer once]. This is not a bad thing. However, the maps this time around seem to be designed much more for CQC and random encounters rather than open-field combat. Also, many of the popular guns have integrated silencers, meaning that silencer use seems to be much more frequent than before. It adds a level of difficultly which is noticed by players, as from my evaluations thus far, at least on PS3, many teams tend to travel in pairs or even groups of 3 in many game modes. Few people travel alone due to the high possibility of being ambushed from behind multiple times throughout a typical game.

**Weapons**
IW did a really good job this game making the guns fairly powered all around. There doesn't seem to be one superior weapon; however, there is one class I've seen at a disadvantage: Marksman rifles. For those who do not know, this is a class between Assault and Sniper rifles that consists of semi-auto rifles like the Mk14 EBR [sound familiar?]. These guns, sadly, seem to be powered okay, but are extremely difficult to use against the bulk of players. They tend not to kill very frequently due to difficulty in aiming, and lack of damage at times. Sniper rifles, on the other hand, are extremely powerful in this game. They feel they are one-hit-kill at nearly any distance or spot on the body. This is clearly shown when snipers engage someone in CQC--they often just hip fire it, and no matter where it hits the other person, it drops them.

**Accessories**

*Perks*: lots of perks to choose from. These require unlocking by level, however, which the weapons no longer do. Patience is required with these, although the starting perks are also useful.

*Attachments*: Many of the guns have multiple attachments that allow the player to use exactly what they wanna use. They also made some changes to attachments, like the Thermal Scope. It is very useful in this game, but it for example, is a modified Hybrid Scope. It is a combination thermal/Red Dot-looking-Sight for closer range. This makes the Thermal Scope usable at all ranges, thus making it feel much more reliable for long-range-thermal fans like myself.

*Unlocking System*: The unlock system for the most part is based solely on what are called ""Squad Points"". These are earned by raising levels, and generally you receive more than one point per level. These points are used to purchase new unlocks. This system is okay, doesn't seem to show flaws of major discontent, but it may lead to difficulty trying new things out later in the game when it takes longer to raise levels.

**Squads and Extinction**
Sadly, *I cannot rate on either of these modes at this time*. I don't have enough experience with them to give a fair rating at this time. This may come at a later date. I have played very little with Squads and don't understand everything about it yet. I've only seen others play Extinction, and I get the idea behind it, but have not fully experienced it myself.

**Overall Experience...Thus far**
Honestly, I like the game overall. It has been fun to play. The campaign was by all means playable without being really boring. As long as you don't have unrealistic expectations about it, it should be a playable game for many people. The multiplayer feels more difficult this time around, but still can be compelling to play once you start to learn the maps and learn to get around. Also, find a gun you like as early as possible. Dillydallying behind and questioning can have serious effects on y our stats, if they are important to you. I would know this firsthand; I tried really hard to get the Mk14 to work for me, but just couldn't do it. However, I have found solace in the Honey Badger assault rifle...for now.
Like I said in the title, I was leery about getting it. I had strongly considered purchasing Battlefield 4 instead [as I am a fan of both CoD and BF], but I stuck it out for Ghosts. I can truly say I do not regret my decision. Thank you for taking to time to actually read this far down. 7,000 characters later, you are definitely a trooper. And I appreciate that. You're awesome.

gaming,Here is an extremely long review of CoD: Ghosts.,"I hastily preordered Ghosts shortly before it released. Got it two days after release. Was excited once it arrived, and booted 'er up on PS3. I'll continue to cover the rest of my experiences with it in this selfpost.

**Campaign** The campaign was overall enjoyable. Without trying to go into extreme detail due to spoilers, the storyline is not bad. It only is slightly unclear in the beginning what exactly the Federation [bad guy team] is fighting for, but it clears up as the game goes on. I played through the game start to finish on Veteran, and found it to be rather difficult at times. Not by mission, but by computer AI. Enemies shoot only at you it seems like, from all angles, take multiple bullets to kill, and your allies provide some help but not a lot. This is to be expected, nor is not a bad thing, it's better than showing no challenge. The campaign provides ample hours of play without needlessly dragging on, but that's not to say it couldn't be beaten in just two or three decent sittings. As far as the story itself goes, it is somewhat compelling and actually doesn't provide a large amount of unanswered holes. Also, the campaign brings in the one thing everyone was blabbing about--Riley the dog. The dog accompanies your player along a few of the missions. Not all of them by any means, but some. At times, Riley is also controllable instead of your player. I found it to be different yet fun to play from the dog's point of view, and hunting people down as him is fun as well. In the other missions involving him, you don't control him from first person, but he can be given command to attack someone down the battle area while you are controlling your main character. I never had the dog die on me, which is obviously a 'yeah, right' kind of deal, but he does get shot at occasionally. The campaign also spans over from South America to underwater to an ocean all the way to in orbit. This is a pleasant change of scenery from the traditional war fighting land, yet sometimes the unusual missions can prove the most difficult. And, also what many whined about, the ending is similar to the MW2 ending. Note that I used similar, not the same. It isn't the same. It's different in that the main enemy doesn't die, and your main character is carried off with him, leaving your main NPC partner behind, also still alive. This implies that the game will have a direct sequel.

**Multiplayer** I haven't logged extensive hours on Multiplayer, but I have logged a few. This is what I'e noticed so far: Connection Quality I have seen a relatively low amount of lag thus far. They seem to have made this game better about in-game playing quality, and that's with me judging upon it via shitty college Wi-Fi. As some have stated, this is no latency measure in the in-game score. This is a neutral change to me, as due to the seemingly lowered amount of overall lag. TL;DR I don't have a hard time playing multiplayer, even on a not-so-good internet connection. Maps As with previous games, the maps are based off of campaign stages [why I play through the end of the campaign before even playing multiplayer once]. This is not a bad thing. However, the maps this time around seem to be designed much more for CQC and random encounters rather than open-field combat. Also, many of the popular guns have integrated silencers, meaning that silencer use seems to be much more frequent than before. It adds a level of difficultly which is noticed by players, as from my evaluations thus far, at least on PS3, many teams tend to travel in pairs or even groups of 3 in many game modes. Few people travel alone due to the high possibility of being ambushed from behind multiple times throughout a typical game.

**Weapons** IW did a really good job this game making the guns fairly powered all around. There doesn't seem to be one superior weapon; however, there is one class I've seen at a disadvantage: Marksman rifles. For those who do not know, this is a class between Assault and Sniper rifles that consists of semi-auto rifles like the Mk14 EBR [sound familiar?]. These guns, sadly, seem to be powered okay, but are extremely difficult to use against the bulk of players. They tend not to kill very frequently due to difficulty in aiming, and lack of damage at times. Sniper rifles, on the other hand, are extremely powerful in this game. They feel they are one-hit-kill at nearly any distance or spot on the body. This is clearly shown when snipers engage someone in CQC--they often just hip fire it, and no matter where it hits the other person, it drops them.

**Accessories**

*Perks*: lots of perks to choose from. These require unlocking by level, however, which the weapons no longer due. Patience is required with these, although the starting perks are also useful.

*Attachments*: Many of the guns have multiple attachments that allow the player to use exactly what they wanna use. They also made some changes to attachments, like the Thermal Scope. It is very useful in this game, but it for example, is a modified Hybrid Scope. It is a combination thermal/Red Dot-looking-Sight for closer range. This makes the Thermal Scope usable at all ranges, thus making it feel much more reliable for long-range-thermal fans like myself.

*Unlocking System*: The unlock system for the most part is based solely on what are called ""Squad Points"". These are earned by raising levels, and generally you receive more than one point per level. These points are used to purchase new unlocks. This system is okay, doesn't seem to show flaws of major discontent, but it may lead to difficulty trying new things out later in the game when it takes longer to raise levels.

**Squads and Extinction** Sadly, I cannot rate on either of these modes at this time. I don't have enough experience with them to give a fair rating at this time. This may come at a later date. I have played very little with Squads and don't understand everything about it yet. I've only seen others play Extinction, and I get the idea behind it, but have not fully experienced it myself.

**Overall Experience...Thus far** Honestly, I like the game overall. It has been fun to play. The campaign was by all means playable without being really boring. As long as you don't have unrealistic expectations about it, it should be a playable game for many people. The multiplayer feels more difficult this time around, but still can be compelling to play once you start to learn the maps and learn to get around. Also, find a gun you like as early as possible. Dillydallying behind and questioning can have serious effects on y our stats, if they are important to you. I would know this firsthand; I tried really hard to get the Mk14 to work for me, but just couldn't do it. However, I have found solace in the Honey Badger assault rifle...for now.

He will be 59.5 in about four years and by that time it will be valued in the hundreds of thousands. My question is what is the best (most tax efficient) way for him to give us this money?

I was considering him transferring us money at the federal exclusion limit each year. However, I have been reading online that ANY withdrawals from a Traditional IRA are taxed at your income level, so even withdrawing multiples of $14k to give to us will be taxed.

Would transferring at the exclusion limit still be beneficial in the sense that my brother and I would not have to pay taxes on that amount each year? Would him transferring us shares of his IRA directly avoid taxes? What is the best course of action? Thanks!",finance,1384276337

I do have a corresponding debt, and it would explain said debt's sudden disappearance (the original debtor wasn't forthcoming, and the issue was promptly superseded by finding food and shelter), but as I'm currently unemployed, paying it all in one go isn't really an option. The letters have been coming for about six months, and by now are understandably a bit miffed, so I'm not sure how open they'd be to a lenient payment plan.

The earlier letters do state that there is a 30 day period after receiving the notice to request verification, which I would like to do, but I'm not sure if the legal definition of receipt was met when the letter arrived, or when I got my hands on it. Everything more or less checks out, but I'd like to be certain.

It's really a shame I didn't get these in time, because they seem polite enough, if pushy. The original debt was unofficially handled by letting me send whatever spare cash I could scrounge along, but as that was around 10 bucks a month, I doubt it'll work in this case.

I'm going to put about $7k down for consideration (to solve immediate needs for the seller), and offer them a fixed interest rate for the remainder balance, amortized at 40 years with a balloon at 10 years. We've agreed to those terms, we just need to sort out the interest rate.

I want to remain competitive so they feel like they aren't losing an opportunity by offering a rate close to what is expected of Vanguard, except a little lower as there is more security by financing the property to me than putting all that in stocks.

I am in 23 yr old in year 2 of 4 of Pharmacy school and have been racking up debt (70K thus far). I have been taking enough loan money out to feel comfortable just in case shit hits the fan but otherwise I live very cheap and also work as much as possible. 

My problem currently is that I have about 30K just sitting in my bank account. I have to get a new car soon (mine is old and I have a fear of it dying any day) so I am going to finally buy a decent car(tired of buying cheap/shitty cars every 2 years) outright that will last (10-15K).  Should I pay down my current loans with the rest of the money I have saved up?

Loans are currently as thus, Stafford loan pays my tuition (30K/yr) at 5.4%, and Grad Plus is for living expenses (up to 20k/yr) at 6.4%. Last year these interest rates were 6.4% and 7.9% respectively and have a chance at going up or down next year. Should I go ahead and accept my Grad Plus loan for the spring (10K) even if I don't need the money now, so I don't risk getting a higher interest rate next year or should I just wait and get what I get? Should I take my Grad Plus loan from this coming spring and pay off last years Grad Plus loan that in incurring the 7.9% interest rate? 

So basically, I have a bit of money saved up and quite a bit of debt, but I also HAVE to buy a car. I want to know what to do with the rest of my money I have saved and what to do with my future loan money. As in should I take on more loans and hold on to the money for security or should I only accept the bare minimum I need to survive. 

Sorry this is so long! Thank you for any and all advice!

Bitcoin,Help me answer questions from a skeptical friend?,"Hey everyone,

I recently invested a relatively small sum of money (right around Silk Road shutdown) in Bitcoin after originally dismissing it 2 years ago. I am now pretty convinced that this is gonna take off and am happy about that.

However, I have a few skeptical friends that basically laughed at me buying virtual currency, and after much debate, they have come up with a few points that I’m having trouble arguing against, and need some help, because I’m rather new at understanding this as it is. Here are the points I kept hearing, summarized for clarity.


1. It’s treated like a stock against USD – people are so concerned about how much money that they are worth that they tend to forget that that this is supposed to be a competitor to the dollar. Theoretically, if the price of bitcoin shoots to $1000, couldn’t that just mean the dollar itself is way down? Another thing – most people still consider the dollar to be safe and it’s sortof a baseline that everyone understands. Let’s say a guy invested $10 dollars years ago and now has $1 million. He would have to REALLY, REALLY believe in the idea of bitcoin to not withdraw his money and not instantly become a millionaire. Otherwise, there is always that chance it could disappear because of forces beyond his control.

2. At least for now, it makes sense why stores would accept it, but doesn’t make sense why people should spend it. If we are “just getting started” in terms of the value, why should anyone spend it? The correct move is to hoard it. A business that accepts $50 in bitcoins for a product suddenly has $51 the next day. [NOTE FROM OP: this is probably more of a short term problem]. Here’s a [source](http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2013/11/11/bitcoin_true_believers_don_t_spend_your_bitcoins.html) on that I was sent.

3. It’s so overinflated that it’s gonna be hard to use – think of it this way - if BTC stabilizes at let’s say, $10,000, it’s going to be impossible to understand how much something costs without converting it back to a currency you understand (dollars). For example, if bitcoin prices go through the roof, and you try to buy a candy bar, you’d have to pay, say, 0.00001035 BTC. What the hell does that mean? That number is so cumbersome. It’s like learning Spanish by translating everything back to English. You’re supposed to read and understand the Spanish without having to translate, and it’s gonna take generations for people to understand what 0.00001035 BTC means. The decimals are way too shifted, and no other currency is like that.

4. The time for people to get mega rich has already passed anyway – The earliest adopters have been rewarded, but a money system like this won’t allow more people to become millionaires like they have. It’s possible to do double or triple, but the time to turn $25 into a million has passed. Ironically, the more popular it is (making original adopters richer), the less of a return you will get by jumping in later. If everyone on Earth had bitcoins, a rise in the value makes nobody wealthier, because everyone still has the same amount of bitcoins relative to everyone else. Same thing happens with the dollar now. If dollars become worth less, prices of goods go up to compensate.

5. Even if this got huge, the Feds are not going to ignore it – Yes, it may be true that you can’t shut down the network, or seize them or whatever. But the second that bitcoin becomes a real threat against the dollar, you’d be a fool to think that the Federal Reserve and credit card companies are gonna just accept that it’s the new thing and lie down. Even if that means legislating it till it’s worthless. (If bitcoins are made illegal in a time when major retailers started to accept them, is Amazon really gonna risk going out of business to defend bitcoin when only a small percentage of shoppers use them?)

Those are the biggest ones, other than the more common one about the fact that it is a bubble. I don’t know what to say when these points come up. Any help is appreciated because I really want to believe in this. Thanks!",cryptocurrency,1384385615

Direct loan calculation site tells me I will get an approx. consolidated rate of 5.3%. I don't qualify for loan forgiveness even though I am a social worker, as I make too much money (before you stop feeling any sorrow for me, please keep in mind that I also owe over $26,000 to Alaska student loans, which are private, and require $350/ month payments). 

My strategy had been previously to throw all my extra income at my high interest loans to pay them off first. I managed to pay off 10G of high interest Alaska loans, but to be honest, I burned out after a year of working two jobs. I work one now, and don't have a lot of extra to put toward those high interest loans. I feel frustrated and stuck, as my overall goal is to pay them off as quickly and efficiently as possible.

personalfinance,New home owner looking for options to get rid of a little CC debt.,"My wife and I just closed on our first home, the final house being built in a new development. Because real estate is bonkers, the house ended up appraising for $35,000 more than the price we agreed to. On the downside, we ended up getting our interest rate locked in during August, when rates were at a relative high point. We're not super disappointed about this, but we could've knocked off a good 50 basis points off the rate. 

Anyhow, we have about $10k in credit card debt at between 9% and 14%. I'm curious if there's a way that I can leverage our situation to get that paid off. Anyone have any good ideas?",finance,1384379505

Bitcoin businesses already exist legally in the United States, with Bitcoin as it is: a digital cash with real fungibility, so I can't imagine why you would set out to create software that would give the US government the idea of changing its mind and mandating that exchanges use these white/black lists that ruin that fungibility.
This white/blacklisting convention, if widely accepted, would create different tiers of bitcoin, each of different value. It would encourage users to download software that can distinguish between the different tiers, so that they can receive payment in the good bitcoins and avoid the bad ones.
If a government starts mandating that exchanges use a list that it controls, and users download and start using clients that check against this list, Bitcoin would no longer be decentralized.

Hopefully there will be clients that Rational People can recommned to our friends that warn them off the merchant telling them that such a transaction will devalue their remaining Bitcoin savings and future earnings.
That takes care of the merchants and customers. The next attack will be taking over the hash rate. Perhaps there could be some safeguards put in place that the current miners would be wise to deploy to avoid to sudden a change in network configuration or force noob limits until they had been fully verified as non-govenmental or non filtering miners?

personalfinance,Pay down student loan debt or contribute to no match 401(k)?,"I'm 28 and married. I make $210,000 per year (plus a bonus ranging anywhere from $15,000 to $25,000) while my wife makes $50,000. 

We have a total of $225,000 in student loan debt (3/4th of that is mine). The loans are a mixture of federal and private, with the average interest rate across all loans being 5.25%. We are about to buy our first home, mortgage is $320,000 after putting 20% down. Rate is under 4%. We have two car payments each month, but the interest rates on those are at 0.9%. 

No substantial emergency fund after the house downpayment, but it will be back to 3 months in January when I receive my bonus. My wife contributes 3.5% of her income to her company's 401(k) in order to get the full match. I contribute nothing because my employer does not match anything and had been focused on paying down student loans (have paid $40,000 off mine in 2.75 years) and saving for the house. 

Anyway, the big question is whether I should begin contributing to my 401(k) plan (I would contribute the annual $17,500 max) or focus on paying down student more aggressively going forward? I understand the tax deferral benefits of the 401(k), but if my student loans are at 5.25% (with some as high as 7.75%), would it be better to pay those off first? But it also sucks that in order to do that, I have to take a huge tax hit on the $17,500 that I would otherwise be deferring the taxation on. Thanks! 

EDIT: Added a monthly budget to make it easier. 

Total net income after taxes per month: $14575

*mortgage and associated expenses (property tax, home insurance): $2400

*student loan repayment: $2850

*car payments and insurance: $1475

*all other bills: $500

*gas, food, miscellaneous expenses: $1500

Total remaining: $5850

If I were to max out my 401(k), it would be roughly $1450 per month, meaning I would have approximately $4400 left over per month in that case. In that case, I would probably put $2400 or potentially $3000 of that towards student loans (in addition to the $2850 I already pay monthly). But just wondering if that is the best use of money, or if having the extra $17,500 (more like $12,500 after taxes) to put towards student loans is better.",finance,1384374162
personalfinance,"Do Negative Items Actually Drop Off Your Credit Report in 7 Years? Plus, Your Critique on My Situation","I'm 32/F in the SF Bay Area with no kids and not married (live with BF). My salary has been 68K, but was just bumped to 75K, netting me $1900 per check, so approx. 4k per month. I just accepted a small ownership in the small business I've worked in for many years and will have significant profit sharing going forward, my projections are that it will be anywhere from 20K to 50K annually...and could be a lot more if I'm driven since I have a significant role in biz development.   

Just for advise reference, my monthly baseline rent + bills + groceries for a month to live is around $2300. 

On to my woes, I was really terrible with credit cards in college, got them all paid off years ago so I have no credit card debt currently. But my credit report was shot for several years due to my mistakes and I just ignored it since I always had plenty of cash and didn't have many reasons to acquire credit, in addition to not trusting myself with credit. The past few months I've been paying for creditrepair.com ($89 a month, high, but so far they've removed 6 negative items!) to help fix some of this stuff.

Two years ago I got a Orchard Credit Card with a $300 limit and I've only used it for one small recurring charge as a small attempt to start fixing my credit.  Around the same time my shitty college car that I'd driven for 10 years was dead and I need a car for work and was moving even further from work, so it was go time. I was really nervous about getting a car loan and so I kind of took what I could get. My loan is at 6.7% with Wells Fargo, which I feel is too high. The best thing I could think of was just to pay a higher amount each month (payment is set at $260, I pay $350).  

So my first question -- my auto loan balance is around $11,000 right now. Should I try to re-finance? My bf suggested I just up my payment even more...but I'm not sure I want do that.

Regarding my student loan, I've paid the bare minimum on this for years ($150 per month). Now that I'm finally caring about my finances I realize that my loan is at 2.3%, I always thought it was lower (oops). My loan balance is $7265.  Should I pay more each month? Try to re-finance? They are a mixture of 4 subsidized Direct and 1 unsubsidized (but all with same interest rate). I graduated college 10 years ago and always heard this was ""good"" debt, but paying interest for so long seems stupid now. 

The other stupid thing I did in my youth was that I had a credit union in my college town and then moved to California. I was able to do some shared branching, but it got to be annoying so I switched to a bank here without closing out the other account and I ended up overdrafting on that CU account. I paid it back, I forget the timeframe, but it was within a few months of it happening. They never took it to a collections agency, but they list this as a charge-off on my credit report anyway, even though it was their in-house ""collections"". Two things:  

1. it happened in 2007, so next summer it will be 7 years that it happened.  
2. even though the CU sent me a letter saying they won't be removing anything, whatever creditrepair.com did, Transunion did remove it from my report in good faith, I guess, and the other 2 credit bureaus are pending. So, should I put any energy towards this more than I already am via Creditrepair.com? Because I was so afraid of my credit report, I hadn't looked at it closely enough in the past to even realize it was there, but now I know it's there I'm pretty ticked (though I totally recognize how stupid I was to let that happen).   

My credit score right now is 690. It was at 653 when I started with the creditrepair.com people, so that seems like good improvement. I was also just approved for the Costco American Express with a 5K credit limit which surprised the hell out of me.  

Reading over this, I realize that one piece of advice I might get is to use my new profit-sharing to pay off some of these debts...it is an option, but we likely won't do our draws until the end of the year (2014) and my instinct was to take most of this money and put it in my SEP-IRA for the tax benefits, etc.

TL~DR should I try to re-finance my auto and student loans? Will the inquiries hurt my credit score that is only just starting to improve? If the requests go nowhere, will a 7 year-old negative item from a credit union actually be removed?",finance,1384367763

There's a real question as to whether the massive bond-buying program known as quantitative easing was worth the cost, former Federal Reserve official Andrew Huszar said Tuesday.

""My argument is not that QE was not at all useful,"" he said on CNBC's ""Fast Money.""

""I believe that at the time, it was just one more tool that the Fed introduced to try to help the economy,"" he said. ""My point, ultimately, is the idea that very quickly into QE, it started becoming obvious that it wasn't working in the way that it was supposed to.""

Huszar, a senior fellow at Rutgers Business School and a former managing director at Morgan Stanley, noted a few of the program's unintended effects.

**""I can only say: I'm sorry, America,"" he wrote.** ""The central bank continues to spin QE as a tool for helping Main Street. But I've come to recognize the program for what it really is: the greatest backdoor Wall Street bailout of all time.""

Huszar told ""Fast Money"" that the bond-buying program, which was supposed to increase credit availability to consumers and businesses, didn't do so.

investing,Protecting capital in a bear market,"I'm just interested in other peoples views on the best way to protect your investments in a bear market. The history of the stock market has gone through many cycles of boom and bust, with some being more severe than others. I know no-one can accurately predict when the next bear cycle will begin, but there are obviously ways you can minimise your losses during these periods. I just came across the following book: [Code Red: How to Protect Your Savings from the Coming Crisis](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Red-Protect-Savings-Coming/dp/1118783727). 

From the [Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2013/11/13/armageddon-playbook/) on the book: 
&gt; The book finishes with the most important chapters on how to protect yourself. The authors preach diversification as a central portfolio strategy and give rules of thumb for selecting stocks for the long run. Despite their dour short-term outlook, they are bullish on America, seeing a new secular bull market after the dust settles.
&gt; 
&gt; Curiously, the authors never seriously contemplate the possibility that maybe, just maybe, Code Red policies will never be repealed. Interest rates will continue to be kept below the inflation rate, and inflation will be allowed to run well beyond a 2% target rate–all because it’s good for the government and good for the banks. Taxpayers, pensioners and savers, go fish.

And, in relation to the authors recommendations:

&gt; Given the uncertainties we face, investors should consider trailing stop-loss orders on equity investments and maintain up to a 10% cash balance for buying a bearish index ETF to hedge long stock positions when a market correction looks imminent.
&gt; 
&gt; ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 (SH) provides daily bearish exposure to the S&amp;P 500, and ProShares UltraShort S&amp;P 500 (SDS) moves double in the opposite direction of the daily change in the index. Leveraged inverse ETFs are risky and not for long-term holders, but they give you protection while you rebalance your portfolio.

Would it be wise to follow such an approach when there are signs of a turnaround in the current market? What kind of strategies do you follow?",finance,1384457864
personalfinance,"22, newly married, andready to start retirement investing - does this look like a good start?","Hello PF. My wife and I have been married for almost 5 months now. After taxes and insurance, we bring home a combined ~4200/mo. Our monthly expenses are ~$3000/mo or less. We have $15,500 in savings, but no other savings or investments. Unfortunately, we also have close to $75k worth of Federal student loans ($694/mo for 10 years). 

Anyway, I think we are ready to put a little bit into a retirement fund. My employer offers a truly pitiful 401k, but I am going to enroll soon. You can contribute 15% of your pre-tax earnings, and they will match 25% of the first 6%... which comes out to a $32/mo contribution for me, lol. I was also planning on opening a Roth IRA with a initial investment of $1500, and following contributions of about $288/mo (~$3500/yr) at least until we are earning more. 

Assuming all of this, we will be left with ~$500/mo of extra savings. As both of our cars are 10+ years old, I was planning on putting this toward a car fund. We are looking to buy a house within 5-8 years as well, so I'm not sure where the down payment will come from.

How does it look so far? And do I just have to suck it up and wait on a house/car, since a $6000/yr savings won't give us much to work with. Any comments or help from this awesome community would be greatly appreciated!

Additional info: Our 6-month emergency fund is $14,000. We do expect to be earning $20k/yr more as our careers progress in the next 5-10 years.",finance,1384456735

So starting in 2013, my business partner and I started an LLC in NY state. We have been doing work and had put all of our money in a business account at the bank. I was employed at a full time job up until the beginning of October when I left and am now self employed full time. We will have grossed around $100k by the end of the year, what I am wondering:

* What will our taxes look like at the end of the year? Will we both be responsible for paying taxes for 50% of $100k?
* How are business expenses handled in regards to our personal filings?
* Are we going to be taxed as an LLC too? Will we need to pay any taxes for the money in the bank? Or just on the money that we pay ourselves (started paying ourselves monthly in October)?
* When you are self employed, how do you figure your ""annual salary""? I've since applied for personal credit cards and just put in an estimated monthly gross income x 12.
* On the money that we pay ourselves each month, I've saved about 35% of it for taxes. Does this seem like a high enough amount? I know that I will be paying more taxes because of social security and medicare. Last year at my full time job at $40k/year my effective federal tax was about 10% (can't find my state rate) so I figured 35% would be enough.

The interest rate on our current loan is 6.5%. I am constantly getting offers from my mortgage company to refinance at 4.75% with no closing costs.

The reason I have not acted yet is that we plan to purchase a larger house in a better school district soon. The thing is ""soon"" seems to be a very fluid concept. We started looking 18 mos ago, but still haven't acted on anything. A large part of the reason why 
(though not the only reason) is that we will be selling our current home at a loss, and may have to actually sell for less than we owe, and have to make up the difference out of pocket. I doubt we'll do anything over the winter, so I don't expect to be purchasing until spring at the earliest, but realistically, it may be even longer than that. 

There is a small possibility that we may keep our current home and try to rent it until the market gets better. On paper, I can carry both mortgages, but I'm not sure how reasonable a prospect that is in reality. It would be my preference to sell it as soon as possible.

personalfinance,advice on buying and financing a new vs used car? young professional,"I am a 24 year old recent college graduate looking to buy a car. 

Whats wrong with my current car you ask? It's a 13 year old jeep grand cherokee with 250,000+ miles on it; the a/c doesn't work, coolant leaks, transmission is on its way out, and...it would have failed smog check 2 years ago if it wasn't for my awesome mechanic who wrote it off for me while I was still in school. The Kelly Blue Book estimates its value at $1,500 for ""so-so"" condition, not taking into account the aforementioned problems it has. It's been a great reliable car for me so far. I bought it and paid it off while I was still in high school. However the smog check comes due again in January (when if will fail). So I have a time constraint on when I need a new car by, otherwise I would eek out all the life it has left for as long as I could. 

The good news is that I have graduated college now and am a working professional! I am looking for advice/input on how much car I can afford and the pro's/con's of buying used or new! I am rather clueless on this and I feel pressured by salesmen every time I go to a car lot, so I'm not sure what I can realistically afford. 

For a quick synopsis of my financial situation: I make about $4,400/month take-home (after taxes, health insurance, etc). I pay a flat $1,650/month for rent and all utilities (yikes, california rent!) and $237/month in student loan payments. I spend roughly $200/month in gas and $400/month in groceries/small living expenses. Meaning after all is said and done about $2,500 of my monthly income goes it bills/living expenses, with $1,900 left over. I have been putting $1,000 into savings each month. 

The good news is that I have no credit card debt and my credit is fair-good at about 720-730. The bad news is that I only just graduated college and started my career 3 months ago. So I only have $2,500 in savings currently. 

I obviously don't have much for a down payment on a car, which I know will increase my monthly payment. However at this stage in my life (young, single, professional) I want to be able to afford a monthly car payment and still put money into savings each month. 

What can I realistically afford to pay for a car? and how much should I limit my monthly car payment too? 

I will obviously have to finance a car with a loan. I know new cars have much lower interest rates then used cars. But new cars have high insurance rates as well. I am just a little overwhelmed with making the best financial choice for myself! 

I would like a midsize SUV with lower mileage (under 100,000k).

First of all, I ignored all of the criticism and bad reviews for COD: Ghosts.  I mean, I have been playing that franchise since it began.  I gotta give it a chance right?  WRONG.  Now, I base a lot of my overall feeling of a game on the campaign.  I love seeing how the developers teamed up with the story line crew to create the game as a whole.  It has been my favorite thing about video games since final fight on SNES.  That being said, what an unholy piece of shit! I couldn't believe how bad it was.  I remember being blown away when MW1 came out.  The story line, the characters, the missions.

Nope.  That's a misfire you dip shits.  I have to be invested in something about the game before you can throw some ""Federation"" down my throat.  Were they Spanish? Mexican? WTF.  Rorke?

The stock is near its all time highs and the current market cap is about 8B with stock holder's equity closer to 1B.

I've never actually seen a 3D printer and its workings so I'm having a hard time making an informed decision.  From what I understand, it heats up plastic and lays a little bit of it at a time to print 3D objects.  Doesn't that mean the object is brittle and prone to breaking easily?  So then the 3D printer is bad for use in practical applications and is only useful as a temporary solution or for creating aesthetic objects.

Who's buying these things? It's not like normal people need these like they would a normal printer. Although I can see a scenario where a company like FedEX Kinko's buying one for every store and with the recent article with MakerBot wanting one in every school but there's no guarantee either will happen especially anytime soon.

Bitcoin,WHY Wallet(btc address) identification is absolutely INEVITABLE for bitcoin. And future Bitcoiners will love and expect nothing less.,"5 billion in deposits FROM banks into the bitcoin network. Exchanges ALL bank dependent. No bank co-operation no exchange, no inflated prices.

Price only goes higher as adoption grows. Adoption grows with EASE of purchase/deposit and ease of USE and EASE of security.

Each successive boom in adoption brings in larger crowds of security inept users who DEPEND on exchanges to keep their BANK FIAT deposits and coins SECURE.

The first round of Greenlist (identity ecosystem http://www.nist.gov/nstic/identity-ecosystem.html) compliant exchanges and hosted wallets will be the most popular, with the highest volume because of:

EASE of purchase/deposit and ease of USE and EASE of security

Banks will choose to work with Greenlist wallet and exchanges. And ALL the new users will CHOOSE them too. 

I think many here are completely confused about how Greenlist over Bitcoin would work. Most of what i am hearing is completely off the mark. It works like this. Greenlist wallets are nothing but interfaces to centralized identity clearinghouses. User creates a transaction, request goes to clearinghouse, clearinghouse confirms identity (along with other criteria, value limits, location restrictions etc. use your imagination) of both parties and if approved the transaction is then issued into the blockchain by the wallet provider. Bitcoin protocol is not modified.

Bill has a hosted wallet on Paypal. He wants to send 1 BTC to Todd. Todd has a hosted wallet on Coinbase. Bill enters fills out the form on paypal and clicks send. Paypal confirms identities and submits the transaction into the blockchain. 

Bill's friend is an evil hacker with a bitcoin-qt client. He wants to send Bill .5 BTC.. Bill only has his Paypal hosted bitcoin address. Evil hacker sends to bill's address. Paypal address receives the .5 btc, payal anaylzes the transaction, sender cannot be identified, Paypal creates a new transaction and sends .5 BACK to address or to the Federal Reserve where the .5 btc is sanitized and sent to a Greenlist exchange to be sold to a greenlist client. Bill NEVER sees any trace of the send attempt in his Paypal hosted wallet transaction history. OR he is informed that an attempt to send from a non-greenlisted client was attempted but he was kept safe from receiving the dirty btc.


Another scenario Bill will LOVE is a different evil hacker has gained access to Bill's Paypal account. Evil hacker attempts to send Bill's BTC to another address. Paypal denies the attempt because the evil hacker's address is not identified. Evil hacker sends to a Greenlist client. Bill discovers his BTC was gone and was sent to an identified wallet. He issues a chargeback and his btc is returned.",cryptocurrency,1384556376
Bitcoin,Anonymous safe-deposit boxes?,"As I get more deeply involved in paper wallet security, I started looking around at safe deposit boxes, and found out (surprise!) they're not at all like the movies; I expected that whoever held the key to the box was effectively the owner of the box (*a la* Da Vinci code; if you have the key and the password, you are entitled to the contents of the box), and can therefore be quite anonymous, and finding great-grandpa's old safe-deposit box key in the attic means finders-keepers.

However, when I made inquiries of my local (USA-based) bank, I found that I would have to put my driver's license on file, take out the box in my personal name, and have a signature on file, so whenever I came back to the box, I would need my key, my driver's license, and sign a paper both to log the visit happened (audit trail? Could be subpoenaed?) and to show my signature matched. The only way I could pass the box on to an heir would be through Financial Power of Attorney.

Much more complex than I thought, and made me wonder, if alongside the anonymous power of Bitcoin, **are there places that offer anonymous safe deposit boxes**, where as long as someone paid the service fee for the box, whoever currently possesses the key is the owner?

Minimums are around $550 so it's $800 extra.

If I pay minimum payments forever, the last loan will be paid off in 2022. Total interest would be $5600.

If I pay just my current minimum payment of $550/month, and keep on paying $550 even when some of the individual loans are paid off, my loans will be paid off in about April 2019. Total interest would be $4500.

If I pay $650/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in June 2018. Total interest would be $3700.

If I pay $750/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in Oct 2017. Total interest would be $3200.

If I pay $850/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in April 2017. Total interest would be $2700.

If I pay $950/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in Dec 2016. Total interest would be $2500.

If I pay $1050/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in July 2016. Total interest would be $2200.

If I pay $1150/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in May 2016. Total interest would be $2000.

If I pay $1250/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in Feb 2016. Total interest would be $1850.

If I pay $1350/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in Dec 2015. Total interest would be $1700.

If I pay $1450/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in Nov 2015. Total interest would be $1600.

If I pay $1550/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in Sep 2015. Total interest would be $1500.

If I pay $1650/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in Aug 2015. Total interest would be $1400.

If I pay $1750/month until they are all paid off, they'll be paid off in Jul 2015. Total interest would be $1300.

So basically, the marginal value of extra payments plateaus right after my $1350/month payment. After that, interest and payoff date decrease at a ever-diminishing rate. So when my income goes up next year I'm going to stick to my current loan payment and do some saving and investing with any extra dough. A mix of 401k, TradIRA, Roth, and taxable. 

My income is getting to that point where I'm being pushed into that 25% tax bracket. If I do 401k contributions I will literally get a 25% return on that, which beats the 5% return from paying off loans. My company does not do a match on 401k contributions, they just give everybody 3% regardless of what you contribute or if you contribute or not, so the 'free money' match is not a factor for me, so in the past I had decided to forgo the 401k and focus on debt for now. Conventional advice tells you just pay off debt first, do ""one thing at a time,"" but with my low interest rates and with this diminishing marginal return on payments, combined with tax savings of retirement accounts tells me the opposite. As much as I want out of debt, I'm not going to miss out on those tax benefits to be out of debt six months earlier.

Just something to think about for all of you getting out of debt. Is there any name for this diminishing marginal utility of my extra monthly payment dollars?

personalfinance,Am I crazy? Did I make the right decision? (life insurance),"Alright, this is going to be kinda long. I just want to know if I made the right decision here. 



* 22 year old, male, 4 month old son, ~$20k subsidized student loans. 



So this summer around the time when I became a father I got a small term life insurance policy and a small whole life policy for my son. Although all my student debt will be forgiven upon my death, I wanted to be able to live a little bit of money for my dependents. I got a $100k term policy for $9/month. It's all I could really afford at the moment.  I also got a $25k whole life policy for my son for $19/month



I found out that my parents had a small whole life policy they had taken out on me when I was a baby. They no longer live in the States and weren't sure about all the details of the policy. They were under the impression that it was paying a dividend, and the face value had grown from about $15k (when they started it) to about $25k. I just met with their insurance agent, (not the same agent or company that I took out my policies with) and tried to get some information about the whole life policy my parents had started for me. 



Here are the details of the policy:

* $15k face value. This policy NEVER grows in face value, even if I keep it till I die

* $9/month premium

* no dividend

* current cash value of $1118.00


Now, I know the cash value obviously won't be close to the amount my parents have paid into the policy. But I told the agent I would like to surrender the policy for the cash value, since it won't ever turn into a retirement vehicle for me. From what I understand, whole life policies are supposed to turn into retirement vehicles if you don't die. Since this one doesn't pay a premium, and never increases in face value, I would be better off cashing it out asap. Plus, I can receive 6x the amount of coverage for the same monthly premium. Although my term policy won't gain cash value, and won't pay a dividend, the cost/reward relationship it offers is the best for me currently. 



Here's what really got me: after explaining this to my parents insurance agent, this is what he said: 


&gt;While I am dismayed at your decision, I am not surprised.  For various reasons, I believe this to be shortsighted.  However, I was taught many years ago that I shouldn't care more about people's money than they do.
 



Are you kidding me?? I am cashing this policy out because I DO care about my money. It has seen a -8% interest rate over the passed 22 years. While it was great that my parents were able to have that coverage in case if I died, I am now financially independent and I don't want them to keep wasting their money on this policy. 




What do you guys think? Was this shortsighted? How are you hedging against your death? How are you saving for retirement? 





**TL;DR** 

I cashed out my small whole life policy that doesn't grow in face value, doesn't pay a premium.

gaming,Idea for a Mystery Card game - Need content help,"Hey guys,

Recently I had a cool idea for a card game that I wanted to try and create. I won't go into great detail as to what its about (I am still spewing my ideas out on paper) however what I can for sure say is that it involves combining a bunch of cards that have little fun/scary elements on them into a grand thing. I wanted to just pop in here and ask Reddit if they wouldn't mind tossing in a few ideas for some things I could include. 

Basically cards have to be unique(ish) yet worded openly so that they could be paired with any other cards. For instance I could have two cards :

Lady in Red - ""as you stand in the room you hear a door open and a most beautiful woman in a flowing red dress walks in. You see that she is walking towards you holding your gaze. ""

Lights Out - ""Abruptly all the lights go out, the room is engulfed in complete darkness. Although you are not afraid, chills claw down your spine. You notice something to your right and when you look you see the flickering of a candle and a shadowy figure walk down the hallway out of sight. As you follow you find yourself at the base of a longer hallway. You catch a glimpse of a door closing and candle light glowing underneath, however you also notice what sounds like a conversation further down the hall. What do you do? 1-You open the door and walk inside, 2-You continue down the hallway towards the conversation...""

separately they can be used with a whole bunch of things but I like to think that playing (or reading out loud) the Lady in Red and then the Lights out would lead the player to believe that the shadow figure could be the lady and that they should go into that room (or totally think its a trap and go down the hallway). There will also be ""Game Cards"" that give the player who's going through this a possibility to be knocked out and lose that game (or win it and maybe get a bonus or something).

For type of those cards, some are simply descriptive that draw the player in and others are cards that give a player two options (or multiple) to get the player to ""move"" throughout the game. so the Lady in Red was simply a card to draw you in and the Lights Out gave the player two options on how to continue through the game.

If I could actually get this going with content I would release it for free as a downloadable file that people could print on the cheap (depending on the paper quality).

I've always kinda wanted to do something like this and am wondering if you guys would like to tops ideas around or maybe even if someone in general wants to help try and put this together. :)

What if the new DPR starts using the coins or moving them around to other addresses?  Will the coins be tainted or only his ""seized"" address.  The answer is we don't know but we do know that the Feds aren't going to forget about roughly $60M of ""drug money"".  The senator/regulatory parties will definitely have this in the back of their mind on Monday.  They have to have a way to ensure that those coins aren't recirculated into the network.  If they cannot do this, then they are much more likely to TRY to strictly regulate bitcoin so that large criminal enterprises cannot have free reign with their illegally made BTC.  If they can find a way to keep the coins or come up with some other solution, then they would be more likely to see BTC as a great new innovation and less of a threat.

Bitcoin,BITCOIN TRANSCENDS NOVELTY STATUS - pretty good basic article about where Bitcoin is from the POV of a mainstream investment advisor.,"This is from an awesome investment newsletter that can be seen at consensus-inc.com (it is in the payed section so I can't link it here. Instead, I copied and pasted the entire article below)

BITCOIN TRANSCENDS NOVELTY STATUS

Prepared by Andy Waldock

(November 13, 2013) The United States has tripled its balance sheet since 2008 and Great Britain has quadrupled theirs in the same timeframe. Theoretically, the growth in the currency base should be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the purchasing power of our Dollars and Pounds. Many of us who've worked diligently for years trying to manage our personal budgets and build up our personal stores of wealth find the governments' actions downright criminal. This is the scenario that's drawn billions into the gold market. We've been taught that gold is the first choice alternative investment for fighting inflation and maintaining the value of our savings. This week, we revisit an alternative to gold as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement: the Bitcoin.

I published a piece on the Bitcoin in June of 2011 titled, ""The World's Strongest Currency."" Many viewed this as a passing novelty at best or, the next .com bubble. At worst, people saw it as the international street criminals' Swiss bank accounts. Bitcoin is an Internet currency that is traded globally for goods and services and can be cashed out in the physical currency of your choice. It is, ""mined"" on individual computers that are placed, by anyone, on the network. The mining is basically using your computer to solve an equation. The equations get harder and harder through time. This ensures that the supply of Bitcoins grows at a stable rate. The publicly validated equations place more Bitcoins into circulation by the people who've mined them. The number of Bitcoins currently stands near 12 million. The next equation and number of coins in circulation are all publicly available in real time.

When we published the first piece in June of 2011, Bitcoins were trading near $14 per Bitcoin with 6.6 million Bitcoins in circulation for a market cap around $92 million. The Bitcoin mining equation is public information. It's always known how many are in circulation as well as the growth rate. Furthermore, the total number of Bitcoins will be limited to 21 million by the equation itself. These are the currency controls lacking in today's global economy. The proof lies in the adoption and acceptance rate of Bitcoins, which is growing exponentially. The current Bitcoin market is 12 million Bitcoins at $400 each for a market capitalization of $4,800,000,000. This places it between Exxon Mobil and Apple in market value.

This leads to the .com bubble argument. There's no question this market is extremely volatile. Let's put the volatility in context before Bitcoin is dismissed and demonstrate why it isn't a fad. The S&amp;P 500 declined by more than 50% in four months during the housing crash and has more than doubled, reaching all time highs since. The European Central Bank just cut their interest rates in half and gold is nearly 40% off of its highs. The world we live in is a volatile place. I'd argue that we haven't seen this much change in the political/economic/social aspects of this world since World War 2. I'd argue further that it is precisely this volatility that has made Bitcoin a globally accepted alternative form of payment at both the retail and business-to-business levels.

Bitcoin has clearly passed the novelty stage. EBay as well as Amazon accept them. They're even beginning to show up as an ATM. The first ever Bitcoin ATM was recently installed in Vancouver and it processed more than $100,000 in transactions in its first week. This is no ordinary ATM. There are financial controls on Bitcoin just like normal currencies. In Canada for instance, they are only allowed to exchange $3,000 per day without filing anti-money laundering documents. I recently visited Mt. Gox.com, the leading Bitcoin exchange and found their registration requirements to be every bit as stringent as the ones we face in the commodity futures markets. This degree of regulation continues to add validity to the Bitcoin system rather than hindering its growth.

We live in a world of fiat currencies subject to monetary adjustments or downright manipulations that many of us have no say in. Frequently, the decisions that are made for us negatively impact the very foundation that we've worked so hard to build. Bitcoin is a known quantity in a world full of unknowns. It travels globally without the processing fees of PayPal, Western Union or the banking industries. In fact, the current banking systems' loss of processing fees is both a boon to Bitcoin business as well as the reason for the most vocal arguments against it. After all, JP Morgan has to recoup the $8 billion they've received in regulatory fines over the last two years somehow, right?

Here are the highlights:  
* Military member, married with two kids  
* Net household income is about $70k/year  
* $22k credit card debt (8.9% interest rate)  
* $20k car loan (0% interest rate)  
* $122k remaining on a home loan (5.875% interest rate) for a property that we rent out    
  
    
Another thing that might be notable is that my 14 year old car (paid off, obviously) is about to go in the shop and I'm expecting to pay about $1500 to get it fixed, but will budget for this out of my normal paycheck.
  
    
So, I'm thinking of putting $5k towards my credit card debt, and the other $5k into some type of account (savings/money market) for an emergency fund.  If I go this route and I want to keep my emergency fund relatively safe (i.e., not play the stock market), would a money market be the best place to keep it or are there other options to consider?

I pre ordered a PS4 on June 11th, on both newegg and amazon. I called to confirm on 6/11 that I would get a launch Ps4. This was confirmed with the representative I spoke to. 

In October I decide I will only need 1 ps4. I go on live chat first and confirm again with newegg. Are you sure I will get a launch day system. Again told yes. I called to get the last confirmation I needed and to inform them that I will be updating my payment method to another card.


Fast forward to 11/7 I receive a newegg email about ""an exciting offer."" To upgrade shipping to next day shipping for $38.68 charge initially which will later be changed to $9.99. Now I'm like wtf? I've confirmed over 4 times that I would get the system at launch. Does this effect me? I call and yes it does. I have to get this service to get it at launch and deal with FedEx. I do ""upgrade"" but explain my situation and get the fee waived. 

11/14 after three calls during the week inquiry about the status of my order, and why my card had not been charged , and to confirm that my system would arrive on time. I get an email at 4:33am that my card had been declined. For some reason despite the fact I had updated my payment month ago newegg charged my old card. I didn't find this out until 7:30am and scrambled to make sure the order got pushed out. Again was assured I would receive my order on time. 

11/15 Launch day. I cleared my schedule for the day to make sure I don't miss this package. I inform everyone in my household to pay attention to the door. I routinely update the tracking information to now when it will arrive it s scheduled to arrive by 8pm. Understandable as the system was shipped from California to NY. 7pm comes  by and I call fedex. Not to worry sir your package is in route and you should be receiving it shortly. 8pm comes and goes. Oh we are showing its on its way. Wait until 7pm to try again.

personalfinance,I had to drop out of college due to depression over my parents' deaths. Now I'm in debt. Advice please!,"* I am a late-twenty-something female in the USA. I went to a public university at the age of 24. For the first couple of years there I excelled, but the last 2 years have been some of the worst in my life. 

* In 2011, my mother's long-term illness started to get worse. Most of the Fall 2011 semester was spent taking care of her. She died the week before finals and I did poorly in all my classes. After this I became increasingly depressed and failed more classes. In the summer of 2012, my father also died suddenly and in September 2012, my grandfather died as well. 

* I have a history of mental health issues. I have been diagnosed with bipolar since I was a teen. However, I was usually able to deal with my problems and was able to work. Now my condition is 10x worse than it ever has been. I am so depressed I can barely get out of bed many times. I now have no health insurance and it is difficult to get treatment for my condition.I have not attended classes since early October. I am so ashamed of myself. I can't believe everything turned out this way.

* I owe about $45,000 in federal student loans. These loans are serviced through Sallie Mae.

* I have attempted to talk to my academic adviser, the counseling center at my university, the head of my academic department and the financial aid center about my situation. No one has any concrete advise for me on what I should do. And I have asked multiple times as well. No one can tell me anything, apparently. They just refer me to someone else who refers me to someone else. 

* I have not officially withdrawn from university yet because I am terrified that my loans will go into default immediately. I am wondering what I should do. I have no idea if I'll be able to keep a job or whether I should attempt to get disability. Can I go on temporary disability? Can I still get income-based repayment if I drop out of college? Believe me I have tried to talk to the people at the university and they just give me blank looks. 

* Any advice appreciated!",finance,1384633367

My 401k is now being maxed out as well as my Roth IRA, I have 6 months emergency fund in the bank, my consumer debt is at zero, and I have a plan to take me to retirement.

So far so good.

The problem is that I ended up with the house in a depressed (but improving) market that is very much underwater.  Current property value estimate is $130K, it has gone up almost 20k this year so the area is rebounding.  I have two notes on the house

143,000 First mortgage, 6% ARM, $1050/mo principle+interest

32,000 Home Equity Loan, 8% fixed, 30 year, $310/mo. total

I bought the property 14 years ago.  I can now afford to add ~800 a month on top of either payment.  If I can pay off the second I can probably refi the first to a lower interest rate fixed and continue to pay it down aggressively.  The problem is that I figure that will take about 2-3 years and I expect interest rates to rise which will reset the ARM.  I may be able to pay down the first aggressively and then refinance it into a low interest fixed to avoid the reset, but there is always the risk that the second note holder won't cooperate.  Neither note is held by Fannie/Freddie so no help from HARP, I've asked repeatedly.

I think the ARM reset is going to be brutal and I'm looking for a way to mitigate that risk.  Anyone have any thoughts of what the best approach might be?

NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — A Chicago lawyer and certified public accountant was convicted Friday for his role in a 10-year tax fraud that generated $7 billion in phony tax losses, scheme authorities have called the largest tax fraud in history.

Paul Daugerdas, the 63-year-old former head of the Chicago office of the now defunct Texas-based law firm Jenkens &amp; Gilchrist, was found guilty of conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service, evade taxes, commit mail and wire fraud and other crimes after a seven-week jury trial in federal court in Manhattan, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said.

Daugerdas, of Wilmette, Ill., faces up to 58 years in prison when sentenced next March. His lawyer didn't return messages seeking comment. A co-defendant at trial was acquitted of all charges.

The tax shelters, prosecutors said, were marketed from 1994 through 2004 to the wealthy and well-connected, including the late sports entrepreneur Lamar Hunt, trust fund recipients, investors, a grandson of the late industrialist Armand Hammer and a man who was one of the earliest investors in Microsoft Corp.

Others have been convicted in connection with the scheme. In March, a former attorney in the law firm was sentenced to eight years in prison and was ordered to pay $190 million in restitution.

Daugerdas made $95 million in fees from creating and marketing tax shelters for wealthy clients but paid less than $8,000 in taxes when he owed more than $32 million, prosecutors said.

Subject: Don't Tax My Credit Union

Message: 

As Congress considers comprehensive tax reform, big banks and others in Washington think it’s a good idea to tax credit unions.

There is a reason credit unions are exempt from income taxes.  All credit unions like mine are not-for-profit and owned by their members. As not-for-profits, credit unions return what they earn to their members in the forms of lower rates on loans, higher returns on savings and lower and/or fewer fees. In fact, for every $1 in new taxes on credit unions, the government would wipe out $10 worth of better rates and lower fees for consumers. That’s a solid investment in our communities and something I personally enjoy as a credit union member.

Don’t mess with this great value! Don’t tax my credit union!


-------------------------



This was his response:


 
Dear Mr. XXXXXXXX:
 
Thank you for contacting me regarding efforts to simplify and reform the Internal Revenue Code.  I appreciate having the benefit of your comments on this matter.
 
At a time when the United States faces more competition than ever from countries overseas, the federal tax code is a major drag on our economy.  According to the National Taxpayer Advocate, Americans spend $193 billion each year in tax-compliance costs, which represents about 14 percent of our total income-tax bill.  With unemployment high and families struggling to make ends meet, Congress should focus on enacting low-tax, commonsense policies that promote economic growth, entrepreneurship, and private-sector job creation.
 
By making our tax code more logical, more equitable, and more transparent, the United States could ease the burden on hardworking families, strengthen our financial system, and ensure that our economy remains the strongest in the world.  Texans deserve to keep more of their money to spend, save, and invest as they see fit.
 
I am honored to represent Texas in the United States Senate, and you can be sure that, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I will keep your views in mind should tax reform be considered during the 113th Congress.  Thank you for taking the time to contact me.
 
Sincerely,
JOHN CORNYN
United States Senator

personalfinance,"[22F] Getting a sizeable chunk of money soon, here is my plan for it, and also a few questions regarding student loans – criticisms and advice welcome","Hi, /r/personalfinance. You guys have been really helpful before so I’m hoping you can help me out again.

My uncle passed away this past August, and I found out a couple of days ago that he had a life insurance policy of $50,000 with me listed as the beneficiary.

I already have an emergency fund of $5,000, with an additional $2,000 secured to a credit card that my bank will make available to me in the coming year. I pay off the balance on the card monthly, with my usage usually between 5-15%. I live with my mom so my bills will be virtually nothing if I pay all my debt off with this money. The only monthly payments I have coming out that aren’t tied directly to loans are my car insurance, Netflix, and my cell phone:

Car Insurance: $148.83/mo

Netflix: $7.99/mo

Cell Phone: $40.00/mo

My mom says she may start charging me rent soon, which wouldn’t be anywhere upwards of $244.00/mo. Since I am under 26, I am on my father’s medical insurance, and I have dental and vision totaling $30.00/mo that comes automatically out of my paycheck.

As for income, I make about $1,100.00/mo, give or take.


My debt is as follows:

Private student loan: $8,301 @ 7.69%

DOE student loans: $15,250 @ 3.86%

Principle on car: $17,331 @ 3.45%

TOTAL: $40,882.00


So, as you can see, I have more than enough coming to me to pay off all my debts in full. My definite plan as far as paying things off is to first and foremost pay off the private student loan in full, because of the interest rate. There is no penalty for paying it off early. Then, I figure I will pay off my car, because it has the highest principle, and that way I don’t have to worry about the car being collateral in case for some crazy reason I end up in dire straights (straits? The band messed up my grammar).

Logically, to me, it seems the next step would be to just go ahead and pay off the rest of the loans, since that would still leave me with a balance of 10k to play with. However, I’ve read that it’s wise to continue paying off student loans since you get a tax credit for interest paid? I’m wondering if there is any truth to this…and also if it would be more worth my while than just paying it off in full and being debt free. To me, ridding myself of debt seems a logical choice. I have good credit already and still have my credit card, so I shouldn’t have to worry about my credit score if I decide I want to start saving for a home, right?

I know you guys probably want to hear about my future plans for the money, and this is where I get a little unsure. Now that I can pay off some, if not all of my debt, I intend to start contributing to my 401k (I will be contributing 3%), since I don’t need to worry about not having enough in my paycheck to cover monthly expenses. That doesn’t factor into my plans for this money specifically but it’s a part of my planning for the future. Then I figure I should probably invest in an IRA or something, but I still don’t understand the difference between Roth and traditional (yes, I read the sidebar). I am also not sure how much I can or should contribute to one of these...$5,500 for Roth, I know, but not sure....

There’s other things to consider here too, though, which may or may not impact what I do with the money. Nothing’s really definite and there’s a lot up in the air, but if you have a sense of what's potentially in my future and what my views/philosophy about the future are, maybe you can help me figure out what the best plan for me, personally might be.

First, let me start by saying that I don't plan on having kids. I am in a relationship with someone who is financially stable, and while the relationship is stable we don't plan on getting married. He has a house already (inherited, so no mortgage) but until he renovates it there's no room for me to move in - as it stands there is barely enough room for him and his two kids. My living situation is pretty sweet (I mean, okay, it sucks living in a trailer with your mom, but I'm useful around here and it's awesome not having to pay rent, internet, or utilities - and she's an awesome cook!), so I'm not eager to move out anytime soon. What's more, my mom has Stage 3 cancer. While we are of course very optimistic about her recovery, there is the reality that even if she beats it this time around, there is still a 75% chance of it coming back. She is frequently out of work because of it, and as it is she makes poverty level wages. So while down the road I might consider getting my own place or moving in with a friend, right now it makes much more sense for me to be at home. I spend a lot of nights at my boyfriend's house, so I'm really only home to take care of her and do housework and such. I am her sole caretaker, as my parents are divorced, and she only has one sibling who lives in Vermont (we are in Mass). I have no siblings. Still, it might be nice to start thinking about saving for a place, or reallocating my savings (and some of this money) toward potential future expenses, worst case scenario being I inherit my current home, best case scenario trying to find my own place. We own the trailer but pay all utilities (gas, oil, electric) except water which is included in the lot rent ($244.00/mo). Any advice here would be much appreciated.

Also, I have yet to complete school, although I am only a few credits away from graduating. When I go back, I plan to go to a community college and pay in cash - no more taking out student loans. I am not in school at the moment because I am trying to work as many hours as possible and still have the time to take care of my mom. I am thinking of going back in January and taking night classes until I complete some sort of degree. With my intent to pay this in cash, I would presumably need to set aside about $3,000 for tuition and books.

Aside from that, I want to travel. I've been wanting to travel for a long time but because of finances I have never had the opportunity. I've been planning on getting my passport for awhile and have already done all the paperwork, and now that I know I can fit it into my budget, I definitely plan on locking SOMETHING away in a short-term CD for a vacation fund. How much I'm not really sure, but I want to go on a trip to Alaska with my mom next summer, and a road trip with another friend. My boyfriend wants to go to Vegas, and I want to take at least one trip abroad. I get a lot of time off from work, so it's totally feasible for me to make all of these things happen within the next two years. I know on pf you guys are focused on savings, retirement, etc. (and this is where the philosophical bit comes in, btw), but I grew up poor and I know how to survive on very little. Although I now feel comfortable enough to start focusing on long-term finances, they aren't my number one  priority. Call me irresponsible, whatever. Like I said I don't plan on having kids and I don't mind working. I'm not really so confident in ""the system"" as a whole that I am willing to go out of my way to make it work for me. I would much rather spend extravagantly in my young age, enjoy my youth, and work myself to death when I'm old. I don't plan on being old (I know it happens to many people anyway). I've dealt with a lot of death and misfortune and quite frankly I would rather make the most of every moment now than live like a pauper so I can be fantastically rich later on. I mean, I think I have a decent head on my shoulders and have worked hard enough for long enough to know that I can save and be comfortable later in life and still enjoy life now to the max. But I'm not looking for /r/financialindependence. Travelling is at the top of the list of what I want. 

Am I dreaming too big? I think all of these things are feasible, but then again I didn't imagine myself having $50,000 liquid cash for at least another twenty years. I don't plan on doing anything drastic like quitting my job or investing in Bitcoind...I want to act practically here, but I also want to have some fun.

Also, I want to give a portion of the money to my other uncle, as he has done a great deal for my mom and myself over the years. We thought he would be the beneficiary, and while I know he has no true need for the money (when I asked him if he wanted anything, he said it's mine to do with what I want, if I want to give him something he'll take it but he's content with none of it), I still feel like a portion of it is his. What I give him is going to depend on whatever's ""left over"" after considering all the other factors I listed above. Just mentioning this because it's on my mind, so you guys can take it into consideration also.

Any and all advice appreciated, whether it's about the money or budgeting or whatever. Aside from paying off the private loan and my car, I'm really not sure what my next steps should be.

Bitcoin,"Advice for new bitcoin millionaires (warning, she be long)","Hi, 

This is a thread that is in response to the post about a warning to new bitcoin millionaires. 

First things first, I would like to credential myself, I am a CPA, I work primarily in audit at one of the big 4 accounting firms so while taxes are not my forte, I am knowledgeable to an extent. There seems to be a lot of BTC Millionaires or thousandaires coming forward and I just don't see practical accounting advice being tossed around here so I am going to try and condense it. 

If you just struck it rich with the latest (and greatest) money making scheme (BTC is not a scheme but bear with me here) then you need to watch yourself very carefully. 

The US is NOT against BTC, they just do not know what to do with it. It's new, it's not well understood (by politicians) and therefore they are approaching it with great caution. What this means for you guys is you need to be careful and not reckless with your new found pile of money. 

advice #1) if you are not a CPA, finance major, or anything related to the field of managing money holy fuck please seek advice. 

AT MINIMUM, speak to a CPA about managing money, and tax planning. For a peanuts fee, they will be able to make sure you do not fall into anything illegal and help make sure your new found wealth goes as far as you possibly can. 

Advice #2) Understand the concept and idea behind tax planning, and tax evasion. 

one is illegal, and one is not. Tax evasion is illegal, tax evasion with tarnish BTC, tax evasion is a shitty way to lose your fortune. 

Tax planning is the critical thinking before you cash out to ensure that you pay the minimum legally speaking in taxes. 

there are lots of options here in tax planning and this is where talking to a CPA or financial planner can seriously help you out. The easiest way to have some sort of tax planning is to pay long-term capital gains taxes. 

This means holding your BTC investment for a period &gt; 1 year and exercising your rights to a lower tax rate (i believe 15% but do NOT quote me) 

This is by and far the absolute easiest way to ensure you are not walloped with a serious tax bill. furthermore, when you do cash out, immediately take your taxable amount and stick it into a separate savings account. This will help act as a fail-safe in the situation where you get new-money-fever and spend every dime you got in a week. (it can happen) 

more complex options would be to look into setting up trusts, real-estate trusts, IRAs, and other types of retirement planning options, this WILL require the use of an investment manager, so please, if this is not enough said yet, meet with an expert to talk about you money. 

Disclaimer: the above two mentioned items are safe, like living in a house wit padded walls while wearing iron armor safe. The below mentioned ways of tax planning involve more shady tactics, things that blur the line bewteen tax planning and tax evasion so please....just use the above two items PLEASE. 

your third option would be start an LLC (a company), and transfer in your BTC investment before you cash out. you will HAVE to have a valid business reason for this, you cannot do this just to avoid taxes. 

start a horse farm, start a rental company, start something, but it has to be real, it has to be practical, and you have to pretty much devout all your time to this. (don't do this) 

your fourth and final option would be to say fuck its, and cash out and not pay uncle sam a dime. 

to that, I say, good fucking luck. for this to even have the smallest, tiniest, most microscopic bubble-fart chance in hell of working would be if you exchanged your coins for cash, stuffed them into a matress, and sit on it. 

why? because banks that see a transaction greater than $5k (maybe changed to $10k) will create a 'large, unusual transaction' which get filed with the IRS. To those saying, 'well that's easy, I will just make small deposits over a period of time' again, good fucking luck, not only does this take a serious amount of time, but banks can recognize patterns, and they will figure it out. 

Janitor with a salary of $50k per year all of a sudden making 30 deposits that total up to $50k? that seems weird, let's look into this. 

and oh yea, when you get caught for tax evasion, the government gets everything. they seize everything you got, charge you interest and the last swift kick to the nuts while your screaming on the ground? your credit is finished. 

Once you get out prison, you have $0, you have no credit, you have no house, no car, no assets, nothing. No decent job wants to hire a criminal. 


all to save 15% of your non-existent* millions? please, it's not worth it, just pay your damn taxes like every other schlub on the block. 

*I say non-existent because that's exactly what your new found fortune is, collectively, the entire BTC early adopters basically hit the powerball and a year prior to this, your life was/is radically different. So step back, be thankful that you are now catapulted into the wealthy and pay your dues so you don't have a headache later on. 


LASTLY - I would not be worth my salt if I did not weigh in on my opinion on BTC. This is new, this is ground breaking, I personally love it, however, there is not an investor in the world that is not going to tell you to cash out and I am no different. 

why? 

because any time you make 50x your initial investment you need to cash out no matter how sweet or great the future outlook is. I am not saying I thikn BTC will implode, i'm just saying when you make that kind of return, you just walk away and go find a yacht, some coke, and a titty to blow it on. 

kidding about the blow part.....serious about the titty.",cryptocurrency,1384718850
Bitcoin,"Getting fed up with CaVirtex? Use Coinbase, here's how.","As a Canadian, the options for converting CAD to BTC can be slow and/or costly. The two most popular seem to be CaVirtex, and QuickBT. 


Although QuickBT is simple and fast, you pay a hefty premium, and there is a rather small daily limit. It's not to say they don't have their time and place, but you really pay through the teeth for it. (currently $533.06cad per btc compared to the bitsamp rate of 484.67cad)


This leaves us with CaVirtex if we don't want to pay such high fees, or buy a larger quantity. Even if we ignore all the policy issues people have with them (inactivity fees to name a big one), we're still stuck paying a premium. First you need to deposit your cad to the exchange which will run you 5$, then you need to wait 2-5 business days for those funds to clear. 2-5 days can seem like an eternity while your watching the price climb and just wish your funds would appear already. Once your funds finally clear, you're charged once again to convert from cad to btc (another 1.5%). So lets say i wanted to buy 1 btc from virtex at current prices (ignoring the fact that i can't because it will take 2-5 days for my funds to get there) it'll cost me 5$+$495+$7.43 = $507.43. Again, compared to the 484.67 price on bitsamp, it seems a bit steep.


So what other options do we have? I decided to use Coinbase. The problem however, is that canadians can't use coinbase... or can they? This is how I did it.

Step 1: Go to your bank and ask to open a US account. Not a canadian account in USD, but an actual US account. I did this with RBC, but i'm pretty sure TD and likely others offer the same thing. It took about 1.5 days to get it all set up, and costs me $2.99 per month (first month free!). Now i can log into my normal online banking and with a couple clicks, instantly transfer funds between my US and CAN accounts. 

Step 2: Sign up with coinbase. Once you have your account, you'll need to go to the area to link/verify a bank account. Simply enter the information off your new US account, and wait about 1-2 days for it to be verified.

Step 3: Although as canadians, we can't verify our address on coinbase making us ineligible for instant buys, we still have the opportunity to buy at today's prices with a delay of a few days to actually receive the btc and the fees are a more reasonable 1%. So let's assume i want to buy 1 btc right now, even assuming my 3$ per month bank fee as part of the cost, it would cost me $507.90cad. But wait, isn't that practically the same price as CaVirtex? Well, yeah..... but i can lock today's price in when i click buy, and don't have to deal with CaVirtex's policies. So in my opinion, i'm ahead of the game.


Well, that's it. I hope this helps someone, I know I was quite please when i found out I could use Coinbase. If you do plan on signing up for coinbase, please consider doing so with my [referral link](https://coinbase.com/?r=52122de76c667eacca00002f&amp;utm_campaign=user-referral&amp;src=referral-link). If you do, we'll both get $5 worth of bitcoin after you've bought 1 btc from them. It's not much, but hell, better than a kick in the balls.",cryptocurrency,1384715449
personalfinance,Paying off debt with a mortgage,"Okay - my husband and I have about 100,000 in debt.  This includes medical bills, credit card debt, a car loan, and my student loans (the biggest chunk.)  We have recently been approved for a loan against our (paid for) house in order to consolidate this debt at a significantly lower interest rate (3.25, which is lower than even my federal student loans.) 

Our credit scores are low - 611 and 598.  This is due to being delinquent on a few bills, having a high use of credit to available credit, etc.   We plan to pay the bills in full with the exception of the largest credit card, which I plan to attempt to negotiate on as it is already in collections.

We are hoping that using a loan against our home, and reducing our debt payment to one lump sum, will help get us back on track.  We make decent money and will not need to rack up additional debt.  Neither of us misuse our credit cards (anymore - I am guilty as charged for many of my teens/early 20's.)

Does anyone have advice on the best way to restore credit?  Should we pay off everything in one big swoop?  Should we each use a credit card, or should we keep the credit cards we have in rotation each month - I have heard that this builds credit but want to be careful.  I was thinking we could use one card for gas, one for groceries, one for utilities and pay off each every month?

business,Chase Franklin International Tokyo News: Shares Gain 1.37 percent in opening trade,"Tokyo shares opened higher Monday, tracking a Wall Street rally on Friday driven by strong US jobs data.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 1.37 percent, or 193.42 points, to 14,280.22 shortly after the opening bell.

The market also won support from the weaker yen as the dollar edged up in currency markets to 99.16 yen, from 99.04 yen in New York Friday.

Tokyo's rise came after the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended at a fresh record of 15,761.78, up 1.08 percent, fuelled by stronger-than-expected jobs data.

The world's biggest economy added 204,000 jobs in October, double what analysts forecast.

The broad-based S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.34 percent, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite added 1.60 percent.

The figures raised the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would wind down its stimulus drive sooner than later. The central bank has said it would start reeling back on its bond-buying -- credited with propping up global equity markets -- once the economy shows firms signs of recovery.

""Equity sentiment remains generally strong globally -- enough so to resist the fear of Fed tapering for now,"" said SMBC Nikko Securities general manager of equities Hiroichi Nishi.

""Hopes for more robust economic growth in the world's largest economy should support confidence in a broad sense, while the weaker-yen factor in particular should buoy Japan shares for today,"" he told Dow Jones Newswires.
Meanwhile, the Japanese government announced shortly before the opening bell that the nation's current account -- Japan's broadest measure of trade with the rest of the world -- logged a September surplus of 587.3 billion yen ($5.9 billion), marking the eighth straight month of black ink.

Japan has earned hefty returns from decades of investments overseas, making up for a tepid export picture and surging energy import costs.

personalfinance,Unsure if I should open another savings account (AUS),"Currently I have two bank accounts - my everyday one which my pay gets deposited into and a term deposit one. My everyday one currently has about $9,400 in it and earns 0 interest on it. My term deposit currently has $25,500 in it and at the moment is earning 3.50%p.a on it.

I usually try to go for a term with the highest interest rate that doesn't last longer than 12 months (I like to deposit in there once each term is up and don't like having $10k+ sitting in my everyday account).

There is a catch 22 on giving this attention, but since Forbes just tweeted it I guess it won't hurt to expand on here. This is not what Bitcoin needs... more association with criminal activity. For some people drugs are tolerable, but not many people are alright with assassinating people who hold public office - no matter how unpopular they are.

From recent Bloomberg article on US agencies saying Bitcoin offers legitimate benefits and today's senate hearing on virtual currencies:

&gt; Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, is also weighing in on the hearing, saying that it has no plans to regulate the currency.

&gt; “Although the Federal Reserve generally monitors developments in virtual currencies and other payments system innovations, it does not necessarily have authority to directly supervise or regulate these innovations or the entities that provide them to the market,” Bernanke wrote in a letter to the committee.

I'm not arguing that the Fed isn't evil... but to assassinate someone appointed to chair it is nuts. Especially after he releases a statement saying there are no plans to regulate it, and referring to it as innovative. If you want to hurt the Fed, you should be pro-Bitcoin - take at least some power away from them. And having Bitcoin linked to this type of website is not pro-Bitcoin. It is giving anti-Bitcoin people yet another thing to point to when arguing why it is so bad.

financialindependence,I only pay $250 in rent. Would buying a house be a terrible idea?,"27 years old, make around 55-60k. I have about 50k saved up in cash, and about 40k in retirement accounts. My living expenses are about 10k/yr, and I have no debt. Earlier this year, my SO and I moved in to SO's brother's house, where we only pay 500/mo in rent (including utilities), so 250 each (our finances are separate). I have the goal of early retirement, ideally in around 15 years. To meet this goal, my major concern regarding living costs is housing. Although our rent is extremely low at the moment, I anticipate in a year to year and a half (at most), we will want to get our own place. If I don't buy a house, we will of course end up renting somewhere at a higher cost. My concern is that house prices and interest rates will only continue to rise, so I will be missing my chance to lock in a lower price &amp; rate if I wait until we *need* to move. Since last year it seems like houses have already gone up 10+% and a 30-yr interest rate is a full 1% higher. However, using the NYTimes rent vs. buy calculator, buying is still cheaper than renting after only a couple years, for the areas and types of houses that I've been looking at.

A few other bits of information:

-I would be buying by myself, since my SO doesn't have any savings, our finances are separate, and doesn't necessarily have the desire to buy a house at the moment (would strongly support me in doing so however), but would pay me rent (probably around 500/mo + utilities). Nevertheless I would technically be able to afford all the costs myself.

-I am looking at houses/condos ranging from around 170-240k. Mortgage (+tax &amp; homeowner's insurance) payments in this range would be around 750-1100/mo. Equivalent rents would be 900-1400/mo. (I recognize that there are many other costs of homeownership as well).

-I'm torn between buying on the lower end of that spectrum with a 5/1 ARM at around 2.8% and buying on the higher end of that spectrum with a 30-yr mortgage. On the lower end (170-190k), I think we would only want to stay there 5-7 years at most anyway. I could save 20-30k per year to go towards paying off the mortgage in that amount of time, and/or count on selling it before or soon after the interest rate increases. On the higher end or if I stretched up to around 250k, I could see us staying for 10-15 years. Of course all this is moot if it's a dumb idea in the first place.

-Buying would also improve our living situation from what it is now, since we rent a small basement room in an older house -- we are fine with this for now, but it would be nice to improve.

-My job is very stable.

-We plan to stay in the area indefinitely.

I know that I'm in an astonishingly good situation at the moment with housing costs. Would it be foolish of me to give this up unnecessarily, on the speculation that houses and interest rates will be significantly higher in 12-18 months?

Everyone I've talked to (family members &amp; SO) has said it seems like a good idea, which disturbs me in that I'm not hearing the downsides.

*Mythili Ramen* (head of the Dept. of Justic Crimnal Division)                 
 *Edward Lowry*- special agent in charge of criminal investigation division

3:13 EST - *jennifer Shasky calvery* statement. 'Recognizing new payment methods must keep pace with laws against money laundering and illegal money transfers. Users of virtual currencies don't have transaction limits, is secure, can be used for money laundering. Illicit actors use virtual currencies in order to launder money, enable drug trafficking and move child abuse forward. 

For businesses, complying with Federal laws is good for the business integrity. 

Bringing virtual currencies into regulation will be positive for the US financial system. 

3:20 EST: *Mythili Raman*

Virtual currencies are viewed through the lens of crimnal activity. Criminals will always look for new ways to hide their crimes. The criminal division's main aim is to reduce the ability of criminals to use virtual currencies for illegal activity.

Virtual currencies (as long as the comply with laws) are not illegal. They can be convenient for consumers because they are quick. These same currencies can also be used by criminals for drugs, weapon sales, and child pornography.

In 2007 - EGOLD moved 6 million dollars per day which may have been used for sale of drugs and child pornograpgy

When virtual currencies fail to live up to their Financial Laws, the Justice division will come after them.

Silk road- the largest online marketplace for illegal substances accepts BITCOINs exclusively for payment. When silk road was shut down, the US sized upwards of 70 million dollars from the silk road website.

The US justice department is encouraged by virtual currencies reaching out to comply with FINCEN's laws. (Financial Crimes. Enforcement Network) 

3:27 EST- Edward Lowry     
Digital currencies have continually grown over the past 17 years. Since Criminals and other illegal organizations use virtual currencies such as E-gold and Liberty reserve for illegal operations

As FINCEN emphasized, digital currency exchanges MUST comply with money laundering laws.

The secret service has successfully found and arrested leaders of illegal organizations whom use digital currencies to fund their activities.

Digital currencies are tools used by a wide variety of criminals. The secret service and ICE (immigration and customs enforcement) cooperate with FINCEN in order to find criminals who use virtual currencies for money laundering.

3:34 EST *Sen. Tom Caper* Asks about the early days of virtual currencies as well as what the future holds for future currencies.

3:35 EST- *Jennifer Shasky Calvery* When there is a new ""player"" in the currency industries, most people think about the gaps that will exist in the market and how criminals will use it for illegal activity. Moving forward with change is very important though, so regulation is necessary.

3:36 EST- *Mythili Ramen* Virtual currencies are not illegal as long as they comply with money laundering laws. The Criminal division needs to be vigilant towards virtual currencies in order to make sure they actively attempt to comply with laws.

3:38 EST -*Edward Lowry* The secret service's hallmark is to adopt their defenses to an ever changing threat.

3:39 EST- *Sen. Tom Carper* ""what roll does the legislative body need in order to combat the dark side of this technology?""

3:41 EST - *Edward Lowry*      
Device fraud- today anyone in the world can reach anyone else in the world. This has changed how ICE and the secret service must combat illegal activity.

*making his case for more money to his department*

3:42 EST- *Sen. Tom Carper* - Can Law enforcement keep up with the changing technology?""

3:44 EST- *Mythili Ramen* Liberty reserve was taken down in a coordinated arrest done by the US branches joined with other governments. The ability of the criminal division is evolving just as much as criminal activity is evolving.

3:47 EST- *jennifer Shasky calvery*    
Congress passing the Bank secrecy act.    
in 2011, the justice dept needed flexibility in order to combat digital currencies. With the USA patriot act sec 311, gives FINCEN the authority to name a foreign entity as using money laundering, and thus cut off from the US market.

3:49 EST- *Sen. Tom Carper* - ""Give examples of how virtual currencies have worked out for the good""

3:50 EST- *jennifer Shasky calvery* 

Online banking and ACH (picture deposit) makes money exchange much easier for the consumer. But with each of these, we had to think about how criminals could exploit it.    

**""CASH IS STILL THE BEST MEANS FOR LAUNDERING MONEY""** - *jennifer Shasky calvery* 

3:52 EST- *Sen. Tom Carper*  "" Do you see gaps in our legislation regarding virtual currencies?""

3:53 EST- *Edward Lowry*

**The secret service recognizes that the high level cyber criminals HAVE NOT moved towards P2P currencies such as bitcoin.** Many high-level criminals use centralized online currencies based in places with less regulatory laws.

3:54 EST- *Sen. Tom Carper* ""Which agencies need to be at the forefront of recognizing virtual currencies""

3:55 EST- *Mythili Ramen* 
The FBI, DEA, OFAC, IRS are necessary participators but are already participators. The National crime agency in the UK has also participated. The Criminal division invites any other entities for help in identifying emerging threats and what governments can do about them

Currently, the criminal statutes used thus far have been effective. The substantive criminal statute, murder statute, and money laundering statutes have already been used to prosecute criminals that use virtual currencies.

Many updates to laws can still be made.

3:59 EST- *Sen. Tom Carper*  
The JAO reports with the help of the IRS on ""tax gap."" 100's of millions of dollars in taxes that are owed to the treasury. The number is going down over the past 10 years

In may of this year, ""virtual currencies could prevent a real vulnerability in the current system.""

Question, ""do you know the current guidance of that status?""

4:02 EST- *Jennifer Shasky Calvery* 

FINCEN, once it collects financial data, disseminates the information to law enforcement. This is not only for taxes but also for evidence against criminals.



The JAO and FINCEN are working diligently to modify tax laws to incorporate virtual currencies. 

The focus of FINCEN is to combat illegal use of virtual currencies while still within U.S laws. Conveniently, many of the laws are very flexible.

4:06 EST- *Sen. Tom Carper* 
After the SILK ROAD shut down, many have popped up in its place. ""How do we combat these websites?""

4:07 EST- *Edward Lowry*

We believe there are 3 infrastructures in place. The SILK ROAD forums, the digital currencies (those which fall outside of the guidance of FINCEN), and ""bulletproof hosting"" -an organization that provides web hosting to anyone with servers in countries with little regulation.

4:09 EST- *Mythili Ramen* 

The main problem is anonymity. The criminal division has created tools and strategies to combat this. **(not said) but this is the TOR javascript exploit** We have been successful in combating criminals who use anonymity to continue illegal activity.

4:10 EST- *Sen. Tom Carper*     

Bitcoin and virtual currencies may move overseas to countries with less regulatory agencies. What can we do to combat this? How do we make business stay in the US?

4:12 EST-*jennifer Shasky Calvery* 

Bitcoin is going to be a big player in the future of the exchange of goods and services. The financial action task force does a good job at making the countries around the world comply with regulatory laws.

4:15 EST - *Mythili Ramen*

This hearing is important for the law agencies because talking about these problems is not easy. Virtual currencies in of themselves are not illegal. Innovation is important. Just as criminals have done for ages, this is just *another* means for illegal activity. We need to stay vigilant in keeping pace with evolving virtual currencies.

4:17 EST- *Edward Lowry*    
The secret service will continue to work strategically to remove the gravest structures to the [US] infrastructure. We are going to have to adopt and jump over hurdles but we will work with foreign partners to make this happen. We will continue to work as a part of DHS to eliminate these threats.  We believe that aggressive acts by law enforcement will benefit the world as a whole

4:18 EST-*Jennifer Shasky Calvery* 

I heard a CEO of a fairly large bank say, ""having the privilege to be a part of the financial industry comes with great responsibility. While innovation is a wonderful thing, it does come with obligations to become part of the US financial system. Regulation in place have help in minimizing the risk and the burden. We ask that businesses do this, put in place AML protections, register with FINCEN, maintain records (including suspicious reports)

We believe that these requests are reasonable because these currencies have already been used for illicit activity. 

4:21 EST- *Sen. Tom Carper*  

""This has been a thought provoking and encouraging discussion""

""It's not true We have to choose between a stronger economy and a clean environment""

""Is it possible to reap the benefits of this virtual currencies while still being able to clean up criminal activity?""

**-RECESS- and change of panel**

*Patrick Murck*-General council of BITCOIN foundation     
*Jerry Brito*-Senior researcher of Technology at George Mason university.      
*Jeremy Allaire*- Circle Internet Financial CEO 

4:30 EST- *Ernie Allen*
Our goal is to bring people together to protect the digital economy while combating its misuse. We are excited for digital currencies to give ""banking"" to adults all over the world. Our concern today is the use of digital currencies in child pornography. Most countries have not added regulation to digital currencies.

Over the past year, I have consulted financial experts of this issue. Child pornography is being created and disseminated by using anatomizing technologies and virtual currencies. 

Freedom hosting was shut down by law enforcement by *penetrating* a loophole in freedom hosting's servers which gave users identities away.

Most of the arrests of those using anonymous networks are of those who are misusing the network. Because of this, we believe that we are not catching the high-level criminals who are using these networks.

We can press for global cooperation to solve these problems. Digital currencies move from nation to nation.

We need to address the core problem which is internet anonymity. An environment in which child exploiters can thrive and not be caught should not be allowed.

Anonymity allows illegal activity, but also acts to give a voice to those against oppressive regimes. 

4:39 EST- *Patrick Murck*    
There is no single bitcoin company that manages the value of bitcoin or the trade of bitcoins.

Bitcoin is like email for money. It is secure any completely transparent. Bitcoin can operate without 3rd parties.  

Financial exclusion is a problem for the US. There is a rising tide of un-banked people within our borders. Bitcoin can help move people from a trapped economy to a globally connected economy. 

Just like any currency, bitcoin can be used for illegal activity. It is no easier to commit crime with bitcoin then it is with any other currency. 

Keeping the bitcoin network safe is all of out opportunity.  When the SILK ROAD was shut down, the bitcoin community was excited.

Bitcoin is not some magical cloaking device that allows criminals free reign. The use of bitcoins is not un-regulated. The exchanges have a deep understanding of how to effectively allow users to trade bitcoin with fiat currencies.

Bitcoin exchanges- ""If you give us clear rules, we will work to abide by them""

We would like to thank FINCEN to opening up the dialog about bitcoin. The bitcoin foundation looks forward to continuing in this dialog with the government and the public.

4:47 EST- *Jeremy Allaire*  

As bitcoin moves into mainstream acceptance, it is important that governments fully understand how to include bitcoin into existing laws.

Bitcoin allows innovation in currency, exchange, and payment that many other currencies cannot offer. Much of our current infrastructure for finances has existed *before* the internet was invented.

It is a risk if the government doesn't support businesses that want to use bitcoins. Such businesses may be encouraged to move offshore.

The U.S. falls behind in this critical economic innovation. **A bitcoin exchange in CHINA has become the single largest currency exchange in the world .** We need to be open and evolving.

4:53 EST *Jerry Brito*

From facebook credit to world of warcraft gold, Virtual currencies are nothing new.

Prior to Bitcoins invention in 2009, all virtual currencies needed to be exchanged through an intermediary. 

Emerging technologies allow great benefits but great risks. 3-d printers revolutionize personal creation, but also creation of guns. 

While Bitcoin transactions don't need intermediaries, many exchanges can still convert government currency to bitcoins.

Criminals are more likely to use centralized currencies because they can lie about how much money has been moved. Currencies such the bitcoin infrastructure show every transaction that happens.

The U.S. could loose it's headstart on an emerging economy if it chooses to create strong regulatory laws.

4:59 EST- *Sen. Tom Carper* 

""Where is the general agreement on the panel, and if not, how can we make agreement?""

5:00 EST- *Ernie Allen*   
There is clear agreement that we can't just ignore the misuse, and that the misuse jeopardizes the currency in the long run. 

5:02 EST *Patrick Murck*

There is a real need to create on ramps into the traditional economic system. The biggest obstacle to that happening is the ability of businesses to get bank accounts in the current system, even a checking account.

If you have the word ""bitcoin"" anywhere around you, your file will be cast aside.

5:04 EST-  *Jeremy Allaire*  

Anonymity needs to be addressed in some way

personalfinance,I have no plan,"My wife and I are 28 years old.  I currently work a job making $75k/yr and she was recently laid off and is receiving unemployement of $1k/month.  We are fortunate to live rent free in a vacant family owned house at the moment and just pay for our utilities.  Our debts consist of a $10k car loan at 1.4% and student loans totaling $15k at 2.5%, combined monthly payments of around $500.  I am currently contributing 20% of my paycheck to my 401k (6% matched 100%) and fully funding both our Roth IRAs.  Cash on hand is currently $40k ($10k in a 5-yr CD which I could redeen and only lose 3 months interest) and I have about $50k in various retirement accounts.


I feel like I have way too much cash and really no direction with my budget.  For example I just randomly picked 20% for my 401k contributions, no real thought process to it.  Part of the cash is from selling our house a year ago when we moved to our current location for work.  Ideally we want to move back one day but my job has insane benefits that I don't think many places could match.  In my head I tell myself that the cash is earmarked for another home purchase but that could be anywhere from 1 year to 10 years away.  I just recently opened up a 5-year CD at Ally to at least get some interest earnings.

I'm long winded when typing, so I'll try to be as brief as possible.  There are three sections: Finance history, current status, and goals.

I'd like to hear what people think I could do better, where my assumptions are wrong, etc.

**History:**
Grew up in a family on federal/state assistance but with both parents working as much as possible.  Went to college on loans, left school with debt of $14k in 1994.  $0 in bank.  Got taken in by credit card signups in college, had 2 cards, used them, ended up paying 3x what I spent in fees.  Paid off cards, haven't had any since.  Also haven't paid on student loans much (I have neuroses about money, and I've handed it poorly for years) since college.  Consolidated student loan to Sallie Mae, then to Ford direct loan program.  It got to $30k before I started paying anything(capitalized interest).

I have always worked in IT, salaries of $30k, $52k, $82k, $86k at a succession of jobs (I'm considered senior IT now).  I am now 43, working FT at a university data center.  I have 0 savings (budget items below)

**Status:**
Making $86k/yr with no dependents.  At my third job I started a 401k with generous matching, it got up to about $32k before I left there.  I was nervous about ever being able to get a house (poor credit due to no money management leading to all bills late, student loan payments not made, car repossessed due to no savings when job lost, etc).  Near the end of the housing bubble I moved jobs and cashed out the 401k for a down payment - figured if they were handing out loans to people with no income I could get one.  Wanted to spend no more than $150k on a place, ended up in an overvalued house for $189k.  

Was supposed to be a ""good first house"" to build equity.  Bubble burst, house is now worth about $99k in tax value, a bit more market value, refinanced because interest rate lowered significantly saving $$ but re-starting equity countdown.  Still owe $176k after 5 years in house.

Budget:  Take home is about $4400/month, I have medical/dental/eye insurance via work.  State retirement plan is deducted/matched pre-tax.  I split money off of each check into second checking account to auto-pay mortgage(escrowed everything), student loan payment, internet, car insurance.  With the rest I pay bills and ""other"". 

Bills (non auto paid):

* Heating Gas  $75/month (average over year)

* Electric  $150/month

* Phone $20/month pay as you go cell

* Medical copays, prescriptions $40/month

Other:

* Food $600/month  - breakfast at McDs each day plus weekend breakfast, groceries (I don't keep much at home but fresh stuff and a few microwave meals, trying to eat high protein diet)

* Gas: $400/month at the moment due to driving a truck - 2001 chevy 1500, 360k miles.

* Non recurring expenses like home maintenance, car repair, etc. are probably about $300/month.  Occasional things like x-mas gifts, birthday gifts, driving trips aren't more than $2000/yr.

All of the above (non auto paid) are about $1600/month.  Take home being $4400/month, that means I have about $2800/month or $700 a week left.

Hobbies: All the rest of my cash.  This includes supplies and parts for tools (milling machine, welders, hand tools, vehicles, computers, scuba gear) and projects (CNC stuff, mini front end loader, boat, etc)

One last part of my status:  I have some pretty big mental health issues - diagnosed clinically depressive at 28, ADHD at 38.  I believe I probably use shopping as a way to improve my mood.  I've been managing this (in addition to doctor and meds) by not buying anything new except some clothes and food.  I shop at surplus stores.

That's not to say I buy junk and hoard it.  I've been working toward being able to start a small manufacturing company - I want to design/build my own products and sell them.  That's what the CNC mill is for.  I've taught myself machining and welding and do occasional jobs on the side for extra cash.  I've probably spent $6000 total on rebuilding the mill in the last year (it's working, but I'm improving it some more) and maybe $2000 on welding gear.  I have parts to build a CNC lathe and plasma cutter, plus enough electrical and electronic stuff to fit out a shop.

**Goals:**
My biggest goal is personal:  I want to find the right person to start a family with.  Very hard because I'm so used to being alone that it hardly bothers me any more - I don't get out more than once a week.  Just mentioning this because the other goals are less important.

Financial goals:  
Live somewhere else - I hate the town I'm in.  The local government mostly and lack of space to build things, plus regulations against car work etc.  I'd like to get a 2 acre place farther out from the metro area (Twin Cities, MN) for about $200k and live there.

I also want to start my own company.  I'm working full time to support myself and so I can in theory use the extra money to get a company off the ground.  I have start-up experience, just not as an owner.  This will cost lots of $$ depending how I do it.

So... what do you guys think?  What's my biggest problem, what should I absolutely be doing with my money that I'm not, what should I address soon?

Thanks for reading.

Bitcoin,"For Bitcoin to grow, the Bitcoin Real Economy Has to Grow, Too (And Without the USD)","One of the most concerning things about Bitcoin at present is that it's top heavy. 

What do I mean? Consider this: The net present value of the annual U.S. economy (bitcoin and shadow markets excluded) is around roughly $16 trillion, but the actual amount of physical dollars in circulation as of October 23, 2013 is fairly small– approximately $1.22 trillion in circulation ($1.17 trillion in notes, $.05 billion in coin) as of October 23, 2013 [1]. As of this writing, consumer spending accounts for about 71% of that figure. That means that $1.22 trillion in cash and coins + bank driven credit is currently supporting $16 trillion in annual U.S. output. 

The bitcoin economy, on the other hand, is incredibly small compared to the value of the currency. In fact, if you couldn't “bail out the back door” from bitcoin-to-dollars, JPY, Amazon gift cards or what have you, the intrinsic value of bitcoin would likely fall to reflect the limited amount of non-mining related products and services that you can purchase with it – call it 1% of the total under-the-table economy, though that number is more of an aspiration than a reflection of the current reality. 

As the value of bitcoin rises, more people will tend to sit on their bitcoins rather than spend them. That's may be fine for the moment, but it's self-defeating over even a short-term investment horizon. One argument against this invokes bitcoin's extreme divisibility, a feature which is undoubtedly one of the cryptocurrency's best features. However, when you think about it, the greed-imperative will incentivize people to hold their satoshis just as it incentivizes them to hold BTC today. In fact, apart from altruism or anti-fiat idealistic motivations, the only rational reason to trade for anything with bitcoin fractions today is to avoid the red flags that a massive bank transfer will automatically raise. 

The perverse effects of this tendency are self-evident: In order for 1 BTC to buy you a space station someday, the currency has to be adopted on a mass scale, but in order to be adopted on a mass scale (and multiple crashes WILL ultimately work against the validity of BTC), it has to be SPENT! While the bitcoin community appears to realize the dilemma, everyone is currently expecting someone else to take care of it while they sit on their bitcoins! 

In other words, the bitcoin community is repeating the mistakes of the Capitol Hill Babysitting Co-Op! [2] But it doesn't have to be this way. In fact, if the real BTC economy swelled by a factor of 100x, greed would start to work against bitcoin overregulation just as greed works against the overregulation of the internet itself: On an anti-Tax political platform. 

But for that to happen, the bitcoin community is going to have to buy a few more $4 million pizzas.

personalfinance,Need help: being crushed by debt,"Hi everybody,

Due to a combination of my own irresponsibility and some failed startups, I'm currently in what feels like a completely insurmountable amount of debt.  I have about $80k in student loans and a little under $30k in credit card debt across two cards.  I have a good job now and am able to make payments on everything each month, but I am not helping my debt situation at all since I can only really pay the minimum or a tiny bit more.  I feel like it is literally killing me.  I'm always anxious and it keeps me up every night.  

I have a small emergency fund and I've already gotten to the point where I am not accumulating any more debt, but I really need a way out of my current situation.  I have about $150k in my 401k and am considering taking an early distribution to pay off about half of my CC debt (the one card with the higher interest rate.)

I know that taking money out of my 401k is not smart, but I really don't know what else to do.  The stress is becoming too much and I need some relief.

Any help, guidance, or happy anecdotes of people making it out of similar situations would really be appreciated.  I already know that it is my fault that I'm in this situation, so please be gentle. :/

Thanks


**Edit based on request**

Here is a little more detail about my current situation:

* Net monthly income: $4,000
* Rent: ($1,400)
* Student Loans at 6.8% interest: ($700)
* CC #1 at approx 28% interest: ($600)
* CC #2 at approx 23% interest: ($500)
* Utilities, internet, insurance, etc: ($250)
* Food, groceries, commuting, etc: ($400)

As far as 401k contributions, I'm currently putting 6% of my salary into my 401k because that gets me the maximum match from my company.  That amount is already taken into consideration when I list my net monthly income above.


**Edit**

Thank you all for your suggestions and kind words.  I really needed to hear them both at this point.  I will not be touching my 401k for now.  Instead my first course of action is pursuing a 0% balance transfer to ease the situation a bit.  I checked my credit, which is strangely not terrible, so that should definitely be an option.  I've already started putting together a budget and will work on that again tonight.

Thanks again.  You've all given me some hope.",finance,1384795107

[ bitcoins do not ""liberate"" anyone.  They are a vessel for people to place their money, time, and energy.  A vessel which is worthless outside said money, time, and energy.  And, as a trackable, non-anonymous transfer of money, time, and energy, the ""liberation"" one ""feels"" is spurious at best.  Lastly, Article 1, section 8, ALONE is all you need to know to realize that bitcoins are UNCONSTITUTIONAL at BEST.  Article 1, section 10, is also clear as to what states can accept as payment of debt (gold and silver) - and bitcoins do NOT pass THAT test.  And, there is always the coinage act of 1792, etc to contend with, much less Federalist Paper 44, etc.  I'm shocked and saddened to see you on the bitcoin bandwagon.  You cannot be liberated with something that even George Orwell himself could not have dreamed-up.  You want liberty?  You won't find it in a worthless, ponzi, my friend.

Bitcoin,My thoughts on wealth shift - only people with fiat loose!,"A lot of people is talking about possible wealth shift caused by bitcoin.

The questions are how big it's gonna be and who is gonna be affected? Will the bitcoin early adopter gain so much while other people loose everything? What about my friends and family? They won't buy a single satoshi until the prices in local grocery store won't be denominated in BTC.

My humble opinion is this: 

DON'T SAVE IN FIAT! IT'S A DUMB IDEA!
Anyone who is holding large amounts of fiat money nowadays is crazy!

Fiat is not money... it's just a currency. It makes it horrible long term investment. There is so much fiat going around and everyday more is created. There are almost no interest rates on savings accounts in most countries in the world. 

If bitcoin really takes off, those who are holding fiat are going to loose massively. Their imaginary ""wealth"" is gonna disappear over short period of time.

Everyone who is little bit smart is trying to exchange their fiat for something else as fast as possible.

Average Joe who lives from paycheck to paycheck will be just fine. He will switch from earning and spending USD to earning and spending BTC. His live will be the same and will get better over time as positive effects of bitcoin appear thruout the society.

Anyone who bought some form of physical asset won't loose anything either. If you bought your house, you will have your house. No loss whatsoever. You bought it in USD, but you can sell it in bitcoin down the road.

Only those holding onto their fiat will loose big time! 
So the wealth shift will only be from fiat holders to bitcoin holders. Everyone else will be just fine!!!!!

Those days when you could get richer just by saving in fiat are gone! It was when people thought fiat currency is real money. Now when masses learn what ""we"" already know, they will unload huge quantities of fiat wanting to buy pretty much anything.

That's why stocks are on all time high when underlying economy is doing so bad. No one wants fiat anymore.

If your friends and family don't like bitcoin, convince them at least to buy something else. A nice piece of land for a garden, working business, house to rent out, gold coins, building materials... whatever.

They will not loose anything when all this shit unfolds.
And it's coming soon!

Bitcoin,"PSA: Communicate to others that Bitcoin is not fiat money, and why that's important.","I've heard a number of criticisms about bitcoin, that it is no less fiat than the U.S. dollar.  While it is true that bitcoin is not tangible like gold or silver, it's very important to properly define what fiat money is, why it's bad, and why bitcoin ain't that.

Fiat comes from the latin for ""let it be done"".  It's a term often used by Christians to describe how God created the universe, that is, by His decree, as opposed to from something.  Likewise, fiat money is created by decree.  In the case of the U.S. dollar, the authority is the Federal Reserve, who has the power to create money by decree.

In contrast, bitcoins **cannot** be created by fiat.  The very nature of the bitcoin is that no one can create more coins simply by their own authority.  This, of course, is in stark contrast to other digital currencies like the Linden Dollar, the InterStellar Kredit, or Warcraft gold, all of which could be inflated or deflated by their respective authorities *by fiat*.

- Age: 25

- Salary: 50k (34.8k post-tax) (+9% yearly bonus) (employer matches 401k 50% up to 3% salary, vested 0%, then 100% at 3 years)

- 100k student loan debt (65k private @3.2% variable, 35k federal @7% fixed)


Current Budget (2895/month):

- Rent: 875

- Loan payments: 800

- Utilities: (cable/electricity) 70

- Food: 300

- 401k: 250 (6% of salary -- maximizing match)

- Savings: 350

- Discretionary: 250

Alright guys, obviously in my situation my best bet is to increase my income because of my very poor salary:debt ratio. Unfortunately,that is not possible because I'm a new college grad and my current job is my first out of school and I need to spend a couple years here getting experience before moving on.

My ""Savings"" budget is a bit large (I'd like to reduce it to 200), so I wanted to allocate some of that money for something more productive -- either a Roth IRA or contributing more to my student loans to pay them down faster. I've essentially narrowed it down to three options:

1) Contribute an additional 150 to my student loans in order to pay them down faster.

2) Contribute an additional 150 to my student loans in order to pay them down faster until the high interested, 7% loan is paid down, then start a Roth IRA.

3) Contribute 150 to a Roth IRA.

Which option do guys think is the most wise?

Things to consider: 3.2% and, to a lesser extent, 7% are both less than the 8% average return after inflation on an Index Roth IRA -- However, there are no guarantees that the Market does well and also no guarantees that my 3.2% variable interest rate does not go up. Paying down loans is certainly seems to be the ""safest"" bet, but is it the best course of action?

And a related question: Since my employer doesn't vest my match at all until I've been at my job for 3 years (so I may not ever see it if I find new work in a year or two since I'll be seeking a pay raise), should I even contribute to it? Or should I be using that money to pay down my loan/contribute to an IRA as well?

Bitcoin,The Senate hearings don't matter,"At this point, it seems incredibly unlikely that the government over-regulates Bitcoin.  In short, DC has everything to lose and nothing to gain by trying to shut down this currency.  The Senate Bitcoin Lovefest (hearings?) confirmed that this week.   

However, what needs more discussion / education are the massive disincentives DC has to shut down Bitcoin from a tax perspective.  You may not have heard, but the U.S. is still running up massive deficits and printing trillions of dollars each year to finance our trade imbalance.  Then here comes Bitcoin — with its paper millionaires and ungodly amounts of taxable (if trackable) income.  With U.S. holders owning something between 25-35% of the outstanding bitcoins, that equates to billions of dollars worth of taxable appreciated assets.

So the Senate hearings don’t matter, but what's taking place behind the scenes certainly does, especially at agencies like the SEC, IRS and CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission).  As Time reported on Monday:  

""While the Treasury refuses to define bitcoin as a currency, a federal judge hearing a case about a Ponzi scheme recently ruled bitcoin was indeed currency. And noticeably absent from the agency responses were those from the Internal Revenue Service, which has been looking into virtual-currency tax shelters, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has said it is looking into regulating bitcoin as a commodity. The question of jurisdiction will remain up in the air until Washington can settle on a definition for bitcoin. Is it a security? A currency? A commodity?""

And there’s the rub.  Because the definition of bitcoin (the specific currency) matters enormously.  The tax consideration has to be the most important issue for interested U.S. parties (consumers, merchants, entrepreneurs, regulators) right now.  

On the one hand, the government can treat bitcoin as a security or commodity, in which case, the government will likely tax only the realized gains at capital gains rates.  This would reward the long-term speculators, and preserve their incentives to hold bitcoin indefinitely.  This seems like the most likely near-term path given the alternative, which would do significant harm to existing holders, and likely entice many to evade taxes. 

That alternative, of course, is that the government will adopt the view of the federal courts (thus far), labeling bitcoin a currency and taxing the unrealized gains holders accrue over time.  This could be politically stupid and economically disastrous for the U.S. bitcoin market.  With unrealized currency gains taxable at the ordinary income rate, the government would essentially be forcing sales of the currency when holders learn that they need liquidity in order to pay taxes on what are much more similar to unrealized paper gains than traditional forex gains.  

The net effect would equate to an enormous tax on the industry and a power shift in the bitcoin market to China and other nations, whose residents could buy up the bitcoin getting fire-sold by U.S. investors without the same tax penalties.

A secretive private entity that is above public scrutiny and feels unencumbered by legislative oversight and produces money out of thin air is complaining about another secretive entity that is outside public scrutiny producing money out of thin air. To further add to the irony, will anyone have the guts to forthrightly ask the representative from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network how many of the ""banksters"" that crashed the economy have been brought up against charges and prosecuted? How about those at the credit rating agencies that gave high marks to inherently worthless financial instruments that they didn't understand - how many have been prosecuted? Let's be honest, the US Government has failed in being a proper steward of the traditional financial/monetary system. A clear case of the pot calling the kettle black.

This issue includes a retrospective on the first 100 years of the Federal Reserve, so I know everyone will have some interesting opinions!

Remember that this is an **experiment** - we wanted to test this out, and see if its something we'd want to do more of going forward. Even if we do this more I don't expect to do it more than one a month or so (and my current, pre-test preference is justdo it every three months when the JEP comes out). We're not shutting down news links on a permanent basis. 

We'll be keeping a closer-than-usual eye on modmail tomorrow. If there's some big economics news that really needs to be covered *right now* let us know, and we'll end this experiment.

Please let us know what you think, and keep telling us what we can do to improve the subreddit. 

edit: I've added jstor.org, aaea.org and repec.org as per some of the suggestions I've received.

* Number of periods
* Current period
* Interest rate per period

Bitcoin,Everyones favorite topic TAXES!!!,"This is a new/throwaway as I don't want any karma just a chance to educate. I'm not here to debate the merits of taxation just to explain the laws as they sit today. If you don't pay taxes,  for whatever reason that's your business. However a cautionary note about taxes; during an audit the IRS can snoop in your bank account, and ""unexplained"" deposits are going to be explained, either by you or by the feds. So to all of y'all making buckets of money, please remember a few things. 

1) gains from bitcoin sales, held less than one year are ""short term capital gains"" and are taxed at ordinary rates IE between 10-39.5% 

2) Gains on bitcoin held longer than a year are ""long term capital gains"" and are taxed at 0, 15, 20.

Right away we can see that LTCG are much better than STCG. Now a few problems. Lets say you bought coins nov 18 of last year and received them on nov 30, the clock starts ticking on Nov 30 NOT THE 18th. 

Problem 2) you bought 1 coin a year ago and two last week and sold all three today, then those transactions would be taxed separate,  IE one at LTCG and the other two at STCG. 

Problem 3) certain transactions automatically generate IRS paperwork, I'm not going to tell you which ones... If only this new fangled internet could search for things life would be easy. 

Problem 4) some of you guys making bucket loads should have been paying an estimated tax. I have to check into this as I don't come across it often, and don't want to pass out bad info. 

Problem 5) this might not be a problem IDK enough about bitcoin to tell. You have to be able to prove when you bought your coins and for how much?  A detailed notebook will usually suffice, but the more back up the better. Especially given the price differences between the exchanges, and the MASSIVE AMOUNTS of volatility. Its not like BAC where I can go check the price at any given day.

Now if you lost your shirt in bitcoin you have a tax deduction, if this applies to anyone and you would like further info please let me know, as its kinda long winded. 

So that's just a few things their are some other considerations but that should suffice for now.

Like I said earlier if you don't like taxes and choose not to pay that's your business, just keep in mind the IRS has nailed some pretty smart criminals.

blah blah...THAT YOUR CONTINUING DISABILITY REVIEW(cdr) must be maintained at at least 5-7 years interval...
Social Security has time periods that they review people's case at, if you have a case less than 5-7 years guess what?! Your student loans according to this document, can be put back into effect.

A person on SSI must have a (CDR) of 5-7 years or the Student Loans can become back in effect!!
On the other side of that same form is a graphic of The family size poverty guidelines for a family of two. Which insinuates that you could work up to the guideline and still receive SSI/SSD...
However if you work at all, surely your SSI CDR period will instantly be changed to less than a 5-7 year review period.!!!

I am desperately seeking an answer to this inarticulately written posting No one without their own separate interest, or ""side""  ie. Social Security, Nelnet, Disabilitydischarge.com is available to  answer. and that in FAQ form only
..
I consider something I signed and dated a contract. 
Over the phone I have been orally told that 5-7 year CDR periold  doesn't apply to me and that I could work Part time.

I wish someone authoritatively would take an interest,

 btw I believe the problem arose when TPD was given in 2012 to those more recent who qualify for TPD simply by getting SSI/SSD.. and so, 

THEY must keep up their 5-7 year review periods, not us older grandfathered in who medically were examined substantially, still ---

That's not what this one-size- fits -all Post Discharge Monitoring Period ""contract"" states.
I am scared to even try to get a part time job! And I should be! and I sit here dead broke.

edit tldr.. Post Discharge Montioring Period paperwork has a number 4) added to it this year and is otherwise identical to other years.. 
It looks like a trap to me! ie. You can work up to a guideline, BUT if you work at all your designation will change(CDR review period of 5-7 years that must be maintained, will of course be changed to something lesser.
( I apologize folks, this Social Security stuff is no joke but is hard to convey)

This exact form affects millions who receive it and could use some clarification so people can go forth with confidence while attempting to better their circumstances and not be put through an ordeal

I can not pay off my loans and so, I would be put on a 25 year program by default, at today's interest rate not 2006 which is what I have...
all for trying to get part time work, and TICKET TO WORK won't necessarily save you from medical review  either!!  Your time period may well be changed from the 5-7 year that is mandatory to something lesser.

personalfinance,Early Retirement,"So I am 26 years old and landed a municipal government job this year.  I have a couple questions relating to how to set myself up to retire early.

My husband's employer puts 3% into his 401k (whether he puts anything in or not).  He is currently matching this 3% with 3% of his own.  He is looking to change jobs (he wants to also work for the municipal government) in the next year.  Should he stop contributing to his 401k?

The reason I ask that is because my employer offers a pension and a 457b plan.  If my husband happens to get a job with my employer, he can roll his 401k over to a 457b, but I'm thinking we might be better off opening a Roth IRA?

Also, the municipal government offers a pension.  Monthly payments from pension will equal 1/2 the average of the highest 48 months of salary (excluding OT).  I currently make $28,350ish, so if I never get another raise, I'd make a monthly pension of $1,181.25 per month.

If I retire early, the penalty is .5% per month before age 60, so retiring at age 50 would give me a monthly pension of $708.75 per month.

My husband and I own a house that will be paid off in 2041 (when we're 54).  Our mortgage balance is $54,863.20 and our interest rate is fixed 3.75% (FHA loan).

Since he's looking to change jobs soon and this new job would initially be a drop in pay (from ~$33k/year to ~$28k/year), I am worried about putting away too much money too soon.   I'm just slightly overwhelmed with everything. We both quit smoking a pack of cigarettes a day EACH, traded in/ refinanced our cars, and paid off 3/4 of our credit cards each month, so it feels like we have tons of money compared to what it was like before.

Also, when/if he gets this new job, he would eliminate his commute of 20 miles/day - we would both commute by bike (I already do) and would probably sell one of our cars.

Also, my background is in property management and we're both renovating our current house, so I am also internally debating buying some kind of house/duplex/apartments to rent out.  The market in my city is amazingly strong - for example, my husband and I could probably get $1,400/month for our 4BR house if we were to rent it out to college kids, or $1,000/month if we wanted someone to live there long term.

What should we do to set ourselves up in the best way possible?  I'm thinking max out an IRA and then contribute ""some"" to a 457b?  What kind of options do we have?

Bitcoin,Family of alleged Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht launches legal defense fund (x-post from /r/silkroad),"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Defense Fund Launched for Ross Ulbricht, Accused Silk Road Marketplace Operator

New York, NY, November 20, 2013 – The family of the man accused by the US government of operating the Silk Road online marketplace has launched a fund for donations to their son's legal defense.

Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested on October 1st and charged with creating and operating the web marketplace Silk Road, under the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts”. The allegations include a variety of conspiracies, including narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering, as well as planned acts of violence. Ulbricht denied all charges in federal court in San Francisco in October. He will appear at a bail hearing at the United States District Court, Southern District of New York at 11:00 am EST on Thursday, November 21.

On their website, the Ulbricht family states: “Our goal is to provide Ross with what every American citizen is promised: a fair trial. In the USA we are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We firmly believe in Ross’s innocence and are working hard with the best legal team to prove it.”

The family has retained New York-based attorney Joshua L. Dratel to defend their son in court. Mr. Dratel stated: “It is crucial that we have a level playing field for defending Ross, and that requires resources from the communities that support him.”

The Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund LLC is a Wyoming-based corporation established by the Ulbricht family. All donations are used solely to pay attorney fees, fund accounting fees and ancillary legal expenses.

What Is Money and Currency?

   Currency and Money is a medium of exchange that individuals can purchase or sell good of services with. Money is a note that represents some physical commodity like silver or gold. Currency is a note that is printed by a government and represents nothing. Currencies have value because people agree that they are worth something. Often, governments will print more currency to fund the government and wars; this causes inflation. 
Fiat currency today is very useful and can be digital (credit cards) or physical such as cash or coins. The United States used to issue money that was backed by gold and silver. Today banks and the Federal Reserve have to power to issue bonds and print money. The problem is that those bonds are sold and then need interest to be paid on them. This is where taxes can surge and create inflation. 

What Is Bitcoin?

   Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer decentralized digital currency that can be used as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin requires an internet connection to use since it is digital. Bitcoin is decentralized; this means that no one central authority controls it. The Bitcoin network is peer-to-peer; this means that many individuals run the Bitcoin software. Many people refer to Bitcoin as cash for the internet.
   Bitcoin is deflationary because there will only be 21,000,000 coins minted. This means that it is more like money because it is a commodity and it has a hard limit. The code for Bitcoin will stop generating Bitcoins in about 30-40 years depending on the network size and speed. The code limits the flow of Bitcoins into the network.
   Bitcoin is the first successful digital currency due to the block-chain. The block-chain is a public ledger that records all transactions that take place over the Bitcoin network. This prevents double spending and fraud. No other digital currencies were able to solve the double spending issue. The block-chain can be viewed by anyone to check transactions.
   Bitcoin is decentralized; this means that it has no owner to control it. Bitcoin is a protocol just like HTTP for the World Wide Web or SMTP for email. The Bitcoin protocol is open source so anyone can review it. If you review the source code you will see that no one person has more power than the next. When people invest in Bitcoin they believe in the code and that it will work long term.

Bitcoin Mining:

   People who support the Bitcoin network are considered miners. The miners have special computer hardware and software to essentially mine Bitcoins. The way that Bitcoins are mined is controlled by a math algorithm that becomes harder as Bitcoins are mined. A miner will have hardware brute force the algorithm to solve it. The first person to solve the equation gets awarded 25 Bitcoins that are sent to their Bitcoin wallet. A Bitcoin wallet is a software program that holds Bitcoins for you.
   Many miners mine in mining pools. The pool will gather resources and once the equation is solved, the coins will be distributed by how much every user contributed. A mining pool is ideal for someone who doesn’t have a significant amount of computing power.
   Miners also verify transactions across the network and collect small fees. This makes it possible to send money across the world for a fee to never be greater than $0.02 USD. You can send Bitcoins with no fees but the miners will not process them quickly. The flow of Bitcoins gets halved every four years. Once all of the Bitcoins have been mined miners will only receive transaction fees.

Who Created Bitcoin?

   Bitcoin was developed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi released the software in 2009. No one knows who this person is. He remains anonymous and hasn’t surfaced. This makes many people nervous about this currency but the software is open source so you can see that Satoshi has no power over anyone else.

Who Uses Bitcoin:

   The majority of people that hold Bitcoin right now are speculators, investors, gamblers. Very few use it for illicit activities. Since Bitcoin wallets are free and downloadable they can be obtained without giving out any personal information. This is why some users use it to buy illegal goods.
   Most people are hoarding their coins right now because they are hoping long term the price will increase by a lot. Bitcoin definitely has the potential but will have to overcome many obstacles to become mainstream.
Some stores are beginning to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. Recently I went to a subway in Allentown that accepts Bitcoin. I was featured in the newspaper and an online article since I was the first to pay in Bitcoin. My experience went well and I received free food for paying in 
Bitcoin.

Business Incentive to Accept Bitcoin:

   Businesses that should accept Bitcoin are small mom and pop shops. If you know anyone that owns a small business they will tell you they hate credit card companies. A lot of small businesses will have a minimum purchase limit for credit cards. As discussed earlier the fees for Bitcoin are very inexpensive. This will really help the bottom line for stores. Another great feature Bitcoin provides is no chargebacks. This means that a customer can’t come in and buy something with a credit card and then call his/her credit card company and claim they didn’t authorize the purchase. Small businesses take big hits in this area. Lastly Bitcoin is fraud free. Every Bitcoin user has to sign a transaction with a private key; this means fraud cannot be used.

Bitcoins V.S. Credit Cards:

   Bitcoins have the potential to take over the credit card industry. Many companies pay thousands of dollars a year to accept credit cards. These companies ultimately make more money by doing this but Bitcoin is the better solution. Bitcoin transactions are almost instant and since the network is peer-to-peer the coins go straight from buyer to seller. This also provides better security from third parties not needing to be involved. Bitcoins can only perform push transactions which users prefer over pull transactions.

Bitcoin V.S. Western Union:

   Western Union is a company that let’s individuals send money across borders. Western Union takes a big cut out of transfers. A transfer of money through western union can take days to weeks. Bitcoin lets you do the same service that Western Union provides with a fee never greater than $0.02 USD and it’s instant. Currently Western Union is worth $11.5 billion USD. If Bitcoin takes over this market the implied price per Bitcoin is $966 USD.

Bitcoin V.S. Gold:

   Bitcoin has many properties similar to gold; many claim Bitcoin to be gold 2.0. Gold enthusiasts are attracted to Bitcoin because Bitcoin is deflationary. Bitcoin takes heavy resources to mine. And unlike gold, you can divide it and send it anywhere in the world instantly. Many investors of gold have flocked to Bitcoin due to the recent scare of asteroid mining. Bitcoin is also impossible to counterfeit; no one can simply code new Bitcoins as the miners will ignore them. Bitcoins are also divisible up to eight places after the decimal point.

Bitcoin Micro Payments:

   One big advantage to a currency with such small fees is micro transactions. This will be a great for bloggers and anyone who wants to accept tips. Currently today micro transactions are pointless due to high fees. I believe that soon online news site will allow small donations for people who like the article to generate revenue that was never possible before Bitcoin. Soon Bitcoins could be used for self-driving cars to travel faster and pass cars; I will discuss this in more detail later.

Bitcoin in Suppressed Countries:

   In many suppressed countries Bitcoin provides many great features. In many suppressed countries individuals don’t have access to basic banking; with Bitcoin, you can have a bank on your phone (including dumb phones). Also many suppressed countries have greedy governments who will take money from its people. With Bitcoin you can encrypt your wallet with SHA-256 encryption or greater. Governments won’t be able to pull money from wallets since they are push transaction only.

What can you buy with Bitcoin?

   Today you can buy many things with Bitcoin: gift cards, subway subs, alpaca socks, gold, silver, sushi, pizza, and many more. Merchants are finally starting to accept Bitcoin world-wide. Bitcoin has the potential to go main stream due to its features. Bitcoins should be accepted by merchant worldwide based on my finding recently discussed. 

Future Possibilities:

   Many claim the Bitcoin has not hit its real potential or anywhere close to it. Many say that Bitcoin needs a “killer app” for it to go main stream. One example of a “killer app” would be what the World Wide Web did for the internet. Some brilliant ideas have already been discussed. One is autonomous corporations. An autonomous corporation would live in the cloud and be ran or owned by no one. It could shop for hosting services and even spawn itself on many different hosts. A service that would use this could be file storage. It would be very cheap and secure to use a service like this. 
    Another great idea is for future self-driven cars to utilize a service like this. With an autonomous corporation running the cars it will be very safe. Imagine you wake up late for work; you could take advantage of micro payments and pay a couple cents to pass other cars to get there more quickly. The slower cars could then accept the tips based on their preference of speed. 


Conclusion:

   In conclusion Bitcoin is an open source digital currency that has no boarders and is owned and operated by no central authority. Bitcoin has the potential to overtake many markets due to low friction transactions and its speed of transactions. Hopefully many new innovations will be made with Bitcoin. Bitcoin also has the potential to change the world if it catches on.

And, I certainly understand why people would prefer using bitcoin for Silk Road type transactions.

But, for the average joe, is there any advantage to using bitcoin?

You can't even argue that anonymity is an advantage, because (unless you're buying bitcoins locally), you're giving out your banking info to the online company you're buying your bitcoins from (i.e. coinbase.com)

At the moment, bitcoin has very limited utility. Few places accept it, and I can't pay my utility bills with it, gas up my car with it, or buy groceries with it.

To boot, its price is volatile and unstable, at least during this price discovery phase.

Bitcoin,"When, if ever, will Satoshis become the unit used to refer to Bitcoins?","I was talking to a friend last night who was amazed at how well I have fared with my Bitcoin investment in the past few months. At the beginning he scoffed at me, and now, after reading the news of the craziness the past few weeks, he is asking more serious questions.

However, in talking with him and a few other people that are completely new to Bitcoin, I have noticed that ~$600+/coin seems like too much for them to jump in with. They always say ""man, I wish I could have bought when it was &lt;$225 like you, but $600 is just way too much.""

This is what my friend said last night. I went on to explain to him that the smallest unit, the Satoshi, is only ~$0.0000063, meaning $1 buys you ~158730.15 satoshis. That would be worth $158.73 if Bitcoin were to reach $100k/coin like some speculate (while others have even speculated up to $1M/coin.)

I find it hard to imagine people wanting to jump in on Bitcoin staring at a $1k+ price per coin, but buying into Satoshis at $.0001 seems like a real bargain!

Others my have talked about this before, but it still doesn't seem very commonplace. What do you guys think?

**TL;DR: People might be a lot more interested in getting started with bitcoin with the far less intimidating price tag of the Satoshi unit as Bitcoin climbs in price. Will this ever be the norm?**

**Edit:**
So, this is anecdotal, and very simple math, but I had fun thinking about it

At $10,000/BTC, a Satoshi is worth $0.00001 (or, .001 cent.) Making your $4 beer .0004BTC, or 40,000 Satoshis.

$100,000/BTC = $4 beer/ .00004BTC beer/ 4,000 Satoshi beer.

What I was getting at, was at what point (not point in time per se, but hypothetical price in BTC) will communicating the decimal places in BTC's value be less convenient than communicating the number of thousands of Satoshis for the cost of an average purchase?

I think any more than three zeroes after the decimal to communicate one dollar figure will start to get annoying to say and over-trying to the average person's (especially if you're here in the US) math ability. 

So to answer my own question, I think Satoshis would become the dominant denomination of BTC for every day exchanges at the $10,000/BTC point, if it were to ever happen.",cryptocurrency,1384973757

They focused on this paragraph

""My personal guess is that the U.S. market, especially the non-blue chips, will work its way higher, perhaps by 20% to 30% in the next year or, more likely, two years, with the rest of the world including emerging market equities covering even more ground in at least a partial catch-up."" 

His real takeaway is

""In the meantime investors should be aware that the U.S. market is already badly overpriced – indeed, we believe it is priced to deliver negative real returns over seven years – and that most foreign markets having moved up rapidly this summer are also overpriced but less so. In our view, prudent investors should already be reducing their equity bets and their risk level in general. One of the more painful lessons in investing is that the prudent investor (or ""value investor"" if you prefer) almost invariably must forego plenty of fun at the top end of markets. This market is already no exception, but speculation can hurt prudence much more and probably will. Ah, that's life. And with a Fed like ours it's probably what we deserve.""",finance,1384973578

economy,The economy is fucked up,"Below is a little blurb I sent a friend who needed help with a paper. Thought I'd share it here as well. 

I believe equities (the S&amp;P 500, DOW, NASDAQ, etc.) are all pretty significantly overvalued. This view is shared by many other people, but others will tell you this is not true and equities have plenty of room before they hit a ceiling. To validate my claim I'll give you three data points; the participation rate,  the growth of the S&amp;P 500 alongside the Federal Reserve's Balance sheet since their expansionary policies started in 2009, and Caterpillar's (the industrial machine producer) historical revenue charts vs. nominal GDP.

Participation rate (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-11-08/whopping-932000-americans-drop-out-labor-force-october-labor-participation-rate-drop) : What this data point illustrates is that the amount of people who are able to participate in the workforce has fallen to 35 year lows. This is not because people are lazy or well off enough to not work, it means people have given up on finding a job because their prospects are so dismal. Once people drop out of the ""workforce"", which is defined as people that are currently employed or actively looking for jobs, they are not counted when unemployment numbers are calculated. This grossly underestimates the actual number of people that are out of work in the US. An interesting thing to note here is that the last time the participation rate was this low women were not commonly in the workforce. Only after 1978 did women start entering the corporate world in full force. Over the course of 30+ years with men and women in the workforce, families got accustomed to consumption lifestyles with two incomes. Today we have fallen back to the levels of the late 1970's when people were living off of one person's salary, yet people maintain their two income lifestyles. On top of this, logically, just think about it. With this many people out of the workforce there will be a lot less people making money to spend on goods from companies represented in these equities markets. Yet, markets are at all time highs and still climbing? Why, against all logic, is this happening? QE, that's why.

The Fed's balance sheet vs. the S&amp;P 500 (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-11-15/mission-almost-accomplished-sp-500-nears-bernankes-1800-year-end-target) : Since the Fed started easing their policy by ""printing"" money (they actually just go to a computer and type in the new amount of money now in the markets, out of thin air) and buying all sorts of financial securities from banks, equities markets have been on a tear. Markets have been screaming for the last 3 years with the S&amp;P up more than 20% YoY and currently at all time highs. Are companies really doing that well with the underlying economy doing so poorly? No, they are not. The whole reasoning behind QE was to get money to the middle class; i.e. the Fed would ""print"" money, give it to the banks, and the banks would then lend it to small businesses and people so that they could conduct commerce and get money flowing throughout the economy. Instead, the banks have been hoarding the cash and speculating in markets, especially equities markets. If you look at the second chart in the link above, you will see an almost perfect correlation between the S&amp;P 500 and the expansion of the Fed's balance sheet this year. The trend is similar for the 3 years prior as well. To me, it is painstakingly obvious that equities are only at all time highs because of pure speculation. The underlying economy does not justify these numbers. Equities are due for a BIG correction. What will pop the bubble? No one knows, but I believe it will be the student loan bubble. (I will forward you an email I sent Connor on student loans yesterday). 

Caterpillar's historical revenue vs. Nominal GDP (http://screencast.com/t/hCBghoCQcVw) : I threw this data point in because I think this relationship is very simple and interesting and the causation can be pretty clear. Caterpillar produces all the heavy machinery that build roads and consume construction sites around the world. If their revenue stream is high it means countries, companies and/or people are investing in infrastructure and people are building things, which means a lot of people are working on those sites and people believe that, when finished, those sites will be filled by businesses that create more jobs. If Caterpillar's revenues are low, or even negative, it means quite the opposite. Businesses do not have enough faith to build new buildings that will provide people with jobs. The people the use the heavy machinery at these sites won't have jobs because no one is building anything, and from there it can be a cascading effect. If you look at the chart, our current economic situation should be apparent. Equities prices are unjustifiable right now and are severely over-priced. The only thing propping markets up is the Fed's ""printing"". 

It's a house of cards. Very sad, and somewhat scary.

personalfinance,"Student loans with the gov, student loans with collections...whats a boy to do? please help","I've done some searching around reddit for an answer and if I've found one it's been in language that I don't understand, so I apologize if I'm asking a dumb and easily answered question.  That being said I graduated in 2005 with somewhere north of 100k student loan debt, I've basically been childish and done exactly nothing about it until now and I find myself in need of some advice, or aid even in what questions I should be asking.

My student loans seem to be split, I have 69852 @2.875% interest currently with the dept of education along with 3 different loans at a collection agency.  Those loans are currently a perkins loan for 11716 @5%; a private loan for 23371 @5% and an ""accounts receivable"" for 21691 @5%

I have yet to make a payment, or consolidate anything, the collection agent I've talked to is trying to get me to consolidate the perkins loan with the dept of ed. Loan and she recommends I put that into forbearance while I work on the private loans/acct receivable.  My kneejerk reaction is to get whatever information I can from the collection agent and then assume she's trying to screw me over.  I also just ran across the loanconsolidation.ed.gov site and now I'm looking at the income contingent repayment plan but I can't find anything to tell me if that would just be for the dept of ed loan, or if I should consolidate my perkins loan with that, or if there's anything to be done with all of the debt I have in total.  

I'm also assuming that because my private loan(s) are in a collection agency there's not much more I can do except pay the loan off to the collection agency, since they are private is this something that I can negotiate down at all?  I'm guessing there's not federal loan type of rehabilitation for private loans? 


I apologize if this is rambling or nonsensical, as you can tell this is far from an area that I can consider my expertise.

edit: forgotten information: i have about 5k in savings i earn about 3200-3500/month avg before taxes (it varies paycheck to paycheck b/c i work as a server) 

rent is 788 

phone 90

internet 60

insurance 150

electricity 100-160

food 250-300

drink/entertainment probably around 250-400 (yes this will obviously be cut way down now that i am going to be paying off loans)

for the past 6 months i've been partying hard as its my first time not living paycheck to paycheck and the leftovers i've put into savings, i wanted at least some amount of savings before i started taking care of the heavy lifting (loans)

what i'm really looking for is practical advise, should i consolidate my perkins loan with my other federal loan, possibly under the income contingent repayment.

dumb question but do i really just start cutting checks to the collection agency?

is there some option or advice that i have clearly not considered and/or questions that i should be asking.",finance,1384972208

Bitcoin,The problems.,"So I was reading the thread with Senator Moran and noticed something that is also noticeable in this subreddit and almost all bitcoin related discussions, and that is no one seems to discuss the problems with bitcoin. Everyone loves to go on about how bitcoin is the currency of the future and how awesome it is... but no one seems to discuss the problems and how they will be addressed.

So here is some problems I have seen mentioned around the place.

The obvious start point of course is that the speculation has created a massive bubble that will burst. This is obviously a very bad thing for a currency. BTC will very much be a niche currency unless the volatility can be controlled... but without a central authority there is no way to do this. If for some reason the value does stabilize then you still have the problem of there being absolutely nothing preventing the exact same thing happening again. Because of this BTC will never be a trustworthy currency. People look for stability in a currency and despite various claims (including on the sidebar), evidence suggests BTC is not going to be stable.

BTC is not the first decentralized currency. How they are issued is new but that will not solve the issues the comes with a decentralized currency. 

With no central authority BTC is susceptible to manipulation. Hoarders and miners can group together and have tremendous control of the value. There is massive incentive to do this, something you do not want in a currency.

No guarantee. My $20 note is worth $20 because the Australian government backs it. Now while there is a small chance that will not be the case tomorrow it is incredible unlikely. BTC has no backing. It comes down to trust between its users. There is no protection against millions or even billions of dollars worth of BTC being absolutely worthless when you wake up in the morning... again this is not something you want in a currency, stability and confidence are big.  

There are more problems, but I will leave it here for now. Before I get accused of being some BTC hater, I would like to say I am very much in favor of a digital global currency and think BTC does some things very well. In saying that I also believe history has taught us the decentralized currency is not going to work, you need good monetary policy.",cryptocurrency,1384937944

investing,How do the best investors succeed?,"I figured there is a lot written and read about Buffett, Munger et al . So over the last few months i have been reading about some of the greatest investors the world has seen but those not often talked about. This includes:

Julian Robertson
Joe Steinberg and Ian Cumming of Leucedia
Joel Greenbalt
Howard Marks of Oaktree
Rales brothers of Danaher Corp
and Carl Icahn of Icahn Enterprises

Surprisingly, some like the Rales brothers’ Danaher Corp has outperformed Buffett’s Berkshire Hathway in the last 3,5,10 and 15 years! Trust me, they are all the real deal.

What i was really keen to find out was, are there any common threads to the kind of businesses these guys (and Buffett, Munger) own, or a common investment philosophy and so on.

Of course it was very clear very soon to me that the only way these guys have succeeded is by exploiting inefficiencies in the markets and individual stocks time and again. That is all they did, repeatedly.Not only that, they have all done well across different macro environments. In other words, these guys did stunningly well just picking inefficiently priced stocks all through all kinds of debacles like the asian currency crisis, 9/11, crude going to $150, the once in a lifetime 2008 financial crisis etc.

Having read them, I concluded that the motto of investment success is this: try and find mis-priced individual bets in all kinds of macro environments. And repeat.

It sounds very simplistic at first but i think its very very profound. But that’s really the easy part: theorizing how these guys succeeded.

The bigger insight i was looking for was, how do they identify mis-pricing? It isn’t easy. Let’s think about this – so you have a business called Mispriced Inc and its quoting at a price to book of 0.7 and a PE of 4. These (and other) numbers are there for everyone to see and theoretically if the mispricing is really obvious the business should very quickly trade at or near or above fair value.

But in reality, this doesn’t happen. The mispricing is rarely apparent to me and you. There is always something to worry about. Its only these investors that see the prices and situations differently, understand that it is probably mispriced and start buying – sometimes continue buying across multiple months (or years) while it remains mispriced before eventually moving to fair value and making a neat return for these ""genius"" investors.

How do they manage to see things differently than the rest of us?

Howard Marks spoke for all his peers and summarized this for us in three simple words: Second Level Thinking.

Marks’ contention is that a lot of people do first-level thinking, but very few can or do second-level thinking. First-level thinking is things like, "" Wow, this is a nice store and it’s crowded; let’s buy the stock!"" or some such thing.

Here is one of Mark’s examples:

First-level thinking says, ""The outlook calls for low growth and rising inflation. Let’s dump our stocks."" Second-level thinking says, ""The outlook stinks, but everyone else is selling in panic. Buy!""

This is super profound. First level thinking ( or jumping to conclusions) is all around us:

""This stock is at 40 times earnings, so it must be a bad investment.""

""This stock is at 4 times earnings, so its definitely a great buy""

"" The governor will raise interest rates, i should definitely sell all my stocks""

Also bubbles in the past occur partly due to the masses stuck in first-level thinking:

1999: The internet will change the world, let’s buy internet stocks!

2007: China will grow forever, let’s buy Chinese stocks!

You can go back and look at all the bubbles and you will see a lot of first-level thinking as the cause of many of them.
After a few people made huge killings in the subprime bubble collapse, everyone seems to be looking for the next great trade by calling the macro. Right now we’re all stuck in this first level thinking ""Fed will taper and our markets will crash.""

Second level thinking is: ""Yes Fed would eventually taper but isn’t that known to everyone? How much impact do known events generally have on prices? Should i really bother so much about it or should i just go about picking quality businesses that are mis priced?""

Listen to CNBC or read the business section of newspapers, all of media is full of first level thinking. They just state the obvious conclusions. FIIs are fleeing our markets, so you should sell too and so on.

If we want to outperform, we have to practice second level thinking. Contemplate on these:

"" Could Page Industries be a great buy at 40 times current year when everyone says its expensive?""

"" Infra and Realty stocks are so cheap right now. Are they really bargains?""

""PSU Banks are trading at 8% yield, they are definitely a buy.""

The only way to make serious money is to have what Michael Steinhardt calls ""Variant Perception"" and this variant perception (a view different from the general crowd) can originate only by practicing second level thinking.

So the next time you’re buying a stock, stop and observe if you’ve put in any second level thinking into it (do i have an insight the market is not pricing in) that makes the current price inefficient.

So look at your portfolio today and for each stock you own, really validate if you have an intelligent variant perception derived by second level thinking. This is the only way our investments can meaningfully succeed.

Bitcoin,Some thoughts on Mercedes Kelly Tunstall's Testimony,"We need, as a community, to take her testimony very seriously.  There is a very specific vision being outlined here for virtual currencies that undermines just about everything the movement here has stood for, as well as the significant monetary investments made in bitcoin hitherto.  

The fundamental insight guiding her testimony is the following:

The technological innovation behind the solution to the double spend problem is independent of the other features of bitcoin and other virtual currencies that make them attractive to libertarian sympathisers.  Since it's the solution to the double spend problem that allows for direct exchange and lower transaction costs - one can take that solution and obtain its benefits, without any of the libertarian cruft, by implementing a bitcoin 2.0 (Tunstall refers to them as next generation virtual currencies).  This 2.0 version will remove whatever aspects of the first version that are considered to undermine the existing regime (it's deflationary nature, semi-anonymity etc).

The encouraging other testimonies (particularly from Ms. Jennifer Shasky Calvery) notwithstanding - I fear there is a very strong chance that this will be the ultimate vision pursued by the powers that be.  And if we don't take this possibility very seriously - then we will get completely blindsided.

What are the chances of such an approach being taken - and succeeding?  

Starting with the first.  Currently, I see the chances as high (but I would like to hear arguments to the contrary).  Why?  Tax.  If theses hearing really clarified anything, then it's the fact that it's not so much the silk road's of the world that bother authorities, law enforcement seems confident at being able to keep a lid on that - it's the issue about taxation.  How are governments going to collect tax on bitcoin transactions?  And I didn't see any concrete answers in any of the testimonies on this issue (correct me if I'm wrong).  Governments are self-interested entities and they will move to protect their interests - i.e. their revenue.

If, to solve this issue, they move to introduce a bitcoin 2.0 that more easily protects their revenue - how likely would it succeed?  I also think it highly likely - at least, if they moved quickly.  Going forward, I'm not so sure as the growing network effect of bitcoin adoption make it more difficult.  But consider - if all the major banks and government agencies throw their weight behind a competing virtual currency - throw massive marketing and development budgets, while at the same time tightening the screws on bitcoin exchanges (with the banks and government agencies already seemingly doing this to some extent), I don't see how bitcoin could survive.  The average joe will pick the currency that is the easiest to use.

What can we do to avoid this?

If we can demonstrate that taxation won't be significantly affected by bitcoin's existing structure then a large amount of wind will be taken out of the sails of those pushing for a 2.0 bitcoin.  (I personally don't think that relying on the network effects of bitcoin adoption will be enough.  The exchanges are too easy to squeeze.)  We could get away with slipping into the mainstream what is an otherwise substantially libertarian protocol if we can just satisfy the government in this one respect.

But is this feasible?  Can we make a convincing case that bitcoin won't allow anymore tax evasion than current systems?  If not, what aspects of bitcoin could be retained?  Is it the case that we would have to give up the degree of anonymity currently allowed by bitcoin?  Is it worth it to give up anonymity if it means we get to slip in a deflationary currency into the mainstream?

I don't think I've said anything new here - but I really feel these questions have greater urgency now.  What do we care about essentially?

1) Making money only?  Then bitcoin 2.0 all the way.

2) Being able to avoid the strictures and regulations of governments (corrupt and repressive or otherwise?)  - then bitcoin must preserve anonymity.

3) Usurping the federal reserve system that taxes us through inflation?  Then we must protect the deflationary aspect of bitcoin.


We might have to admit to ourselves that we might not be able to achieve all three.  But if we do admit this and realise that the powers that being are really worried about 2) right now - then we might get away with sneaking a victory for 3).

Also whether it makes for better credit score to pay off the higher interest one (~$1800 @ 5.66 variable) and keep making payments on the lower interest one ($5500 @ 4.16%) and throw more money at the house down payment savings or to pay both off and be done with student loans and then divert all the extra scratch I have to a down payment.  I'm trying to avoid paying PMI at all costs.  I currently have a stable job making $38000/yr salary and some side work that brings in another 5-10k/yr but is considerably less stable.

Certainly paying both private loans off have guaranteed returns and will free up an extra $140 minimum per month (just paying off just the higher interest one will free up $50/mo), and there's no way my savings account is going to have returns exceeding 4.16% on &lt;3k of cash.  My concern is that I have a few late payments on both loans and I'm wondering if its worth the interest to keep making on time payments to bump up my credit score, or if it will even matter in the &lt;1 years time before I'd like to be taking on a mortgage.",finance,1385078386

Could use a little advice.,"My original plan out of high school was to attend community college for two years, transfer to my state school, graduate, and then enter law. Well, as luck would have it the bottom in law fell out. I was stuck with a 'useless' honors degree in Political Science/Int'l Relations. Fast forward three years to today - I'm almost 26 years old and it doesn't seem like the economy is going to come around anytime soon. In the meantime I've traveled and worked a bunch of dead-end jobs, but I'm sick of meaningless administrative work. I want a career. Politics definitely isn't for me.

economy,Why is there so much US currency in circulation now?,"Federal Reserve data suggest the nominal value of circulating currency roughly tripled 1994-2012.  And that a 2012 was worth $0.65 in 1994 terms.  Together this means a 92% increase in the total currency value during those 18 years.

It's evident that individuals use less of this paper than they did a couple of decades ago.  Indeed I'd have expected this decreasing demand to have offset the 21% population increase during the period.  My instinct would have been that the value of the currency supply would have remained constant, or maybe decreased slightly.

Why not?  Is it due to a massive increase in hoarding?  If China was warehousing a couple of hundred billion, and each US adult had $1000 *more than they did in 1994* in cookie jars/mattresses, it would barely account for the increased supply.",finance,1385066604

My money right now is all in my Navy Federal account. I put 3000$ in my savings, I have around 980$ in my checking, and around 1020$ in an 'easystart certificate' that pays 3% interest per year, money cant be taken out until august 2014, a year from when it started. 

I make 600 dollars per paycheck, every two weeks, and once a month i put 122 dollars in my easystart certificate. Before my paychecks they already take 170$ out for my thrift savings plan which is basically a military IRA. So with 1200 my expenses are almost 0. The only things I really need to pay for are my phone, toilet paper, and hygiene gear, the rest of the money is pocket money, food is paid for. What I have been doing and hope to continue doing is give myself 15$ a day physically in cash and not spend on my debit card except in an emergency.

* I will probably get ~$700 in graduation gifts (based on what I remember my siblings getting)

So, with the above, I was thinking a decent way to supplement my income until I get my job and a signing bonus would be a 0 APR credit card with a 12-15 month introductory period until they jack it up to like 24%.

Bitcoin,"I posted this on the seekingalpha thread, trying to suss out what I think the monetary system will *actually* look like should bitcoin become the world reserve currency. Thoughts?","That is not the correct way to think of dollars, because it rests upon a notion of ""total dollar supply"" that is pretty hard to pin down. Obviously measuring the money supply is something economists have thought about long and hard. But it's still not clear cut. I learned a lot from this Coursera class on banking: https://www.coursera.org/course/money. That's not to say I think the professor is the ultimate authority. Far from it. But a valuable takeaway from the class is to think of money as a hierarchy, or perhaps a pyramid, where height corresponds to liquidity (up) versus illiquidity (down), and width corresponds to the amount. Thus one has base money (cash) at the top [or during some historical periods, the underlying commodity, such as gold/silver, backing the currency], and below it assets such as demand deposits, bank notes, money market mutual funds, short term government securities, and so forth. All of it is money. You might like to think of the stuff at the very top as the most money-like, but the fact is companies can and do exchange stuff further down the hierarchy in just the same way they exchange cash or electronic bank balances. As you go further down the hierarchy, you get to assets such as debt with longer maturity. The relative value of the various levels of the hierarchy - even the most liquid levels at the top, once you factor in opportunity costs - is thus inherently intertwined with expectations of inflation and interest rates, including expectations of the behavior of central bankers who wish to guide those rates. Thus it's totally naive to think of dollars as a % fraction of some money supply growing steadily at some rate of inflation and earning some smaller rate of interest of banks. That may be how consumers interact with the monetary system, but it's not at all how the monetary system ultimately works. By the way, the coursera class goes into a lot of historical perspective, and it's certainly NOT the case that this complicated monetary system is an innovation since the end of the gold standard. (Not to mention the fact that the US left the gold standard during the Civil War, and other such complexities... :). As long as the concept of money has existed, the fact that money now and money later are different assets with different values has been a part of the world. So there have been bankers (or proto-bankers) practically forever. Even when gold reigned supreme as the ultimate form of money, it was still the case that ""the money supply"" and the monetary system comprised far more than the supply of gold bars or doubloons.
In short, you are wrong that bitcoin will replace savings accounts, in the sense that credit -- the substitution of more liquid monetary assets for less liquid ones, with the loss in liquidity compensated for by a commensurate rate of return -- will certainly remain a feature of an economy with widespread bitcoin use. The interesting question, which I think no one knows the answer to, is what credit markets and the banking system will really look like in such a world. The blockchain technology itself offers extremely interesting possibilities as a tool for intermediating credit markets, not just direct transfers of money (at a fixed level of the liquidity hierarchy) from one party to another. It will be fascinating to see how it plays out.
All that having been said, I firmly reject the ""goldbug"" argument for bitcoin -- that it is a step towards running our economy on a ""sound money"" basis. That seems like an incredibly far fetched scenario. The reasons it is far fetched include some of the arguments made by (narrowminded) opponents of bitcoin who decry it as a ""deflationary currency"". If bitcoin were to be the top of the money hierarchy in the future -- the single most liquid asset -- what then? Would people be paying for all their everyday purchases in bitcoin? I fail to see why they would. In this scenario the banking system would probably evolve to incorporate bitcoin. As long as banks think they can invest bitcoins at a rate of return higher than the rate at which bitcoins appreciate, they will accept bitcoin deposits and pay interest in return, probably through some sort of cryptographically-verified blockchain-based contract system. Such contracts would include provisions specifying under what circumstances the creditor (depositor) would be unable to recover their bitcoin, for example if the bank were to go bust. Just as in our current system, and perhaps relying upon something similar to the existing FDIC infrastructure, we might arrive at a situation in which many or even most consumers accept the risk of bank failure in return for sufficiently high interest. In that case people would keep the bulk of their money in the form of ""bitcoin demand deposits"", which they draw upon in much the same way we use debit cards etc today. (Although to keep consumers happy, depository institutions would have to offer far better service in this regard than banks do today, since the ease of use of such forms of bitcoin credit would have to compete with the use of bitcoin itself for transactions.)
Once you have that sort of scenario, the ultimate supply of money in the bitcoin economy is vastly bigger than the 21M bitcoins themselves. In short, you arrive at the same sort of complex monetary system we have today, just founded upon the blockchain instead of the US government's say-so. From this perspective, the ""bitcoin is inherently deflationary"" objection evaporates: the supply of money in this economy would be governed by many factors, including interest rates, deposit insurance prices, etc., some which could even be influenced by governments who wish to prop up aggregate demand during recessions. So from the perspective of someone happy with the current banking system, I'd say there's no reason to worry. But from a goldbug perspective, I have to say I don't think bitcoin will really solve your problems -- ""unsound money"", which just means money that interacts with credit markets and encompasses a supply that can expand and contract as those markets dictate, has always been here and will never go away.
Now it's still worth emphasizing that a monetary system (writ large) based upon a bitcoin backbone probably will still look very different from what we have today. I do think that basic features (banking, credit, etc.) will still be here. But the details may be surprising. For example, banks may be a lot smaller or a lot bigger, they may have a lot more or a lot less political power, the flow of credit may change a lot in favor either debtors or creditors. Who knows? The payment processing role of banks will certainly change drastically. If you have the option of transacting using bitcoins -- with their decentralized nature -- or instead using bitcoin-based demand deposits that must be cleared through some quasi-centralized network of banks, I think it's likely you'd prefer the former, all else being equal. (After all, avoiding central clearing is what makes bitcoin transactions so smooth today, relative to normal payments processing.) But you might choose to use the inferior system for some transactions, if you were compensated for the inconvenience. In other words, to attract deposits, banks would have to offer more attractive interest rates. Might they be able to do so? Sure, if they had sufficiently attractive investment opportunities. But who knows if that's a gap that can be bridged.
Today banks play the role of payment processors because they are the de facto standard. I keep some USD in bank accounts not because it pays positive real interest rates, but because I value having that money in liquid form. Part of the liquidity is the banks' role in the payment network. In the bitcoin world, that built-in advantage for banks -- their ability to fund their businesses on debt (to their depositors) at very low cost -- disappears. Conceivably, without that advantage, banking will cease to be a profitable business. But equally conceivably, banking will persist as a less profitable business. Personally, I think the latter possibility is more likely. In that case the world might look like I've sketched above -- similar to our current monetary system in many ways, yet fundamentally changed in others. If this world arises, the ""fixed divisible supply"" nature of bitcoin may seem like a peculiar thing to have been obsessing about during the early days.",cryptocurrency,1385000962

personalfinance,Please Help A Stupid Person,"I am a 25 year old college graduate with many of the ""regular"" issues of someone my age with some bad choices on top. First I will lay out my financial situation in summary:

**Income:**

Roughly $2,000 take home a month with some help from monthly gas reimbursements from work averaging about $200

**Debts (here we go):**

* Student Loans: I have roughly $5k in private loans that I am paying off as well as a consolidated loan that is about $55k. I have been paying on the private loan since college but have been sparingly paying on the consolidated loan as the interest rates ended up being higher than I expected and the income based payment is still too high for me to afford.

* Car Loan: I basically made the dumb decision to trade in a mostly okay paid off care when I graduated college and got my first job. After various bad decisions I am not upside down on a car. The loan is about $15k (the car is worth about $11k) and I am paying roughly $370 a month.

* Credit Cards: I currently have 3 credit cards and 1 outstanding line of credit. My credit card debts are as follows - AmEx = $3,500 Capitol One = $1,800 Chase = $300. The line of credit is from Best Buy and is about $700 with 0% interest until late next year.

For my month-to-month money I pay about $230 a month for rent and about $100 in utilities (I am currently splitting rent/utilities with 2 of my friends). I have car insurance that is about $70 a month also.

Can anyone even begin to give me advice on how to wrangle this all in? I realize that a better job would help but that is an ongoing project. I know I made stupid decisions and the last thing I need is for that to be rubbed in more. I am willing to provide more info (to a point) if it helps. Thank you.",finance,1384999683

Bitcoin,keynesian altcoin concept,"A common criticism that economically inclined folks have leveled at Bitcoin is that it is prone to [deflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation) or [deflationary spirals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deflationary_spiral]deflationary spirals). The Keynesian approach to this perceived problem is to increase or decrease money supply until inflation reaches a target rate. Individuals who believe this is necessary for a useful currency have argued that this is only possible with a centralized controller of the money supply.

 
It occurs to me that it might be possible to create a keynesian decentralized virtual currency somewhat like Bitcoin, where the difficulty adjusts to keep coins generating at a specified rate which is in turn adjusted based on information about coin value over time. The difference with this new currency would be that rather than having the target coin generation rate follow a predetermined schedule, the coin generation rate would be tied to coin purchasing power in some clever way. One way to achieve this would be for the protocol to intelligently scrape information about global exchange rates and try to regulate the average exchange rate between different world currencies to some constant. Alternatively purchasing power information is fed by miners somehow and there is a reward in coins depending on how close the information matches the average information being fed from around the world. This way there is an incentive to not skew the data, and it would be difficult to form a &gt;50% group willing to pump inaccurate purchasing power information into the network.

 
Both kinds regulatory mechanisms listed above are rather naive and could result in the network being fooled by attackers into generating coins at strange rates.

[*disclaimer1: I realize I am referring to a ""distributed network"" as being capable of various things, this is hypothetical for the sake of starting with conceptualization.*]

 
A better mechanism starts with the concept of [implied volatility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_volatility). If the network could ""sell"" contracts relating to coins for coins to network participants, self-interested network participants will buy these derivatives or options contracts at different prices depending on their beliefs about the future vs current purchasing power of a coin. 

 
A simple example(network issuing ""bonds""): consider a contract where the network sells a fixed number of bonds for 1 coin with a 0.1 coin per year return, and some of bonds for 1 coin with a 0.09 coin per year return and so on down to arbitrarily small returns. If the coins are inflationary, say purchasing power is decreasing by 5% a year, participants will be willing to put many coins into the 0.1 coin return per year but much fewer coins in the 0.05 or lower return bonds(as they would rather spend the coins than buy a bond that loses value). If the coins are deflationary, users will be willing to put more coins in a lower return bonds. The network monitors the distribution of bond purchases at different prices and determined something about the expected future value of coins compared to their current value. If participants are buying up the bonds available at all return levels a deflationary state is implied, and the network decreases difficulty until the purchase rate of lower interest bonds starts to decrease, the network difficulty is basically adjusted with some kind of negative feedback control with respect to the deviation from a certain reference bond buying distribution that corresponds to the desired inflation rate.

 
Another way of implementing essentially the same feedback mechanism above is for the network to allow participants to pay coins for slightly decreased mining difficulty for a certain address. This creates similar incentives to the bond scenario, letting the network hold onto your coins in exchange for small returns in the form of more coins mined tells the network something about how the value of coins is changing over time depending on the equilibrium purchase rates of different lowered mining difficulties, and again the network can apply negative feedback to drive the equilibrium on ""mining bond purchases"" to a price which implies the desired inflation rate.

 
I believe that better solutions exists involving a more sophisticated set of derivative trades between participants and network, which would give the network much more reliable information about value projections of participants, allowing cleaner feedback on coin generation rate, along with providing mechanisms for eliminating coins. Assuming the participants are rational economic actors, these mechanisms would allow the network to regulate to a nearly constant coin value over time using only information derived from network activity.

What does everyone think? Is there economic sense to these ideas,(assuming the reader is a keynesian, for the sake of argument) and if so would it be possible to implement them in a distributed protocol? 

[*disclaimer2: I am not a keynesian, I do not claim inflation is desirable. What I am proposing are some top level details for a system that would allow for the network regulation of deflation/inflation rate. I used keynesian concepts to provide a familiar starting point for the discussion of this altcoin concept, with the keynesian example being special case of inflation/deflation regulation. Bitcoin does not regulate inflation/deflation and tends to undergo uncontrolled deflation due to slowly growing, fixed or diminishing money supply with an unknown amount of coins being lost per unit time. While I do not make keynesian claims, I do claim that an unargued preference for the specific money supply and deflationary characteristics of Bitcoin over say a controlled deflation rate of 5% a year is an example of status quo bias*]",cryptocurrency,1384996421

personalfinance,Getting Started: How to Make a Budget,"You're in dire straits. You're just graduated college, and you're 100k in debt. You got a big promotion. You lost your job and took a pay cut to work retail. You're expecting a kid. You want to save up for a house. No matter how you preface it, this is the first thing I will say back when you ask me for advice: *show me your monthly budget*.

Budgets. Not only do they make finance nerds happy, but **it's essential to your financial health**. They allow you to keep a modicum of self-control on your spending. They will show you, clear as day, where you can start saving money. In fact, I would go as far to say that trying to make ends meet without a budget is like trying to drive a car without a brake pedal. And here's the wildest thing about them: they only take *mintues* to set up; shorter than the time it takes to read this post. If you haven't started yet, you'd be crazy not to.

The biggest rule to balancing the books is to live below your means. You're living in a world where basic arithmetic makes sense; you earn an income and subtract your spending. Times where your income minus your spending is *positive*, you have **savings.** Times where income minus spending is *negative*, you have **debt.** It's literally that simple. Since we want to avoid debt, and since your income is probably set in stone, *regulating your spending is key*. So let's get started, in five easy steps:

**STEP 1: Pick Your Poison**

There are three flavors of software I often recommend.

First pick of the litter [Mint](http://www.mint.com/). It's my personal favorite, and it's free. Mint automatically tracks your spending and updates all of your accounts by downloading all of your online transactions. It does this in a [completely safe](https://satisfaction.mint.com/mint/topics/newbie_worries_about_fraud) and read-only manner. My only gripe is that the Categories can sometimes be a hassle, but free is as free does.

There is also [You Need a Budget](http://www.youneedabudget.com/), which is a favorite of those who want something more hands-on than Mint. It's a free trial for the first month, and $60 for the full suite. YNAB requires that you manually enter your spending, which some claim as annoying, but others claim that it helps with self-control.

Finally, there is always the simple spreadsheet, or even a piece of paper. Everything is manual, but you will have control over tracking your own spending in your own way. For those of you who don't have Excel, there is always [free office software](http://www.libreoffice.org/) out there.

**STEP 2: Monthly Income**

First thing you want to do is budget out for *four weeks of take-home (after-tax) pay*. This means if you're paid weekly, your monthly income is based on four paychecks. If you're bi-monthly, you might want to grab your February pay stubs or a [calculator](http://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator/hourly/) and see what 10 workdays of pay looks like, then multiply by two.

You probably noticed that you're missing a couple of checks, or at least part of your checks. In fact, you just calculated a year to be only 48 weeks long. *This is a good thing.* You are assuming the worst-case scenario, which will happen at least once a year: February. Only base your monthly income off of your minimum, guaranteed income.

So what does this mean? If you're bi-monthly, you get paid a little more than you expect a month. If you're weekly, you get four ""bonus"" checks spread throughout the year. Bi-weekly, you get two or three ""bonus"" checks per year.

Using this method—whether you're bi-monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly—you're earning on thirteen months, while spending on twelve. All of your ""bonus"" money should go toward Step 4.

**STEP 3: Mandatory Spending**

The next step you should take is to subtract all of your spending that you can't cut. This includes:

* Mortgage or rent, Home insurance
* Electric, Natural Gas, Water/Sewer, Internet
* Gasoline, and Car insurance
* Groceries

Notice the items that *I did not include:*

* Cable TV
* Dining out, bars, and clubs
* Travel expenses
* Shopping

These items are *discretionary*, and belong in Step 4. Anything that is not related to [safety or survival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) is discretionary. This means if you can't afford it, cut it.

Now while you're coming up with your mandatory spending list, keep in mind that there are rules of thumb. You should consider making a major change to your lifestyle if one of the following scenarios is happening:

* Your monthly mortgage/rent is more than 30% of your take home pay. You might want to consider getting a roommate, or moving to some place cheaper.
* Your monthly expenses on your car is more than 15% of your take home pay. You might want to consider carpooling to work, traveling less, or taking the bus or a bike. You may also want to consider moving closer or selling your car, if either's an option.
* Your groceries cost more than $300 per person. If you're trying to cut costs, you might want to look at more frugal options for buying groceries, such as buying in bulk, going for store-brand foods, or frequenting less expensive grocery stores.

**STEP 4: Debts, Goals, and Retirement**

Now that you have your framework, it's time to paint the picture. These next set of steps are subjective, since they all depend on what you want to do with your life. However, I would strongly consider the following:

* You want to pay debt down fast (especially debts with high interest rates), so you pay as little interest as possible. There are [tools](http://unbury.me/) to help you, and Mint has a paydown calculator if you chose their service. (Some investors would advise you to pay low interest debt, like debts that are only a few percentage points above inflation, more slowly. You can instead invest in retirement and get higher returns. More on this later.)
* You want to save up for an emergency to cover 3-6 months of expenses in case something goes horribly wrong. You will need this money available to you in a separate, liquid savings account, not an investment fund. I will elaborate why in next week's post.
* You want to invest as early as you can into retirement, so you can take advantage of compound interest and live a wealthy lifestyle.

Your ultimate goal in this section is *taking steps toward total, financial independence.* This can take years or even decades, but don't fret about the timeline. The point is that this should be your biggest financial focus, and the more you put toward this step, the more your money compounds. Your money can work harder than you do.

&gt;*""Those who understand [compound interest] earn it. Those who don't, pay it""*

&gt;—Albert Einstein

**STEP 5: Discretionary Spending**

Anything else that's left over from your goals go here. Shopping, hobbies, sports, cable, gym membership, coffee, fast food, dining, and so on and so forth to infinity and beyond. Just remember: *always* live within your means, and try to save up for capital expenses *before* buying.

**Special Note:** Dining out is more expensive than a lot of people think. It's easy to blow $250+ in a month just eating by yourself, or going to the bar with friends. If you're looking to cut back on this, consider making food at home, or inviting friends over for beer and homemade wings over a football game instead of going out.",finance,1385160934

One of the options available to me is an HDHP &amp; HSA (Aetna). I've been doing some research and this sounds very interesting. Essentially, it's like an IRA that I can build upon through investments and not have to worry about taxes. However, I live in California and my understanding is that HSAs are not acknowledged here. My question is, does it make the HSA option not worth it then? From a federal tax perspective this sounds like an excellent option and, if I were in a another state, I would heavily consider it. Being in California, however, and considering that this is applicable to the state tax it sounds like dealing with this could be more of a headache than actually beneficial. What is your opinion? 

The other option I have available to me is an HMO (Aetna). 

Another question: If I do end up selecting to go with HSA, I have the option of entering the amount of my contribution. The limit for 2014 is $3,300. So if I enter the full amount here, does that mean that it will be deposited into the HSA per pay period? So (3,300/24) $137.50 per month?

Bitcoin,LocalBitcoins.com - Do admins support fraud? Is there a bias towards sellers?,"**LocalBitcoins.com - Do admins support fraud? Is there a bias towards sellers?**


Because reddit deleted my previous post completely, I'm posting again, this time in sequential format some more indisputable facts that I can back up with screens I saved as well as emails from localbitcoins admins and messages from the seller: 

**Nov 18** - I bought **13 BTC for $7367.23 AUD** from the seller, the payment method he requested was ""National bank transfer (within Australia)""  
I sent the money from my St. George bank account to his Westpac bank account in two payments (due to a daily limit, I had to send $5000.00 in the afternoon and $2367.23 after midnight, I kept the seller updated via the message system). 

The BTC price went through the roof.

The seller requested that I cancel the trade, even after I told them the money has been sent. 

The seller called me a scammer. 

I sent my ID documents to the seller as well as banking receipts and offered to call him. 

The seller made more threats and accusations towards me. 

The seller announced that he will return the money once it is in his account. 


**Nov 19** - The seller confirmed via the messaging system that he received the money in his bank account (both transfers) while claiming that his localbitcoins.com account was hacked. 

The seller did not release the BTC from escrow, instead opened a dispute. 

I uploaded several other ID documents as well as bank statement and transaction receipts via the dispute form to localbitcoins staff. 
Including credit cards from my St. George bank account, government IDs and more. 

I had conversations with localbitcoins admins and they suggested I ""ask forums what the community thinks"". 

Localbitcoins admins asked me for my bank account number so that the seller can return my money and cancel the trade. 

I stated that I would like to receive the 13 BTC as per the trade. 

**Nov 20** - My bank confirmed that the money was sent out, I can also see it via online banking.  

Localbitcoins admins change the BTC amount in escrow from 13 BTC to ~12.7 BTC -  effectively changing the terms of a trade that was fixed, this was their solution to the sellers dispute request, they called it ""fair"". 

I disagree with changing the terms of a trade that was fixed previously and fully paid for by myself. 


**Nov 21** - I post the story on reddit to get feedback from the community, to protect myself (because an unknown man came to my house the day before), and to warn other people about the slow &amp; unfair dispute resolution taking place on localbitcoins.com 

The seller begs me to remove the post because it damages his reputation. 

Localbitcoins staff state that because I posted the story on reddit, they can not release the escrow now. 


**Nov 22** - Localbitcoins admins write to me that 
""Regarding to the money transaction, we have no doubt that it have been successfully conducted and credited to the seller's account"". 

Yet localbitcoins admins do not change the escrow amount back to 13 BTC, neither do they release the escrow to me. 

My bank confirmed that they have informed the recipients bank about the transfers being completely legitimate. 

 As of now I still did not receive any of my BTC. The seller is not releasing the escrow, localbitcoins admins are not releasing the escrow. 
 
Localbitcoins admin requests that I send them a photo of myself holding a utility bill. 

Seller alleges that he spoke to police in Australia and that they told him I have a ""history"". 

I provide localbitcoins admins with a photo of myself holding a utility bill next to my face. 

I provide localbitcoins admins with a police clearance certificate from the Australian Federal Police as well as employment reference letters. 


**I still did not receive any of my BTC.**

I have had a couple of very stressful days and sleepless nights. 

I missed out on the chance to sell my BTC at a big profit.

Bitcoin,"Fed up with Coinbase - and NO, it's not a hold on my buy order. A BitTip I was given (presumably for Reddit Enhancement Suite) has mysteriously vanished.","EDIT: If you're the person who sent me the BitTip, could you message me? There seems to have been a typo in your reddit username, and I can't find you.

**TL;DR** a tip sent to me 9 days ago has vanished. customer support unresponsive/inept. guy who said he'd help me figure out what's going on is apparently too busy to do so.

Hi. I understand people here are tired of the ""Coinbase froze or cancelled my order"" posts, but this is not one of those.

I really WANT for Coinbase to be a great service we all love and trust.  The US doesn't have much in the way of good options.

I also understand that Coinbase has volume / availability issues and that's why people's orders end up getting frozen etc. That problem is a tough nut to crack. This is not about that problem.

My problem:

**November 13th**: I received a message that someone sent me a BitTip via Coinbase (not bitcointip, different thing).  Neato!  My first BitTip! Very exciting...  First I verify that this isn't a phishing email by double checking where the links go, verifying what BitTip is, etc. Seems good!

So I click the link, log in to my Coinbase account and... what?  Nothing.  No tip.  I see a message saying ""token already claimed""... hmm, weird. Maybe it means it's on its way into my account?

I figure maybe it takes time to process, so I wait a few hours.  In the meantime I google this BitTip thing because I've not seen it before.  I see a bothersome review of the [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bittip/cghdimfhbmogfkdfheenlfgdjmchijno/reviews) where a user says he saw the same ""Token already claimed"" message that I got.

**November 13th** (a few hours later): I email Coinbase support and let them know what's up.  I get an automated response about it and that's it.

**November 14th**: I haven't heard back from Coinbase support, but I see a thread about Coinbase in this sub, so I [post a comment on it](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1qklav/coinbase_introduces_1_btcweek_instantbuy_without/cde01t3?context=3).   I get a reply from /u/coblee saying he'll take a look -- cool, I calm my hackles a bit.

I message him my info and he politely says he'll look into it but it may take a while because he's super busy.  Okay, I understand. A few days is fine, albeit generous on my part since money given to me is *missing*...

/u/coblee also sends me a small test tip (well, not via BitTip, but a transaction anyway) to ensure things are working. I appreciate this. Hackles even more calmed.

except days go by...

**November 18th:** I contact /u/coblee again and ask if he's had a chance to look.  He replies ""Not yet. Sorry. Been busy with other stuff.""


**November 21st:** I finally receive an email from Coinbase tech support who says ""I'm showing that this tip came through. If anything still appears amiss please let me know and I'll be happy to look into it!""

I think ""oh, cool, it's fixed!"" -- I log into my account and NO tip went through. This customer support rep must just see the tip from /u/coblee and be mistaking it for the one I never got.

It has now been 9 days since I was sent a tip and yet there is no sign whatsoever that I'll be getting it.

It took Coinbase's customer support 9 days to get back to me, and they didn't even get back to me with a solution, but rather a message saying ""looks like it went through!"" when in fact it did not.

I have no idea what /u/coblee 's role at Coinbase is, so I'm not going to sit here and say he's a big jerk or not doing his job or whatever because he might be a dev who was just offering to pitch in and has ended up being busy enough it falls off his radar.

However, as a **collective company experience**, I would say that Coinbase has proven to be unreliable and untrustworthy.  Incompetent at best (most likely), or perhaps pilfering my tip/money at worst (unlikely, but possible).

Bitcoin,Realization About The Earliest Bitcoin Adopters,"Many of us that have been around the internet, especially on sites like Reddit and 4chan, have probably known about Bitcoin for a few years. And we've all heard plenty of stories of ""early adopters"" that invested $1000 in bitcoins in 2010 and are now millionaires. As more and more people around my office are learning of bitcoins and asking about what it is, I've been doing a lot of thinking about why I, and many others, didn't invest into bitcoins early on. We could all be millionaires now if we had just seen the potential in bitcoins.

I think we can all agree that the largest limitting factor to early adoption was what you could use bitcoins for. You couldn't easily buy a new computer with bitcoins in 2010. You couldn't pay for college, or pay for a spaceflight with Virgin Galactic. If there was nothing we could buy with bitcoins then why would anyone want to invest in the currency early on? Oh you know what, now that I think of it there was one thing you could buy with bitcoins in 2010. . . drugs.

I don't mean this to discredit what bitcoin has become, but let's accept one observation. many of the earliest adopters of bitcoin were people trading in the black markets of Silk Road, and the other dark recesses of encrypted onion sites. As the FBI continues to find ways to track these people, and as more and more legitimate uses become available to use Bitcoins on, this segment of bitcoins original users will continue to become a smaller and smaller minority. 

However, realizing they were some of the earliest adopters brought me to another realization: There are inevitably people out there who were trading drugs, hacking services, and many other illegal goods and services for bitcoins in 2009-11. and if a some of those people left their money tied up in bitcoins back then, the growth in popularity and market value has now turned those small time hackers and internet drug dealers into millionaires.

Literally if someone sold 1 ounce of pot on silk road for $250 worth of bitcoins in 2010 when bitcoins were around $0.30, and ""forgot about it"" they would now have a bitcoin wallet worth $625,000, assuming they didn't get raided by the feds when silk road was shut down, but that's beside the point.

Once again I don't mean to post any of this with the intention of tarnishing the reputation Bitcoin is building as a legitimate currency. In a way I actually find it rather humorous that in addition to all the stories we hear of ""early investors"" becoming rich, there are also likely dozens if not hundreds of untold stories of small time illicit entrepreneurs from the earliest days of Bitcoin who are now also millionaires from their ""investments"".",cryptocurrency,1385144650
Bitcoin,DOOMSAYER HYPOTHESIS: What would happen if their is a giant crash?,"Okay with the news that China is longer going to be hoarding foreign currencies and with them quietly trying to ween the world off the Petrodollar and move it to the Yuan, this will bump the price of products up coming from China. I understand that we are a giant market for China, but let's play devils advocate.  If Washington can't get their crap together, which I don't think they will, by next year we are heading toward another government shut down, there is another Tech bubble that pops, and the loan system goes belly up again from bad loans on cars.  Lets say all this happens around January to February of next year and the QE comes and bites us all in the butt.  Inflation would go through the roof, interest rates would enslave everyone in Generation Y for the rest of their life, and all the vapor in the stock market would disappear sending the world in economic chaos.

Its been driven to death, but it is still in very good condition (160k+ miles) and has a few dings on the body. I really want to spoil myself with a used Jeep. They hold their value really well and I feel it would be practical for me since I love outdoor activities. They are pretty poor on gas mileage (~17mpg) which is the biggest drawback. 

Can I afford a used Jeep Wrangler? I have been perusing craigslist and found several 2007-2008 Wrangler  for 13-14k. I will be able to put 5,000$ down for the Jeep, leaving me an auto loan of roughly 8k. I still have to account gas expenses and insurance. 

I currently work as a mudlogging geologist working four week shifts at the drillsite and then two weeks off. During my two weeks off I crash with college friends around the country or stay with my parents, during the time onsite my job the company provides housing and meal costs. I spend roughly $1500/month (lot of it during off time on hobbies/clubbing/restaurants/camping,gas, car insurance), but that is the extent of my total expenses.

Bitcoin,I have a wild plan,"In light of recent events in my life I've been allowed by fortune and fate to buy my first bitcoins. I've spent a lot of time (researching) and money proportional to my income to invest but it was well worth it not for the pure sake of investment but for the sake of knowing. Knowledge, as I'm sure many of you are aware, is power. Sadly for me I began feeling awful at all the schemes I began to concoct and bitter realities I face when confronted with multiplying returns. I saw myself say ""just one more trade for profit and I'll donate,"" but I didn't trade right away and I saw myself uncheck the solar panel from my online amazon cart just to secure that toy I always wanted. I reverted back to my childhood selfish ways of hoarding Legos my friends would trust me to play with. I learned a hard lesson as a child. Hiding from your friends what they lent you is a sure fire way to lose a friend and a better way to lose anybody worth playing Legos with. After my most recent fortune of finding a disability card with all the disability money I misunderstood to have never been paid I went shopping for groceries and a new bank to help me expand my business plans for biycoin. On my way in I encountered a bell ringer searching for donations to charity. I had no intention of giving anything until I left and only because I had loose change did I drop anything in the bucket.

For 4 long years I have suffered a hell few people can know the full exten of. I've learned hard lessons after 23 years of textbook. At my age of 27 I feel I'm on the berg of a breakthrough.

Peak oil faces soviet and renewable energies are gaining traction, but the transition is slow. Time I fear is our only enemy but more so is the threat of global conflict as a result of poor leadership. We've dodged the bullet for now but I expect oil prices to spike in the next two decades if alternative energies aren't widely available. More portably is the psychological components associated with investig in solar and wind. On a windy night like tonight it may seem the windmills are worth Teiresias weight but pictures of dead birds, windmills ablaze and fallen windmills are enough to dissuade the investors in it. Solar, to most energy engineers is considered a joke. But not to people who cannot always rely on their aging power grids. The most psychologically binding and worthwhile endeavors happen to be those of great feat and ingenuity. The final frontier is a fantastic show when confronted by man and woman of the stars. Going into space is not a necessity but a nerds pastime. No immediate returns come from space exploration except unity psychological ones. I believe however that a more robust space program is necessary to build for tomorrow. The lessons learned in space may give mankind the edge needed to overcome the problems faced on earth. Learning to work together again as opposed to the competitive factions of corporation and nations. Competitions are good, as in competitions to build te best barn or gather the most fruits. To compete to see who an kill the most neighbors or throw the hardest, blunt, damaging strikes to the other are of little value to society. Perhaps only on a psychological one do fights like those in the arena have any actual point. Bread and games pacified the Romans during times of hardship. Better to see another suffer with food in one'a own belly than to suffer hungry and in solitude. This year hundreds of millions of first world citizens will watch the games and still more will demand it up close and vivid. The roads will crack, bridges creak, and rails go rusty but the games will go on.

I ask this of you. To vote with your wallet and make the rift loves while you're sober without absolute power. Put your money where your dreams are and help put good people where they belong. Elect a leader who does know the facts and will follow through. But be damn sure he is not stopped by the same old party. Elect his opponents carefully too an don't take electoral college for an answer. Vote with cash for a very real space program and program to fix the slowly dying infrastructure of roads and energy that are determined to fail if ignored for much longer. Lastly put the good people with starving families in conditions thy can hope to flourish in. The hungry won't remember your charity if it's too late, they will be gone and with them the only labor and services depended upon nu a living society.

Renew renew renew. Energies and leaders alike need to be refreshed. But so to do te instruments of learning. Ingenuity and science make no headway in a pot of stagnating routine. Renewable energy isn't a matter of want or desire but a matter of life and death. Millions of livin things died and formed the most precious compost heaps imaginable so we could drive to work every day. The reserve that our infrastructure depends on are dwindling. Imagine what you will do when the roads are in disrepair and the communities cannot afford to drive to the sites let alone repair them because their equipment costs too mic precious oil to repair and to much precious oil to run. The last secluded tribes will have the last laugh when we o hungry because most people live to far from anything to actually make a living from.

Do we revert back to tribal life now and gain experience livin off the land like our ancestors did? Maybe. Do we use what fortune we have to craft a better tomorrow with alternative technologies? Always. The very real opportunity with biycoin is the freedom allowed. So much freedom leaders are afraid of its potential misuse by the patrons of it. Our founding fathers would share this uneasiness. IF The slaves were suddenly capable of making and spending money as the please. The reality is technology is moving faster than public awareness. I told three people at work about biycoin and they did not know what it was. I had plans to open up a biycoin shop and fleece my neighbors before my conscience got the best of me.

I have one set of goals and some backup plans if they fail. First and foremost, secure the next 200 years for the next generation of people. Second, to right the wrongs abroad and nationally and bring those responsible for their crimes to the justice the deserve. And lastly to pellet a disciplinary program that doesn't neuter prisoners, junkies, and deviants of their ability to recover and rejoin society. A police state will only stem the bleeding but a state allowed to self govern and self sustain will be more viable and productive between states than one condemned to tyranny.
Transparency in power is key. If the powerful aren't transparent how can the be trusted? Arbiters, as I'm sure you are all familiar, are they key. Disinterested parties that gain nothing from helping or hurting one party or the other. A third party has never seen real life in the American government but I propose, guided by my outlined goals already mentioned, that a third party paid for by bitcoin and untouched by the fed ca. Accomplish what needs to be do e for the good of humanity.
I'd like to form a slaves republic made by the slaves for the slaves and owners. A party that seeks the honest and most utilitarian approaches to handling tomorrow's problems by using tomorrow's approaches. Too long have we be riding the dying mastodon of status quo. It's time to find our legs beneath us and run!

If you'd like to contact me personally I respond to atmclennan@gmail.com 
I have .83 bitcoin and 4530 us to my name. Implementing my goals will cost a lot and require a paid party. I'll take applications for membership on a person by person basis. If you'd like to contribute please contact me and I'll do my best to make things like high speed rail a thing of the near future and hunger a thing of the dieting only.


Together we can build something with Legos instead of keeping everything we find. Synthesis of mind and resource is the real form of profit.

As always, Tepper gives a simple breakdown of where he sees the financial markets in the future. My takeaways are 1. There is no stock market bubble/stock market is not overvalued. Almost every S&amp;P earnings estimate for next year gives the current market a forward P/E multiple of ~15, no where near overvaluation. 2. Tapering won't have a major effect on interest rates. Tapering means QE still exists, and all other Fed rates will be zero/near zero (discount rate and fed funds). 3.   Tapering will probably have a short-term negative effect on stocks, which will be a great time to add to your positions.

Bitcoin,Why The Assassination Market Is A Terrible Idea,"As if this needs to be said. It sickens me to see the operator of this website claim that he wants to see a ""peaceful, private, laissez-faire"" society while promoting the murder of other people. This coming from a principled, peaceful crypto-anarchist voluntaryist. 

This website is insanely misguided, and probably a scam. First, let's address why it is misguided.

The creator is quoted as saying ""I also believe that as soon as a few politicians gets offed and they realize they’ve lost the war on privacy, the killings can stop and we can transition to a phase of peace, privacy and laissez-faire."" This is much the same argument State Communists and Socialists have made: we'll just kill a few Capitalists, take over the economy, and then the State will wither away to peaceful anarcho-communism. Except it doesn't work that way, because it's entirely illogical to think that violence will beget peace. Instead, this Assassination Market will create an immense amount of blowback from the State, which will crack down on not only enabling technologies like Bitcoin and Tor, but also any legitimately peaceful and philosophical anarchists. The means are not consistent with the ends of ""peace, privacy, and laissez-faire,"" and so therefore these means will not manifest that end. Rather, this kind of system will be exploited and used to harm innocent people. Even if this particular Assassination Market operator has so called  ""ethics"" which prevent him from allowing a hit on individuals who have not ""“initiated force against other humans,"" there will be others who have no such rules and this will be used to harm innocent people. The brazen stupidity of this website operator is breathtaking. 

Let us now address why this could quite possibly be a scam. Aside from the obvious stupidity of the idea, which may be easy to miss if one is not actually principled and consistent in wanting to achieve a peaceful laissez-faire society, the whole issue of WHY someone should trust this website operator with hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars worth of bitcoins is important to point out. The way this website works is that users pledge bitcoins which are credited towards the assassination of a given political figure. First, how do we know that any bitcoins have actually been pledged? Second, why should we trust the website operator not to abscond with the bitcoins? Afterall, it's unlikely that any assassinations will actually occur via this website. There's already plenty of incentive for these politicians to be killed; they have indirectly harmed millions of people through their political activities (or by direct assassination in the case of President Obama and his ""disposition matrix""). If they haven't been killed yet, it's probably not going to happen because someone might earn a few thousand bitcoins. Therefore we can assume that most of the bitcoins pledged will just sit there until either the site operator decides to get bored and take everything, or the site is seized. Either way, the pledgors are out their bitcoins, and all that has been accomplished is swatting at the hornets nest and pissing the State off even more than Bitcoin and darknets already do. 

In short, this website is at best, a bad idea that will cause a lot of unpredictable blowback, and at worst, a scam that could still cause unpredictable blowback. Proceed with caution accordingly.",cryptocurrency,1385103699

Bitcoin,Coinbase Undoing Sell Transactions?,"Hey everyone - just ran into an interesting issue I haven't seen on this board, and wondering if anyone might know what's going on.

As of a few hours ago, all my coins are back in my account, and the payment never reached my checking account. Under my Transaction History, there's an entry saying something about the returning of my coins being an adjustment (can't get the exact text at the moment - Coinbase looks like it's having some issues for me).


So basically, at this point it looks like Coinbase just undid the transaction that I initiated on Monday and they marked at Complete, and I'm not seeing any reason why. I'm awaiting a response from Support, but I've heard they're a bit short-staffed over there, so that might be a while.

personalfinance,Advice on Student Loan Rates vs Quantitative Easing,"I have ~$60K in *private* student loans (I have repaid all of my public student loans, which had higher rates.) They all have, at present, 2.5% interest rates.

I have decent credit (credit karma says 772 ""Excellent"") and a well-paying job ($100k+).

I believe that I am primarily benefitting from quantitative easing, which is keeping interest rates low, but that since my rates are floating there is a high potential for them to rise quite a bit when the government ends quantitative easing. I may not be understanding the entire situation very well, however. 

Without asking you to speculate on how much longer we will have low interest rates, can I get some advice on my best bet as far as consolidation?

I posted a few months ago, about moving to NYC for a great job and the student debt that went along with getting that great job.  For the record, I'm single, with no kids.  


I'm familiar with the basics of this subreddit.  (Emergency fund -&gt; Pay off debt, highest interest rate first -&gt; save/invest).

Summary:

(details removed)

Questions:  

- (NYC)  One big sore spot in my budget is the price of food.  Living in Manhattan makes grocery shopping both inconvenient (due to not being able to drive a decent-sized car over to a normal grocery store and shop in bulk) as well as RIDICULOUSLY expensive.  My natural reaction to this, of course, is to get take-out frequently and spend even more money (hooray, logic!).  What do other people in Manhattan do for groceries?  What's a good amount to budget? Any tips/tricks to grocery shopping here?

- (NYC-kinda?)  Regarding emergency fund:  As you can see, my only real burden month-to-month is my rent. Do people in NYC follow the same ""3-6 months"" rule that everyone else does?  How does the inflated cost of living in the City affect personal finance/savings calculations (if at all)?  (details removed)

- (General)  Regarding savings, both normal and retirement:  Am I right to think that, until I've spent 5-7 years paying off my student loans, I should avoid messing with 401ks and IRAs?  I'm around 30 years old, if that matters.

- (General)  As soon as I get this Emergency Fund thing decided and squared away, I'd like to start throwing massive amounts of money at my loans.  (details removed) Given that I don't have a solid line-item in my budget for random household things, or rainy days, or whatever, what would be a good monthly amount to aim for?

Bitcoin,"""Why is the price rising? Here's why... (long answer)""","TL;DR - Federal Reserve Notes == SATAN/EVIL/DARK/SHADY DEALS   BTCS == God/Good/Light/Happy customers and merchants

It's so funny watching people who understand ""economics"" run around like chicken's with their heads cut off when it comes to our beloved cryptocurrency. It's almost as if NONE of them understand what central banking has done to our country and WORLD economies. It's like none of the people asking why it's rising understand how the internet has spread the knowledge of the bank's agenda to continue to consume our wealth for themselves by taxing us to death, then reloaning that money out at interest to pave roads and build schools. It's all such a sham. If people would spend some time watching a few videos like the Money as Debt trilogy (see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC720Cl3N-0 for a good sampling) there would be no purpose for the question, ""What is driving this up so much?"" It's being driven up by the simple fact it's the BETTER PRODUCT and everyone around the WORLD is moving their currency into it because they believe in the power of the BTC more than the EUR or USD OR JPY or anything else for that matter. The government FIAT Notes, with all the controls and restrictions put in place to use it, have made it pretty much worthless against the Bitcoin.

I truly don't believe the ""worth"" is any higher than it was in the beginning. The price of Bitcoin has just shown how worthless the dollar is because of the Quantitative Easing that they are doing. Well, that and all the rights they are taking away and then to top it all off they are taxing us to death. I think people should read this story to understand what people have realized and programmers have implemented in a rock-solid method that can't be beaten. Satoshi realized ol Honest Abe was onto something...

""President Lincoln needed money to finance the Civil War, and the international bankers offered him loans at 24-36% interest. Lincoln balked at their demands because he didn't want to plunge the nation into such a huge debt. Lincoln approached Congress about passing a law to authorize the printing of U.S. Treasury Notes. Lincoln said ""We gave the people of this Republic the greatest blessing they ever had - their own paper money to pay their debts..."" Lincoln printed over 400 million ""Greenbacks"" (debt and interest-free) and paid the soldiers, U.S. government employees, and bought war supplies. The international bankers didn't like it and wanted Lincoln to borrow the money from them, so that the American people would owe tremendous interest on the loan. Lincoln's solution made this seem ridiculous. Shortly after Lincoln's death, the government revoked the Greenback law which ended Lincoln's debt-free, interest-free money. A new national banking act was enacted and all currency became interest-bearing, debt instruments, again.""

We can now make money, pay taxes only at the point of consumption (which I do think is MORE than fair), and we can actually save money and not have inflation leach all of it's spending power before we get to use it. Bitcoin is the best thing to ever come along, I don't care what economists say. Tell me it's tulip mania, all I can say back is, ""You do your old school economics that have been full of lies, greed, and deception."" I'll do my ""new-school cryptocurrency stuff"" that doesn't lose value and actually will allow me to buy MORE in ten years than anybody who held onto your Federal Reserve Notes. I think people are STARTING to realize it, but this message needs to be pushed more.

Bitcoin,Why bitcoin will never have to worry about being quashed by big banks or sidelined by a competing crypto currency.,"**It's been a long running debate: Is bitcoin the defacto crypto currency? What's to stop someone else launching supermegabitcoin and stealing its crown?  Why, if it's so great can't a bank come along and use it's marketing might to do the same thing?**

In this post I'm going to attempt to answer these questions once and for all so that we can all leave here without a shred of doubt that bitcoin will almost certainly be the King of Cryptos for time immemorial.  

I say *almost certainly*, because I am working on the assumptions that nothing disastrous happens to the protocol itself and that humans don't blow themselves up before it gets a chance to take off.

First, let's rewind.  Back in 2011 Gavin Andresen was asked by the CIA to visit their headquarters and give a presentation on bitcoin.  Present at the meeting alongside the CIA were: PayPal, Facebook Payments, M-Pesa, Heartland Payment Systems, and the Federal Reserve.

Source: http://www.bitcointrading.com/forum/talk-bitcoin/gavin-andresen-cia-visit-presentation-(june-20th-2011)-(pdf)/


It is perhaps no coincidence that just prior to the meeting Wikileaks had just started accepting bitcoin which garnered much mainstream media attention.  The decision to support Wikileaks came after a long-running discussion on bitcointalk that had involved Satoshi himself (who was vehemently against supporting Julian at such an early stage in the development of bitcoin).  Satoshi was outvoted and seemingly his worst fears confirmed when shortly after the CIA got in touch.  Satoshi left shortly after Gavin announced he would be attending the CIA meet.

So here's what we can ascertain from this: bitcoin is giving oxygen to an organisation that has had all other payment methods frozen by the government and has been labelled a threat to national security.  In tandem with this, it is also being used to fuel the world's largest online drug marketplace (Silk Road)... At this stage you would have expected two things to happen: 

1. The CIA moves fast to make any bitcoin related transaction illegal, blocking at the banking level (as they did with online gambling).

2. The FED, Paypal or any number of the other reps present at the meeting lift the bitcoin code and implement some proprietary version of the tech that can be controlled and regulated.  They launch, trumpeting it as the world's most advanced, legal, government backed crypto currency and AmeriGovoCoinPal becomes the new reserve currency backed by all the major banks, who can offer the usual payment protection etc.

Except.  That didn't happen.  Nothing happened.  Bitcoin was left to quietly permeate it's way through the collective consciousness of the Geek hive until it began to grow at an almost [exponential rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VNPScd-xg0]).  Just taking a look at the Github repository and watching the codebase contributors expand from back when it was just Mike Hearn and Satoshi himself to what it is today is truly mind blowing.  

**So, how (and why) was this allowed to happen when there were so many big players at the CIA meet (including the FED itself?).**

The answer is the same as you would give to the question ""Why is Linux the most powerful operating system in the world?""

Because bitcoin, like linux, is open source.  There is a reason the [International Space Station](
http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/155392-international-space-station-switches-from-windows-to-linux-for-improved-reliability) switched to Linux, just as there is a reason so many geeks wet their collective pants when they realised what bitcoin was capable of; Put quite simply, bitcoin cannot be stopped and will always prove to be the most powerful crypto in the world because of it's open nature.  

The only thing that threatens this are external events such as the Foundation making too many concessions to heavy handed regulators.  But even then, the bitcoin community *always* has the nuclear option: forking a new version of the protocol and moving away from any perceived compromises.

*""Open solutions enable the ecosystem to discover the optimal value of the solution, whereas less open systems are at the mercy of their creator having guessed at the optimal solution in the first place."" 
- Dick Costello (co-founder of FeedBurn)*

But wait.  We've not even got started yet.  Let's rewind right back to April 2009 when the bitcoin protocol had just 2 developers:  Satoshi and Google security engineer Mike Hearn.  Bitcoin was but a mere twinkle in Gavin's eye back then.

But Mike was on it.  In fact, he was so taken with Satoshi's vision that he chose to dedicate his Google 20% time to the project and what he quickly realised was that bitcoin wasn't just a lovely platform for cheap monetary exchange, but...a...whole...lot...more.

Here's what Satoshi had to say about the architecture of bitcoin that Mike quickly picked up on.

""The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago.  Escrow transactions, bonded security contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature etc...If bitcoin catches on in a big way these are things we will want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later.""

As Mike explains [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4L7xDNCmA), the bitcoin protocol is FULL of features that currently lie dormant.  These features are so ground-breaking, so mind-bogglingly game changing it is, for once, not a cliche to say that bitcoin represents a huge paradigm shift that will permeate every level of society and business.  Every business model that relies on middle-men; from banking to real estate, from car loans to health insurance and contract law is going to go out of business unless they rapidly adapt to the forthcoming changes.  In exactly the same way MP3s and P2P have driven a nail in the coffins of record industry middle-men so too will bitcoin finish any model of business that can be more elegantly dealt with by the crowd and a rock-solid mathematical algorithm.

And it doesn't even stop there, that's just short-term stuff.  The next decade is going to see sooo many innovations built around blockchain and micropayment technology that the current world we are living in is going to look like something from the flintstones.

""Oh Fred, do you remember when we used to have to WALK up to parking meters and actually pay physical coins for the privilege of parking our cars?""  

""Yes"" Laughs Fred, ""And do your remember when they used to actually pay men dressed in silly faux policemen outfits to walk up and down all day in a job they hated, just so they could check we had paid at the meter?""  

""Don't forget Fred, Barney had that terrible job of having to empty all those worthless coins out of the meters and that he died on his way home - completely needlessly because some punk thought those old nickels and dimes were worth something.""

""To think, only 10 years later there would be [automated flying ambulances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu4PAMFPo5Y) that owned themselves and his life would have been saved.  Poor Barney.  Google Car: Home Please""

**Back In 2013...**

It is not histrionic to assert that we will - in a very short space of time - look back on the current system in the same way we shiver with disbelief that there was an era not that long ago when bank clerks used to tally all our life savings in hand written ledgers.   

It is of course very difficult to think ahead and predict future changes, and yet maverick technologists like Ray Kurzweil have made a fine living out of doing just that.  Of course there are those that have not faired quite as well [(Krugman.  We are disappoint)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=177601.0).

**So why bitcoin and nothing else?**

Just as nothing could stop the rise of Linux due to it's legion of nerdtastic programmers who work on it day in day out for the pure love of what they do, there is nothing that can even come close to emulating that goodwill (no matter how much money is spent on drones hired by banks or other agencies).  

The global legion of talented programmers, designers, enrepreneurs, business gurus, financial experts and lobbyists (yes, lobbyists) who have already made a collective decision to dedicate their time and energy to building bitcoin into what is and what it is yet to become is an unstoppable force.  

So take the red pill and buckle your seatbelt Dorothy, because that is the power of love, and it cannot be bought, sold or compromised.",cryptocurrency,1385171419

personalfinance,Running the numbers on whole life insurance from my wife's parents (USA) -- Warning: wall of text,"My wife and I are expecting our first child soon, so the topic of life insurance has come up. We recently took over a whole life policy from my wife's mother (started when she was 1), and I'm trying to approach this objectively.  I've done the cost/benefit analysis, but I'd like to put it in front of you, to see if I've missed something glaringly obvious, and to help spark discussion (I saw a few other similar posts recently with people asking about whole/universal life insurance they'd been given).

The policy is for $45k, and costs $112/year.  There are guaranteed purchase options for $15k of additional coverage every few years (including one this year...each one adds $13 to the annual premium).  From the bill, the premium break down looks like $83.45 for insurance/fees, and $28.55 into the cash account.  The policy has $1,720 of equity.  The interesting part to me is that the cash account has a guaranteed 4% interest rate, currently paying out 4.67% APR (that piqued my interest...I bonds and the CDs I've found are all paying &lt;2% right now).

Since the interest rate seems pretty decent, I thought I'd give the numbers a look.  But first, the goals/alternatives.  We'd like to take out $200k of coverage on my wife.  She gets $45k from work, and can purchase more at $0.042/k/month.  So, here are the two options as I see them....

#1 -- Exercise our GPO to up the whole life to 60k and purchase another 95k through work.  Cost is $199/yr ($169 for insurance premiums, $30 into the investment account that comes with the whole life)

#2 -- Cash out whole life, purchase full 155k through work.  Annual premium is $103/yr, put the extra $96/yr into a savings/investment account.

Both options give us the same coverage for the unfortunate.  The question, then, is which one will leave us with more cash at the end of 20 years (my hope is that our retirement accounts will be large enough to reduce the need for life insurance at this point).

So, in terms of investment (for reference, you can find lots of calculators online for this... I used  https://www.allcomcu.org/calc/fv_multi.html for this)...

Option #1: $1,720 + $30/yr + 4.67% APR (4.0% guaranteed) for 20 years comes out to about $5,350 ($4,742 guaranteed)

Option #2: Cash out the $1,720, put the extra $96/yr into an account with it.  I could use something like 5% as an expected return in the stock market, but that wouldn't be strictly fair, since this is a guaranteed return (closer to a CD).  So, I used 1.83%, the best I can find in a quick search for guaranteed returns.  After 20 years, this comes out to: $4,668. (If I use 5%, as an expected stock return, $7,761)

So, I know I'm losing money when compared to an expected return in the market.  But, if I look at the cash as a supplement to my emergency fund, then it's better off in the insurance plan, and the 4% return is enough to offset the extra cost of insurance (barely, and only because CDs/I-Bonds are paying so low right now).  

I understand this is very atypical, but I think I'm going to go with option 1.

investing,Fundamental-driven tactical asset allocation,"This post is about the allocation of assets in your portfolio, eg stocks vs bonds vs RE, not individual stocks, which research has shown to be the most important factor in determining portfolio return. 


I have split Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) into three parts, based on the following research paper:

[Link](http://www.actuaries.org/AFIR/Colloquia/Boston/Boulier_Hartpence.pdf)

* Strategic asset allocation: Long term allocation of assets, rebalanced every year. For example 60% stocks and 40% bonds.
* Fundamental-driven tactical asset allocation: Medium term changing allocation on assets. For example going from 70% stocks to 50% stocks based on very high P/E numbers in the market.
* Tactical Asset Allocation: short term asset allocation looking for mispricings in the market, based on mathematical models.

In this post I would like to discuss Fundamental Driven TAA. 

TAA and different methods are discussed in the following paper:
[paper](https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/tacticalassetallocation_052006.pdf)

Common TAA strategies from the second research paper, summarised:

* The “Fed model” signals: This model compares stock earnings yields (the inverse of the price/earnings [P/E] ratio) to nominal bond yields to to set allocation weights. Clifford Asness (2003) detailed several drawbacks to this approach.
* Business-cycle/macroeconomic signals: Signals include term spreads (the yield differential between long- and short term bonds), the credit spread (the yield differential between high- and low-credit-rated corporate bonds), “unexpected inflation,” and industrial production.
* Fundamental-valuation signals: Metrics include dividend yield, book/market ratio, and P/E ratio, to determine relative valuation. Another approach is to use the dividend discount model to determine the required rate of return from market prices and projected dividend growth rates.
* Momentum signals: Signals include technical indicators, earnings growth, and changes in trading volumes.
* Sentiment signals: Signals include measures of consumer confidence and margin borrowing.


According to the first and the second paper, superior returns can be generated with the right TAA strategy. As an amateur investor I would like to utilize this, if possible. I do not believe I have the skills nor the tools to utilize short term TAA. I am mainly looking to change my asset allocation(AA) in the extremes, for example situations with very high or low P/E ratios. Or preferably a combination of different fundamental indicators.

I realize this is a market timing strategy, which seems to be quite controversial these days. However, the average amateur investor loses 2% to market, because he tends to buy high and sell low. I am essentially trying to do the opposite. [source](http://arborinvestmentplanner.com/is-a-tactical-asset-allocation-strategy-the-same-as-market-timing/)

The following article discusses different TAA strategies, based on fundamentals. It concludes that short term TAA is not a viable strategy, but that in the long TAA can optimize results. The articles has excellent graphs and tables that illustrate the point. 
[Link](http://www.fpanet.org/journal/TacticalThinkTank/)


This is a new subject to me, which I have been reading up on all day and I apologize for any misconceptions. My goal with this post is to generate some discussion about the the pitfalls and merits of TAA, and if it is at all possible for an amatuer to make a sensible TAA strategy.

I would like to develop strict TAA rules for my portfolio, that allows me to move a part of my portfolio between asset classes in extreme market situations, to reduce risk and increase returns.


Edit:

I am going to post some of the graphs and tables from the last article. 

[These](http://imgur.com/R6MVGrb,t8wTHgx,hAs5AVO#2) 
graphs show the subsequent returns based on the 10 year P/E ratio. It does not have much meaning short term, but gets more significant over the long run. Also note that the sweet spot for breaking even seems to be just before P/E 10 (year average) ratio of 30.

[This](http://imgur.com/R6MVGrb,t8wTHgx,hAs5AVO#1) table shows the subsequent return after years with extreme P/E ratios.

And finally [this](http://imgur.com/R6MVGrb,t8wTHgx,hAs5AVO#0) graph shows how the actual returns tend to revert back to the trend over long time.",finance,1385326823

Bitcoin,Did you ever wonder...,"I’d like to ask you to remember where you were a decade or so ago, in the year 2000. I’m going to list some of the things that have happened since then. Did it cross your mind that we would see…

• Two stock market crashes of 1929 proportions and a financial crisis that almost brought down the entire global banking system.

• Youth unemployment in Greece at 62.5%, Spain at 57%, Portugal at 43%, Italy at 40% and an EU average of 24.4%. Or the Greeks calling Germans Nazis.

• Interest rates in the US at 0.25% and in the UK at 0.5% for years on end, runs on banks as people discover their money isn’t safe and the Bank of England actually printing money.

• A gap between rich and poor that has grown so big the richest 400 people in the world have assets equivalent to the poorest 140 million. The wealthiest 1% of Americans pocket a quarter of the country’s income and control as much as half of the nation’s total wealth, with CEOs of large banks and other large corporations earning as much as a thousand times more than low-ranking employees.

• The average age of the first-time UK house buyer at almost 40, with an entire generation of people in the UK that believing they will never own a home. Yet only 2.5% of British land is actually built on.

• Obesity rates of 25% in the developed world, yet almost a billion people suffering from chronic undernourishment, while over half the food we produce – some 2 billion tonnes – gets thrown away each year.

• 36 million people across the globe taking part in 3,000 protests against a war in the Middle East – and UK and US government ignoring them and going ahead with it anyway.

• Healthcare spending more than doubling from £68 billion to £143 billion in the 11 years to 2011, yet ‘basic clinical failings’ being commonplace across the NHS – with one NHS trust found liable for 1,200 people dying while in its care and a further five trusts facing investigation.

• Spending on schools in the UK rising by over 86%, while the Ofsted chief inspector declares ‘standards have stalled’.

• And debt. Oh, my goodness. The UK currently owes, excluding bank bail-out costs, just under £1.2 trillion. That’s almost £40,000 per working person. In just five years the coalition government, on a so-called austerity drive, will add £700 billion to the national debt. That’s more than the combined total of every British government of the past 100 years. For all the talk of ‘fiscal cliffs’ and ‘debt ceilings’ in the US, President Barack Obama has overseen an administration that, in its first term, increased the national debt by 60%, adding $6 trillion. The first 41 presidents only managed $5 trillion combined.

Many of these things were unthinkable ten years ago, yet they are now part of our daily experience. A lot seems to be going wrong. Is this just an inevitable fact of life, or is it something else? I happen to think it’s something else. And that’s what this book is about. Many of our most fundamental institutions, social arrangements, economic policies and political ideas seem to be breaking down. They are either in acute crisis, or close to it. Things that we have taken for granted for decades – that a bank is a safe place to put money, that the NHS looks after its patients, or that European countries have left the conflicts of the Second World War behind them, for example – are now in doubt. If we are coming to some sort of boiling point, it’s essential to understand what the fundamental problems actually are and how they came about, otherwise there is the real danger that, misguidedly, we replace what we have with something worse – as happened with Fidel Castro’s great Cuban revolution, Communist Russia and Nazi Germany. ‘Only a crisis – actual or perceived,’ said economist Milton Friedman, ‘produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.

I subscribe to George Orwell’s view that, ‘on the whole human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not quite all the time.’ The problem, as I see it, is not so much individuals but systems. Accidentally or otherwise, our systems of government, finance and economics have been modified and manipulated and now no longer have the effects their originators intended; they have become entrenched, out of anyone’s control, and seemingly possible to change or remove. It feels like the West is an unstoppable train, hurtling down the tracks; but we are on the wrong tracks, going to the wrong place. Nothing seems to slow this train, let alone reverse it. It’s too big; it’s going too fast.",cryptocurrency,1385314958

Bitcoin,The Future of Bitcoin,"It's another one those “let's have a rational discussion about Bitcoin” posts.

As something of a believer I am not interested in trashing Bitcoin, but it's clear that not everyone's vision of the future for Bitcoin is the same, so here is mine.

First the negative.

Bitcoin is terrible for in person transactions, and I suspect it always will be.  What Bitcoin excels at is being “Internet Money”.  No average Joe wants to wait 10 minutes for a confirmation whilst buying a cup of coffee.  The main arguments against this are a mixture of “zero confirms is good enough” and “services on top of Bitcoin facilitating off chain transactions”. 

Merchants do care about small value losses, the CCTV cameras in most small convenience stores prove this, whilst the Satoshi client does not let you double spend easily with zero confirms, in terms of the protocol it is trivial.  If Bitcoin adoption grows and zero confirms start to become common we should assume we will see alternate clients designed to make double spending as easy as possible.  

As for services facilitating off chain transactions, what is the difference from the consumers point of view between this and a Credit Card?, add in the fees for this off chain service and you are likely at the same cost as a CC payment.  Bitcoin adds little value over cash or CC in the real world, fiat currencies for transacting locally are difficult to beat.

The enthusiasm for Bitcoin is impressive, but Bitcoin's future does not lie in Subway, bars, coffee shops, etc.

Bitcoin has also conclusively proved that not everybody is ready to be their own bank, here are some examples.

* MtGox gaining new customers despite their banking problems being well publicised.
* People complaining about the price rising after they sold coins, expecting the exchange to make up the difference (yes I have come across this on IRC and it didn't appear to be joke).
* BFL pre order customers forcing refunds from PayPal, despite BFL having a poor reputation before they began accepting ASIC orders.
* People losing coins because they don't understand how change addresses work.
* People forgetting passwords to their wallets.
*People losing coins due to insecure wallets, poor passwords, brain wallets, web wallets, etc.

The last point about security is important, I consider myself to be fairly technical but find the task of securing Bitcoins daunting.  The most difficult scenario is where someone has a lot of coins but needs to spend some of them frequently.  The community could really do with a dedicated guide about security listing the options and trade off's, the Bitcoin wiki page currently is a bit too focussed on the Satoshi client.

Note that simply blaming the user isn't good enough, CC and cash offer a much better consumer experience (lost your credit card?, call your bank and get it cancelled and re-issued).

Now the positive.

I see lots of scenarios where Bitcoin is incredibly successful but the average Joe knows nearly nothing about it.

* Buying things over the internet (duh), particularly internationally.  Bitcoin gels very well with the increasingly globalised and smaller world that we live in.
* Remittances.
* Allowing unbanked people to participate in the global economy cheaply.
* A stable and liquid reserve currency which could become a kind of meta currency.  For example currently if you try to convert two disparate currencies through FOREX, say Singapore Dollar and South African Rand, the money will likely be converted into USD in between.  Bitcoin could be well suited to this intermediate step.
* B2B transactions, Bitcoin is great way for companies to settle with each other.
* Savings, Bitcoin is a great way to diversify, whilst nothing is guaranteed in life, Bitcoin being widely adopted means it is likely to hold it's value.

The last point is also important, one common theme I see in the Bitcoin community is that of banks hating Bitcoin.  For investment banks in particular this is likely to false, they currently trade and speculate on a large number of commodities every day and would welcome a global instrument like Bitcoin.  

Retail banks don't have much to fear either, as previously mentioned even Bitcoiners love to be able to reverse payments in some circumstances (BFL pre orders).

I suspect the reason the banks are not all over Bitcoin yet, is due to a combination of regulatory worries and inertia.  Banks have become risk averse since the 2008 financial collapse and it would be disingenuous to suggest that Bitcoin is without risk.

One final point about inflation versus deflation, roughly speaking most western countries were on the gold standard for about a 100 years, and we have been off it for nearly as long.  What is often ignored by newcomers to Bitcoin (but I have seen raised in the community) is that a monetary system is not independent of the world it exists in.  The last hundred years have seen a huge increase in the planets population and this will inevitably bring with it resource scarcity.  There may be a perfect one size fits all monetary policy, I doubt Bitcoin will be it, but Bitcoin may be exactly what the world needs to get the world through leaner times.

So to summarise, I find it hard to envision Bitcoin replacing fiat completely, if Bitcoin is really successful fiat could be commonly measured against Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency,1385290731

personalfinance,"I think I have an opportunity to make some money, but I'm not the world's greatest mathematician.","I graduated from college last year, and I currently am paying off a loan to my father for a portion of my tuition costs.  Here are the details:

* Initial Balance:  $23,364.63
* Interest Rate: 4%
* Payment Period:  12 years (144 months)
* First Payment Date:  September 1 2012
* Monthly Payment: $205.68
* Current Balance: $21,536.18
* Principle Paid to Date:  $1,955.82
* Interest Paid to Date: $1,129.37

Earlier this year I also inherited about $100,000 from another family member.  Although I initially thought about paying off my loan in full, I elected not to because my father wasn't stressing the loan (he thought it was important for me to have liquidity in this job market) and because I thought I could do better than a 4% return in the market (I have).

However, I spoke with him the other day, and he mentioned if I wanted to pay off the loan early, he would let me pay off the principle directly (in the monthly increments already specified by the loan) and effectively 'skip' the interest payment for that month.

It seems to me that since the interest payments are front loaded for the loan, and the principle payments are back loaded, I could achieve a higher rate of return than I can in the market by paying off part of the loan.

If I were to just use the next month as an example, if I were to pay off the loan early I would 'invest' $133.89 in principle payment to 'earn' $71.79 in skipped interest payment (a return of 53%).

The farther in advance I pay off, the lower the return is, but I imagine I could target a certain return and pay off to that number.

Is there something big that I'm missing?

Below is what I'm attempting to describe - here's what my payment schedule would look like if I prepaid the next 5 payments:

personalfinance,Advice on paying down debt,"I'm a first time poster to reddit and just finding this particular subreddit.  I was hoping to get some thoughts/advice on my credit issues. 

I do pretty well for myself overall and bring home about $2700 a month after taxes.  Due to some poor spending/savings habits, tough medical and veteranian expenses, and my student loans increasing as my income has increased; I'm barely scraping by.  Without help from my parents and family (which I'm fortunate to have and thankful for), I'd be in a very tough spot.

However, I can't keep asking for money from family and relying on them to help me pay down my debt.  I want to get my credit cards paid off and be in a more manageable place, but the interest rates are killing me. 

Currently, I pay a $1200/month mortgage, $600 in student loans, $400 on my car (only 16 months left there!!), about $500 in utilities (this has just killed me this year, I'm still paying for my heat from last winter but finishing off the budget there this month and should be down to $300), and currently have about $25000 in credit card &amp; medical debt (the medical is low...about $4000 and some of that is on a care credit card) that is about $1000/month in bills.  In other words, my expenses are about $700 more than my income without even getting to living expenses (groceries, dog food, occasional other expenses).

I've been tempted by debt management, debt consolidation, and credit counseling, but am scared of the stories I've heard from those programs about scams.  My goals are to pay back everything I owe, close out most of my credit accounts, but find a way to make it manageable for my budget.  Any recommendations or resources that are helpful to getting debt under control?  Thanks in advance, I'm going to learn as I go how to use reddit, so please bear with me there as well.",finance,1385415769

My wife and I make about $145,000 a year combined. We are 25 with no kids (may change but not for 3-4 years at least).

I've been lurking a while and figured I would finally submit something. Below is my budget and if you want to steal the format go ahead. It's not as fancy as the ones posted on the sidebar, but it's easier to read IMO. 

I would like some input on whether I'm on track or not. Sometimes I feel like it's an endless battle trying to defeat the debt, and a little bit of moral support goes along way. I've made my mistakes, now it's time to fix it. Right now my goals in order are to:

1. **Save $1800 more towards my emergency fund.** I'm in the Marine Corps so job security isn't an issue, but I'll be moving out of my house in a year and a half so I need to save for rental property costs.

2. **Cancel my credit card.** Just having it, is too much of a temptation. I think if I transfer my balance to a lower interest loan or a 0% apr card deal, I might be able to save some cash on interest.

3. **Pay off my general loan.** I think I can start spending $600 a month once I pay up my emergency fund. Once I do that I'll be able to pay it off in 15 months (not ocunting the tax refund and raises).

4. **Pay of my Credit Card.** I want pay my credit card off second since it has such a high interest rate and high balance. 

5. **Pay into Retirement at max.** After my card and loan are paid off, my retirement will be able to compete with my debt's interest rates. So time to push it to the limit.

6. **Pay off car.** I have a pretty great interest rate on the car so I don't intend to pay it off until 2017. 

Any critique, or ideas on how I could pay off some debt faster would be great. Just being able to discuss my situation with someone is helpful enough. So, thanks in advance.

personalfinance,Can someone check my financial plan?,"Background: I'm a 23 year old college educated man making about $55k engaged to a college educated woman making about $67k. Her family is financially stable while mine was less so. She has expressed interest in a financial plan so I want to draw outline. We live together and both have stable jobs with great career advancement opportunities.

Debt: I had to finance my own education. I have about $65k in student loans which I am on track to pay off in 5 years and the interest rates are pretty low (5% and less). I am also paying off a 3 year car loan at twice minimum payment. She has no debts and we have 6 months savings.

My question comes with retirement savings. She has a traditional 401k which she is investing to get full match (6%). I am not eligible for our 401k until next year but there is no match. I want to open an IRA but am more confused than when I started after reading the sidebar and previous IRA threads. It seems like we should both open Vanguard Roth IRAs as we can afford to contribute the maximum but our tax rate is relatively high now. I fear that with our savings and potential inheritance from her side of the family our tax rate may not be lower in retirement though. Is that a fair concern? We have talked about opening Roths now and if our income continues to increase open a traditional IRA and adjust contributions. Am I correct in thinking that is a possibility?

business,Davenport real estate lawyer loses license after fraud,"Dorota Dyman &amp; Associates Real Estate - A Davenport real estate lawyer who was convicted of helping buyers fraudulently secure inflated loans before the 2008 housing crash will lose his ability to practice law, the Iowa Supreme Court decided Friday.

The court revoked the law license of Marc Engelmann, saying his conduct caused large financial losses to lenders even if it did not enrich him. Engelmann, 62, is serving a three-year prison term after a federal jury convicted him in 2011 of wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy.

Engelmann represented a seller in nine different sales of residential properties to the same two buyers. In each transaction, Engelmann filed official forms that overstated the actual sales price by $30,000. The inflated price deceived lenders, who approved loans for the buyers that were larger than the actual prices. The seller received the higher price gave a $30,000 kickback to the buyers at closing. The buyers defaulted on the home loans after the 2008 market crash, causing a loss to the lenders of $393,000.

Engelmann testified that he believed it was appropriate, if unusual, for the deals to be structured with a ""cash refund"" to the buyers, and he denied committing fraud. But the high court rejected that argument Friday, as the jury did in 2011. A federal appeals court also has upheld his convictions.

Justice Thomas Waterman said Engelmann made repeated misrepresentations that deceived lenders. As a sophisticated real estate attorney, Engelmann knew or should have known that the deals were unethical and refused to take part, he wrote.

Engelmann collected only a $350 fee for each closing and did not otherwise benefit from the fraud. But Waterman said the crime nonetheless forced banks to suffer great losses.

Engelmann had practiced law since 1976 with an unblemished disciplinary record, handling thousands of real estate transactions in the Quad-City area of eastern Iowa and western Illinois. He is incarcerated at a prison in Terre Haute, Ind., with a projected release date of Oct. 14, 2014, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

personalfinance,How to handle discretionary income from (optional) extra work,"I'm interested in getting a couple other opinions or how other people have solved the following 'situation'.

Us: 25 years old - Fiancee and I have been very fortunate - both parents provided substantial financial backing to pay for all schooling, cars, my parents supported me starting a landscaping in high school that I was able to sell client list and keep all proceeds. Our current situation:

Annual combined income: ~95k 'guaranteed' by her salary (engineer) plus my paltry contribution (graduate student - 25k).

We purchased a home in an expensive part of the country as we will likely be here 5+ years. Her parents loaned us 100k for downpayment @ 1% annual interest rate. It's a large place so we took on a roommate for an additional 1k per month so we are paying substantially less than we would pay for rent anyway.

Our cars are both in excellent condition and paid off and we have no debts (minus mortage) 

Our current monthly expenses result in: after mortage payment, utilities, food, cell phones, expenses etc we are currently putting away 2k into long term savings (401k, roths, etc) as well as paying her parents back 1k.

So here is the situation:

I'm in a highly specific graduate program and have opportunities to do some additional consulting work. Most jobs pay between 2-10k and take 20-100 hours (aka around $100/hour). The 'problem' is I already work around 70 hours a week for my graduate work so taking these jobs literally means me doing nothing for weeks on end but work. 

To 'make it worth it' I proposed to my fiancee that we take the money I make - or at least a substantial portion of it (after taxes) - and use the majority of it for ""splurge"" money - vacation, new computer, etc. She wants to treat it as all our other income (which is to say 10% goes into ""spending money"" pool, rest is placed in investments/savings).

I personally am fine with at least some of it going into savings but to me only seeing a couple hundred dollars of 'spending' money for literally giving up any ability to have any free time for social events, hobbies, etc is not worth the long term payout given we already have a solid (imo) long-term plan in place.

Based on our (decently frugal) lifestyle we're already putting ~25k per year into retirement accounts, 10k to her parents to pay back the mortage loan) and also have to a middle 5 figure investment account that does well enough, which at our age I believe is doing quite well for setting ourselves up for the long haul.

The final 'argument' I have is my field has a pretty high level of job security and based on networking and a couple consulting jobs I've previously taken I have standing job offers for solid 6 figure starting salary once I finish my PhD. I don't like to 'bet' on future income projections but with everything as it is I think that taking this additional income and using to ""live a little"" is not unreasonable.

personalfinance,Refinancing Private/Federal Student Loans,"I recently came across www.sofi.com and thought it was an absolute Godsend! Its a service that will refinance both your private and federal loans. The interest rates are linked to the LIBOR rates, so they are pretty low. You can get a fixed rate of as low as 4-5% or a variable rate as low as 2.5% is you qualify. 

The website is very well organized and maintained. UX/UI is amazing, and so easy to use. I started an application, filled out all the info, got all the necessary statements and pay-off amounts for my loans. Customer service always picks up the phone and answer your questions, you don't need to go through an automated menu. They said that they would get back to me within 24 hours of submitting the application. 

Its been 5 days and I still haven't heard from them.

I have over $35k in student loans (both private and federal) at varying interest rates from 3.95% all the way to 7.5%. (Funny thing, Federal/Stafford loans, even the subsidized ones, carry a higher interest rate than the private ones.)

My question is, does anyone know of another service like SoFi? I have called every bank and credit union I could think of (JP Morgan, Citi, PNC, Discover, Sallie Mae, BOA, NEFCU...) but none of them will take on to refinance student loans, especially Federal loans. The Fed will consolidate your loans, but not refinance. My schools' financial aid office was of no help. Darien Rowayton Bank will only refinance for those students with Master's/graduate degrees.

This includes a dozen or so student loans, from two different federal loan servicers.  The oldest loan is about 8 years ago, and the most recent is less than a year ago.  (Grad school).  Given my debt load, it's likely I will be in repayment for at least 4-6 years.

I'm worried, though, that right now my loans are an open credit account, and that every passing month is good (in that regard), and that consolidating will effectively (a) close all of my loan accounts, stopping their age at their current age, and (b) start a new account that lowers the average.  In 4-6 years, I wonder if my average age will be significantly lower if I consolidate now than if I don't.

personalfinance,Why a max of 25% of after-tax income towards a house?,"Hi /r/Personalfinance. I'm looking at buying a house soon in the 170k-240k range. I currently have ~45k saved in a short term corporate bond fund for a down payment, and my parents have offered to loan me the balance of what I'd need for a 20% down payment at the same interest rate my mortgage will be. I make ~$3,800/month after taxes and 401k contributions. (I am not maxing out my Roth 401k yet, only putting in 8% to get the full 6% matching funds, because I have been saving for a house). I also max out my Roth IRA each year. I am single, have no dependents (although I would like to get a dog once I have a house), no long-term debt, and very few expenses. As a result, I invest or save about $2,300 of my $3,800 after tax/401k monthly income. I currently pay $800 in rent, which will obviously be offset by buying a house.

I've seen the rule that I shouldn't put more than 25% of my after tax income towards a house, but I can't help but feel like that is an absurdly conservative number given my financial situation. I could put 50% of my income towards my house note and still easily save about $1,000 per month. So what's the basis for the 25% rule?

Bitcoin,Worried about a potential government crackdown on bitcoin? Relax a bit. Don't forget that politicians and bankers are essentially prostitutes.,"The Molyneux-Schiff debate, which touched a lot on the theme of the threat of a crackdown, got me thinking.  

We should not assume that the powerful rent takers in DC and Manhattan are not silently acquiring BTC to hedge their bets.  (I refer to politicians, lobbyists, congressional staff, bankers, and, yes, even economists and officials at the FED).  This goes likewise for the same types of people in London, Frankfurt and political capitals the world round.

These people (for the most part, and despite the rhetoric) are without principles.  But they are not stupid.  So they have begun to realize what a difficult job it would be to shut down a de-centralized system such as the block chain.  Plus, existing laws for the most part do not outlaw bitcoin, so for them to pass such laws and regulations would require them to perform some very unpleasant intellectual and political contortions.  So their reluctance to begin a crackdown must be serious.  

Now, at the same time some of them are surely acquiring bitcoins for their personal accounts.  As the value of these goes up, so does their reluctance to clamp down.  I am convinced these people are mostly without sincere ideology, they just want to preserve the wealth and power of their caste.  And they want to get re-elected (BTC campaign contributions anyone?).  At some point it could be the case that for their aggrandizement it makes more sense to embrace bitcoin rather than reject it.

personalfinance,A few quick questions before I try to help out my parents.,"I follow this subreddit quite a bit and I feel like I am pretty well-informed on how to budget, prepare for retirement, etc. So thank you to everyone who posts on here regularly. Anyways, I just found out my parents are sitting on top of about $40,000 of credit card debt and they've basically been carrying CC debt for ~20 years, most of the interest rates are around 15%. He is really disorganized about the whole thing, we are going to sort through all the different cards/payments soon and get on some kind of budget so he can really tackle the debt. Know that a lot of these numbers were estimated after talking this weekend.

 Luckily, my dad makes a good amount of income(~$150,000/yr before taxes). In addition, they owe about $300,000 on the most recent mortgage, this isn't really what I'm worried about as the house is worth a lot more than that and they will probably downscale at some point. I really want him to pay off the credit cards and stop using them.

He will probably be retiring in about 5 years and he will collect a yearly pension of about $80,000 (70% of his base salary). He has also been contributing to a traditional IRA (balance around $10,000) and a Roth (around $10,000). He only just started to invest in these the last decade or so (both through Ameritrade). He has also been getting screwed for life insurance for probably the last 30 years, as I'm sure most people on this sub can imagine.

Basically I have a question about these IRA's. My first instinct is to just withdraw the balance of the Roth and knock out as much CC debt right off the bat as possible, is this a good idea? Is consolidating a real option? Is it worth it? I have some PLUS loans in his name, could he withdraw from the traditional IRA penalty-free to knock out those loans and take the money I would have put towards it to the CC debt?",finance,1385456553

investing,Margin investing,"I've been thinking about alternative investment ideas lately and wanted to get some feedback on one of them:

With interest rates on Interactive Brokers' margin accounts so low (1.59% right now), would it make sense to buy a few stable, blue chip stocks or diversified ETFs with high dividends? It seems to me like a good way to leverage up returns without taking on too much risk. I would benefit from the leveraged dividend payment  (which would cover the interest on borrowed funds ) as well as underlying principal appreciation - would plan on holding the positions for the long term. 

I understand the obvious risks: declining stock price would be bad, but since maintenance margin is 25%, that's a pretty big cushion, especially on blue-chip dividend paying stocks. Further, I think the long term buy and hold strategy could help to mitigate this. Also I imagine increasing interest rates might make this less attractive, but I don't really have an idea on how much margin rates are likely to increase. Any advice on that?

I would also like to point out this strategy would use a relatively small share of my overall portfolio, I'm not gambling my entire life savings here.

The Situation: I just got engaged to my boyfriend of seven years and, though I had started saving for a wedding, I'm nowhere near my goal.  Neither is he. I was never good with money and, a few years ago, I tried to change that. I personally plan to have $4,000 saved by May 2015 (we will absolutely not be married before then) but, as I started planning, I realize that I will need to make large deposits on venue, photographer, etc. WELL before this money is actually saved. Really did not think of this.



The Question: Some of my friends have told me to put everything on my credit cards and pay it off in increments. I am EXTREMELY uncomfortable with this and do not want to do it. Is this normal? Are my friends crazy? Instead of doing this, should my fiance and I try to take out a personal loan? We can likely get a low (under 10%) interest rate. Other options?



My information: I'm 26, fiance is 27. My take home pay is around $2,000 a month. His is slightly lower. My credit score, according to CreditKarma, is in the 700s (it's probably lower than that in reality). Disclosure on the next statement: I used to be terrible with money. Some would say I still am. A few years ago, I started trying to build an emergency fund but a few personal things happened, causing me to drain it. It happened, I was extremely upset, now I have to move on because I can't change a damn thing. I have $1,400 in credit card debt at ranges of 18% to 22% (I know, I'm cringing. This was from believing it was good to carry a debt! Also, see disclosure). I have no student loans.  I have $6,200 left on my car (I pay $275.24 a month). My portion of the rent is $475, my cell phone bill (two lines) is about $150 a month, and my utilities are about $100. My fiance and I love to eat and drink so we do that a lot...and are probably spending far too much on it. We are planning to cut it wayyy down starting now. My credit utilization is 15%. I have a pension with my job which is probably not important since I'm not touching it.



That's about it. I'm new to this and hoping everyone is still patient from the Moronic Monday Thread. Any advice other than ""wait until you've saved enough""?

Hong Kong faces risks from QE exit, Shanghai zone

Hong Kong is facing twin challenges next year, with increased market risks due to the expected ending of monetary easing in the United States and keener competition from regional rivals such as Singapore and Shanghai's free-trade zone, the city's central bank chief and business leaders said yesterday.

At a General Chamber of Commerce business summit, Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam warned local businesses and investors to beware of the risks of an outflow of funds and a sharp rise in interest rates if, as expected, US monetary policy changes next year.

Another challenge is competition from rivals, with a chamber survey released at the summit showing 73 per cent of members considered Singapore a better financial centre than Hong Kong.

The survey, to which 319 member companies responded, also showed 60.2 per cent thought Hong Kong's competitiveness had deteriorated in the past year, against 31.7 per cent who said it was unchanged and just 8.1 per cent who thought it had improved.

It also found that 53 per cent of companies plan to give pay rises of up to 5 per cent next year, with about 20 per cent of firms planning rises of between 5 and 10 per cent, but 23 per cent not planning any rise at all.

Chan warned Hongkongers to beware of the risks related to the impending US exit from the quantitative easing programme - the monetary easing policies adopted by the Federal Reserve since the global financial crisis in 2008.

The QE programme has injected US$2.8 trillion into the market to boost the US economy but has also led to capital flowing into Hong Kong's stock and property markets. An outflow is likely when QE ends.

""US can't have QE forever,"" Chan said. ""The US government will exit from the market sooner or later. It may be in March or May next year. We will keep warning the public not to incur excessive debt simply because interest rates are currently at very low levels.

""The exit from QE will have a negative spillover effect here. We need to stand ready to face the shockwaves.""

HSBC Asia-Pacific chief executive Peter Wong Tung-shun said at the summit that Hong Kong companies needed to prepare for challenges from Shanghai and other mainland free-trade zones, which would compete with Hong Kong for talent and business.

""We need to have the right attitude to face these challenges,"" Wong said. ""We need to position ourselves to prepare for the next 10 years of development of China. We need to stay ahead.""

He said Hong Kong needed to think of its position when the yuan became freely convertible, maybe as early as in 2020, or when Shanghai introduced an international board.",finance,1385428261

Bitcoin,What is bitcoin backed by? Let me tell you.,"I am tired of reading troll posts on news sites where gold whackjobs and brainwashed fiat slaves argue bitcoin is backed b nothing. Let me dust off my old unused economics degree here. Golds was used for economic activity because it did not deteriorate. It held up as a savings. It was rare but not easily divisible. That is why silver was used asss well. Silver and gold are hedges in modern times. They are the best store of value IF CIVILIZATION IS WIPED OUT BACK TO THE DARK AGES. SO I agree having a little is good but it will not grow your wealth.

Fiat/dollars are backed by DEBT. It is not made by the government but by private banks. The government could issue currency tomorrow backed only by belief.. but the fed backs their dollars on the debt owed by taxes on labor and land and commerce. A citizen owes the government money every year. If they hold land, worked to eat or sold assets. So fiat is exchanged for someone e's effort. And the fed decides what value that bldholds. The fed borrows that right from the people. 
Bitcoin is backed by a concensus of people who retained their right of money for their efforts. Unmaniputable. If some people find it worth a lot and some find it worth nothing then the value meets in the middle.
Even non participants affect the price. Because if they bought the value goes up. It I'd not decided by a central bank.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is the perfect blend of currency, equity, and social capital","Like most people, I found bitcoin just as interesting as anything else you found randomly on the internet a few years ago. ""Internet tokens, cool."" But after seeing Cyprus dump its money into Bitcoin to escape seizure and make a fortune in the process, I realized that the game had changed. I just bought my first 0.5 BTC. Even if Bitcoin is not ""the future of money"", the future of money has Bitcoin in the mix in a big way.

Fiat currency is great obviously, especially when it's issued by a military/economic superpower. But when you hold dollars, you hold a single unit of currency that belongs to an unknown proportion of the entire currency pool, in circulation and reserve. Even if you're not a fan of the fed, centralized banking has its merits, and does a good job maintaining a balance between currency in circulation and reserve and therefore has some measure of control on the liquidity of the US economy- the ease of exchange of goods and services. But you already know all of this.

What I find amazing is that while bitcoin serves this P2P exchange purpose, it is also in fact an equity stake in the entirety of the blockchain. Even if it all goes bust and bitcoin hits 0 for good, you still own that portion of the blockchain and you can prove it. Your wallet is in fact a stock certificate. And you've laid claim to an indisputable portion of all of the bitcoins both mined and ever to be mined.

Some of you might know the story of the island of Yap, an island in Micronesia that used giant stone disks as currency. Legend has it that a ship carrying one of these stones was shipwrecked and the disk sank to the bottom of the ocean. But when the crew got back to shore, they told everyone what happened, and ownership of the stone continued to be exchanged as legitimate currency only without the hassle of lugging a giant stone disk around. 

""Hey Bob, I'll trade you my giant stone disk at the bottom of the ocean for some your wife's fantastic pot roast."" 

""Sure thing Rick, we still fishing tomorrow?""

Bitcoin allows the global liquidity benefit of digital and the local cultural benefit of stone disks. And as the world continues to develop, and we continue to get running water and broadband out to more and more people, bitcoin will bring the individual livelihoods of people across the planet closer together than ever before. It will do for personal finance what the telephone (and then the web) did for communication.

So, now that the obvious stocks option is out of the way, there are also bonds. Now, unlike stocks where I have some knowledge as what to do with research, technical indicators, reading charts, etc. I have no idea what to do with bonds. All I know is the coupon rate is the interest rate, I know what what junk bonds are and what the ratings are, thats about it. So if those of you think that this is the way to go, perhaps you could give me a good starting position.

And then we have the retirement accounts. I know absolutely nothing in this area except for the name Roth IRA which is thrown around quite a lot. This is all long term stuff, so is the amount of money I have now even worth putting in to an IRA account? And are there other accounts?

Just a bit of more information. I currently do not have a job, so there is no stable income although I do babysit quite a bit and make some nice money off of that. So, ideas, thoughts, suggestions?",finance,1385517438

personalfinance,401k Asset allocation - Unsure if 401k investments options are worth it,"My wife recently began a new job in which she is eligible to contribute to a 401k plan that will give a 50% match to the first 6% contributed.

personalfinance,"How would you handle a raise paid in bitcoins? (Or, ""Let's talk about capital gains and FIFO."")","Sorry for being another btc post...

My husband got a significant raise yesterday which will, for better or worse, be paid bimonthly in bitcoins (his regular salary is paid in cash).  To keep numbers easy, let's say it's $1000 worth of bitcoins a month.

He obviously can't have anything withheld from a bitcoin salary, so we will be responsible for his share of FICA.  Next year, we'll be in the 25% marginal tax bracket, so total tax rate on what he gets in btc will be 38.72% (25% federal, 7.65% FICA, .0607 state/local).

Our plan is to increase his W-4 withholding to account for the federal taxes portion.  Overall, though, we will have to cash out $387 monthly just to be sure we can pay the taxes on it.  To actually ""feel"" the raise, we'll have to cash out more.

The problem with that is that I've been advised by an accountant (who will be doing my returns from now on) that the bitcoins will be considered sold on a first in, first out basis.  My understanding is this is because they aren't stock or mutual funds so we can't pick what lot we're selling from (please tell me with confidence that this is wrong).

The reason that is a problem is we already have a lot of bitcoins acquired when they were worth $10.  This year our capital gains tax rate is 0%, next year it will be 15%.  So to break even on the raise, we really will have to cash out $455 monthly, and will pay 15% on anything above that.  Obviously we will then be regularly acquiring bitcoins with a higher basis that could be an issue later, but with FIFO there doesn't appear to be anything we can do about that.

We don't technically *need* 100% of the raise.  We're planning on taking advantage of our temporary 0% capital gains rate to pay off high interest debt this year.  We want to leave some of the $1000 in btc in case it blows up.  But we also want to enjoy the extra income.  Any number between $455 and $1000 will be pretty arbitrary - and there's the opportunity of whatever we leave in there skyrocketing even more, or the risk of it being completely worthless overnight.  

So what would you do?

**tl;dr - How would you withdraw old, low basis bitcoins so you see a raise paid in new, high basis bitcoins but don't get eaten alive by taxes?**",finance,1385656945

Bitcoin,a way to encourage spending Bitcoins?,"It is probably too late now, but I had an idea that could use some feedback.  In order to encourage consumers to use bitcoin, and to get over the fear of spending them when, 6 months down the road, they'll be worth twice as much, what about having the merchant kick back part of the initial transaction? It's not quite a ""refund"", at least I wouldn't call it that.

How much to kick back and when depends on various factors - time, volatility, the initial amount...  I'm not an economist, so I can't say what makes sense.  But the real world price of the goods or service bought is a factor in how much gets refunded, and the merchant ought to be able to charge some sort of interest rate (the time value of money and all that), so the eventual amount of profit (in bitcoin) they get after the kick back is slightly more than the ""real world"" profit.

For example, if 1 BTC = $10 (if only...) and I sell you a book that costs $10, then you pay 1 BTC.  A year from now, when BTC/USD = 1/$20, I ""refund"" you 0.9 BTC, and thus you'll get over the psychological trauma of having spent BTCs when they were not worth as much.  In return, I have made more profit (but not an excessive amount) by accepting Bitcoin and providing this ""refund"".  This seems to be a way to tie the value of bitcoin to fiat currencies for some sort of benefit....  I just thought this up, so there are certainly holes.

A very simple example and I'm sure there is something I'm overlooking, but if Bitcoin is to succeed, getting people to avoid buying and holding is crucial.  How can human psychology be leveraged to manipulate the system in the desired way?",cryptocurrency,1385650923

personalfinance,I am in need of financial advice and guidance,"Hello Personal Finance! I am need of some sound financial advice. I am 19 and I am about to graduate from a community college with no debt because I paid my way through with money I recieved while working at an internship. Recently, I have recieved on offer for a full-time position at the company I work for. Starting salary is $45,000 a year with bonus options,employee stock, tuition reimburstment, and excelent insurance. Given that my company wil pay for me to further my education, I can use that money for something else (I do want to make an effort to continue my education). Currently, I have $10,000 in my credit union, of which includes $2500 in checking, $2500 in savings, $4500 in a money market account, and $500 in a student CD. I already own a car that I have paid for, in full. My only monthly expenses are car insurance $40, Cell Phone bill $40, and that is it. I also have a VISA with a $2000 limit that I use in place of a debit card and pay off in full at the end of the month. Altogether, I have a credit score of 725.

Now for what I need advice on:

Given that I am still living with my parents, I don't feel like it is right burdening them when I am making enough money to live on my own. So, I am looking for a place to live. Since I already have a job in the area and there are 3 potential Universities down the road from me, I know I will be staying in place longer than 5 years, so I feel like renting would be a bit of a waste, especially because the average apartment in my area goes for $1200 a month. Another thing to rule out here would be houses, which are usually run about $300,000. Condos on the other hand average $70,000 - $145,000 for two bedrooms. Would it be a wise decision to get a condo? I have already been pre-approved for a $75,000 loan with 4.3%  interest.  My next question involves mortgages themselves. 

I was told that because interest rates will never be this low again, a 30 year mortgage be a better choice than a 15 year mortgage, even if you can afford a 15 year mortgage. Is there any truth to this? Would it really be better to get a 30 year mortgage and just pay more per month than what's required to pay it off faster?

Is there anything I can do at my age that will help me out in the future? For example, I like to pretend like I wont have social security, but I don't know how to save for that awful situation. Is there anything you wish you would have financially done at my age?

Bitcoin,A case against deflationary currencies (such as BTC).,"I've explained this before in some comments [(like this one)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1q0e3v/with_bitcoin_price_going_up_what_is_my_incentive/cd7x1y8), but thought it would be worth a post on to itself.

in a deflationary environment (when currencies gain value over time relative to the goods and services) there is no market for lending at lower real interest rates, (IE if nowadays some people borrow at 12%/year, and the inflation is 2%/year, then the real interest is 10%/per year (because after a year the same amount is 2% easier to come by, the currency is cheaper by 2%); but if deflation is IE 20%, then the real interest rate is actually 32%, so people would likely not borrow with such high real interest rates. only if the real interest rate was IE 10% (as it was with a 2% inflation environment) would people borrow; but that would have to mean that the interest rate asked by the lender would have to be negative 10% (10% real interest rate = 20% deflation + X% lending interest rate &lt;=&gt; 10%-20%=-10%) of course none in their right mind would lend money to get less of it back latter, so... problem... Some people are still willing to borrow money at such high real interest rates, but it removes alot of the lower real interest rates market that exists with a non-deflationary currency.

*{EDIT: sorry if the wording is confusing to some; I've tried to give a [better explanation in a reply to another redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1rpd16/deflationary_currency_cant_work_doesnt_work_itd/cdq05gm) in another thread (although it doesn't seem to have helped that redditor, (frustratingly), but it might help others):*

&gt;*if deflation is IE 10% (AKA if the value of the currency increases by 10% per year relative to goods and services priced in that currency; AKA if prices (of goods and services in that currency) lower by about 10% per year), and a loan has 1% interest rate, that means the real interest rate is 11% (because after 1 year the value of the money of the loan is 10% higher (AKA it is 10% harder/more_expensive to get that same amount of money). The result is that from a borrowers POV he is borrowing with 11% interest rate (he will have to get 11% more value to pay back that loan), but the lender is only getting 1% from lending his money. given the lender would never lend at or less then 0% interest rate, the minimum real interest rate (the rate of value that the borrower has to earn per year in order to pay back the loan) is more then 10%. this means there is no possibility for a borrower to borrow money to fund a project that has an expected return on investment of 10% or less. thus the currency cannot cater for a considerable chunk of the lending market.}*

*{EDIT: same as for investments could be seen for purchases, in that investments are just purchasing debt, or conversely purchases are just investing in products that will reap more value then the initial price over time}*

So I believe that for BTC to truly become the main currency in the world, it needs to be non-deflationary. if not can some other non-deflationary currency be used for the lower real interest rates loans market? (I haven't thought much about if this is feasible or desirable) *{EDIT: thx to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1rq9et/a_case_against_deflationary_currencies_such_as_btc/cdps7w6), I come to realize that this approach would not be a solution, and I've explained why as a reply to that comment.}* And if BTC were to become non-deflationary, what would that do to the ""integrity"" of BTC (making such a fundamental change...)?",cryptocurrency,1385756548

Zen Magnets is one of the only last magnetic ball companies in the US thanks to a federal crackdown.  The Consumer Product Safety Comission is pushing the ban of all industry sales because the products are related. 

As a dozen other magnet companies, including Buckyballs, closed their doors or agreed to stop selling, Zen Magnets has enjoyed a steady increase in business.

Perhaps because they take Bitcoins? 

To celebrate Bitcoin Friday, a sale by all participating Bitcoin businesses which takes place on Black Friday, Zen Magnets and Bitcoin Store have decided to partner in order to take the deflationary aspects of the crypto-currency to new extremes.

The Zen Magnets Bitcoin Set, which will contain on average 0.015 bitcoin, is the first product of its kind to be backed by bitcoin. 

As bitcoin rises, the value of the included bitcoin ‘rebate’ in the Zen Bitcoin Set increases as well. Another big point, is that for somebody who already has bitcoin, there is no reason to get the Zen Magnets Bitcoin Set, over the Zen Magnets Gift Set. They will be the exact same price ($40). Except the Bitcoin Set includes an average of 0.015BTC, and a 1% chance of including over .0728BTC (72.8mBTC). Zen Magnets LLC won't be offering any discounts on our magnets, except for this deal. Especially since Zen Magnets are projected to sell out this Holiday Season.

The Zen Bitcoin Set will be sold exclusively on Bitcoinstore.com. During the promotion, Zen Magnets will even get its own category at Bitcoinstore.com.  

But, act fast. 

You might want to secure your Zen Bitcoin Set as soon as possible, as, if Federal authorities have their way, the magnets could soon be illegal on the grounds of public safety. Instead of public safety, how about “due to the ingestion hazard posed to children.”

Zen Magnets hasn't been immune to the pressure faced industry wide.

I have 2 options there, a 6.25% visa or an 8.15% visa rewards with no balance transfer fees.

Can I use my two register discount cards as I have been but instead of paying them immediately instead transfer them immediately to this reward card, pay that off immediately, and get points in addition to the register discounts?

Most have never seen a ""real"" bull market in anything. All they have seen is the 100 year old Fed/Central Banker induced monetary bubble that has caused MUCH of the 100 year rise bonds, stocks, etc. The ultimate BUBBLE that these fools don't get is the existing MONETARY Paradigm they are in. Fiat Currencies backed by nothing...but belief...the war machine, etc.   

Yes, there have been real trends in the last 100 years...industrialization and computers/internet. But much has been FUELED and RULED by central banker induced leverage, and EASY MONEY.

So this bitcoin thing gives people a chance to finally unleash their hate for the irrationality of our system that benefits the top elite..and yet they bash and fall back into the same bubble head talk...while refusing to see the US Dolllar is the biggest bubble of all time..literally. Without the USD constantly being printed and primed and shopped, everything collapses worldwide. I believe the elite get it..that eventually there has to be a new paradigm/solution from which they can rule. I believe they have chosen and released bitcoin as that paradigm bu they are giving us all the ability to profit off of it..if you are awake.

So here is this S-curve blast off coming of BTC..and people are so confused and bewildered..they don't get that this is normal growth curve for any growth company or industry. A guy did a wonderful youtube presentation of this. The fact that BTC has the biggest market cap, the most penetration, and is backed by Wall St tycoon like Thiel...and the fact that the nSA/cia is likely already in BTC...to me says its the right horse to be on.  

I believe the elite are beginning to shift some funds into this...by the time rest of hedge fund world does could be 5k. by the time mom and pop finally buy .001 it could be 25k

You guys don't get it...if nations and fiat currencies really start collapsing again or hyperinflation takes off, this thing will continue to be driven UP and Up.

Bitcoin,It does not matter if a currency is inflationary or deflationary.,"&gt; Econ lesson time! Deflation is the phenomenon where cash grows in value relative to everything around it (that is, prices go down). More specifically, deflation occurs when people expect the value of cash to grow in relative value to everything around it, and prices trend down consistently.

&gt; Question: if your money is getting predictably more valuable, why would you want to spend it? Answer: marginally speaking, you wouldn't.

______

If you live in the States (or a western country with a similar education model), that's what you have been told time and time again throughout your history/government/economics classes in college (and high school). And many other people who are basically blindly retorting the same shit that's been told to them to dispute Bitcoin. 

The main argument against deflation is this: if the value of a certain asset you hold is constantly going up, why would you bother ever exchanging it for something else?

Now... let's try to tackle this by asking the null-hypothesis. If the value of a certain asset you hold is constantly going down, why would you ever bother holding it?

It's because we're forced to use it. We have to pay taxes with them. We have to pay our employees with them. We have to report our income with them. All of the countries that are selling oil to one-another have to use the USD to buy and sell oil. If we don't, then we will either get our country invaded or we will go to federal prison.

The rest of my school expenses are covered by scholarships, and I was planning to cover living expenses out of pocket (I've budgeted approximately $1500/month, which would use up exactly the $70,000 I have saved over 4 years). I should also mention that I have about $25,000 in loans from undergrad which are all subsidized until I finish medical school.

Here's the catch: In order to receive the university loan and other scholarships, I need to take out at least $8500 in a Stafford Loan. Should I pay off these Stafford Loans as I take them out while I still have the savings, and then just take out more 3rd and 4th year after I run out of these savings? Or would it be better to hold onto the money I inherited now and maybe invest it? And if that's the case, should I actually be taking out the maximum from the Stafford Loans (I had the option of taking out up to around $25,000 a year)?

electronics,Suggestions for DIY Cloud Enabled Electronics,"I am mostly interested in software that controls real world events.  Most of my electronics and programming experience has been with bare AVR uC programming in C.  However, I have very recently turned my sights to iPhone programming.

I would like to get more into web-enabled and smart device design.  The UP24 bracelet or NEST thermostat are good examples.

So, I put together an arduino with various environmental sensors and output the values over USB serial to a fedora laptop.  This laptop runs a perl script to parse the incoming serial data, LPF the data, build a json file and upload it via ftp to my server.  Then, I wrote an iPhone app to grab the json file with AFNetworking and parse it to an NSDictionary.  From there I have a very basic text display on my iPhone of the averaged sensor values from the next town over ( where the arduino lives ).  This is the basic framework for a simple weather station.

But, the communication is not bi-directional and there is a superfluous laptop in the mix. I also own a raspberryPi that I have done very little with...

How would you implement bidirectional communication from an iPhone app and remote digital/analog I/O?

What development platforms have you used, or do you think are suitable to investigate as I am exploring new ideas for whatever my next project may be.  I have kind of had my blinders on with my focus being stand alone microcontrollers.  As I mentioned, I have a raspberryPi, but I know there are other platforms such as the beagleboard or beaglebone.

Bitcoin,"How-To: Building an offline cold wallet with a Raspberry Pi, Pidora and Electrum.","After piddling with Bitcoin for ~2 years and seeing my balance wax and wane, I find myself with a dollar value now in the low 5 figures. Small for some, but still enough to make make me grin like an idiot...

However, while I run Linux everywhere, and have multiple encrypted backup copies of my wallet seeds and private keys the chance of getting hacked is (while small) not zero. More importantly, the odds of fat-fingering a transfer and sending someone 1000x what I intend are far more likely. So I just spent a couple of hours installing Electrum onto my Raspberry Pi, and testing it out. Seems to work. :)  
  
  

**Required:**

* Raspberry Pi
* 4G (minimum) SD card (I used a Class 4 card, and found it noticeably slower than the Class 10 I have used before.  Doesn't make a huge difference, but worth considering.)
* USB thumb drive
* Networked computer
  
  

**Installing the base OS:**

* Download Pidora - http://pidora.ca/pidora/releases/18/images/pidora-18-r2c.zip (I know Rasbian is the more common distro for the Pi, but I'm a Fedora/RHEL weenie.  Deal.)
* If you're running Windows, download RawWrite.exe from http://www.chrysocome.net/rawwrite
* Unzip pidora-18-r2c.zip 
* Windows: Use RawWrite to write pidora-18-r2c.img to the SD card.
* Linux: Use dd to write pidora-18-r2c.img to the SD card.  ('sudo dd if=pidora-18-r2c.img of=/dev/sd? bs=4k' where the ? is the letter of the SD card.  Don't get it wrong or you'll trash your Linux system....)
* Plug the SD card into the Pi, and plug it into an HDMI display, connect the network cable, keyboard and mouse and power it up.
* Fedora will ask you a bunch of questions on first boot.  Create a user account, password, and make it part of the Adminstrator group.  Set the root password.  Secure passwords aren't *that* important here.  You'll also probably want to ""Resize Root Filesystem"".  At the end of the setup, the Pi will reboot.
* Boot up the Pi, log in with the user account, and open up a terminal window.
* sudo yum update (Optional - This will apply the latest patches to the install, replacing many, if not most of the installed software with newer versions.  It will take an hour or so.)
* sudo yum install python-pip PyQt4
* Answer ""yes"" to the dependencies.
* sudo pip install http://download.electrum.org/Electrum-1.9.5.tar.gz#md5=e8d66b08f7d1d745e1de04a090d199c2
* Disconnect the network cable.
* Click and drag Applications Menu -&gt; Internet -&gt; Electrum Bitcoin Client to the desktop.
* Right-Click the new Electrum icon the Desktop, and select Properties
* Click the Permissions tab, and check the ""Allow this file to run as a program"" checkbox.
* Click the Launcher tab, and change the Command from ""electrum %u"" to ""electrum --offline %u"".  (Without this, you may run into some problems when Electrum tries to connect to the non-existent network.)
* Click the Close button on the Properties window.

Your setup of the Pi is now complete.  None of the secret information for the wallet has been generated yet, so even if something got in as you built the platform, as long as you never connect it to the network again, you should be secure.
  
  

**Electrum setup:**

* Confirm that the network cable is disconnected.
* Start Electrum from the desktop icon.
* Select ""Create new wallet""
* Electrum will give you a 12 word seed.  Use a text editor (Applications Menu -&gt; Accessories -&gt; gedit is an available GUI editor), and save this seed to a file in the home directory.  ie: ""Wallet.seed""
* Electrum will make you confirm the seed, so paste it into the dialog box.
* Set a wallet password.
* Go to Wallet -&gt; Master Public Key.  Copy the key, and, using a text editor, save it to a file.  ie: ""Wallet-Master-Public-Key.txt""
* Quit Electrum.
* Open a terminal.
* Encrypt the wallet seed:  gpg2 --symmetric Wallet.seed
* Delete the original:  shred -u  Wallet.seed
* Use a complex password for the above, but don't lose it.  It's your backup for the possibility that you lose or damage the card your offline wallet is on.
* Widely distribute the Wallet.seed.gpg file.  Put it on your home and work PC(s). Send it to yourself at your GMail account.  Put it on Dropbox.  As long as your passphrase is good, it's safe.

Your offline wallet is ready.  Now you need to set up your **online** wallet.
  
  

**Online wallet:**

* Put the thumb drive into the USB port of the Pi and copy over the Wallet.seed.gpg file (for distribution) and the Wallet-Master-Public-Key.txt.
* Eject the thumb drive, and plug it into your online PC.
* Install Electrum on the online PC.
* Start Electrum, and create a new wallet.  Select ""Restore wallet from master public key"".
* When prompted, copy and paste the Master Public Key from the thumb drive.  This will create a ""watch only"" wallet corresponding to the offline wallet.

Your online wallet is now ready.  You have public addresses in the online watch only wallet that you can use to fund the offline wallet.  To move funds from the offline wallet, do the following:  (Blatantly stolen from http://electrum.org/tutorials.html#offline-mpk)
  
  

**Performing an offline transaction:**

* [Online PC] Go to the send tab and make a transaction. Instead of sending it, Electrum will detect a seedless wallet and query for a location to save the transaction. Select your USB-Key.
* [Offline PC] Go to Settings -&gt; Import/Export -&gt; ""Load raw transaction"". Select your transaction from the USB-Key. It will detect it's not signed and will prompt you to do so now. Fill in your password and sign the transaction. Save the new, signed, transaction to your USB-Key.
* [Online PC] Go to Settings -&gt; Import/Export -&gt; ""Load raw transaction"". Select the signed transaction and it will ask you if you want to broadcast it.
  
  

That's it.  Enjoy.

personalfinance,"Family Finance Woes... dementia, past family issues, and TAX. (AU)","Hi everyone,
Posting from a throwaway account here, but a regular redditor.

Now, it's rather complex, and I know some of it belongs in r/relationships, but please hang in here with me.

I married my husband several years ago, and we've spent the last several expating (he's a contractor, I'm a casual jobs/housewife). I get on very well with my husband's mom, B, though he didn't until recently.

We're currently living with B, having returned from overseas to re-establish ourselves here, and have a little time to decisionmake about what we want in our lives. B also asked us for help.

Now, B is a lovely woman, but lacks capacity for logical decisionmaking, and has difficulty understanding consequences to her actions. This is due to some drugs she was given as a child.

B is a caretaker for the estate of S, my Husbands grandmother. Now, S married very very well. Her first husband was a well off Doctor who owned his own practice, and her second owned a chain of drugstores. S is wealthy to the tune of about 5 mill (est) in assets. Most of this wealth is in a couple of homes, and dividends from a large share portfolio. Her second husband died some years ago, and she inherited it all.

Several years ago, she had a fall, and it was discovered she had dementia. B became her caretaker, and took care of her, got her treatment, fed her, and generally took care of her. B lives in the house she inherited from her Aunt, who left it all to her in the mid 90s.

S got a lot better having been taken care of, proper treatment and extra help in the care home she was put in for a while. Enter L, my husbands sister, who was contacted by the aged care home as a next of kin, when S's bills there hadn't been paid for a while. L is very logical, organized and consequence oriented. Long story short, S complained about being mistreated by B, and L came in to save the day.

She assisted S in suing B, for money mismanagement. Though L's motivations were to make S happy, and to have power of attorney removed from someone who was mismanaging, as she saw it.
The Court ruled that half of B's house was now S's, and removed the power of attorney. And it is true, B was mismanaging. Not out of maliciousness, but combine lack of logical thought with lack of consequence, and you get B.

So L went to get power of attorney from the guardianship tribunal. S hired very expensive lawyers and a Doctor to say this was not required, (Guardianship in Oz is not usually conducted with lawyers present). L was steamrolled, went F this for a joke, and moved overseas. She is now no longer involved.

S moved in with a male friend, and has been living there ever since.
S lasted about a year, before asking B to manage her affairs again. She does so, but in a limited manner. She has access to one shared account which she uses to maintain both properties, though it is not ridiculously poorly managed, money is spent that is not needed to be spent.

B asked us to help her with managing all this, and we stepped in thinking we could just help out with organizing everything. Then we found out that S has shares all over the place, mostly unfranked, about 6 different accounts, and that S's tax hasn't been done since 2004.  Now anyone who knows the Oz tax department knows there isn't sick leave on tax.

To complicate things further, B's finances have been entwined with S's for some years, so she wants to get returns filed herself- which she can't do unless S's are done. There is a half million dollar mortgage on one of S's properties that B took out a long while ago, in S's name, that we don't think S knows about. It started at 220k, and has now gone up to 450 at 7 (we think) percent interest. S could owe up to half a million to the tax dept.

Now aside from the fact that B has delusionally convinced herself she can pay off this mortgage, and explaining that she'd have to make 80kpa just to service the debt, doesn't seem to have sunk in. 

We went to visit S, who we have been visiting on and off for a while now. I went for a walk with the friend who she lived with, who revealed S's character had changed over the last year. She would not leave the house and has become... confused. She often thinks she lives with her second husband, who died a couple of decades ago now. On a good day, she is ok, but he was quietly telling me that her dementia was worsening.

She apparently refuses to sign the authority for an accountant to do her tax, because D, her second husband takes care of it. He's been dead a long time.

We are also concerned about doing her tax because we don't know what her income actually is. We know what comes into the shared account with B, but not the 5 or so other accounts she has. We know she has a wealth management company she has a portfolio with, but no real picture of whether or not this tax bill will bankrupt her, wiping out her, and B, who is dependent on the income she makes from S for maintaining the estate.... making us responsible for both of them.

S is not compis mentis, but I have no doubt if proceedings were launched to get power of attorney she would call her lawyers, and wealth speaks. B and S have never really forgiven each other, and S doesn't have much picture of what really needs to be done. The larger and mortgaged of her two properties is not maintained inside, and is close to falling down. The second property is owned half by B, and half by S, with a caveat that it can't be sold until B's death, or B must agree without duress to be paid out for her half.

So in summary: 
*B needs help, and cannot move onto a normal life making money on her own without submitting her tax.

*S has not done her tax for ten years, tax department will take that estate for all it is worth if S does not have the cashflow to pay it, which we do not know if she does or not.

*S needs that income, and could live another 10-15 years.

*S's dementia is worsening, but if anyone tries to interfere with her affairs she will sic lawyers on them.

*B's motivation for taking care of a lot of S's property is the hope we will inherit (we don't really want it. Without going into further history, it is very dirty money indeed, and we want to make our own way) though B has fixated on this.

*B owes a mortgage in S's name of half a million... increasing by the year, and in the meantime the estate is being decimated, unless S has large income streams going into her other accounts, which, who knows?

What the fuck do we do, Reddit? My husband doesn't want to see his mother decimated, or be entirely responsible for either of them, S will not give anyone any power to handle it, B is slowly decimating what might be S's only income, and a large estate is being run into the ground, and if there is a lot less money than we think there is, between the mortgage and the tax bill, S may not have enough to live on, which in turn will displace B's living situation. But something has to give.... HALP...

PS, fuckoff to another country seems attractive, but has it's own costs and is not currently especially viable if the other half and I want to have kids and save some money etc.... what would you do?

Willing to answer or clarify anything, know this is confusing!
Thankyou.",finance,1385800588

Then I would be able to pay it off and build my credit at the same time. I know how interest rates and credit cards work, but is it a good idea?",technology,1385789039
personalfinance,Sold Car - Pay Off Student Loan or Invest?,"Gentlemen, I recently sold my auto and downgraded to something more economical. This puts me with 10,000 USD that I was considering using to pay off a student loan. I currently have 10,000 (20 pmts) of the 30,000 remaining paying a lowly 1.49% interest rate.

Should I just pay off the loan in a lump sum (forgoing the interest, improving credit) or take this 10,000 and place it in some kind of index fund to beat the interest rate?

I'm feel as if I'm six in one half dozen in the other. Thanks in advance!",finance,1385783348
