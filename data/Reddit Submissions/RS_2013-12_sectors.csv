financialindependence,Request for advice,"This might be the wrong sub-reddit, but maybe you guys can point me in the right direction.

I graduated college with a degree in Computer Science. I have been working about 1.5 years as a software engineer. This work is a lot of fun. I had a lot of student loan debt after graduating (~50k). It is now down to about 14K. I have paid off all of the high interest rate loans, and I am going to start to invest whatever money I am able to save instead of paying down these loans (probably in index funds).

My issue is that I _really_ want to continue studying Computer Science. Either through school (getting a masters/phd) or independently at home (no degree). But with all the time that I spend with a full time job, I don't really have time to do this. I could get loans/grants/TA positions to be able to go to grad school, but I owe child support to my x-wife (650/Month), and I have to pay for my son's health insurance expenses (currently this is covered through my work). 

If I stop working and go back to school I would still owe this as though I were earning my current income (depends on a judge, but I most likely I would). Not complaining, just stating facts. I have thought about doing something like saving up ~60K for paying child support and using loans/grants/TA positions to afford to go to school. If I run out of money, I could just start working again. I don't think that serious part-time Software Engineering positions are really available. 

My work offers a program that it could pay for me to go to grad school. Working full-time and going to school I think would be really stressful. I know that another employee was given the option to work 32hr/week while in grad school. Would that be my best possible option? 

I know I have to make sacrifices, but I am not sure what is the best way to do this. I would prefer to be a full-time student and not have anything else eating into my time. Is this just crazy/impossible given my situation?",finance,1385931509

Bitcoin,Experiences selling on coinbase?,"I've tried searches on bct and elsewhere and can't seem to find a lot of info about people's experiences selling on coinbase. I've read a lot of horror stories of people buying there and getting flagged high risk. After being fed up with CampBX's sluggishness, I got my account l1 verified on coinbase and sold significant coin in the last couple of days. I see the market is now taking a dump, so am concerned that the sells I did might get high risk cancelled now. Unfortunately from my research there just doesn't seem to be a lot of viable alternatives for US residents, and there are additional IRS concerns with doing a lot of trades on foreign exchanges.

I am hoping everything goes smoothly with coinbase, it would be helpful to hear others' experiences selling there and if they have a tendency to cancel sells.",cryptocurrency,1385926470
Bitcoin,Haters create opportunity,"Evidence:

10. ""A rocket will never be able to leave the Earth’s atmosphere."" — New York Times, 1936. Of course, this prediction was published; there had to have been countless other prominent figures, even in that industry, who must have scoffed at the idea of reaching the moon. After all, it was the 1930s.
9. ""Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible."" — Lord Kelvin, British mathematician and physicist, president of the British Royal Society, 1895. Flying in the air must have been a dream to some and an impossibility to others back in the late 1800s. This concept has been most recently revisited in the remake movie: Around the World in 80 Days. Lord Kelvin was featured in the film.
8. ""TV will never be a serious competitor for radio because people must sit and keep their eyes glued on a screen; the average American family hasn't time for it."" — New York Times, 1939 There's not a whole lot to say about this. Television is one of the top ten inventions of all-time; probably top three, along with the telephone and automobile.
7. ""This ‘telephone’ has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us."" — A memo at Western Union, 1878 (or 1876). The telephone has, of course, since gone wireless, and we ask ourselves today, ""Where would we be without it?"" Put your cell phone away for an entire week and you'll see how difficult it is to get things done. And, without any phone at all, the modern world as we know it might as well be referred to as the Stone Age. Also, what on earth would we do without catchy songs (i.e. Lady Gaga's Telephone)?
6. ""Everything that can be invented has been invented."" — Charles H. Duell, U.S. patent office official, 1899. Was Mr. Duell wrong? Well, check out this list of inventions and see how many appeared after 1899. That'll give you a rough idea. I bet Duell regrets the remark, especially if he saw the absolute marvels of shopping carts and automatic doors at his local supermarket.
5. ""I am tired of all this sort of thing called science here ... We have spent millions in that sort of thing for the last few years, and it is time it should be stopped."" — Simon Cameron, U.S. Senator, on the Smithsonian Institute, 1901. This 'science' thing has proven to be quite an asset. That one German fellow did quite well with it.
4. ""Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?"" — H. M. Warner, co-founder of Warner Brothers, 1927. Apparently millions upon millions of people who are willing to spend millions upon millions of dollars. Take a look at a list of the highest-grossing films of all-time. Note: James Cameron directed the top two.
3. ""The truth is, no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher, and no computer network will change the way government works."" — Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, 1995 The accuracy of his statement must burn him to this very day. Why, according to Mr. Stoll, I would not be able to share this information with you! Stoll may just be the last daily newspaper subscriber in America.
2. ""The horse is here to stay but the automobile is only a novelty – a fad.” — The president of the Michigan Savings Bank advising Henry Ford’s lawyer, Horace Rackham, not to invest in the Ford Motor Co., 1903. If the world, especially America, were to go without cars, a collective gasp, followed by sobs, would be heard throughout the nation. Ride horses everywhere? What are we, cowboys?
1. ""There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home."" — Ken Olson, president, chairman and founder of Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC), maker of big business mainframe computers, arguing against the PC in 1977. To this, I simply say, does Mr. Olson own a personal computer now?

Many of his statements are posed as arguments but lack any in-depth analysis and he cites few examples of his own advice, and almost seems to argue FOR the adoption and viability of Bitcoin: 

""Note: any time you see a proposal of a new form of money, hold on to your old form of money.

""The central benefit of money is its predictable purchasing power. A monetary commodity is not easy to produce. The cost of mining is high. Money is slowly adopted by a large number of participants. These participants use money as a means of exchange. Why? Because it was valuable the day before. They therefore expect it to be valuable the next day. Money has continuity of value. This is not intrinsic value. It is historic value. So, a person can buy money by the sale of goods or services, set this money aside, and re-enter the markets in a different location or in a different time, in the confidence that he will probably be able to buy a similar quantity of goods and services.

""Money is not accumulated for its own sake. It is accumulated to buy future goods and services. It is useful in the facilitation of exchange precisely because its market value varies little over time. It is the predictability of money's market exchange rate that makes it money.""
His is almost an outline for the adoption of a new money.   He leaves out the fact that it has the added benefits of being a decentralized and digital currency, nearly instantaneous in transfer, without a middle-person and the potential for complete anonymity without the need for money laundering. People will launder money anyway to avoid becoming a tax base of governments, organizations which are now under increasing scrutiny and suspicion for creating the very terrorists they claim to be defending us from.  Money laundering, much like the war on drugs, perpetuates the power of organized criminal enterprises.

The Federal Reserve is a private organization, and is it's own ""Federal Reserve Wanna-be"". The control of our monetary system was handed over to private banking interests? Another reason why non-centralized digital currency is the asset transfer of choice for those of us who consider the banking system one of THE most corrupt institutions we are deceived to take for a granted good. BTc may not wind up being THE sole goto currency, but for now it is must gain value until minor fluctuations in it's over-all rational value, a change perhaps ±0.00001% every day decided by the market and not by a group of rich men behind doors deciding on the value of precious metals as a trade commodity. If a few people end up hoarding the majority of Bitcoin then it's value of adoption can be rejected and a new currency will spring in it's place. Isn't this the true value of a pure, object-oriented currency?",cryptocurrency,1385917952
Bitcoin,The mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto continues...,"I wrote about Paco Ahlgren a while back. I read his book a couple of years ago, and some people were talking about him being Satoshi Nakamoto. It was an interesting theory then, but I didn't pay any attention and nobody else did either.

When Bitcoin started taking off earlier in the eyar and then again in the last month I started thinking about his book again (Discipline). The higher the price went, the more it kept coming back to me. Then the government stepped in and called these hearings and the similarities seemed to be too much.

In the book, Ahlgren writes about a global financial collapse. He talks about Fed intervention, and eventually the breakup of the U.S. and the collapse of the dollar. But here's the catch -- when the dollar fails, a new private currency takes its place. It isn't created by one person, but by a group of people.

The first time I read the Discipline, I was into Bitcoin, but I didn't really believe the world was going to take it seriously, at least not this fast. So the book didn't really stand out. It was interesting, but it was just a book. I read some threads suggesting he was Satoshi, but they died.

I read Discipline again last week, and I've had a hard time sleeping ever since. First of all Ahlgren wrote the book in 2001, and published in 2007 .... two years BEFORE Bitcoin existed.

I still don't think he did it by himself though. I don't think Satoshi Nakamoto is a single person. It seems like it would be impossible for jsut one person to do all of this by himself. It seems more likely that it was a team, and I am not convinced Ahlgren was a part of that team.

The second thing that gets me is that he talks about how the government deals with the currency .... politicians, and all that. It's crazy how similar it is to what's going on right now. (NSA?) He also talks about other private currencies appearing. And he talks about how the government tries to track down the creators of the currency.

One of the things that turned me off about the Discipline currency was that it was centralized. There was a group of ""good guys"" who controlled it and helped distibute it around the world. They used gold to back the currency. Once I read that, I didn't think there was any way Ahlgren could be Satoshi.

But the reason I picked up the book again was because I started thinking. If Ahlgren was Satoshi (or part of the Satoshi team), would he really want to put the Bitcoin algorithm in print 2 years before it was complete? And if he was planning on maintaining anonymity, he wouldn't want anyone making the connection. That sort of intentional obfuscation seems exactly like something team Satoshi would do.

Also, what if he was hoping his book would sort of get everybody ready for the idea of Bitcoin? Or maybe he was hoping Bitcoin would help sell his book! But either way he wouldn't want to connect himself too closely with Satoshi and Bitcoin. And doesn't that also just sound like something Satoshi would do? And then the whitepaper came out in 2008, less than a year after the publication of the book. Coincidence?

The more I thought about it, the more I had to read the book again. The reason I read it the first time is that the Amazon reviews were fantastic, and I thought what the hell? I don't think its the best book I ever read (although it's pretty damn good). But because of the Bitcoin connection, it took on a whole new meaning for me. Mostly I hoped I was full of s*it, and reading it again would convince me for good that I was just day dreaming.

But that's not what happened at all. The whole book is like a puzzle. It's a loop, and there were so many details I didn't catch the first time. More than anything, I was hit by the fact that Ahlgren predicted so many events long before they happened. His descriptions of unrest and terrorist acts are right in line with what's going on today in the world, and it all ties into the currency and the Fed.

I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but this is weird. Also, his Wikipedia page used to talk about Bitcoin (and how he denies any involvement) but that section was removed. Why would he remove that? Or why would someone else remove it? Oh, and here's a big shocker. He's an Austrian economist, a financial analyst, and a programmer.

The last thing that got me was that Ahlgren came out a couple of years ago and said Bitcoin was doomed to fail in a blog entry. Then he deleted the post from his blog immediately (like the same day). There was a bunch of discussion about it, and he reposted it. But here's the kicker. As far as I can tell, he hasn't written one thing since -- not any articles, no books, nothing. His Facebook pages are pretty much dead.

So why does an author who writes a book with great reviews and good sales suddenly just disappear? Am I the only person who thinks that's weird?

He lives in Austin as far as I can tell, and he has a Linked in page, but that's about all I could find (other than interviews and articles from way back). I even tried emailing him (from his site), but he hasn't responded. His background is both in finance and programming and apparently he's some kind of a ""security expert."" That at least makes him a candidate.

My curiosity is peaked now. Has anybody else come across any information about Paco Ahlgren, or heard about any possible connections between him and Satoshi Nakamoto?",cryptocurrency,1385915408

Bitcoin,Currencies should not fluctuate in value as wildly as bitcoin does. This is why central banks are important.,"The fact that bitcoin has skyrocketed in value like a tech stock in 1998 means that there is suddenly a much larger demand for bitcoin relative to the number of bitcoins in circulation than even a few months ago, correct? Well if bitcoins is to gain traction as a medium of exchange, what needs to happen is that the number of bitcoins need to be increased in order to meet the demand- the digital equivalent of running the printing presses. In fact, this is why the US dollar loses value over time: as the dollar economy grows (both inside and outside the US), more dollars are needed to facilitate more and more transactions. 

If the Federal Reserve had stopped creating money in 1950, the US economy would have been depressed for like the last 50 years even though a single dollar would be able to buy a lot more food (for example). In this type of situation, we would see a whole lot more hoarding of money and less spending of it. This is where bitcoin is headed; the top 100 individuals with the most bitcoin currently have 20% of the currency, leaving a fairly small amount of ""free floating"" currency that is changing hands. 

I am not necessarily predicting doom for the currency right now, in fact I will probably buy some since I believe the bubble won't burst for at least a few more months or so, but burst it will some day. See links below.

personalfinance,I'm desperate for help with a private Sallie Mae loan that I do not believe is mine.,"I’m sorry for the wall of text. I’m doing my best to explain this confusing situation. It’s been ongoing for years. I’m desperate for help. And obviously this is a throw-away because I am petrified of putting this information out there and adding fuel to a fire that can consume me or my mother.
I will try to summarize my problem, and then I will explain what happened.
SHORT VERSION:

* I took one private loan, co-signed by my father
* Sallie Mae claims that I have two private loans, of identical amounts, identical interest, and identical account numbers
* Over a year of BS back and forth, never provided proof that I signed two loans. Kept sending me the SAME signature paperwork for the loan I already acknowledged and was paying on
* Loan went into collections. 
* First ‘collector’ failed to provide evidence that I owned the loan
* Now in hands of second collection. Requested proof I owned the loan * got the standard paperwork in mail that is a form letter of 'if you dispute this, send dispute in writing'
* Father (cosigner) has since passed, will my mother have to assume responsibility if I refuse to pay this disputed loan?
* Aren’t loan collections required to provide proof of disputed loans?
* The loan doesn’t appear to be on my credit. WTF?
* Is this someone else’s loan? How long do I have to suffer these collection calls?
* I have ZERO dollars to contribute to a lawyer

BACKGROUND. [Truncating language]
I had to take a personal private loan; father co-signed. After graduating, I started paying both loans; one to Sallie Mae, and the other the Fed loans. My story is focused on the private Sallie Mae loan ONLY. 

Six months after the loans payments started, I was receiving phone calls from Sallie Mae that I wasn’t paying my private loan. I called &amp; talked to the reps, everyone agreed the payments were being made and apologized for the confusion. 

A few days later, the calls continued. I would talk to the rep, explain my payments and validate the check numbers… and they’d apologize for the confusion. This went on for months. Each call was at least 40 minutes of confusion, reading, and apologizing to me. I started to ask for paperwork. 

I got print outs of my statement (computer simplified print out), showing my full balance, the balance due ($0), past due ($0) and payments received. This only frustrated me more. I called and demanded to know why I was being harassed by phone when I was clearly making payments. Apologies all around again. I took a stand that they were going to have to send me paperwork only to avoid these phone calls and the giant time-suck that was Sallie Mae every other day – at my job. It was becoming a predictable problem: They would call then spend nearly 40 minutes reading their computer screens and then apologizing for the call.  

This went on for almost 5 months. Then somewhere a ‘supervisor’ got involved and said that the confusion was due to the fact that I had TWO loans. TWO identical loans with IDENTICAL debts, and identical Account numbers. 

REAL PROBLEMS START NOW
Here’s where shit got very confusing. I was being told there was another loan out with Sallie Mae and everything – including the account number – was identical. They were claiming that this second loan was mine, just called a B loan. I found this incredibly confusing… the same account number? How could they differentiate the loans? Plus – I only had paperwork and the memory of ONE loan. Where did this loan come from? Several times Sallie Mae couldn’t answer any of my questions. Each time we get into the nitty gritty details, they supervisor would say s/he would research it more and call back. This literally never happened. It always got quiet, and then the calls would start over again and a NEW supervisor would appear and we’d start the process all over.

I started to demand proof that the loan was mine. They would send me the signature of the 1st loan, and never got paperwork for the 2nd. I started to demand that Sallie Mae send me BOTH signature loans to me at the same time to FORCE them to generate two different signature pages – or at least settle this matter once and for all.  It never happened.

The Supervisors, however, did alter and change the account numbers on my private loans on two different occasions. I found this incredibly suspicious. I had to alter my loan payment methods via my bank several times.  Also, they modified and changed their website repeatedly, so that some of the original screenshots I captured are no longer in existence on the site. Naturally, after one of the site changes, the ‘second’ loan magically appeared where it never existed. This happened after a Supervisor changed my account numbers. 

Additionally, my payments were being shifted between loans. I acknowledge the one, but they started putting my payments into the disputed loan. I would call and try to iron it out, but they were ‘stealing’ the payments from my valid loan and applying it to my disputed loan.  They were trying to force me to pay on the disputed loan, and I was having trouble getting proof on what payment was sent to what loan. I kept getting different/conflicting answers from different phone reps – and paperwork was never sent to me despite my repeated requests.

My suspicions grew.  I started to seek out lawyers. But I did not have the funds to acquire a lawyer.  [My father has since passed and my thin budget has to help my mother. Not to mention my payments going out to student loans.]

I called Sallie Mae and demanded that they send me both signature loans as proof of debt.  Things got quiet and I thought – finally! – I was getting things resolved. I kept receiving one and only one proof of debt… and I was starting to feel relief that this was finally working out.

Suddenly I’m getting calls from a Debt Collector. It is in default.  I’m super fearful. Was this a legit loan that was all one major mistake? I demand that the Collector provide proof that this is my loan. After several months of demanding this… the loan goes to a SECOND collector. It’s now in the hands of someone else.

I checked CreditKarma… this default doesn’t appear to be on my credit. This raises my concern more – but I am not proficient with my credit and I may be missing it. I’ll be tearing through my reports in great detail in the coming months. 

Dear Reddit I’ve followed your experience(s) and opinions in this area for years. But I’m at a loss.

* Can this loan be real? Or is it a Sallie Mae fuck up?  I’ve been asking for proof of this loan for YEARS… nothing. 
* What should I specifically request / say to demand that proof of debt so that if it ISN’T there, these collectors will stop harassing me?
* If this loan is real, and is one giant fuck up, can they go after my mother? My father did co-sign for me, and has sinced passed away. I’m fearful that they can harm my mother who has meager assets – but still ‘assets’ that they could threaten her with – all I have is debt. 
* Why isn’t this screaming across my credit report? (at least, creditkarma?)  Is this another clue that this is all BS?
* Does anyone have any experience dealing with this level of bullshit that they could share and help me resolve this nightmare?
* How long can this nightmare go on?",finance,1385870394
Bitcoin,[Update]And I'm poor again... The Mt. Gox Saga Continues with a Reply,"**Update** to [Woke up to an email from Mt. Gox. ""There has been a withdrawal from your Mt.Gox account."" And I'm poor again.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1rs0bq/woke_up_to_an_email_from_mt_gox_there_has_been_a/)

I was the the individual that lost $12 000 USD today due to my flippant laziness. I invested in 10 BTC in 2011 with Mt. Gox K.K. Bitcoin Exchange. At that time Mt. Gox had recently been hacked and had beefed up security and Bitcoin had recently collapsed and begun to rebound. I don't believe two-factor authentication was enabled yet.

I felt pretty good about just letting it sit, and didn't think about it for quite some time. When I did, I watched it grow from $200/BTC to today's $1200/BTC. During this time I failed to enable two-factor authentication, failed to move my money into a personal encrypted wallet, invested trust in Mt. Gox, and thought I was holding a winning lottery ticket.

As a security minded computer professional that keeps all of my files in encrypted volumes and considered finally moving it out of Mt. Gox just last night, I could not be more embarassed or heartbroken about the outcome. As of 0601 CST this morning, I was left with approximately $14 USD in my account.

I recieved from Mt. Gox this morning, ""There has been a withdrawal from your Mt.Gox account: ... Please contact us as soon as possible by replying to this email if you did not request this withdrawal.""

I contacted them back as soon as I saw this, 0947 with the following, ""No. I have made no such withdraw. What can I do. My public IP is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx."" And followed up at 1110 with, ""Come on guys. Stop this transaction. Please reply. It has not hit Blockchain yet. I need your involvement. This is not okay.""

But the damage was done. I knew there was probably nothing to be done, but I hoped that Mt. Gox would give me some good news, or at least suggest what they would do to avoid this in the future. For instance,

+ Require all outbound transactions over x be verified by email.
+ Force two-factor authentication to have over x on the exchange.
+ Help track fraud more closely.
+ Most of all, have the email that requests me to contact them as soon as possible be more than just platitude.

Here is the reply at 1826:

&gt; Dear Valued Customer,

&gt; Thank you for contacting us. We apologize for the inconvenience caused. Since you have informed that the withdrawal was not authorized by you, please change your email address password and Mt.Gox password immediately. Please do not use the same username and password on different services. You can use the Yubikey or Software Authentication on our Security Center to further secure your accounts.

&gt; Unfortunately the Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed or cancelled. Please file a police report in order for the police to investigate the case and make an effort to retrieve your funds. We will cooperate with the police authority in providing the necessary information for the investigation, but we are unable to reimburse any stolen funds.

&gt; Best regards,
&gt; Mt.Gox Team

I am sad, but I hope that my loss is another's gain. First, until I know precisely what happened, I would recommend against using Mt. Gox at all. In fact, while I don't believe it was malicious, I have realized that there is no way to know that they aren't just scraping funds from account holders. What easier way could there be to give out bonuses? Again, that is not an accusation, but an indictment of an unregulated exchange.

There have been some suggestions by the community of creating services to help combat this. It may be tough, but something should be done.

I was not able to file a police report because I didn't have printouts proving what I said, and they basically laughed and thought I was talking about video game money. In the office, on Monday I will print out the pertinent documents and attempt again. I did file a complaint with [Internet Crime Complaint Center](https://complaint.ic3.gov/), as recommended by the USAGO.

Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and I would love to be a part of any project seeking to mitigate these problems with Bitcoin. Thank you for all of the support.

Bitcoin,Can Baltimore handle a virtual currency? -- Maryland Daily Record (full disclosure: quotes me :),"Can Baltimore handle a virtual currency?

Posted: 7:13 pm Tue, November 26, 2013	
By Lizzy McLellan 
Daily Record Business Writer

Tzadik Vanderhoof is desperate for a place to spend his Bitcoin.

So far the only taker he’s found is a friend he’s persuaded to take Bitcoin in payment for a bar tab. But that could change.

Next Wednesday, the Baltimore software developer will join other area enthusiasts of the increasingly popular — and controversial — virtual currency at Betamore in Federal Hill. Their goal: to bring Bitcoin to Baltimore.

The meeting’s organizer is John Devor, a technology entrepreneur who works in the shared space at Betamore. Devor and Vanderhoof have a lot in common when it comes to Bitcoin. They see it as a way for citizens to have more control over their money and bypass fees when transacting or sending large sums. And they both want more opportunities to use it.

“I would love to be able to go down the street and order some Thai food and pay right then and there with Bitcoin,” said Devor. But, he admits, “I think that is a little ways off.”

Good gamble, or gimmick?

Betamore’s founder, Mike Brenner, is a bit more skeptical of the blooming Bitcoin buzz.

For one thing, the currency is volatile. Its dollar value has shot up over the last few months (see chart, page 9A), with a couple of wrenching zigzags. Some worry the technology could disrupt the banking system. And Bitcoin was used on a website, SilkRoad, that was tied to drug dealing.

But Brenner sees potential — especially after Friday’s reports that someone bought 194,993 Bitcoin in a single transaction valued at about $150 million. The completion of such a high-value transaction with no bank involvement or fees, he said, is amazing.

Brenner owns Bitcoin himself — he first bought some after meeting Devor — and he says he’s enthusiastic about hosting the meetup at Betamore. He sees it as an opportunity for innovation. And he says he can envision something like Bitcoin, with a similar protocol, becoming mainstream in the next few years.

So does Vanderhoof. For him, Bitcoin falls at the intersection of several personal interests: software, cryptography, economics and “beating the system.”

Before Devor organized the Betamore meetup, Vanderhoof had thought about organizing one of his own. Vanderhoof, who works for Kelly &amp; Associates Insurance Group, sees Bitcoin as a way to escape governmental influence on citizens’ money, and wants to see it more widely used.

“I’m thinking if I can get some ideas going … I might be able to make it work, some kind of entrepreneurial opportunity around Bitcoin,” he said. “It’s very similar to the creation of the Internet … it turned out to really have a big economic benefit.”

On paper, Brenner’s Bitcoin is worth five times what he paid for it, and he agrees that a form of virtual currency could become common and beneficial in the near future. But he’s not ready to convert many more of his own dollars.

“We’re years away from any legitimate business that would really take it,” he said. “I think that anyone who takes it now, it’s just a gimmick.”

Bitcoin pioneers

According to coinmap.org, 395 businesses in North America take Bitcoin. A website called Bitpay says they include organic food vendors, coffee shops and retailers of e-cigarettes.

Two of those are in Maryland.

A Baltimore-based retail site, cryptoanarchy.com, found its way onto the map Tuesday. The site sells key chains, T-shirts, magnets and other retail items that promote Bitcoin. Tactical College Consulting, an educational application consultancy based in Stevenson, started accepting Bitcoin last week.

“We’re always evolving in terms of the payment options we offer our clients, and this seems like a logical step,” said Craig Meister, president of 7-year-old Tactical and its only full-time consultant. Until two years ago, when it began using PayPal, the company took only checks as payment.

Tactical College Consulting has a small number of clients — between 75 and 100, said Meister. While many of them are from Maryland, between 15 and 20 percent are from outside the United States.

Regular clients pay anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000 for consulting packages, which can include essay editing and college list development.

“We really do have a lot of clients, both domestic and international, who are on the cutting edge of technology, who are very savvy investors,” he said. “I think it will be responded to probably better than if we were a coffee shop or a shoe store.”

Most of Tactical’s clients make payments at the end of each month, said Meister, so he expects to see soon whether Bitcoin will be useful to them. He’s optimistic.

“As an independent entrepreneur, you try things, you see how it goes,” he said. “It’s nice to be independent in that sense.”

Bitcoin,"Serious question for you, regarding potential for price manipulation","So, we're all pretty aware (I presume) that the U.S. government seized 144,336 Bitcoins during the [Silk Road/DPR bust in October](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/26/net-us-crime-silkroad-seizure-idUSBRE99P01620131026). The seizure was valued at $28 million.

At that time, 1 BTC was worth ~$193.99 ($28,000,000/144,336).

According to [Bitcoin Watch](http://bitcoinwatch.com/), 1 BTC is currently worth ~$984.62, making the total value of those 144,336 seized Bitcoins $142,116,112.

Is there any way to prove/disprove that the meteoric rise in the ""value"" of BTC isn't due to some form of market manipulation by the U.S. gov't?

Bitcoin,My Open Letter to Peter Schiff (followup from the debate today),"An Open Letter to Peter Schiff
A follow-up to the discussion on the Peter Schiff Show, December 2, 2013
(this has been emailed to Peter just now)

Dear Peter,

It was a privilege and an honor to be a guest on your radio show today. I’ve been a fan of yours for more than five years; you were one of the reasons I discovered Austrian economics (and, in turn, Bitcoin), and your eloquent explanation of consumption vs. production in an economy has guided my outlook of the world ever since. So thank you sincerely for what you’ve taught me, and for the opportunity to appear on your show. It was a really special moment for me.

While we had some valuable discussion today, I felt a follow-up was appropriate to better articulate my points. You’re right to be highly skeptical of such a new technology and monetary system, but please take the time to ensure your skepticism doesn’t blind you from what I humbly suggest is one of the most important tools for human freedom ever conceived.   



*The Fundamentals*

First, Bitcoin must always be considered as two things: the payment network (Bitcoin) and the currency units (bitcoins). Condemnations of the latter can often be resolved with an understanding of the former. Satoshi should have named them differently to avoid this initial confusion.

When you suggest that bitcoins have “zero intrinsic value,” you are only considering the currency unit itself and ignoring the payment network. While I prefer the term “utility” over “intrinsic value” (because all value is subjective to the valuer), I may indeed admit that bitcoins, as currency units all by themselves, have no fundamental utility and are completely uninteresting. But – and this absolutely critical – the payment network has vast utility. 

In fact, this network is probably one of the most valuable and consequential technologies currently on the planet. Some of us realized this a few years ago. Others are realizing it now. Many more will realize it in the future. The Bitcoin network is, fundamentally, a ledger of title controlled by no man. Ponder that for a moment. The transmission of value and ownership has thus just been severed from the State, not by impotent voting, but by the technological achievement of man.

Now, during the show, you agreed that perhaps this payment network has utility. So, if the network (Bitcoin) has utility, and only one currency is accepted on this network (bitcoins), and those bitcoins are scarce, then should not those units themselves command a market price? Who knows what that price should be, but there should be a price, no? 

Any good that is useful and scarce will have a price (consider that air is useful but not scarce, and fish with three eyes are scarce but not useful, thus no price for either of them). Because the Bitcoin network is useful, and because only scarce bitcoin currency units are permitted on this network, the bitcoins themselves have a price. Indeed, they must have a price until the network is no longer useful, or the coins are no longer scarce. 

This is not magic. It is not a Ponzi scheme or elaborate fraud. It’s just the market pricing something that it finds useful. As the network grows in usage, its utility subsequently grows, and thus scarce bitcoins appreciate further. Those who grabbed coins in the early days benefit hugely, just as those prospectors grabbing nuggets of gold out of the California foot hills did in the early days of the gold rush. Gold is not a pyramid scheme merely because early acquirers profit from later subsequent adoption and demand.



*The Utility of Bitcoin and Competitors*

So to adequately claim that bitcoins ought to have no price (which is the implicit assumption from your claim on national television that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme), you must demonstrate that the Bitcoin network has no utility. As someone who has transferred $100,000 worth of value to another person instantly in another country (on a Sunday when banks were closed, no less), I am confident that you will not succeed in this demonstration.

I believe that you will understand and agree with my above arguments if you objectively ponder them for a while. Your contention then moves to the following: that if Bitcoin (the network) can be replicated by anyone, it isn’t actually scarce at all and thus even though the network is valuable, the price of individual coins will fall toward zero as the system is replicated over and over by competitors. You would explain that while bitcoins are limited to 21 million units, anyone can create a competing crypto-currency and thus the number of possible crypto-currency units are unlimited, thus not scarce, and thus not fundamentally worth anything. 

You made this argument several times on the show today. It is a fair point for you to raise, but please allow me to counter it.

Bitcoin, after all, cannot really be copied. True, the open-source code can be copied and the copier could release CopyCoin (indeed this is happening all the time). But, the copier cannot copy the infrastructure. The protocol layer is easily copied. The infrastructure layer is not. On Day 1 of Bitcoin, it had no infrastructure layer. I can tell you, as an entrepreneur in this space for the past few years, Bitcoin’s infrastructure layer is now substantial. Indeed, I am sitting in my office, and looking at my employees building this very infrastructure as I write this. Their work, and that of many thousands of others around the world, is not so easily replicated. 

Let’s use an analogy, which you so often convincingly do when describing the absurdity of Fed policy or the counter-productive nature of various government programs. I believe the following is a very fair analogy.

Consider that language itself is a protocol – a set of rules for conveying information. Consider then that one could copy the English language, and change parts of it, and release it as English 2.0. However, why would anyone use it? Even if it had marginal improvements over traditional English, where is the infrastructure? Where are the vast tomes of literature written in English 2.0? Where are the speakers and writers and scholars of this new language? Where are the libraries and Wikipedias full of English 2.0 articles? How many newspapers are written and conveyed in English 2.0? How many Peter Schiff podcasts are disseminated in this new alternative? That infrastructure wouldn’t exist, and neither therefore, would the users. This is merely the natural, spontaneous consequence of network effect, and it applies to English as a protocol for language just as it applies to Bitcoin as a protocol for money.

Now, does the network effect mean English, or Bitcoin, can never be replaced? No. But it does mean it’d be extremely difficult in either case. 

But let’s remember something. Even if a superior crypto-currency overcomes Bitcoin in the open market (certainly possible), does that make Bitcoin a failure or Ponzi scheme? Does that negate the utility bestowed by Bitcoin while the market still favors it? Consider that one can benefit from the Bitcoin network with zero or very low exposure to the currency price long term. This means a payment made with Bitcoin last year still accomplished its objective – value moved freely, the users benefited, even if a year later the system falls apart and goes to zero. Thus, there is real utility today even if the system doesn’t work next year. The assumption that Bitcoin will be around for eternity is not a prerequisite for benefiting from its utility in the present.



*Mutual Respect for Market-Based Money*

I think you will discover, upon reflection, that your concerns about Bitcoin boil down to the thesis that Bitcoin is a volatile, highly speculative, and non-conservative asset class. In this, I wholeheartedly agree. But if your arguments are claiming that the payment network itself is some kind of fraud – a Ponzi scheme undeserved of respect or even consideration – then I must take issue with that. The Bitcoin network is an utterly revolutionary technology. It separates money from the state, in a way that gold, unfortunately, has been unable to do. 

When fully understood, Bitcoin should bring tears to the eyes of anyone who fights against the tyranny and ignorance of coercive governments and their monetary witch doctors. This is why thousands of people around the world have dedicated their lives to this campaign. We are carrying out this experiment without anyone’s permission. We’ll either fail, or change the world in a way that was inconceivable before this technology existed.

I wholly support your idea to make a gold-backed digital currency. Please do it. I’d love to be your first customer, because I love gold. But being in this business, seeing how the payments and banking and regulatory world works, I can tell you that your initiative will likely fail, either by self-immolation (GoldMoney severing inter-account payments), or by governmental take down (e-gold). 

A monetary/payment system that relies on gold backing is reliant on the backer. It relies on a centralized, trusted party, to warehouse the gold and provide convertibility. This is the counter-party risk eliminated by Bitcoin. 

If there is a centralized backer for any payment system, then the system will have to follow all government laws, or be shut down. To follow the laws, personal customer information must be known, meaning privacy is impossible. Transfer limits and strict terms of use will be imposed, meaning financial freedom is impossible. And have fun with the compliance costs. Have you noticed international banks dropping American customers around the world? It is due to this unfortunate dynamic. And then, if the stars align, and the gold-backed currency manages to grow big and become a successful global payments network, it’s not unreasonable to assume that governments will take it down anyway, because it would compete with fiat – from which great swaths of their power originates. 

You cannot compete with fiat by having a competitor that is vulnerable to the guns of government. Bitcoin may not be perfectly immune, but it is highly resistant. Censorship of e-gold was easy. Censorship of Bitcoin will be… entertaining.

Regardless, if you’re honestly interested in trying that experiment again, I will help you and support that effort, because I recognize the value of precious metals as commodities and as money. Until such a system actually exists, I am humbly asking you to support our efforts in kind, and am humbly suggesting to you that bitcoins, while non-physical, are indeed real and indeed have real value, because they are the one currency accepted on the most revolutionary payment network known to mankind. This is not theory – it’s actually working for millions of dollars of payments every day. We’ve moved beyond the Mises textbook. We’re running in the open market.

While Bitcoin is still a highly-volatile experiment, it deserves more respect than dismissal as a Ponzi scheme, and regardless of whether you think the current price of a bitcoin unit is justified, you must acknowledge that this technology, broadly speaking, has utility both for both economic exchange and, more importantly, individual freedom.

When my grandparents ask me how to protect their wealth, I don’t tell them to buy bitcoins. I tell them to buy precious metals. When they ask me how to transfer value across distance, I don’t tell them to ship gold. I tell them to use Bitcoin. My hope in writing this letter is simply this – that perhaps you’ll come to see Bitcoin and gold as beautiful compliments and important tools in the advancement of free-market money – one long-standing, conservative, and physical, the other new, technologically and politically disruptive, and digital. One will not replace the other, but I believe both will come to replace fiat, and good riddance to that stuff.

I'm also curious as to what side effects either option could have as well. Will one option over another possibly qualify us for a lower interest rate on a potential mortgage?

I can achieve this through principal saving, however, I would like to have my money do some work for me during the saving period rather than toss it into a savings account and yield next to nothing.  I've researched and discussed bond funds (doesn't seem like a smart option given the nature of interest rates over the next five years with the fed).

So I am looking at setting up something like a Vanguard account with a low expense ratio and something where I can continually contribute towards it over the next couple of years.  ETFs seem out of the question since I have little desire to ""maintain"" the account and I don't want fees eating up much of my profits.

What I found wasn't pretty - I'd got myself into credit card debt by just allowing autopayment stuff to go on and relying on it to take care of stuff instead of addressing what was actually going on.

Good news is, things are now back on track - I've got my budget set up such that I expect to have all of the debts aside from my mortgage, a total of about $20k including the car, resolved in about 16 months of frugal living using the avalanche method. However, since most of it is on credit cards, it is at a high interest rate. Using unbury.me, I'm expecting to end up paying a bit over $2000 in total interest over this time due to the high (16-18%) interest rates on the credit cards.

I'm looking at ways to reduce that interest paid. One thing I was considering was using some kind of loan as a source of debt consolidation. Two potential ways I can think of to do this. One would be an unsecured loan through my credit union. That would be around 9% interest, saving several hundred dollars (I would continue paying into the unsecured loan at the same rate as I'd be paying into the credit cards now). Second would be a car refinance. I'm not sure if the credit union would even allow this, but if they would do so, I could refinance the car up to having its full value financed, then apply this money to almost entirely pay off the credit cards. This would be at a 2-2.5% interest rate. Either way, my intention is to continue burning it down as fast as I can - all that would change is who I am paying.

""How did you get past the problem of lending?  (I lend you 1 BTC today so you can invest in a business, you owe me 1.1 BTC in the future.  Assuming deflationary forces, the 1.1 BTC will cost you much more than 10%.)  

The article I read said that banking would just have to adapt by using negative interest rates.  But that seems bizarre.  I give you 1 BTC and you give me back 0.9 BTC which has the same purchasing power as 1.1 BTC when I lent it.  But if only get 0.9 back, why would I lend it to you in the first place?""

What do you think about this scenario?",cryptocurrency,1386091853
personalfinance,Help! Recently got a settlement. Want to invest but all if this is a lot to take in.,"I'll try and make this short. In March I was hit by a pickup while biking.

I got a settlement for 1.3 million, but after medical bills and the lawyer I will have about $500k.

How should I go about investing this? I know I should find a fee-only advisor. I think a Roth IRA is in order, but beyond that I'm unsure. I'll keep probably around $50k in an ETF that I can liquidate fast. The rest in probably online banks such as Ally for the better interest rates.

Most of my loans are federal loans for which I am on an income based repayment plan and my payment is zero right now. So that's fine. Then I have a loan through Discover and the payment is $50 starting in January. That's fine too, I can afford that. But the problem is that I have a $9k student loan from Sallie Mae. It's a smart option loan so the website tells me that I'm not eligible for deferments or forbearance but there is literally no way for me to be able to pay what they want from me. I know it doesn't seem like a big loan but the monthly payment they want from me is $187. I can't afford it.

I really need to know if I'm going to have any success in contacting them to lower my monthly payment to a more reasonable one (under $100/month). I don't even know how to begin to negotiate about that or the procedure about it. Do I just call a generic customer service line? Do I ask to talk to supervisors if I get denied or will that do anything at all? I just don't even know what to say. I can't ignore these loans because my parents cosigned but they do not have extra money to lend me each month as they are paying off their own debts. I honestly feel like the only option would be to enroll for 6 credits of courses but even the cheapest community colleges around me are too expensive (over $200 per credit for IN STATE, I hate where I live). And although it would be not a total waste to take a course or two (I still might need to take chemistry before grad school), it does seem like throwing money in the wrong direction.

CryptoCurrency,Why mine Quark (QRK)? Securecoin (SRC) has the same features ...excepted it is still largely unmined.,"I know some economist backed Quark recently, and there has been talk about him being bought by QRK devs, but in the end I don't think any of this really matters...

As can be seen on the other sub-reddits, many people are getting into mining, following the recent Bitcoin buzz. Some are looking for ASIC sellers, some have bought GPUs, and I suspect quite a few just use their CPUs to mine QRK (or just wish they could still use their CPUs to mine Bitcoin, if they have not heard about QRK).

When the people in the last category start to realize [Securecoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=270852.0) has the same specifications as QRK excepted that it follows the minting curve of Bitcoin, I think they will go for it. After all, it's the best opportunity for people who get into crypto-currencies now to get on a Bitcoin-like ship before it sails, and with no hardware investment at all. It was launched about 3 months ago, that's nothing in the Bitcoin timescale: less than 5% of the coins have been mined, and each block is rewarded with full subsidies. In contrast, 98% of QRK are already gone.

I think it can be successful if it builds on both the Bitcoin and Quark hypes.

Moreover it will probably stay around as an ASIC-resistant coin for some time, as it is not expensive enough to motivate research into ASICs, and the fact that it uses 6 different hashing algorithms must make it about 6 times as expensive to produce ASICs. So it will be a perfect opportunity for anyone who has heard about Bitcoin to try mining, with a clean slate for everybody. And let's face it, mining is fun. The people who start mining will probably stick around to support they crypto-currency. It is an excellent moment for a CPU coin to try and build a large user base.

If some of you are fed up with the newcomers' questions about Bitcoin and Litecoin mining, I invite you to try a little social experiment: redirect them to Securecoin and see if it catches on.


**EDIT:** since I've seen people are actually starting to mine this, here's a useful piece of info to get you started.  
The default nodes in the client seem to be outdated. For a more recent list of nodes, please refer to the Securecoin forum:

**An Introduction to the Basis for Speculation and Potential Value in the Widespread Adoption of Bitcoin and Crypto-Currencies**
 


**Precursor**


This is a paper to address the widespread and often misunderstood speculation regarding the economics and potential value of crypto currencies, more specifically Bitcoin. I must start out by stating that I do not claim to be an expert in crypto currencies nor economics. My interest in the subject was sparked a few months ago and in that time span I have done significant research regarding the nature and speculation of crypto currencies. For those who question my background, I am currently a student studying Finance and Economics finishing up my final year to get my degree. In addition to the research I have done in this subject, I have applied knowledge that I have picked up at school to the claims in which I make in this paper. In this essay I will clearly outline why Bitcoin has value, the reasons which I believe Bitcoin has the potential to change the global economy, what needs to be done in order to make this speculative claim come to fruition, and state my beliefs on what this means for the future in terms of economic and social reform. I understand that many people who have been familiar with crypto currencies may already understand this information; therefore this paper is tailored more towards people who are new to the subject.


**Why is Bitcoin valuable?**


Throughout history, there has always been a necessity for a medium of exchange. If you can recall from your early school days, you may have learned about early civilizations in North America using the purple part of sea shells as a form of currency, known as “wampum”. The reason why I bring this up is because it’s a simple example that can be used to highlight the intuition behind understanding the concept of a medium of exchange. This wampum and modern currency’s alike including the Dollar, Euro, and Yuan, are all only worth something because the society who holds them believe their worth something because. Obviously, the purple part of sea shells has absolutely no value intrinsically. You may stop and wonder if the dollar is backed by gold, however the fact is that the United States government abandoned its commitment to convert dollars to gold in 1971. It is only due to the widespread belief that today’s fiat currency’s hold value that it allows it to function as a medium of exchange, and therefore allows the monetary system to operate successfully. So for those who don’t understand why BitCoin may hold any intrinsic value, the answer is that it doesn’t, and neither do the
fiat currencies which you use every day. Bitcoin can only be considered valuable if the society at large perceives it as valuable. However, hopefully the later portions of this paper will explain why Bitcoin would end up serving as a better currency or “medium of exchange” than the modern forms of fiat currency which are used today.

The benefit in using Bitcoin over today’s fiat currency’s starts with the fact that it is decentralized. The supply of Bitcoin in the marketplace is determined by mathematical protocols and can under no circumstances can it be manipulated by human intervention. This is a good thing because throughout history we have learned or are in the process of learning that fiat currency’s which are manipulated by governing bodies have for the most part failed, or are in the process of failing. Actually throughout history there were 609 currencies that are no longer in circulation, of which 153 were destroyed as result of hyperinflation (Hewitt). Even last year, European currencies almost suffered hyperinflation as a result of the European Debt Crisis. Further, the question must be asked of where the dollar will be in terms of value in the years to come considering the enormous pile of debt that the United States is obligated to pay and its necessity to default on its debt ceiling each time it comes due. Also what is going to happen when the Federal Reserve stops pumping money into the economy with its quantitative easing program in order to keep the economy and financial markets artificially stable? If what we learned from history remains true and today’s fiat currencies don’t stand the test of time, then theoretically Bitcoin can serve as a viable form of currency when most or all other fiat currencies are in effect devalued. This assumption is derived from the fundamental nature of the currency considering that there is a finite amount of Bitcoins that can be mined (21 million) and the supply of the currency is not manipulated by a governing body. Bitcoin’s are created through a process where computer hardware must compute mathematical functions for a long period of time to be “awarded” a Bitcoin when solved. Also, for each sub sequential Bitcoin mined, it becomes harder for this computer hardware to mine the next one. These truths are a function of the protocol on which Bitcoin operates.

*“Paper money eventually returns to its intrinsic value – zero.”* (Voltaire, 1694-1778 )

Although the fact remains that Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, a dilemma arises in the way that it is set up to create a deflationary based economy opposed to the inflationary economy which we are all used to today. In an inflationary based economy, the value of a single unit of currency would decrease through time since there are more being created. As an example you may consider the inflationary nature of the dollar when the Federal Reserve prints money. In the case of Bitcoin, as more and more Bitcoin’s are mined, the effect would result in scarcity of the currency resulting in an increase value, especially if combined with an increase in demand. The resulting increase in value is compensated by the way Bitcoin is denominated to 8 decimal places. Therefore as the value of the currency increases, the value of .0000001 BTC may eventually be comparable to the value of 1 dollar in today’s marketplace.

Furthermore, in a deflationary based economy there would be an incentive to produce quality and durable products that last as opposed to producing products that are designed to fail like many firms do in the present inflationary based economy. This is because in a deflationary economy there is less incentive to spend, because by holding your money it would be worth more tomorrow than it is today. In an inflationary economy the opposite is true; there is less inventive to sell because firms wouldn’t want to receive money which will be worth less tomorrow than today. This is the basis by which firms in an inflationary economy must create products that are designed to fail. To expand on this claim, in order for firms to keep up with the devaluation of currency through inflation, they must maintain constant profit streams by forcing the consumer to return and buy more products. On the contrary, in a deflationary economy, in order to get consumers to want to spend their money which they know will be worth more tomorrow than it is today, firms will have to compete on offering the highest quality product or service in order to sell their product. Not only is this good for consumers and competition among firms, but it could help towards creating a more environmentally friendly marketplace by creating products which do not contribute to the negative effects of industry such as waste as much as they do today. For those who may argue that there would be no incentive at all to spend in a deflationary economy, it must be noted that there will always be a necessity for a medium of exchange since there will always be goods and services demanded which one person cannot produce themselves.

personalfinance,I don't know what else to do. Having panic attacks and nightmares; my debt is ruining my life.,"I've been subscribed here for a little while now, and I'm slowly learning lifestyle changes that have been very helpful. However, using YNAB, I just recently found out that my spouse and I are nearly $100,000 in debt. Around $6,200 of this is credit cards which keep escalating in interest accumulation, the remanding chunk is private and government student loans.  

Of course, my husband and I made really stupid choices and I feel like we keep making them. We stopped eating out, stopped going out at all and still we keep needing to use credit cards to make ends meet. I'm freaking out every night and am starting to feel the physical effects of this.  

I know these posts come across a lot here, but I am really needing some additional input.  

A little background:  

* My husband works at an Apple store, makes pretty decent money. Around half of his paycheque each month goes toward his 401k, our health insurance, and toward stock purchases. This leaves us on average with a little under $800 every two weeks. 
* I work in a hospital and bring in around $500 every two weeks. Because I'm still in nursing school, I cannot work more than 36 hours a week, so this cheque is usually from me working 2 days a week (24 hours).  
* Our average monthly income usually sits around $2,600.

Our bills: 

Rent is $725, utilities ~$100, car payment ~$250, gas is insane at ~$400 (we have one car and I have my nursing school clinicals a half hour from home x2 days a week). We have to pay at least minimum balances on the credit cards each month at $250, car insurance is another $210, medical expenses are $50, Netflix and Hulu are 16. We pay $50 a month for business class internet that hubs gets as an Apple employee, 35 for his phone, 55 for mine. We eat at home for most meals and spend $280 a month on groceries, maybe $50 a month together on coffees/to-go breakfasts since our schedule is extremely hectic. The rest of our money basically goes into trying (and failing) to pay down the cards, our household products, and putting some money into savings (we have an impressive $175 so far there).  

We got into trouble before because of my husband's love of movies and video games, and my love for Starbucks and expensive makeup.  

I know that's a lot of info. I'm really desperate at this point; I can't live with this debt anymore. Any advice you guys can give will be more than appreciated. Thank you. 

**Edit:** So much great advice, thank you! A lot of people have been rightfully asking about our 401k, ESPP, student loan and CC percentages. My apologies for leaving some critical info out. Here's a more specific breakdown of these:  

* Our 401k is employer matched 75% to whatever dollar amount is set aside. Right now he contributes 4%. 

* ESPP buys at 25% and we contribute 6% toward the share. 2% is minimum, 10% is max.

* The biggest chunk of our student loans are Stafford. $44,600 for me, $6,000 for him. I have $15000 in private, and he has $9600. We are currently paying interest on his Stafford loan at $67.00 a month. 

* Our highest CC interest rate is 24.24, the lowest is 19.99% APR.",finance,1386186883
personalfinance,Lien holder not reporting payments,"Very sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit, or if it's confusing. I'm just not very familiar with this subject.

**TL;DR What can I do to get my lien holder to report my payments? Will a paper proving my payments be the same as a higher credit score? Is this even worth fighting about?**


I'm trying to keep this question as simple as possible, so I don't have a really long post. 

The company that holds the lien on my car claims they are reporting my payments to Transunion. They aren't and are giving me the run around, saying they tried to contact Transunion, but have not recieved a call back. I got fed up after a week of calling everyday, and called Transunion myself. The woman I talked to said if the payments are not showing up on my report it's because the creditor is not reporting them. I know that a car dealership isn't legally bound to report my payments, but they said they were. What the man at the lien holder's told me was that if I needed proof that we're making payments he can fax a paper to whoever I needed it faxed to, but what I want is for my credit score to go up, and I don't think his paper will do that.

So it looks like I wrote too much anyway, sorry, I guess I'm just really frustrated. Any help or advice is really appreciated :)

 I'm calling the lien holder again after I post this to see what they say about me calling Transunion. I doubt I'll get anywhere though.

**EDIT** Ok so just for general information whether it can help someone out in the future or even if someone has any help.

I, brilliantly (just kidding I should have thought of this a long time ago), thought of calling my credit union, and asked if they would accept that paper of proof from my lien holder as evidence of my year of on-time payments. They said yes, they would! I then called me lien holder and the man I talked to told me that the only thing he can do is enter in my information. He repeated it all to me, and it was correct, and he said then it has to be something wrong on Transunion's side, and that he has been calling every morning since this issue came up with no answer to his calls. I have no idea what's going on, but hopefully I can refinance through my credit union with a lower interest rate because 20.04% is killing me.",finance,1386184372

Bitcoin,"Introducing BDIC: Bitcoin's decentralized, privately-funded version of the FDIC","If we had a satoshi for every time the mainstream media scoffed at Bitcoin's volatility and referenced the fact that there are limited consumer protections available in this ""crazed"" market, well, we would probably *be* Satoshi. 

Most of us agree that mainstream adoption of Bitcoin will only be possible when consumers are less exposed to vicious price swings in the Bitcoin market.  After all, merchants have instant conversion tools that help them minimize their currency risk thanks to companies like BitPay and Coinbase.  But consumers have no protection whatsoever. 

That's why we formed BDIC.  We are creating the Bitcoin community's version of the FDIC.  A decentralized, privately funded deposit insurance corporation that helps mainstream consumers minimize the risks associated with holding bitcoin.  We are building technology that integrates with wallet providers like Coinbase, and we are using hedge fund assets to guarantee the underlying USD value of new users' deposits (up to a cap).  We will provide downside protection for wallet holders, allow hedge funds to trade bitcoin on margin without actually holding the digital currency, and (in theory) help reduce volatility in the broader market. 

We hope you will contribute ideas, critiques and enthusiasm with comments below.  You can also request an invitation to our private beta at BDIC.me.

gaming,"I don't know what I expected from EA or Battlefield 4, but I think this basically sums up the frustration that everyone shares with the company as a whole.","http://imgur.com/g4qCt8J

The story is as follows:  My friend and I have played Battlefield since 1942 came out.  We have always held Battlefield in very high esteem.  I have owned every single one since Battlefield 2 for my original Xbox.  When Battlefield 4 was released, I rebuilt my computer to run it.  I was super excited.  I got engaged in the fall, and have been slowing paying off wedding plans and was looking for a way to save a few bucks.  My friend bought the standard edition with premium, and we were both unsure whether the Deluxe Edition came with the same access (it's since been clarified better than when it was first up for pre-order).  We chatted with a representative who was unsure and gave us the phone number to EA customer support to call and find out for sure.  That representative ASSURED me, that I would have the same access as my friend up until the 3rd expansion.  Since the deluxe was an extra 20$, and premium was an extra 50$, I obliged, and cut the corner with the Rep's assurance to save some money before the wedding.  40$ is 40$ when you're trying to keep an account up to pay for a honeymoon.  Today, I recieved an Email that the expansion that came with the deluxe was released, and I needed to login to access it and start playing today.  It wouldn't download.  So I chatted with a first agent, who told me that there is nothing that could be done.  I did not have access.  I asked if I could credit the 20$ for the deluxe towards a premium membership since I was mis-informed about the deluxe edition.  He said no.  And told me he was sending me a link to explain the next step in talking to someone.  That link was to the order page for Premium.  He then ended the chat.  Pretty upset, I opened another ticket to talk the a second agent who was even less helpful, and refused to hear my argument.  He fed me something about voiding the warranty 24 hours after installing it.  I just wanted to upgrade to premium without re-buying the content.  He abruptly cut me off to explain the different account types, told me ""If you're looking for a refund, it's expired.  I don't want to make you a false promise.""  And in the middle of typing, he ended the chat, and the link to save or print the transcript wouldn't work.  So the third person I talked to was this chat.  

I am so insanely disappointed in EA.  Everyone on Reddit has hated them, and I never understood why.  Short of a few bugs with Dead Space 3, and Origin, I have never had a problem with the company.  I had a BF3 Premium account.  I had BF3 pre-ordered and didn't have a problem.  This was mis-leading, and has severely damaged the EA reputation for me.  I have always held Battlefield in much higher regard than any franchise on the market, and I came to terms with the fact that I had to upgrade anyway even tho I was mis-informed.  I just didn't want to spend the extra money.  I didn't know that EA would fight this hard over a $20 misunderstanding at their customers expense.  I know my money is nothing to them, but it's ruined a quality product for me.  And a product I've bought upon release since mid-2004 when it was released.  It's been a good run EA.  I'm terribly disappointed that this is how little your customer base means to you.",technology,1386140847
Bitcoin,How we can guarantee the regulatory success of Bitcoin,"So there is a very real threat that regulation (around the world) could destroy Bitcoin. I would prefer this threat to disappear - and I have a solution. It's not pretty, but it will probably work.

So let's agree, by vote, to give politicians bunches of bitcoins.

We don't give it to them immediately - we release it to them slowly, (per block, like miners rewards), so that they can't easily sell them off.

The whole thing might require some changes to the protocol.

We first decide on initial rules on how we'll vote. For instance, we will only give bitcoin trust funds to politicians whose net worth is low enough that the fund will matter to them. And they have to be in a sufficient position of power (U.S. Federal senate, house, executive, or U.K. parliament, etc.). And we'll only give the trust funds to the first N politicians that approach us. The network will hopefully vote along these lines, but doesn't have to. As long as the guidelines are followed *for the most part*, it should still work. 

The funds are acquired by a two-step process: 1. The politician approaches the community, announcing their support of Bitcoin and provides a Bitcoin address which they own. 2. The network holds a vote (by stake ownership - more bitcoins = more vote, or by mining ownership - more blocks = more votes) to decide whether or not the address actually belongs to the politician who claimed it and whether or not the politician deserves it. 3. If the vote passes, the address becomes a trust fund that the politician now owns. Funds are added to it for every block that gets mined according to the predetermined rules.

For example, each trust can distribute an average of 100 bitcoins per year to the first 250 qualified politicians over the course of 20 years. At the current value of the network, this is roughly an incentives package of $2 million per politician, and would cost the network about $500 million (4% of the market cap).

So we'll lose 4% of our value (or whatever amount ends up getting decided). The value we gain from it? The annihilation of regulatory fear. The interests of the politicians who are in the greatest position to fuck everything up can instead be HEAVILY aligned with our interests - they will want to see the Bitcoin protocol succeed because their assets will be tied to the success of the protocol.

This is how we can defeat the regulation issues. I know it sounds like a bit much, and there's quite a bit of resistance to strange ideas, and this is definitely a strange one, so I doubt the Bitcoin community will do it. But eventually, there might be an altcoin that does this. I'll be mining *that* altcoin.",cryptocurrency,1386140092
Bitcoin,Bitcoin Deflation and Debt Myths,"1) Deflation is bad.
False. Deflation is the natural outcome of a productive society.
Savings fuel new innovations which increase productivity which increases output of goods and services. Higher supply means greater affordability, hence lower prices. This is natural.
Think electronics. Electronic prices have fallen for decades as productivity has increased. Everyone is wealthier.

2) Modern Fiat money is a form of institutionalized usury.
True. Debt Deflation(Credit contraction/collapse) is the final outcome of a fiat credit money system. Credit money requires constant expansion of loans in order for ""interest"" to be created to pay the previous debts. All credit based systems eventually self implode from the liberal over issuance of consumer and government credit. 6000 years of history provides countless examples. Every empire and kingdom has been decimated via debt issuance to finance consumption(wars, consumer goods etc) Debts + interest force business's and individuals to liquidate wealth creating capacity in order to service ever growing liabilities. Think of a virus eating a host.

3) Bitcoin is anti-debt therefore cannot work in an economy.
False. Bitcoin promotes the useage of equity based financing for projects. Think share issuance/trusts/units. This makes ownership more *distributed* as 1 party is never capable of financing an entire project. Bitcoin is designed NOT to encourage the rampant expansion of credit. Credit expansion leads to capital destruction and enormous gaps between the creditors(0.1%) and everyone else.

4) Interest on debt is an unnatural phenomenon.
True. Interest is a claim on wealth which has NOT yet been created. If you lend someone a cake and they consume it, how can you ask for the cake + a piece back? It makes no logical sense. Interest on debt is money breeding. However money in and of itself is a sterile good. It is a medium of exchange that by itself is not productive. Debt based systems attempt to create wealth out of nothing. History shows they have always imploded. 

5) Bitcoin represents a threat to the Money Power.
True. See above. Bitcoin is ANTI-DEBT meaning Anti- debt slavery. 

6) Bitcoin has no bailout mechanism. 
True. The bitcoin ecosystem promotes many *minor* mistakes. People learn from these mistakes and improve the economy going forward. No bailout mechanism ensures that wasteful users of bitcoin are punished(think pirate40 participants), and people use their capital more prudently. A system of small mistakes ensures maximum anti fragility. See Nassim Taleb on this topic. Bitcoin ensures overtime only the most prudent,intelligent and productive users become capital allocators. This is a benefit for EVERYONE, as the wealth pool expands via increased efficiency.

7) Bitcoin is anti-credit.
False. Self liquidating credit for productive purposes is entirely possible with bitcoin. Please see Antal Fekete and Real Bills concept for more. Bitcoin is ANTI consumer credit, which is nothing more then a miss-allocation of scarce capital.

8) Bitcoin cannot work because there is nothing ""backing it"".
False. The US dollar by definition is a defaulted claim on gold. Hence why it trades at a substantial(99%) discount to gold. It is a liability of the Federal Reserve whose assets contain the debts of a bankrupt government. Bitcoin does not need ""backing"" because one of its inherent positives is the lack of 3rd party liability/exposure. No government ""backed"" currency has ever survived the test of time. Government can only ""bacK"" debt via coercive enslavement of it's citizens(taxes).",cryptocurrency,1386139631

personalfinance,Possibly stuffed / B.S. medical bill - what to do?,"Hi PF!

I didn't know where to post this but I've seen a lot of good advice regarding bills here over the years, so I figured this might be a good place to ask about what I think is an unfair medical bill.

I went to the urologist complaining about pain in my testes (ow - yes - turned out fine though), and he ordered an ultrasound at the hospital. When I got the bills they said this:


Hospital Bill:

* OTH IMAG ULTRASOUND $252
* PERIPHERAL VASCULAR LAB $524

Physician's Bill:

* DOPPLER LTD: ABDOMINAL/PELVIC/RETROPER $215
* ULTRASOUND SCROTUM $114


These are all coming out of my deductable, which is fine. But I'm confused as to what some of those charges are. Talking to the doctor's office, the lady who works there said that they only ordered an ultrasound. For good measure, I got a copy of the referral, and sure enough, it says ""Ultrasound:testicular"". She went on to say that they shouldn't have charged for anything else, as none of those were ordered by the doctor.

Talking to the billing company didn't help much, they told me to contact medical records. I got a copy of my records, and the orders section says; ""US DUPLEX VISCERAL LIMITED; US SCROTUM"". Now, this seems to imply that they thought the doctor ordered the visceral ultrasound, which he clearly did not, looking at the original referral, which says testicular ultrasound.

I tried to get to the billing department at the hospital, but turns out it's not done in house. There was one lady who was in contact with them, so I talked to her. The lady said the vascular lab was likely ""part of the same thing"" which sounds like bullshit to me, but I'm not educated enough to know. Could this be true?

Furthermore, the records say ""Exam: Ultrasound of the scrotum"" and ""Technique: Sonographic evaluation of the scrotum. Color and Spectral Doppler analysis was also performed to assess testicular vasculature.""

Now I'm receiving notifications saying they'll send my bill to collections.

What should I do? Should I pay up to make them go away, even though I think it's unfair? It seems ridiculous that they can do a medical procedure without my knowledge and then ask for it.

Any advice appreciated. Also would appreciate possible subreddits for crossposting.",finance,1386278738

Bitcoin,Just wanted to get some opinions,"Hey /r/bitcoin.

I am working on a Bitcoin-based gaming site, and the feedback that I'm getting from a lot of people after they figure out what bitcoin is, is ""I want to send money to myfriend@thatemail.com. Why do I have to send it to 1HbQA9CMpLoLck55qBoxdtX5KssBD3Anq9, and how am I supposed to remember that?""

So I wanted to make a simple address-discovery protocol/service that would be decentralized and could be run from anywhere. It would take the OAuth approach to federating in that if you own domain xyz.com, you could have any @xyz.com addresses you want; that's your realm. It does not preclude someone running a ""public"" service, however. The process would be simple: I want to send BTC to jim@domain.com. So I just send it to ""jim@domain.com"". The client checks with domain.com for account ""jim"" and gets a response of some kind -- a valid bitcoin address in the event of success. Use standard SSL/TLS certs for domain authority, and I think it would work pretty well for most cases.

The issue is that in order for it to work I would have to code a lot of things: 1) the service itself (or at least the reference implementation) 2) documentation for the protocol, 3) a library to interface with the service in a handful of languages, and 4) (the big one) patches for all the popular clients to support something like this.

That's a lot of work, and I'm one guy. Before I dive in, I was wanted to check with the Bitcoin community at large if there is even a need/want for something like this beyond my handful of beta testers. If your client ""just worked"" with more easily remembered/human-like addresses, would you use that feature? Would you run your own discovery service? Is this just a hair-brained scheme?

Separate from that I am currently putting $11k a year away for retirement (401k) and will adjust accordingly once I get finances squared away (lets say a target of retirement in 40 years). In order to get that salary, I needed some college loans which total $254k. At the current 30 year payback plan I owe about $1800/month. Ideally, I would like to pay it off ASAP, as I don't like having debt. Interest rate is  about 7.2% (with the possibility of the interest rate being lowered to 6.8%) No other debt.

Here's the 5 year forecast: Will need to purchase a used vehicle costing about $10k within the next 9 months. Within the next 3 years a reliable family vehicle will need to be purchased (hoping to have a kid or three).

Currently renting month to month and would like to purchase a home. Here's where my real question comes in. Originally I had planned on purchasing a home around $120K. However, there are a few homes in the $230-$260k range that would be literally ""dream"" homes, where you really see yourself growing old in. With planning to start a family in the next year or so, would you go with the ""forever home"", but sacrifice by being on a tighter budget? Or would you go with the $120K home and hope that interest rates stay low so you can tackle the student load debt and hopefully obtain the ""dream"" home later in life?

In either scenario, does it make more sense to have the lowest down payment so more money can go towards the student loan, even though the mortgage interest rate would go up a little bit, or should a good ~20% down payment be made to keep the mortgage rate low and sacrifice throwing that money at the student loan?

Now there is huge variable that my wife could make about $30k a year and add that to our income, but I'd like to think conservatively in case job prospects are not that great or try to swing having her be a stay at home mom. 

Here's some pros and cons to the home situation I'm currently contemplating:

**Dream Home Pros** : Any home improvements will stay vested with the family for the foreseeable future, its a dream home for the entire family

**Cons** : Student loan not paid off as quickly, not nearly as much cushion for unexpected costs


**Budget minded home pros** : Saves money, potential savings could be spent on family activities or related costs, budget would have more cushion to have wife stay at home

**Cons** : Repairs and improvements will most likely be only enjoyed for the short term as would ideally be intending to move once debts are more manageable, may never get chance to move to the dream type of home (you know how life goes...)

I am around town quite a bit, so I stop in irregularly to see who is there. One thing I love about Bitcoin and especially having a physical location for it - is the people I meet that have been brought together by it. There is many unique, colourful individuals I otherwise likely would not have met.

Anyways, I am there last night and there is this dude, this guy.. this older dude guy in a big trench coat. He came in to use the ATM, and I am there talking with two young Bit-thusiasts. He overhears me talking and begins talking to us..

This dude guy, is a master mask creator. Telling me he has sold some of his masks for $10,000 - and now plans to accept Bitcoin for his masks and actually KEEP IT IN BITCOIN.

He goes on to tell me that he has FOURTEEN KIDS. They are all overseas, most of them in a big ass house he sends them Bitcoin to pay the rent for in the Phillipines. He says from his 14 kids, many of them have kids/families of their own, so his actual family size is 35.

He goes on to show me pictures, one of the bathroom with two big cups literally overflowing with toothbrushes. The next part of his story, warms my heart -

He goes on to tell me, that over the years he has sent some $1.5 MILLION to his family through Western union. The fees, the wait times, the hardship.. but he had no other choice. Western Union has a near monopoly on this kind of stuff - and they know it - and charge accordingly.

He says now thanks to Bitcoin, he is able to do it directly and bypass them. Now the NEXT PART OF THE STORY - really warms my grassfed heart - big time!

He goes on to tell me, that he is going to open a wallet for each of his kids and grandkids, all of them. He is going to put 2-3 BTC in EACH WALLET, and then just tuck them away... for ""20 years from now"" he says.

Man, I lost it! One of the BEST Bitcoin stories I've ever heard. I said $%#* stocks &amp; bonds and go on to tell him how my grandmother, bless her non-grassfed heart, left me and my brother $2000 bonds before she left this world.. and on those bonds they would give back a staggering 1% a year, maturing in 20 years time with incremental .25% interest increases each year. $20 a year... $25 the second year.. etc...

In 20 years, I'd have enough for a sandwich cart. Not my idea of a light at the end of the tunnel now is it.

Now this dude guy, his kids, 2-3 BTC each, a couple thousand now, might potentially be millions for them later in life.

investing,TIPS. tips?,"I have never purchased bonds/fixed income directly before.  I hold some LQD and it makes up ~2.5% of my portfolio (this is pretty much the extent of my bond holdings - the rest in US and foreign equities).  I'm 24 years old.

My thought process here is that the market is a little pricey, Fed actions are putting a lot of extra cash into the hands of banks.  It remains to be seen whether or not they will start lending this, and what affect it will have on the dollar (possibly leading to inflation).  In addition, this ""inevitable"" correction (the fear of which may lead to a gradual correction in itself) is coming.  Now? 3 years?  Who knows.  Anyways, if I increase my fixed income exposure, my portfolio will see less decline in a correction, and I'll be able to re-balance (or liquidate my bonds) and buy the dip (that's the dream, right?).

Why TIPS?

1. Sweet acronym
2. Benefits (or at least insulated) from inflation
3. Low-risk*
4. Better rate of return than sitting on cash

Possible Downsides:

1. I assume the coupon is generally lower on TIPS than other treasuries, to offset the nice inflation protection feature.  
2.  I'm subject to interest rate risk, which has been the reason everyone has sounded the alarm against bonds for the past year or two.  
3. I've also read that any changes in par value due to inflation adjustments is a taxable event, even though you aren't being paid out any of that par value until maturity.

Questions:  

1. Do TIPS decrease in value in a deflationary environment?  
2. Does it make more sense to buy shorter maturities (5-yr as opposed to 30-yr) because of the very real interest rate risk?
3. Are there reasonable projections for how the price of TIPS will move over the next few years based on whichever assumptions (i.e. if QE continues through 2014 and inflation gets a little out of hand, the par value could increase by 2.5%/year -  If QE ends in January, interest rates are likely to rise and TIPS will lose 3% of their value - etc.)

*There are many factors to risk.  I know there's an opportunity cost to being in fixed income while the stock market makes new all time highs.  I'm about 95% in equities, so I'm not losing out that much.  I'd like to get closer to the 90%/10% range.  I say ""low-risk"" in that my capital will be largely preserved, even if the TIPS decline in value 5% over the next 2 years, I guess I'm betting on the correction being more significant than 5%.

Now I only have $200 in my checking account.  I just got situated with a job that pays around $2500 a month.  Of that $2500, around $700 goes to rent.    I think if I really wanted to I could live extremely frugal and transfer around $1500 back home each month.

Or, I could open a new credit card with 0% interest and no transfer fees.   My credit score is 760 so it wouldn't be a problem.   But, I'm worried if I transfer it to a 0% interest card that I would be less likely to make payments.

personalfinance,Father in law has refinanced student loan taken out for my wife,"Hi everyone, I've got kind of a unique situation going on here, so I'm just checking to make sure we're doing the right thing.

My wife's father paid for my wife's undergrad education by taking out a loan. At some point around 5 years ago, he decided to refinance the loan and now it's got about 25k left at a rate of 2.85% or so and it has about 15 years left on the payment schedule. Because it's so long and the rate is pretty low, the monthly is only $250. (Not exact numbers but pretty close)

Recently, there's been some financial toughness in the parents household, so we've agreed to pay off the loan for them.

Instead of literally moving the loan under our name, we've currently just opted to direct debit $250 a month to his loan. We've decided to not pay more principal because the interest rate is low enough for now. 

We currently are a little tight on money after our wedding this year, so we're just paying the minimum until we have quite a bit more money to dump into there.

I have a few questions:

1. Are we doing the best solution for now? Should we be paying more principal off on the loan?
2. Is there a way that we could transfer the loan somewhere to reduce the interest rate even more (because it's a student loan)?
3. Is her father able to take the interest as tax credit because it's on student loans even though he refinanced the loan and even though we're the ones paying for it? Or is it possible that we (wife and I) can take the interest as tax credit?

&gt;U.S. mortgage rates jumped to the highest since September as investors speculated that the Federal Reserve will slow bond purchases aimed at keeping borrowing costs down.

&gt;The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 4.46 percent this week, up from 4.29 percent, according to a statement today from Freddie Mac. The average 15-year rate rose to 3.47 percent from 3.3 percent, the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company said.

&gt;Mortgage rates have climbed from a near-record lows in May as the Fed weighs how soon it should scale back its stimulus. Yields for 10-year Treasury notes, a benchmark for home loans, rose to the highest level in more than two months yesterday after a private report showed U.S. payrolls increased more than economists estimated, adding to bets the central bank may advocate slowing bond purchases at this month’s policy meeting.",finance,1386260535

personalfinance,Need some sound financial advice,"I recently graduated college with about 55k in student loans.

About me: I am 23 years old, newly married (wife has no student loan debt) and we are English teachers in Korea (we are from Atlanta, Georgia). That being said I have a little over 2k a month to put toward debt and savings. 

We currently put $1,500 a month to student loans ($1,000 towards Sallie Mae and $500 to parent plus loans) and put $500 a month to a savings account in the states (Suntrust). My Sallie Mae loan is down to around $28,500 (average of 5% interest rate) and the Nelnet parent plus loans are down to about 24k (7.8% interest rate). The Nelnet loans are low priority because they are in my parents name and I am technically not responsible for them. They are honestly so broke, swallowed in debt, and financially retarded that I am assuming responsibility of the loans in order to keep a positive relationship with my parents. 

That being said, I will have my Sallie Mae loans paid off in 2 years (I am planning on staying in Korea teaching until they are paid off). With year end contract bonuses (~4k) and a year end raise this will be no problem to knock out the Sallie Mae loans. After the two years of paying $500 a month to Nelnet I will have around 10k-11k left on those (my parents say they are going to help when they can but I'm not counting on it). We also pay into a pension which will total to about $9k after our two year stay. 

We have about $7K in savings back home and have no other debt. My questions are: 
A: Am I going about this the right way? 
B: Is there a way I can be getting some kind of reward from Sallie Mae/Nelnet (cash back, bonus points, etc.)?
C: Should I be paying less to student loans and more to savings/investing?
C (part 2): If I should be investing more money how/where? 

The main point of coming to Korea was to be able to save lots of money and to be debt free when we go back home to the wonderful job market in the States. I hope I explained myself enough and this isn't just a jumbled mess.

Bitcoin,Banks show a hostility towards bitcoin that is unwarranted.,"I keep hearing about how bitcoin will destroy banks and lead us into a new age. I like bitcoin as much as any avid bitcoin fan could........ but I think most people don't understand the situation fully.

 Bitcoin's success would eat into certain profits that banks have.... for instance wire transfers as an example. But the bread and butter of banks profit isn't from some petty fees (even though they add to billions). It's from loans. For instance with the dollar...... every dollar in circulation (electronic or cash version) has been created because it was loaned into existence. Therefore every dollar is also earning some bank interest. They create it from nothing.... lend it out with interest attached... and reap the rewards.  No one has a better gig than that. The president doesn't have a better gig than that. God himself doesn't have a better gig than that. A slave owner from centuries ago didn't even have it that good. And bitcoin doesn't affect that.  No one in their right mind is going to ever say hmmm...... should I get a loan in dollars (which is an inflationary currency ) at this low interest rate.... OR should I get a loan in bitcoin (deflationary) at this high interest rate ? No sane person is going to want a loan in bitcoins. Even if there was some fancy bitcoin bank giving them out.

And people love getting loans. They love living beyond their means on credit. Loans won't go away. And of course ...... the dollar won't die. Even if bitcoin is wildly successful.... the fact of the matter is the government taxes us. It forces us to pay taxes. Therefore we have no choice but to pay them and since the dollar is accepted in the payment of taxes then it will always have some value. 

None of this is a problem for bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't need to kill banks to be successful. In fact........ of all the people in a position to profit wildly from bitcoin it is banks themselves.... because if one bank was to integrate an exchange and offer deposits and the exchange in the same place that would be pretty nifty.",cryptocurrency,1386210507
personalfinance,What's the r/pf consensus on I Series bonds?,"I'm curious as to what the consensus is on I Series bonds as far as the r/pf community is concerned.  To me, they seem like a good investment for anyone sitting on cash that they won't need for a year, but foresee potentially needing in 1+ years (up to maybe 5 or so, at which point, stocks/other bonds may be the better option).  I bonds highlights:  

* The rate on I Bonds currently is 1.38%

* You are limited to $10,000/yr/SS#

* interest gained on i bonds is exempt from state and local taxes (and federal taxes if used for education, but there are some other limitations like a fairly low income phaseout)

* the interest rate is determined by a fixed rate plus inflation

* the interest rate beats out what you could get from other mid term investments like online savings, MMA's, and CD's without taking on (any?) a lot of risk

* money invested in i bonds can't be touched for a year - if you withdraw after a year, but before 5 years then you forfeit previous 3 months interest

At this point, emergency fund is well stocked (in terms of expenses, my emergency fund is currently the equivalent of years, hence why I'm looking at some other options).  I max out 401k, Roth IRA and HSA already.  I have a taxable investment account with some ETFs that track domestic and foreign stock indexes.  I've been looking at I Bonds for awhile and the only thing holding me back is the ""inconvenience"" of having to open an account with TreasuryDirect (yet another place that assets/investments will need tracked from) and locking up money for a year for a rate that's not too terribly more than what you could get via online savings/MMA/CD/etc.",finance,1386208414

Graduating in April from a good university and estimate I'll be ~$80,000 in student loans, most of them via Discover with ~3% interest rates (loans are variable interest, so I'm not 100% sure on rates at present) thanks to my parents co-signing and having fantastic credit.

Admittedly, I wish I'd have gone to a less expensive university, but I can't change that now. I loved my school and got a fantastic education in a field where I have absolutely 0 worry about finding a job.

My worry, however, comes in repaying these loans. I've done some research lately and the average debt is hovering around $30,000 for recent grads. The fact that I'm much, much higher than that is a bit disconcerting. It doesn't really worry me so much that I'LL be in debt, but it worries the hell out of my that I won't be able to pay it back and my parents will be accountable.

At present, I'm a full-time student with a part time job and an educational internship that takes up all my free time. I only work ~20 hours/week to provide myself with spending money.

Maybe my situation isn't as bad as I'm assuming, but I'm admittedly a little inexperienced with handling money aside from paying the gas bill at our apartment monthly and handling my Discover payments for the last 3 years.

personalfinance,House vs Loans and timing,"**Topic:** Looking for advice on the trade-off of paying loans vs buying a house such as how much to pay on loans, how low to get them before buying, etc.

Details:
Married male, 26 in midwest. Both employed, wife slightly underpaid, searching for job closer to her degree. All below numbers are household (we don't separate our accounts/debts etc)

Income: ~110k
student loans: ~41k (most interest rates are 6.55%, I have one older for 3500 at 5%)

401k: ~6k
HSA: ~1k
Roth: she has 3500 in one that was from gift from her gparents. we havent started any yet as we've just been using excess for loans/savings.

Take home is about 6k most months (she works overtime here and there). 
Rent is 800 up to 1100 with utilities and internet. 
Gas/food/pets/goingout/sport/misc is about 2k a month. It varies depending how social we are being. I dont track those things specifically, we use mint to collect totals but neither of us care about the details much. All that spending goes on reward cards paid in full every month. Throw in car insurance etc.

So, we have usually 2500-3000 each month in leftover cash. 
loan mins are 245 and 315 and i've been doing mine at 550 for a while. Her's we've been doing 800-1000. And then 1-1.5k goes to savings/emergency fund each month. Current cash is at 24k. 

**Summary:**
110k income
41k student loan debts
24k cash
10k retirement stuff

Looking at houses like a 2-4 br 1500-2000 sqft with big yard. Depending on suburb here that is 200k-300k range. Both have good credit.

So if we play the 20% rule, we'd need 40-60k + efund and closing/extras. So more like 60-80k. 

With my forecasting spreadsheet, we would get there in 3Q 2016 at current loan vs savings rate. If we cut savings and threw all cash at loans (cept 10k efund) wed be done around 9/2014. And hit 60-80k cash again Q2 2016, maybe Q1 with bigger income increases.

However...if we do a smaller downpayment(10-15%)... That gives a lot of other options with the added benefit of freeing up the 800 in rent which then is applied to the loan/mortgage bucket.

I have math degrees. So I know that going all loans first is the best option in terms of maximizing net worth. However we are solid on location, my job is very stable and she has plenty of local opportunities she is interested in (just a matter of time). Not to mention shes happy with her job, just not the pay. So timing-wise, we'd like to buy now.

investing,"Stop me from investing everything ($100,000) in KO - 33/35 year horizon for an income generating goal","My first post, lurked for a long time. So, let me start with a few facts as I try to read you mind and anticipate questions in the thread:

* Investing in a single stock/equity is not a great or even good idea - I know this. But is KO different? Hoping to get some real opinions here. Would you do it?
* Only debt is a 5% mortgage - $126,000 remains on this.
* We bring in about $120,000 salary a year between us both.
* Emergency fund is secured.
* We fully fund our ROTH every year with a diversified group of dividend champs/aristocrats and this will continue.
* Wife is 30, main objective is to secure an income generating portfolio for her at 62-65. Gives me a 32 year horizon, possibly more.
* DGR (dividend growth rate) and stability (moat) is what attracts me to KO.
* Will have to pay taxes every year on the dividend income, understood.
 
I look at dividend ETFs and it just makes me cringe to see the turnover rates and the fees associated.  Is the diversification worth the fees? Can any stock be safer than sweet, sweet KO?

I want to take $100,000 and stick it all in Coke stock, reinvesting the dividends for 30+ years, meahwhile forgetting we even own it.

I don't care about missing out on lots of capital gains by sticking with such a 'boring' stock. In fact the more flat the price remains the more shares I can buy with my DRIP plan. Its all about ending up with as many income/dividend generating stocks for when she retires.

Alternatively, if we pay off the mortgage (could do this in about 12 months) I will save us that 5% interest rate but we are back to zero on investing for our future. I can take future 'this would have been mortgage money' and buy shares as time passes, but dumping so much now will just start the compounding snowball years ahead of time.  Every year makes a huge difference with dividend growth investing. 

Let me provide an example:
I love this site:[BuyUpside](http://www.buyupside.com/calculators/dividendreinvestmentdec07.htm)

Here is what I get with an 8% DGR and a 2% stock growth rate - over 26,000 shares in 30 years. Assume the dividend will be 3X by then and that 100k investment nets us $93,000 yearly.  If we wait an extra 5 years before stopping the automatic reinvestment there are 64,000 shares and $230,000 yearly. This is why I am tempted to do this now, 5 years can make a huge difference.

Yes I know inflation will change the future value of those dollar quite a bit, $38,000/$81,000 respectively in inflation adjusted dollars.

Bitcoin,"China's recent guidance great for Bitcoin in China, terrible for the US.","America believes that yesterday's People's Bank of China statement on Bitcoin constituted a ""crackdown."" They said it's not a currency, banks can't touch it, and payment processors can't facilitate transactions. Therefore, China is trying to reign in Bitcoin. This is completely false. With this announcement, China now has one of the most favorable and friendly regulatory environments in the world.  China has acted quickly and decisively, and established very clear permissible behaviors re: Bitcoin (esp. vis-a-vis the US). And the US, be it the media or the government, doesn't understand this development.

Generally speaking, China had to balance two vital concerns. One, how to mitigate Bitcoin's potential to circumvent the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. (People's Bank controls all foreign exchange for the Chinese banking system). And two, how to corner and keep as much Bitcoin wealth as possible. 

In declaring Bitcoin a ""virtual commodity"" AND expressly saying Bitcoin is NOT a currency, they avoided the utter mess of having to integrate Bitcoin into current foreign exchange controls. It's a pretty sizable challenge to both allow internal Chinese bitcoin transactions, and forbid all international bitcoin transactions. Even if that was possible, they certainly have no idea how to do it at present. Further, had they permitted banks and payment processors to do anything involving Bitcoin whatsoever, they would've tremendously exacerbated the wealth flight problem. They can't declare it a currency without regulating it as a fiat currency, and they can't permit banks and payment processors to handle it w/o risking capital flight. Assuming China's goal is to not blow up their own foreign exchange controls, which seems likely, a strict separation between Bitcoin and bank is really the only option they had.

In addition, by declaring Bitcoin a virtual commodity and placing its regulation under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), China hasn't burdened Bitcoin's growth with banking regulations and controls. Now, exchanges like BTCChina know they don't have to become a bank or financial institution - they are simply a virtual commodity company. MIIT is the regulatory body that approves and manages, essentially, anything having to do with the internet (save for content). While ""payment processors"" cannot handle Bitcoin because it's not a currency, facilitating virtual commodity (which is ""private property"") trading and exchange (even for goods and services) looks to be perfectly legal. Expect the MIIT to approve a ""payment processor"" for BTC as something like a ""virtual commodity processor."" This would now be a ""natural"" expansion of BTCChina's business platform. 

So this guidance achieves both goals; China reduces the risk of capital flight while also establishing the regulatory future of BTC as free of undue financial institution regs. The US has effectively gone in the opposite direction - since BTC can be defined various ways, and there have been multiple ""official"" declarations of what it is, various federal agencies / regulators are involved, and most are bewildered. Exchanges must have banking relationships, have state-by-state money transmitter licenses, surety bonds, etc... BTC faces nearly all the financial services barriers-to-entry the US can muster. Not so in China. 

Separating Bitcoin and bank, expressly defining BTC, and assigning a regulator are brilliant moves by the Chinese. The rules and regulations around ""virtual commodities"" are now free to develop unencumbered by the Banking system's controls. Unlike the US, China has laid the legal and regulatory framework that can best facilitate Bitcoin growth.       

EDIT:

A currency is a contract. The terms and conditions of state currency are: 1) issued and managed by a central government, 2) used to pay debts to the state. China used these two contractual conditions to DEFINE a ""currency."" Therefore, BTC cannot be a currency: ""Bitcoin...does not have equal legal status with currency, and it cannot and should not be circulated as currency on the market.""

Nevertheless, China did not ban CONTRACTS. In fact, they created a new one, a ""virtual commodity."" BTC is a virtual commodity. Virtual commodities, such as BTC, can be used for transactions between people.",cryptocurrency,1386353836

I have also accepted a promotion effective Jan 2014 that will grant me a small ownership percentage of my company, a privately owned engineering consulting firm, for whom I have been working for 6 years.  
I was speaking to my dad about how to allocate the money within the 401k plan, and the funds below are what he suggested.  The website we use using indicated a very “red” pie chart, which suggests extremely volatile (or risky?) balance to this plan.  I have been reading up on definitions, strategies and so forth on what a properly balanced portfolio looks like, and the way it ended up being balanced below does not fit any of the conventional wisdom advice I have read about.  I should note that his initial premise is that the Fed just printed a lot of money, so the only way to address that *politically* is through significant inflation rates.  So I figured I would ask some internet strangers for some pointers.  
In what ways is this plan unbalanced?  What are some of the potential benefits of pursuing a balance like this?  What are the potential pitfalls?  Any advice is welcome, and thank you very much for your attention.

The Market Morals of Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are a new and revolutionary phenomenon that have challenged the orthodox view of fiat currencies and introduced a framework that can be utilized to achieve a more fair and efficient financial system.  The functions that the Bitcoin network provides allow for a money transmitting system that will help bring the free market to its apex, while leaving plenty of room for desired regulations that can flourish in a fully transparent environment. Through the use of a public transaction ledger, decentralization, and a limited supply of currency, Bitcoin can usher in an unprecedented era of market morality that cannot exist under current, traditional financial systems.

For better understanding, a summary of how Bitcoin works will be given before the concept is related to market morality.

Introduced in 2009 by an anonymous programmer using the alias ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to gain mainstream media attention. The term ‘cryptocurrency’ refers to the underlying cryptographic computer code that governs the Bitcoin network. It uses cryptography to secure transactions, protect the accounts that contain Bitcoins (wallets), and provide a proof-of-work algorithm that Bitcoin miners can solve to mint new coins. The network is founded on the principal that the underlying code (open-source) comprising the technology is decentralized. In other words, no controlling entity can govern, regulate, or change the Bitcoin network itself.

The Bitcoin network exists as a peer-to-peer network; many computers operated by many different users share transaction data. Advanced mathematical cryptography is used to verify and secure transactions that occur on the peer-to-peer network through the process of Bitcoin mining. The Bitcoin miners are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins in exchange for supplying the computational power to the network that is necessary for the authenticity verification of transactions. The Bitcoin algorithm adjusts the Bitcoin mining difficulty every two weeks to maintain an average rate of one ‘block’ being mined/solved every ten minutes. The reward for solving a block started at 50 Bitcoins per block, but that amount halves every four years (the current block reward is 25 Bitcoins). This process will continue until 21 million Bitcoins have been mined, which is estimated to occur near the year 2045. Past that point, no new Bitcoins will be created, but miners will still be rewarded by collecting the transaction fees that are sent to the network when a transaction occurs. That way, an incentive will always exist for computational power to be made available by miners.

Bitcoin transactions are transmitted instantaneously at little or no fee, and then verified every ten minutes (when a block is solved by a miner). A transaction consists of Bitcoins being sent from one public address to another, and this transaction is logged and verified by the network. Once the transaction is logged, it will be visible to all users of the Bitcoin network, essentially making it fully transparent as it resides on a public ledger. This system makes hidden transactions impossible and allows for all Bitcoins to be traced to their origin. On the other hand, the parties involved in the transaction can only be identified by the public addresses (keys) that are associated with the Bitcoin accounts involved. This means that although the transactions themselves are publicly available for scrutiny, the parties involved can remain fully anonymous if they choose, provided they are not linked to their public key. For parties wishing to make themselves known, they can provide their public Bitcoin address and users can browse the account’s history of all transactions.

A fully transparent, public transaction ledger juxtaposed with optional anonymity, allows for many improvements in the morality of markets. For instance, consider a theoretical country that uses Bitcoin as its national currency. The government could provide the public address(es) of where its Bitcoins reside to the general population. This would allow any citizen (or foreigner) to see exactly where their tax money was being spent. Even if the government did not provide the public address(es) of where the tax money was being kept, it could be easily deduced by tracing the trail of transactions originating from the initial tax payment to the government. A government operating under a financial system that is this transparent would be forced to be honest with the citizens.

In an article by Leif Wenar titled “Property Rights and the Resource Curse”, he addresses the issue of the ‘Resource Curse’. The curse is a phenomenon that occurs in less developed countries where a strongman, dictator, or other empowered group takes complete control over the countries natural resource wealth. The money is used to fund wars, violence, and make the perpetrators rich, while the general population remains poor as their country’s wealth is essentially stolen from them. As part of his proposed plan to put an end to the resource curse, Wenar developed a set of three conditions that could be required for a transfer of resource wealth to legally take place. If these conditions were enacted, it would help prevent resources from being ‘stolen’ from the citizens of a country (the rightful owners) by a strongman.

The first condition states: “An owner who cannot know about sales or their terms cannot authorize those sales. Citizens who cannot find out about resource sales cannot approve these sales even tacitly. At the very least, citizens should be able to obtain reliable general information about which resources the regime is selling for how much, and who is getting the proceeds.” (Wenar, Property Rights and the Resource Curse, 19). This condition can be easily met by utilizing Bitcoin, as opposed to current financial systems. If the government (or strongman) in question was conducting transactions on a known public Bitcoin address, the citizens of the country would be able to “obtain reliable general information about which resources the regime is selling for how much, and who is getting the proceeds”. In our current system, the transactions could be kept secret from the public very easily, as most transactions between banking systems are private information. If the government/strongman was unwilling to disclose the Bitcoin public addresses being used for the transactions, the citizens of the country could easily retrieve that information from the purchasing party on the receiving end of the resource sale.

The second condition states: “In order to acquiesce to resource sales an owner must have the ability and opportunity to stop these sales without incurring severe costs. Any regime claiming that it has the authority of the people to sell must put some effective mechanisms in place through with it acknowledges that the people can dissent to the sales. Citizens must also be able to peacefully express their dissent inside or outside of these formal mechanisms without fearing exile, imprisonment, torture, or death” (Wenar, Property Rights and the Resource Curse, 19-20). Bitcoin can also help satisfy Wenar’s second condition. The Bitcoin network contains a feature that allows for multiple private keys to be required for the authorization of any transaction out of a specific wallet. In other words, a wallet can be setup so more than one ‘password’ is required to allow for any outgoing transactions (spending). If the proceeds from all resource sales were deposited into a single wallet and a system were put in place where citizen-elected leaders or supervisors had possession of one of the required private keys, their consent would be required for any outgoing transfers to occur. Using this system, a strongman or totalitarian regime would have to gain the approval of its people to be able to spend any of the resource money. Otherwise, the money would be stuck in limbo without the required private keys. An organization like the United Nations could enforce resource buyers to only send payments to that specific wallet, under threat of sanctions. Cooperation among buyers coupled with this use of the Bitcoin system would help satisfy Wenar’s second condition for preventing the resource curse.

Bitcoin easily satisfies Wenar’s first two conditions of stopping the resource curse. Putting an end to the systematic theft of the wealth of a country’s people is unarguably a moral undertaking. Bitcoin’s public transaction ledger can also improve morals in other ways. For instance, money laundering would become much harder under a cryptocurrency system. Contrary to popular belief (many believe that one of Bitcoin’s main functions is money laundering due to its anonymity ), using the Bitcoin network to launder money would be very challenging. Algorithms can trace the entire history of a Bitcoin (or fraction thereof) to find where it originated and what addresses it passed through on the way. Throughout the process, the Bitcoin addresses are anonymous, but when the Bitcoins are exchanged for fiat currencies, or spent on online goods, identifying information is revealed in the form of a shipping address or bank account. The only way to get around this would be purchasing or selling Bitcoins person-to-person as a cash transaction, but in that case the money laundering may as well have occurred via paper cash. Paper money is still, by far, the best way to anonymize and launder funds.

By utilizing Bitcoin as a system of money transmission, increased morality can be achieved compared to current methods for sending money. Consider a migrant worker, working for minimum wage or less, that has family back home. Currently, their options for getting money home to their family include sending paper cash through the mail, or using a money transmitting service like Western Union or MoneyGram. If they send cash through the mail, they risk losing all of it from either theft or random loss. If they use MoneyGram or Western Union, they are forced to pay steep fees including the time and money it costs to complete the transaction, like driving to the required location and spending the time to fill out paperwork. When trying to support a family at such a low wage, it would be beneficial for them to send the funds via Bitcoin and avoid the time, hassle, and steep transaction fees. Clearly it would be immoral to deny them this capability, now that the option exists.

Bitcoin can also benefit lower-income individuals and families by offering a better store-of-value. For the portion of the population that lives “paycheck to paycheck”, at best, they may have a savings account. While the rich can afford to put money into stocks, bonds, commodities, and other stores-of-value that appreciate over time, the poor generally do not have this opportunity. Any money that they happen to have in a savings account, if they have one, receives such a low interest rate that it is negligible at best. In most cases, inflation will easily outpace the interest rate and the value of their holdings will decrease with time. Since the supply of Bitcoins is limited to a finite amount, 21 million, Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. Generally, storing earnings in Bitcoin will increase in value over time, rather than decreasing due to inflation. Overall, it offers more opportunities and fairness to the poor, thus again increasing market morality.

Lastly, Bitcoin greatly increases the morality of the markets through decentralization. Being a peer-to-peer network rather than a centrally controlled system, no governing body or authority can change Bitcoin in any way without 51% network consent. Politicians, bankers, and the leaders of Wall Street are unable to ‘play’ with Bitcoin like they do with the current financial system, oftentimes causing destabilization. The actions of the few end up harming many ordinary citizens. Decentralization allows for the true apex of the free market to be reached, while protecting the money supply that the general public depends on to live healthy, fulfilling lives.

By adopting Bitcoin as a major currency system, greater morality in the markets of mankind can be attained. The public transaction ledger allows for greater transparency with government and organizational spending. It also prevents money laundering and makes other criminal financial activity more traceable. Two of the conditions laid out by Leif Wenar’s framework for combating the ‘resource curse’ can be easily met by the capabilities of the Bitcoin network and can result in the improvement of human life worldwide. Instantaneous transactions that can be sent easily with little or no fee allow for more liquidity and movement of money, which can especially benefit the lower class. Through decentralization, Bitcoin creates a more stable and fair financial system. The concept of cryptocurrency can be applied to a free market society, yet it leaves room for fair and monitored regulation. Overall, Bitcoin is a superior alternative to the current financial system. Its implementation can be used to advance morality among the markets and make our world a better place.",cryptocurrency,1386301051

Anyway, I ended up opening a loan and moving the balance of my card to the loan.  Well I looked at my statement a couple days ago and realized that in 2 months I have already paid about $65 in interest.  This surprised me because I usually had a lower monthly interest fee on the credit card.

After doing my research I realized the loan is 10% interest and the credit card is 7.5%APR

I was upset because I had been told that the interest rate would be lower on the loan.  So I called the bank, and told them my situation.  He told me that they would cancel the loan and move the balance back to the credit card.

Now however, the banker who opened the loan is contacting me and telling me I am making a mistake.   She said that I will have higher interest on the credit card.  That's not what I'm seeing though.


Just looking at my statement I see this for my Credit Card:

Previous balance: $2231.16

Interest charged: $14.54


And on the personal loan I see:

Prior Principal Balance:  $3800

Interest Payment:       $32.27



So should I close the loan and keep things they way they were originally?  What is the benefit of this loan?        And yes, I realize I should have done more research prior to signing the loan.  Live and learn I guess",finance,1386294007

personalfinance,Need advice on getting documentation from Sallie Mae!,"I graduated from college a little over a year ago with about $32,000 in private student loans (with interest) from Sallie Mae. Unfortunately I didn't pay much attention to what I was getting into in college and now the majority of my loans have an interest rate of 10 or 11%. I have gotten approved to consolidate my loans through a credit union which would bring the interest rate down to 6.5 or 7%. Unfortunately in order to consolidate my loans I have to have a 30 day pay off letter from Sallie Mae. I called Sallie Mae to request the letter and was told it would take ""approximately"" two week to process the request and send the letter by mail. When I was asked if it could be sent by email I was told no, and that it takes two weeks for them to calculate the results. I waited a week and then called again just to make sure it was being processed. The representative I spoke with told me that the request had not been entered and there must have been a mistake. He assured me he would enter the request and process it from that day. I gave it a couple days and called back only to have another representative tell me the same thing. This time I demanded to speak with a manager about the situation and after some harsh words were exchanged was told everything would be taken care of immediately. I called back a few days later and was told everything had been entered and was being processed. Two weeks later I FINALLY received a letter in the mail from Sallie Mae. When I opened it however instead of the letter I had been requesting it was a letter from Sallie Mae stating that due to the backlog in requests Sallie Mae would not be able to process my request and I should try again at a later time. Since i have not been able to get this letter from Sallie Mae my application with the credit union timed out. I spoke with a representative at the Credit Union and they told me Sallie Mae is notorious for this kind of thing and unfortunately they didn't have much advice.

personalfinance,Graduating with a job and loans. Care to critique my repayment plan / budget?,"I'm graduating in a few weeks. I've landed a job paying $90k/yr in a city with a fairly low cost of living (mid-sized city in the Midwest) and I've been going over my finances to make sure I have a plan when I start earning. I'll graduate with the following federal student loans:

Unsubsidized: $7,000, 6.8%  
Subsidized: $10,930, 3.4%  
Subsidized: $4,922, 4.5%  
Subsidized: $5,500, 3.86%  

The largest subsidized loan has a grace period of 6 months, but the other subsidized loans apparently require you to pay the interest during that grace period or it is added to your principal. The unsubsidized loan accrues interest now. I have no credit card debt, car payment, etc.

Here is my projected budget when I graduate:

Monthly gross salary: $7500  
401k contribution: $1450  
Taxes (est. 30%): $1815  
Roth IRA: $450  
Housing: $1500  
Food: $300 (double what I live on now)

This leaves roughly $2000 of discretionary income, but obviously not all of that can go toward my loans (there's a conspicuous lack of saving, and I'm human so I will probably buy a few things now and then). I'll be prioritizing the unsubsidized loan first, since it accrues interest and has the highest rate. Basically I want to strike a good balance between how much I set aside for myself, how much will go into savings, and how much will go into the student loans.

First of all, I'll have a projected $4000 in my savings account when I graduate (a meager emergency fund I guess) and likely $1000 in my checking account (basically to be used toward misc expenses). I'll have good job security (booming industry, employer is expanding, and I'm holding my breath on another recession), so I think I might forgo bringing my savings up to the 6-month threshold for a little bit to focus on my loans. Here is what I think:

For the first 4 months I want to pay $1500/mo. to the unsubsidized loan, $250/mo. to savings, $250/mo. that I can use wherever. This will pay off the bulk of the loan.

Months 5 and 6 I'll lower the payment to $1000/mo. to loans, $750/mo. to saving, and $250/mo. toward misc expenses. The first month will finish off the unsubsidized loan, the second month will pay off the interest accrued on the loans (hopefully including the grace period interests, but if it's more, I'll take that out of the misc expenses). After the 6 months of saving I should have ~$6500 emergency fund, which, if I were to lose my job at that point, would support my housing and food expenses for 4-5 months.

At this point, since the grace period on these loans has ended, I'll switch back to the original $1500/mo. toward loans with the rest split toward savings and expenses. I'll be able to pay back all loans (with interest) in 14 months. So in two years after graduating, I'll be debt free, maxing out my investment options (401k, Roth IRA), with a decent amount of savings ($10k).

So given all this information (I realize I've written a lot), **is there anything that I've neglected to think of? Something that seems shortsighted or misguided?**

A note about ""misc expenses"" -- this is basically money used toward my cell phone bill ($30/mo., no contract), gas for my car, and eating out/shopping. I spend ~$250/mo. now, in college, so I expect I can follow this.",finance,1386436858

Bitcoin,Wife’s debit card got pwnd and Bitcoin saved the day.,"**Background:** My wife’s credit card stopped scanning, so she was in the process of receiving a new one in the mail.  In the meantime, she had around 1180 dollars in her checking account to use for Christmas shopping and to sustain off of.  She lives in Florida and I live in Japan, I am on an unaccompanied tour in the military, so we do not live together.  We have a two-year-old daughter as well.

**Story:** Somehow her debit card gets skimmed and **no shit** 11 charges appeared on her statement at Wallgreens for 105 dollars each.  **11** and the bank did nothing.  If I spend 60 dollars buying drinks for friends, my card always gets flagged for fraud, but 11 straight charges for 105 goes right through.  Then to make matters even worse, when she calls the bank they tell her it’ll be two weeks before she can get money back “if it is indeed fraud”, but they say it to her like she actually spent the money, her card is then cancelled immediately after the phone conversation.  The next debit card comes in two weeks.  She had no food or gas and a hungry two year old.

**Solution**  I’m woken up after two minutes of sleeping  by a panicked phone call and I tell her to calm down and download a Bitcoin app on her android phone.  I send her some BTC change and get on localbitcoins.com find a reputable dealer’s number give it to her and she sells the coins for cash.  Thanks to Bitcoin I did not have to get out of my underwear for this one and my baby can eat.

TLDR; Christmas Debit Card scammers and Banks suck.  Bitcoins are awesome.


**UPDATE**:Thanks for you all calling me out on my laziness. I got on the phone with the bank and here's what they had to say.  She ordered the card via snail mail which was set to come in 7-14 days from now.  I cancelled that order and asked them to send a new one via Fedex, so it's heading out on the 9th and should be to her within two days.  They then connected me to the fraud department and they confirmed that the charges were flagged as fraudulent and that the card was indeed cancelled.  The card was ran in a Wallgreens in Houston, Texas.  I assumed it was the one down the street from my house in Florida.  They told me it would take 3-5 days to review the charges and that the money would be reimbursed .  I just ran with her story and wanted to celebrate Bitcoins as the quick fix to all of this.  Either way she's good for the next couple of days and the card is getting there much sooner that before.  Any other time I have some drama occur I'll make sure to consult reddit.  You guys are awesome.  3:00 am for me here, so I'm calling it a night.  Thanks for pointing out the obvious actions to take in this situation.

**UPDATE**:On 12/12/2013 the money was refunded.  No women or children were injured or starved during the making of this post.  The only adverse impact was that my wife used the same card to purchase me a Nexus 7 and somehow she was able to place the order, but it later declined.  I’m not really sure how Amazon bills customers, but I will be alright because my Nexus 5 is providing me enough gadget happiness in the meantime.  Thanks again reddit, this was all fixed much faster with your input.

**NEW UPDATE** 12/14/2013 I retain my stance, fuck banks.  They cancelled my card too despite the fact that I have a completely different account from the one that was subject to fraud.  I don’t pull money out until pay day.  I will not have any cash access for at least three weeks.  I can Fedex stuff to my address, but I have a god damn APO address, so regardless it will still take three weeks to get to me, especially during the holiday season and my wife still hasn’t received her card.  SUCK A DICK USAA.  Luckily being in the military I have friendships with people that always stand ready to take bullet for me, so for them spot me cash for a month is not a problem.

Bitcoin,"Satoshi was very smart. Like a good father, he gave Bitcoin the best possible capital environment to develop in.","Since 2009, equities markets around the world have been in full BULL mode due to loose money from the Fed. Along with these markets, Bitcoin has undeniably benefited from all this speculative money these last few years. However, when tapering begins and markets develop significant corrections (most likely next year), our little guy will face a serious question of maturity... and when this happens, it will be the first time in Bitcoin's short life that ""rich"" Uncle Ben stops issuing an allowance.

So the question: Is Bitcoin ready to become a global safe-haven asset? Can it get a job, apartment, and survive on its own?

Personally, I think it's too young. However, I don't think it will die. 

I estimate a few years from now, when this forthcoming crisis blows over, Bitcoin (or the improved future version) will emerge stronger than before; grounded, mature, and ready to dominate global reserves.

To me, exchange rate policy is essential to a country's operations in the global market. The worldwide use of one currency (essentially a worldwide monetary union) that some people talk about seems like a terrible idea, as your country would be at the mercy of completely exogenous factors (see Argentina's hard peg to the dollar). Moreover, deflation would be a huge issue. Deflation hurts countries, as a constantly deflating currency will lead to a constantly increasing interest rate and a decrease in investment (see interest rate parity).

These things are just some of the issues I see, and there are many more.

I started my first real job with a 401k that has 60% match for first 3% and 40% for next 3%. I understand with a company match, i should be highly motivated to do a 401k (at least for the first 6%)

About myself: ~120k income, 110k in student loans (6.5%), $11k in savings. After I set up my 401k, I plan on doing a Vanguard 2050 Roth IRA and aggressively paying off my loans. I plan on retiring around 2050 and am willing to invest my money moderately aggressively and don't plan on taking it out for market dips (for the long gain). Also at this point, I will only be putting in 6% to my company 401k

I was originally going to do the target fund that my company 401k offers (BlackRock LifePath 2040 Portfolio Inv A - LPREX) however I saw that it has a gross expense of 1.41% and a net expense of 1.1% and it is poorly rated on morningstar. I think it would be better if i allocate my funds myself that has a lower percentage rate. 

[This CNN Money Asset Allocation Tool](http://cgi.money.cnn.com/tools/assetallocwizard/assetallocwizard.html) told me I should do 50% large cap, 10% bonds, 20% small cap, 20% foreign stocks which sounds like that's good.

For the small and large caps, i found BGI indices but I am confused about the foreign stock and which bonds to pick. Ive posted this at /r/investing and was told that i should be wary of bonds at this point and also that i may want to look into just the BGI small/mid/large cap indicies at this point since nothing else seems good. Also, is there something better than the Vanguard target 2050 fund I should be doing (since the low interest rates for bonds currently?)

personalfinance,Having trouble deciding how to maximize gains.,"I am 22 years old and about to graduate in May with an engineering degree. I am an ROTC student so I have a full ride and a guaranteed job with the Air Force. I have always had an interest in investing so I got a good start contributing to some mutual funds at a young age. Recently I have been unsure if I am managing my savings right.

Here is my info:

* No debt!
* $13,000 in USAA mutual funds
* $150 in a trading account that I just fool around with... it used to be higher but the fooling around part won.
* $1500 in savings meant for personal use
* $500 in savings that I use to contribute to my mutual funds monthly
* Income comes from summer internship, TA position at the university, and a housing stipend (non taxable). About $6k a year is taxable.
* My monthly income from being a TA and my living stipend minus my room and board (I live in a fraternity where meals are provided Monday-Friday) is about $500. 

Every month I put $100 from my investment savings in to the mutual funds and put 10% of my income in to each of the savings account (20% total being saved).

Thinking about it, I don't really have a plan for what the money in the mutual funds is for. As weird as it sounds I have no idea why I saved $13k dollars other than the fact that I could.

If I want to use it as a start to a retirement account do I just keep investing like I am? Once I go on active duty in the coming months I will start on the Thrift Saving Plan which is like a 401k for federal employees.

What if I want it to be liquid instead so I can use it for something like a payment on a house in the future?

Will it take time for paying these bills off to affect my score? My guess is 30 days?

* I want to actually do 20% down. I plan on getting preapproved as if my current savings would become 10% down, under the presumption that I'd be able to double my savings by the time I close, or at worse make a 15% down payment (the presumption about saving that much is realistic assuming it takes 6 months to put an offer down)
* 2 incomes 2+ years at my job 5+ years at my wifes job.
* We own a condo my wife bought before we were marries. We're underwater on it, but she paid slightly less than I make in a year for it.
* ~10k in car loan debt (3.99% interest).
* Credit card debt will be wiped out by the end of this year (month).
* We plan on renting the condo, but can float two house payments.
* We're net positive net worth. 401ks contain more than we owe on the current mortgage.

Can I get preapproved at multiple banks, or do I have to marry a bank before getting preapproved? Do I just apply everywhere? If I get preapproved at a 10% down payment, will they let me put down 20%? Can I renegotiate a lower interest rate at that point? Anything about my plan seem insane?",finance,1386517464
personalfinance,So Many Directions!! What to Do?!,"OK, I am looking for some advice on how to approach my student loans, car loan, and retirement. I have somewhat of a budget figured out.  I am 24/M with full time job ($74k/YR). I have $1300 in savings. Here is my current situation:


**- Monthly Take Home Pay:**   $3850  


**- Monthly Bills:**

---- *RENT:*  $750

---- *UTILITIES:* $150

---- *INTERNET/TV:* $145

---- *CELL:* $68

---- *INSURANCE:* $192



**- Monthly Budgeted Expenses:**

---- *GAS:* $350

---- *FOOD:* $400

---- *MISC:* $200



**- Debts:**

---- *CAR LOAN:* $13,146 @ 2.24% = $328/mo

---- *SALLIE MAE:* $3184.02 @ 10.12% = $72/mo

---- *FED LOAN A:* $1336.36 @ 4.5%

---- *FED LOAN B:* $3406.65 @ 4.5%

---- *FED LOAN C:* $2137.80 @ 3.4%

---- *FED LOAN D:* $823.27 @ 6.8%  = total A+B+C+D = $80/mo





**Summary:**

Income = $3850

Expenses = $2750

Remain = $1100




**PRIMARY QUESTIONS:**

1) My employer matches up to 5% 401k, however is it matched at 1:1 for the first 3% then 1:2 for the next 2%. This means I need to contribute 7% to get a 5% match. I currently contribute 3% and the employer matches 3%. *How much should I be contributing to my 401k?*


2) Car loan is an interesting situation - I owe $13k+ at only 2.24% **BUT** I fear my car will not last the term of the loan, which is 40 more months at minimum payments  (it is currently at 135k miles and I drive 35k miles a year... three more years would require it to get to 240k miles...). *Should I be paying off my low-rate car loan?*


3) For my student loans, the Sallie Mae one is the worst interest rate. Not sure how to approach this.  *Should I be paying more than minimum on any of my student loans?*


4) I am getting married in April 2014 to someone with $40k+ of debt and currently no income. *Any advice for how to prepare for marrying $40k of student loan debt?*





Sorry for the long post, just trying to be thorough. Any help is appreciated! THANKS

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Considered Harmful,"(Caveats: I am speaking for myself, not my employer.  I am not an economist, but I have studied the subject.)

BITCOIN CONSIDERED HARMFUL

I suspect that if a sizable fraction of the population of a currency region comes to consider Bitcoin a better store of value than the currency region's fiat currency, then there will be negative outcomes.  Since the number of Bitcoins are strictly bounded and gross world product is not, Bitcoin is an inherently deflationary currency.  This is not true of fiat currencies: most central banks aim for low but positive levels of inflation to promote investment.

Anyone who thinks that Bitcoins will probably continue to be used as a medium of exchange in the future should also believe that Bitcoin's value should at least increase with gross world product.  By Gresham's law, such people will tend to hold onto Bitcoins rather than the local fiat currency.

If the returns on Bitcoin investments exceed returns in the stock market or the returns on starting a new business, there will a large disincentive to start new businesses, investment in the future will sag, and recessions will be that much harder to exit.

This should be true for gold as well.  We are lucky in that gold is hard to use for a medium of exchange (there's not enough of it), which reduces its value as a store of value.

I love the idea of a digital currency.   I love the idea easy digital transactions.  I love the idea of sidestepping credit cards and banks.  I love the idea of making it harder for the financial sector to skim billions of dollars off the economy without taking any risk or doing any work[*].  But I don't want to take monetary policy out of the hands of central banks.  I don't want to return to the gold standard.  We can do better.

[*] When banks do do work and make risky loans to businesses and individuals, then they deserve to make a profit from interest.  But taking 2% of every credit card transaction or wire transfer doesn't add value to the economy — it is what an economist would call a rent.",cryptocurrency,1386510919

personalfinance,I think I've been Yoyoed! Please help!,"So I went and got this car Nov 24th. We signed papers for a lease deal. Last week, we slid on ice coming down a mountain and hit a guard rail, but we survived with a cracked bumper. No big deal since I intended to buy the car out after the lease was up. Now I was a bit worried since my payment papers haven't come in this past week. Yesterday (Saturday), I got a call from the dealership saying that my lease deal didn't go through so they have to change it to a loan.

But Oh don't worry about that, you got an extra 2-3K in leases. Also, your payment goes down $15! And your interest rate is just 7%!

But I am not ok with that! 7% on a 30K car is a lot~! I prefer 1.8% lease I had, since I was buying out anyways.

What can I do? They want me to come in tomorrow, on a Sunday, to fill out more paperwork and sign new papers. I don't want 7 years of making payments either. What can I do? I traded in a car I had negative equity on. They changed how much they were going to give me for the car from 10K to 8K. (I owed 11.8K on the car.) Then they said they were ""loaning"" me 5K on top of the 8K owed on the car to make up the difference.

So what can I do? Do I ask for my traded in car back if I don't agree to the terms? What about the damage to the bumper?

What happens from here? I don't want to go in stupidly. I like my new car, but not enough to get screwed over on it. It's a 2014 Kia Sorento. I feel dumb, but I thought it was a done deal!

Edit1: I forgot to mention I was in the finance room, and had already been at the dealership for 4 hours that morning. I was there 4 the previous day. So I wanted to read the whole damn contract thing, and he was like ""Ok, well we will just call you in later, so you can read it in the meantime while we get to the next customer. Or I can just tell you what the contract says."" Dammit, I don't know how I let that slide.

Thank you all for responding! You are helping me a great deal over here! 
 Edit2: I just talked to them. They made a mistake in my paperwork regarding my monthly income. Sucks for them. They said I make 4K a month when Its really around 3.5K. So they took 5k off the price of the car to make the deal go through. I still haven't gone in to sign anything.",finance,1386497637

personalfinance,Is there a more feasible car option?,"The short story: 

My girlfriend's mother purchased a new 2010 sedan about a year and a half ago, which she could not afford. She really went all out...extra options, extended warranty, the whole shabang... Because her folks were juggling some other financial issues, my girlfriend decided to take over the loan and swap cars with her mother (the old car needed to go, but this new replacement wasn't necessary). 

Now...

At the moment, she is paying ~$450 in monthly car payments, which is a pain when lumped together with student loan repayments, rent, and other costs of living. We're by no means struggling, but an extra ~$450 in savings each month would certainly help a young couple that's planning for the future. 

We've discussed some possible alternatives, but I don't know enough about automobile financing to recognize all the options. As far as I understand, there's a bit less than two years left of payments, though the interest rate is pretty great. The caveat is that the car is still in her mother's name. From what I understand, changing the name on the title will lose her the low interest rate, though this will ultimately be necessary before a change can be made. 

Any advice on how to reasonably manage the situation and reduce the financial strain would be greatly appreciated! An exchange for a used car is an option, but affordability and reliability need to be considered.

investing,The price of gold during 2014: Gilded or gelded?,"Hello r/investing, this is Brendan Conway, the ETF columnist at Barron's. I'm a longtime Reddit lurker making my first post. It's good to be here!

I thought I'd share my most recent column on investing in gold, a subject that sparks plenty of disagreement among my colleagues. I put heads together with a few sharp observers on the subject and the argument is this: Even investors who've stuck it out during this year's 26% slump should think about other options. That's because it sure looks like a classic bandwagoner's asset has lost its bandwagoners. I argue gold bulls who insist on sticking it out might end up better served by an even more loathed investment: gold miners. For the rest of us, there's a different rationale presented below: Ditch gold for an asset with a better chance of weathering rising interest rates. Read on to learn what it is.

I'd be most interested in hearing your thoughts.

best regards, Brendan Conway


Gold: Gilded or Gelded?

By BRENDAN CONWAY  

Near the height of gold's 12-year bull market two years ago, Warren Buffett observed something remarkable: The value of all the world's gold could be used to buy all 400 million acres of U.S. cropland, along with the world's most profitable company, ExxonMobil, 16 times over. It was his way of saying gold's value is in the eye of the beholder. After all, gold pays no dividend, has no earnings, and pretty much sits in a vault (or a jewelry box). So you have to look to a brew of investor whims and macroeconomic forces for a price forecast.

Now, gold's value has plummeted, down 26% this year due to fears that the Federal Reserve might slow its bond-buying efforts, and exchange-traded funds have reflected that glum opinion. Investors have pulled $36.4 billion from gold ETFs around the world during 2013 -- that's more than what's currently held in Treasury-bond ETFs. The biggest ETF, the $33 billion SPDR Gold Trust (ticker: GLD), has seen investor outflows every month, leaving its assets under management at less than half of what it had a year ago.

""There are a lot of deer in the headlights right now, trying to figure out what to do,"" says Bob Smith, head of Sage Advisory, an ETF portfolio manager. ""There's probably another wave of panic selling ahead."" Earlier this year, Sage eliminated an 8% gold weighting in one of its key ETF strategies. It replaced the allocation with stocks, and Smith is in no hurry to go back. ""In the absence of calamity, there's not much to go on,"" he says.

Gold investors looking for a substitute should realize the past 12 years were an aberration, says Morningstar analyst Samuel Lee. Theories of currency debasement or nefarious central bankers aside, slow economic growth, easy monetary policy, and a financial crisis all led to big investor demand for gold, while the growing wealth in emerging markets such as China and India led to greater consumer demand. True believers can buy assets linked to gold that are currently offering deeper value -- like the much-loathed mining stocks that burned hedge-fund manager John Paulson. ""Three years ago was not the time to own miners, but now might be the time,"" says Lee. Gold-mining companies, on the whole, overexpanded and failed to hedge gold prices, leading to some steep selloffs that have left many of them with deeply depressed stock valuations. But investing in miners is a bet that those CEOs learned the right lessons and, of course, a bet that gold prices won't drop again. If that's you, Lee recommends the $6.4 billion Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), which is sitting on a three-year annualized loss of 31%.

HERE'S A BETTER IDEA: Admit that your worst-case scenarios about global crises and abject currency debasement never panned out, and shift tactics. Lee argues that investors should move to a different niche altogether -- nonagency mortgage-backed securities. This pummeled asset class is illiquid, and it lacks gold's disaster-insurance allure, creating a recipe for an effective active manager. Its properties are quite different from gold, but it's a way of adapting to rising interest rates, rather than fighting them. The pick here is a closed-end fund, Pimco Dynamic Income (PDI). ""It's an implicit bet on housing prices, and I think housing prices have a lot left in them,"" Lee says.",finance,1386467986

Bitcoin,U.S.A. Quantitative Easing Program - BITCOIN,"Quantitative easing (QE) is an unconventional monetary policy used by central banks to stimulate the economy when standard monetary policy has become ineffective. A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying specified amounts of long term financial assets from commercial banks and other private institutions, thus increasing the monetary base and lowering the yield on those financial assets. This is distinguished from the more usual policy of buying or selling government bonds in order to keep interbank interest rates at a specified target value.

Quantitative easing was first used by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to fight domestic deflation in the early 2000s. According to the Bank of Japan, the central bank adopted quantitative easing (量的金融緩和, ryōteki kin'yū kanwa) on 19 March 2001.
The Bank of Japan had for many years, and as late as February 2001, claimed that ""quantitative easing … is not effective"" and rejected its use for monetary policy. The BOJ had maintained short-term interest rates at close to zero since 1999. With quantitative easing, it flooded commercial banks with excess liquidity to promote private lending (sound familiar?), leaving them with large stocks of excess reserves and therefore little risk of a liquidity shortage. The BOJ accomplished this by buying more government bonds than would be required to set the interest rate to zero. It later also bought asset-backed securities and equities and extended the terms of its commercial paper purchasing operation.
The BOJ increased the commercial bank current account balance from ¥5 trillion to ¥35 trillion (approximately US$300 billion) over a four-year period starting in March 2001. The BOJ also tripled the quantity of long-term Japan government bonds it could purchase on a monthly basis.

The U.S. Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet soon after the global financial crash of 2008. It has since embarked on two more quantitative easing programs and is currently pumping an open-ended $85 billion-a-month into the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have both followed the Fed with asset purchases and low interest rates have been prevalent across the globe in an effort to combat deflation.

Is it too far off to believe that the USA has implemented bitcoin as a new type of quantitative easing program? The mysterious inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, whose name just happens to be Japanese originally wrote his papers with an American dialect. Almost as an afterthought, perhaps realizing his disguise was not perfect, this enigmatic figure then became an anglophile, using spelling such as ""colour"" instead of ""color"".

Satoshi Nakamoto holds a vast amount of bitcoins. If the true intent of the bitcoin is quantitative easing, what better way to reduce the US deficit than by Satoshi cashing in on those coins after the entire planet has been won over and bitcoin prices rise beyond what anyone could imagine?

1st question: When/IF QE eventually does tapper/end, is BND the type of ETF that should see a rise in value?

2nd question: What type of ETFs will rise when QE does end?

To my understand, because bond rates are so low, many people have put their money into stocks. When QE eventually does end (which would be a precursor to raising fed rates), many stocks will take a hit, as people move their money back into more stable fixed rate income bonds. And bond prices will rise.

Bitcoin,"Support WORLD PEACE, not bitcoins... unless you want to lose everything some day?","Bitcoins can all be destroyed with an EMP.. The value of bitcoins is dependent on a common delusion, just like the value of the federal reserve note..  The main reason it will never be accepted as the world's standard currency is that many people will never accept trading things of real value for ones and zeros on a hard drive....  
I know lots of people who want nothing to do with computers..

besides-
Happiness involves social, person to person, interaction.

and I support this argument with a better sollution:

World Peace is an open source currency. The concept of the World Peace is that: ANYONE can and should create currency!
The value of One World Peace depends on the time, energy, and material involved in it's creation--or it's collectibility!
One World Peace is simply a small, durable item with apperent value.

Exchanges are simple person to person trades, based on the barter system, using small, intentionally portable, items of value.. Items created for the purpose of trading.

EVERYONE SHOULD MAKE WORLD PEACE!!

The first Peace were made in 2013 out of wood and steel. The Wood was inlayed in the form of a peace sign, with a steel ring around the border.  They were marked with hand carved stamps ""ONE WORLD PEACE"" and ""TRADE IN PEACE"" as well as custom ink stamps to commemorate the events they were first exchanged at, and the year. The print was then sealed in with wood finish..
You are welcome to expand on that idea in your own creations..

The first One World Peace took about 15 minutes each to make, and the time and energy could be easily seen.  Most were traded for small items. The highest trade value was two Peace in exchange for two record player heads made by Shure, valued at over $80 each..(ebay verified)
Some were sold, most for $5-$10, but one (the last of a series) sold for $20.. overall a very successful project
I expect it will be even more successful in the future.

World Peace can be made by anyone, out of anything. Soon there will be also be One World Peace made from glass, and precious metals, because others were already inspired by the success of the first Peace. 

Any artist capable of making a valuable One World Peace, should do so. This will balance our economy so that the most creative people become the world bank. 

If One World Peace is worth a days wage, it should be something that cannot be replicated without many hours of skilled labor, some very valuable material.. or have a very high collecters demand. The trade value is different for each Peace. Plural for One World Peace, is just Peace...(don't call them peaces)
There is no math in trading Peace, as each one has it's own value, having a good selection and veriety of peace in your possession just allows for easy bartering. This also becomes a common ground for fun social interaction as trading Peace is mutually benificial. Each one is also a conversation Peace.

If World Peace is made by thousands of artists before our current system fails, we can easily continue on with Peace as our currency..

If you want me to use a computer for every interaction..
Than I think you should have your head checked?? 

Make Peace..

Assets in a brokerage account: ~$17,000 left over from a very generous great-grandmother's education fund

Savings: $5,000 in a credit union savings account that yields 4% per year... I don't know how or why they do it, but I'll take it.

I put everything on my credit cards and pay off the balance every month in full. I have a 1% cash back card and just signed up for the Chase Sapphire Preferred.

I contribute the max. match to my 401k (4% now, 6% after a year) and I get health, dental and vision benefits. 

So here's the thing: Is it better to keep my investments in my brokerage account and use my extra money to pay off my loans gradually, or should I sell my investments and pay off my loans immediately? If I expect an 8% return on my investments, is it optimal to keep the investments and the large high-interest loan? Or should I just liquidate my investments and pay off the loans? I'm leaning towards the latter option, but I don't want to get caught with only $5,000 in savings in case something bad happens. Would it be better to pad my savings a little more before making such a big move? My expenses are around $1700 per month, so $5000 is approx. 3 months of expenses readily available. I've also been counting my $17,000 in my brokerage account as emergency fund assets.

I'm currently paying a little extra every month to one of the federal loans, a $2000 unsubsidized Stafford loan with a 6.8% interest rate. I ran the numbers and paying a small amount to that loan ended up being better than paying the same amount extra on the large high interest loan because of the snowball effect. My priority is getting rid of my student loans because I'd love to save an extra few hundred a month. How should I proceed?",finance,1386617233

personalfinance,Need help deciding what to spend $20k on.,"Hi Guys I need some quick advice and I was hoping you might be able to give me some ideas.

My wife and I purchased our first home about 7 months ago, (we bought below our means, yay) and at the time owned 2 cars (owned in full).

We were doing well with saving money, and we are hoping to have our fist kid next year, so we decided to sell one of the cars to help save money on fuel and insurance, and live with 1 car until we can save up some money and buy an SUV. We want an SUV because 2 cars was not really functional for us since we do a lot of outdoor sports with lots of equipment and own 2 dogs.

I have no interest in getting another monthly payment, so I agreed to the plan as long we saved enough to pay for the new (new for us, but used) SUV in full. So we started out trying to save $20k.

Well, now here we are at the $20k mark, and starting to look for a vehicle, when my wife says ""Why don't we pay off our student loans, and get 0% financing on buying a used car from a dealership?""

Well, I guess I never really thought about that.

We currently have combined about ~$22k of student loan debt.

&gt;Current Interest Rate: 5.50 % Floating*

&gt;* The Prime Rate used by the NSLSC is based on the variable reference rates of interest declared by the five largest Canadian financial institutions. The Prime Rate is calculated by ignoring both the highest and the lowest of those five rates and taking the average of the remaining three rates.


So what do you guys think? Would it be smarter to pay off our student loan debt right now? Right now we are spending about $350 a month on loan payments, and there is still 8 years left on the larger loan.",finance,1386613985

solar,Arguing against net-metering is talking out your ass.,"This is in response to the recent [bestof](http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1s4dmh/conservative_group_alec_pushes_stealth_tax_on/cdugcvp?context=3) post attacking net-metering, and all the other posts that have been cropping up attacking net-metering. I know conservatives don't like listening to experts on the subject matter, but the argument below is one that needs to be heard more often. 

In advance, I'd like to tell newcomers that this sub-reddit has fairly even-handed discussion. Those who follow my posts will note that I'll get right in there and attack the solar industry for bad work practices. Over the past week I've been called delusional etc. for defending net-metering, and r/solar has been called a circle jerk for discussing solar-related issues. LOL. That's like calling Home Depot a circle jerk for construction projects.

Look, during the day, commercial energy drives demand on the distribution grid to its peak. You see this reflected in rate structures - commercial energy users get billed demand charges. The reason we don't have demand charges at the residential level is the expense associated with administering the charge. But for most commercial customers, it makes sense for the utility to issue demand meters and administer the billing structure. Peak demand drives grid expansion, which is a significant factor in price increases.

So how much is that peak demand worth? 

Well, let's take an innocuous part of the electric grid, like Mississippi.

I recently got a hold of an electric bill for a manufacturer who pays $80k/month in electricity! Holy Moly!

His demand is $10/kw and his energy rate is ~6.5 cents per kwh. His effective rate is 7.5 cents per kwh. The average rate of electricity for all users in the area is 10 cents per kwh.

So take a 1kW solar array producing electricity in the middle of the day at peak demand. 1kW = $10/kW x 12 months = $120. 1kW x 1.4 Mwh/kW x $65/Mwh =  $90. $210 / 1400 kwh = 15 cents per kwh. This is 50% higher than the average rate, which is what a net-metered customer is compensated at.

In other words, somewhere at 2PM, a net-metered residential solar array is being paid 10 cents per kwh for electricity being sold to a commercial customer for 15 cents per kwh. The grid operator takes that profit. 

This is only because the commercial users who peak the middle of the day are a much larger subset of customers than solar-powered users. But we're talking about 50% of the grid compared to .1% of the grid. Until those numbers are more equitable, net-metering profits the utility.

Now, we can ""privatize"" the grid, by inserting a bunch of middlemen between the generator and the end-user, which makes it harder to realize those values.... but then guess who takes the profit in that situation? Not the consumer! 

If you take a look at Arizona's solar installations, a whopping majority of new array capacity is utility-scale. Utility-scale solar needs to be marked up before being sold to the consumer. Fundamentally, utility-scale solar raises electric prices as compared to residential-scale solar. Attacking net-metering is actually supporting utility-controlled solar, which raises prices.

There are plenty of other arguments that can be made against net-metering. And I think the Arizona fee is a fair compromise - more than fair if they have time-of-day net-metering in that area. But TODNM is a subset of a subset.

Look, you want to attack solar, stick to the 30% Federal tax credit. That full-time credit is well above the 10% energy tax credit many industrial-scale energy projects receive upon occasion. Solar gets similar depreciation benefits as the rest of the energy sector. So the present day federal funding of solar tax credits is subject to debate. That's the smart policy to attack, not net-metering.

Of course, I'd argue that we should subsidize solar a bit more than typical energy projects. If clean coal costs 20% more to capture 60% of emissions compared to regular coal, a 20% additional subsidy for solar to capture 100% of emissions is a heck of a deal. But again, its debatable. Ultimately, the best argument is to throw out the 30% tax credit and institute emission fees. That will appease environmentalists while reducing the need for green energy subsidies. But whatever, we don't build bi-lateral consensus in this country anymore. ~Thanks Obama~

The point is, until solar penetrates the market to the point where it load-shifts peak power on the distribution grid away from 1-3PM, net-metering does not raise electric prices.",energy,1386608852

personalfinance,"Rolling old 401k into new vehicle, thinking backdoor IRA conversion...need advice","So I have ~$12,000 in a former employer's 401k that I am going to move. I'm just trying to figure out where.

I currently am maxing my current 401k and my Roth IRA. I have some debt that I'm on a regular repayment plan with which is all at interest rates between 1.5% and 3%. I completely understand those who suggest not carrying debt, but I'm going to keep making the regular payments at those interest levels.

My personal plans include saving for retirement around age 59 or 61 (depending on if I stay with my current employer or a potential new employer in which I'd stick around another two years to qualify for their pension.)

Since reading up on 401k roll-overs, rolling these funds to a traditional IRA (don't have one at the moment) and then doing a backdoor conversion looked appealing given my retirement saving plans and my anticipated retirement age, but since I'm maxing my Roth, can I still do this? Is there something I'm completely missing?

(In case it matters, my AGI is just above the fully deductible levels for an IRA, but with charitable contributions I might dip right below that.)

Also, this might be a bit off topic, but if I am going to end up with a company with a pension (both are educational companies are on solid footing and endowed generously to continue to exist in the future) should I be cutting back on retirement to focus on investments I might be able to cash out before the retirement penalties would kick in?

 Hello *******

I hope you are doing well. I'm writing you today wanting to talk to you about my mortgage. We have been paying for about 12 years now, and to date we have paid you approximately $480,730.63 in interest, $264,568.11 in principal for a total of $745,298.74 not including the original down payment. At the start of July 2014 we will have approximately 413,990.35 in principal left on our mortgage, &amp; one year until the balloon payment could be due. We have rarely talked over the last few years, but it's come to the point to where we need to have a discussion. I need to know if you would like to continue to hold the mortgage. I have a few options and I'm trying to plan for the worst and hope for the best. 

1. You could call the loan due as per the morgage &amp; I would have to pay the $414k 

2. You could choose to not call in the loan, &amp; I would continue to pay for the next 8 years. 

I would also like to explain to you my options. 

1. I am going to refinance the remaining $414k @ 5% my mortgage payment would be $2700.00 a month

2. If you choose to not call in the loan. I would need to have the interest rate on the remaining $414k lowered to 5%
@ this interest rate you will receive another $96,500.55 in interest on top of the remanning $413k in principal. The total amount that I would have paid on the business will be approximately $1,404,000,00.00

Please let me know what you would like to do.

* My credit is in the high 600s.  Not exactly good, but it's better than it was a few years ago.  
* My understanding is that to qualify for consolidation, my annual salary must be at least the same amount as the loan, which would mean 55K.  Clearly, I don't make that much.

Bitcoin,How do you think BTC will overcome economic issues that affect its adoption as currency?,"I want to start a discussion and hear /r/Bitcoin's ideas and thoughts on how Bitcoin will overcome barriers to be adopted as currency. 

I like Bitcoin. I use it for buying products and as an investment. It's a smart solution to a serious problem, and I believe decentralized cryptocurrencies are the future. 

However, having studied economics, I see 3 main issues that greatly threaten Bitcoin's adoption as a currency worldwide. 

* **Price Stability**: For BTC to be adopted as a currency, people need to have some trust that its price wont change drastically in the future. If I had exchanged my USD$900 to 1 BTC two weeks ago, and then planned to spend it, I would most likely *not* spend it if I had any expectation that the price would go up to USD$1100 a few days later. If I held on to it until it rose to USD$1100 I would've been able to spend my original USD$900, *and* made an extra USD$200. Similarly, as a vendor I wouldn't be likely to take a currency that I'd imagine is going to decrease in value in the future. 

* **Moderate Inflation**: A moderate inflation is a good thing for a currency. It influences unemployment to go down in the short run, and creates incentives for people to spend or invest their money instead of storing it under their mattress. Despite some harmful policies and the power it provides to banks, the US Fed does a pretty decent job at maintaining a moderate inflation. 

* **Market-Share Fragmentation**: Unfortunately, we have some ""whales"" in the BTC market. They have a large proportion of the Bitcoins in circulation, and they represent a danger to the price stability of Bitcoin--they could create mini/large-scale crashes, and booms. We don't know how they might behave, and we'll have to trust them to do what's best for the market.

These issues are correlated and the solution for one can be a solution for the other (e.g. greater market-share fragmentation will achieve better price stability). Some of the solutions will need time (e.g. wider acceptance of BTC stabilizes demand and price). 

I'm not saying that these issues don't have a solution, but they need to be solved before BTC can be realistically adopted as a currency. Until then cryptocurrencies will remain as a cool experiment in the electronic exchange of payments, or a commodity at best. 

How do you think BTC will overcome these barriers? 

**TL;DR: Price stability, and lack of inflation and fragmentation threaten BTC's currency status.**",cryptocurrency,1386695950

personalfinance,Suggestion for paying off an old debt?,"Hey PF, I have an old closed Home Depot account that I originally pulled to do a basement remodel. The intention was to use my credit card to fund the remodel in order to build my then under established credit. The home was foreclosed on but the relative has continued paying the balance down. At the time I was in no position to do anything about the debt, but things have improved and I want this thing gone. So, thank you all for posting what you do and helping me to see the light. It sits at $735 right now at something like 20% APR. Lesson learned.

After I move in February I'll be in a position to help paying it down, but for now I'm thinking about transferring the balance to my Amex Blue Preferred which is paid in full each month to take advantage of the 0% rate. Is this a good idea? How do I go about this? Do I initiate the transfer with Amex or with Citibank? Citibank will not take a card payment over the phone - should I just walk into Home Depot and see what they say?

Now, I will be receiving some $ for xmas. Roughly half is going to pay for credit cards to get the balance even further down. But I would like to invest the other half in a new laptop for work/home. The one I have works, but it's way too heavy to lug around an expo hall and been having screen issues (screen keeps turning on and off). 

I did my research to start saving money for one and saw a pretty good deal on a smaller, faster and lighter ultrabook. And where I work, I might get a discount ontop of that. However, my SO feels that I should really use the other half to paying off my credit cards or the wedding ring she really wants, which is about the same price as the ultrabook.

So what do you think I should throw those funds back at my debt, a wedding ring or laptop used primarily for work?

I will be starting a new job next year with a base salary of 105k, plus between $7500-$13,500 in bonuses guaranteed. Right now, I make about 30k a year so this is a pretty big jump. But, this is also my first real job. There are two issues I have: finding a place to live out of state and what to do with the extra money.

First, should I rent or buy? I'm thinking that I should probably rent until I know the area better, but I want to get comfortable on a house-level budget before I get used to having so much more income. But I do have a funded house-hunting trip and moving expenses covered, so if I have to move again in a couple years I will be eating the moving costs. Second, how much can I reasonably afford per month?  Is it worth renting now to save for a bigger down payment?

Second, I'm not sure how to best utilize all this extra income. I am 28 and don't have any retirement accounts or anything like that (finishing grad school). This job offers 6.65% 401k matching which I fully intend on maxing, but what are the other options? Should I be opening a Roth IRA in addition? How much can I put in that? I could use any general advice honestly. How can I minimize the tax burden on my income (USA)?

Right now, I have about 20k in savings and 20k in other investments and I have pretty good credit (~733). I am single and completely debt-free but I do plan to get married and  that person is probably not going to be as fortunate as me to not have student loans.

Right now, my projected monthly expenses are:
* $580 401k

* $127 medicare

* $543 social security

* $1780 federal &amp; state taxes (based on base income)

* $150 health insurance premiums

* $320 utilities/phone/internet

* $200 groceries 

With a gross pay of 8750 a month, that leaves me still with like $5k per month for rent/mortgage and... what else do I do with it? Am I missing something important?

Two nights ago, me and two of my clan mates were playing COD:Ghosts in Call of Duty.  We did a search for Domination Game type and we were automatically put into a Domination game.   In a few minutes, we realized that the lobby was a hacked lobby.   We could tell because we shot a specific person, our ammo number in our gun would not go down as normal.   We said, ""Hey, is this a hacked lobby?""   And we backed out immediately. 

We dashboarded to see if it would reset everything, opened up the game, and did a search for another game.  That second lobby was hacked as well.  We dashboarded again to get out of it and did a THIRD search, that lobby was also hacked.  Three game searched in a row landed us in hacked lobbies.  The guys name that appeared to be doing it was ""IMODCOD"".   We reported him.   Finally getting fed up with the hacked lobby business in Domination, we switched game types and went over to Kill Confirmed and played a few more games before going to bed.

Today, I went to start up the game and my account is PERMANENTLY BANNED.  I just dropped $600.00 on a new console, own two copies of the game (360 and Xbox One) less than a month ago and now I can not play.  

I spoke to an Activision customer service chat person online just now.  Here is the expert of that conversation (Matthew S. is the customer service guys name):

Matthew S: I understand. We are glad that you chose to reach out to us about the issue you are having. I apologize for the inconvenience that this is causing you but I would be more than happy to assist you in understanding this situation.

Cheating or other behavior that violates the terms of service of the Call of Duty: Black Ops II Security &amp; Enforcement Policy are final and will not be discussed.

You: I am so upset.  I am a hardcore gamer, I play this game religiously, and I do not hack.   At one point in a previous COD (World At War), I was sixth on the leaderboards.  Legitimately.  I was also semi-pro in the same game.  I don't hack.

You: IF you guys check  the playing history...we joined and left numerous games in the Domination lobby because every game we searched and got put into was hacked. How are we being punished for something we have no control over??! Your GAME is HACKED!!  It puts legit players into hacked lobbies when they do a normal game search, and Activision is now banning the legit players right along with the hackers.   Oh my god.  

Matthew S: I understand what you are going through right now, for I am a gamer to like yourself, those lobbies were randomly matched so we cannot really blame Activision for this. This is due to the hackers and modders that are ruining the game. The team is working on this, I apologize for the inconvenience it has brought you.

Matthew S: Since I already provided you all the information I can for this type of issue, I will be disconnecting this chat to assist other customer's who need support. Thanks again for contacting us.

Matthew S: Thanks again for contacting Activision Support. If you have any further need of assistance, please feel free to contact us again. For future updates about the game you may visit our website: www.support.activision.com or log on to https://elite.callofduty.com/ or follow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/ATVIAssist

The developer is the one banning people.""  I then asked to speak to a supervisor.   I was told, ""The supervisor is refusing to talk to you.""  And I was hung up on. 

So basically, their game is hacked and they are banning legit people who just did a search for game and were randomly put into a hacked lobby???

Dear Drew, 


Thank you for your kind words and comments about virtual currencies. It was good to hear from you. 

Non-traditional forms of payment, such as Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, have the potential to revolutionize how we conduct commerce. While there are significant tax, law enforcement, and national security implications of the growing use of virtual currencies, I agree that we should take a measured and thoughtful approach to regulating new technologies and forms of payment. It is my hope that the state and federal governments can work in partnership with consumers and those in the industry to ensure that current money laundering and terrorist-financing laws are respected while policy makers further investigate the issue. Please know that I will keep your thoughts in mind as Congress debates the merits of and considers measures related to virtual currencies.

Thank you for contacting me about taxing credit unions. I appreciate hearing from you. 
The Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 established nonprofit credit unions to make credit available and to promote thrift through a national system. Credit unions generally provide lower fees, higher returns on savings, and more affordable loans to individuals. Additionally, they are exempt from paying federal income tax since the income tax was first instituted because they are ""organized and operated for mutual purposes and without profit."" Should legislation arise that deals with taxing credit unions, the House Ways and Means Committee and House Financial Services Committee will have jurisdiction. Although I do not serve on these Committees, I do not support changing credit unions' intended purpose as nonprofit entities.

I was contacted by my existing mortgage company through one of their subsidiaries. They offered a refinance opportunity called a Same Provider, available under the HARP regulations. 

The representative told me that he could lower my interest rate without the usual credit authorization because they already held the loan. My credit's not great, but I've never been late on a mortgage payment. 

This sounded too good to be true, so I asked some more probing questions. The idea as it was expressed to me was that it's good for the borrower because I can refinance without all the usual hoops, and it's good for the lender because they hold on to a good loan, since I've never been late on a mortgage payment. 

I did some research on the companies and found out that Greenlight is a legit subsidiary of NationStar, who currently holds my mortgage. 

This seems like a great opportunity, because I tried to refinance earlier this year and was turned down because of my credit score. I could really use some insight from you good people. Thanks in advance.

If you’ve been following along, you will see that I normally have roughly $1690 left over each month (I round down to $1600 in my personal budget). We VERY rarely go out and spend a lot of time playing board games with friends/watching Netflix, which is why I have nothing in entertainment. I make my partner save up if he wants to pay for his hobbies (video games, Warhammer 40K) as they can be expensive. I always try and put our monthly extra money towards debt instead, with the order being: 

* The Brick Card
* Partner’s Credit Card
* My Bank LoC
* My Car, and so on and so forth. (I got this order by using the Unbury.Me calculator – which by the way, is super helpful so thank you to whomever posted it originally!!!)

Now onto my questions…
* **Is there any place in our budget you think I could improve upon?** Two other things to note, I guess: My partner will hopefully be receiving a promotion within the next year which should hopefully increase our income by $800/mth (based on projections within his company) AND I really want to start an Emergency Fund. Most specifically, I want an Emergency Fund SOON because someone dinged our car in the back bumper and I’d like to fix that up. ;) My goal for an Emergency Fund is to start putting $1000 away a month (if possible) as of February.

* In regards to the Emergency Fund…I am very blessed with not currently having to pay rent/utilities/internet with my current home situation. My job is a one-year contract position with the possibility to be resigned for two more years, which most likely will happen. **In the meantime, I want to save up as money as possible and grow that money so I can maybe put a down-payment on a house. What kind of account would be best to do this in?** I currently bank with TD and PC Financial, but am possibly closing my TD account (as I mention below).

* One thing that drives me nuts is paying $50 in bank fees monthly!!! This is because I do a lot of transferring back and forth between accounts with my partner and never have the monthly minimum balance of $2500. **I am considering closing my TD account, but wanted to ask…if I do this, am I still going to be able to access my TD Visa and my Line of Credit? Also, is there another way besides Interac eMoneyTransfer for me to pay down my Visa and my Line of Credit from PC to TD, without accruing fees? Like a within-institution transfer or something?**

* My partner currently has his Line of Credit with RBC and a chequing acct and savings acct with PC Financial. I have my TD chequing acct. We also have a PC chequing acct together, which is where the main majority of our joint expenses (cell, car, etc.) come out of. I am currently able to only access the joint account, but my partner can access all three. **Would it make sense for me to open up a separate chequing account with PC and link it, so that we have four accounts in total? Or would it make sense for me to just use the joint as my main account and then funnel the money back to TD (my only two personal expenses) and to our savings account?**

* I am looking into high-interest savings accounts with PC. They currently have one with 1.35% in interest rates. **Does this sound like a good account for me to put our Emergency Fund into? If not, which savings account should we consider?**

* Finally! I eventually want to get into investing, to grow our money even further. I’ve also looked at PC’s portfolios for investing and they seem okay. **Is there a better place for me to invest our money?**

I apologize for the crazy lengthiness of this post. 

**TL;DR: I am a financially-obsessed woman, looking to save my money and pay off my debt as quickly as possible. I have lots of specific questions about the Canadian banking system and would love your thoughts!** 

Edit: So, I spoke to TD Auto Finance about my loan. One positive is that it was for less than I expected, but BIG negative is that it *is* an interest rate of 13.95%. I'm not really sure where to go from here, honestly. I'm going to talk to my partner tonight about selling the car/refinancing, as well as talk to my dad. It's going to be a tough conversation, but I think it needs to happen.

**Edit 2: My partner is on-board with looking at refinancing. He also wants me to ask about consolidating our loans. Based on our current debts, do you think it would make sense to consolidate any of our loans? Or should we look into just re-financing our loan? I honestly know nothing about re-financing, or what to do. He's pretty adamant that he does not want to sell the car, but he definitely thinks re-financing can work.**",finance,1386780101

gaming,Desperate at this point.,"I guess I have to preface this post with a little history. I started my gaming lifestyle around the age of 9-10 with the Runescape beta. This was back when the game was a full world pvp MMO. The only one of it's time aside from Asheron's call. I had the most fun a person could ever have in that game. It was my life. I LOVED it. I truly did. It was amazing. Well, as everyone knows Runescape changed and Wilderness was added. I'm not sure if anyone remembers but it was at that point that the world PVP was removed and it was made into a shitty game. At first wilderness was fine, it was world PVP limited to a zone... then eventually it was dumbed down to level restricted zones and eventually just assimilated to the rest of the sheepy game. So I quit. The next game I got into was half-life. This stage was brief for me, because when I told my friend about how much I loved half-life he was like I play a half-life mod called Counter-Strike. My life was changed. I got so into Counter-Strike that my team won Cal-Main season 8 and went onto be one of the first Cal-Premiere teams ever. (Team afterSHOCK~) for anyone who played during that era 2003-4. Well after a 2 year run of winning a few lans and traveling the country sponsored by a local LAN cafe we ended up disbanding on our way to college. It was at this time that I got into WoW heavily. I'd played on and off since the betas, of which I got a key for due to my close association with the LAN center we played for. Fast forward a year, around this time Blizzard launched their second arena tournament. I'd been running a guild called DRIFT for a long time and they'd disbanded not too long ago. We were one of the first guilds to reach Maiden in Kara just to give people a general idea of the timeline. Well anyway when the second arena tournament was launched I decided to really take it serious and try to qualify for the finals at ESWC. Well my team which was composed of hunter mage warrior called GET EVEN, for anyone who may remember us ended up getting top 10 qualifying for the 3v3!!! Unfortunately due to our age and our parents mainly we were one of the many teams who couldn't fly out to Korea for the finals. After this disappointment and a few patches to warriors which completely crippled the class I got tired of WoW and switched to Halo 3. I'd played Halo on and off since it was released and I had a good friend who competed in local amateur tournaments. Well I no-lifed the game (which I do with every game I really enjoy) and 6 months later I got invited to a team that was going to MLG Dallas. We practied for 3 weeks before the tournament non-stop and we ended up placing 28th/256th!!!! It may not seem like a huge deal but we were on cable television (g4 ran a special for that MLG). After this time period I joined the Army blah blah blah, fast forward a deployment and a year. When I got back I was so ready to game again I could almost taste it. On a whim I checked a game I used to follow more than any other game ever. I anticipated this game more than any other game. Including all the beta's I'd played. This game was called Darkfall. It is without a doubt my greatest game of all time. The favorite game I've ever played. I love it so much. I was one of the best players of all time. Here is my youtube where I published PVP videos of myself playing http://www.youtube.com/user/daakpunk/videos. Unfortunately Darkfall: Unholy Wars was trash and I hated it. 

I guess what I'm asking from /r/gaming is PLEASE guide me to a game that will satisfy my need for competition and pvp!!",technology,1386750681
Bitcoin,"Bitcoin's future as a payment processor is limited by a lack of parallelism in design. I have an idea that could fix this, an idea that is already partially build into the reference client!","Studying the network I've come across what I see as the largest weakness: the singular blockchain. Having a single blockchain introduces a number of problems that I'll outline below.

----Problems----

__Problem 1: chain bloat.__
Bitcoin was designed as a p2p network, but the rapidly growing blockchain is beginning to push out older hardware and low-end PCs. At current rates the idea of running the standard client on your home PC may not be viable in a year or two. Already it is a task relegated to enthusiasts.

__Problem 2: Network stress.__
This problem is a bit further out, but if bitcoin were to handle a large volume of transactions, even high end servers would be choked by the constant influx and re-transmission of transactions. Soon we would even reach limits of the data structure as servers struggled to assemble and build the Merkle tree as new transactions came in. For a corallary, imagine if every server that Visa used shared a mirror of an identical data structure, there's no way they could scale to 10,000 transactions per second. Any sufficiently large network must integrate parallelism as well as redundancy, bitcoin only implements the latter. Some argue that the solution is ""off network"" transactions, but that's like saying that the solution to automobile fatalities is to not drive: of course it works, but it doesn't actually solve the problem.

__Problem 3: Greedy miners and transaction discrimination.__
This problem is a result of problem's 1 and 2 and it is already happening to some extent thanks to Satoshi Dice. Miners can reduce their load by ignoring transactions from ""spammy"" sources like SD, but going into the future it would be straightforward for motivated individuals to modify the client to ignore transactions that don't convey a fee of some magnitude or that don't participate in their arbitrarily selected preferred list. Remember, so long as you have the correct nonce value and all transactions conveyed are valid, your block will be accepted, there is no built-in disincentive to ignore low-fee transactions or any arbitrary transactions.

---Solutions---

__Solution 0: finish the 'passive' default client.__
To solve this problem the network must be parallelized. Ie. it must be possible for the default client to act passively torward a blockchain: pulling specific transactions only when needed, rather than mirroring the entire block chain. This feature is required to implement Solution 1 below.

__Solution 1: decentralize the blockchain.__
Bitcoin already supports multiple networks (ie, namecoin, testnet), just extend this feature to allow networks to run simultaneously. Set a date, say 1 year from now where all clients will need to be compliant and make the split. For starters, a 100-fold increase in the number of blockchains would be nice (although surely this could be extended in the future). Simply split the reward so that the rate of creation of bitcoins stays relatively constant. A peer could actively participate in all 100 chains at once, or it could participate in a subset while pulling transaction info as a light-client from the others. Mining hardware could perform getwork for multiple chains simultaneously. Inter-block transactions have already been designed by the bitcoin core team and building a whitelist into the network would allow the newly expanded set of block chains (or, __block forest__, if you will) to maintain transaction compatibility. The end result would be seamless to the end users since the exact chain a coin is on really doesn't matter, their wallet will reflect balances from all chains simultaneously and ideally inter-block transactions would only need to be performed by financial institutions or individuals wishing to transfer coins to a chain hosted on their server.

__How does this fix greedy miners?__
Well, it doesn't directly. Hopefully distributing this network a little bit will, for a time, alleviate the stress that causes miners to filter transactions in the first place, but this is not guaranteed so long as the network continues to grow. Over time I think we will see market forces come into play and people will learn a fair fee. Furthermore, financial institutions will have incentive to process their own transactions for free, so I could see industries being grown around block management and mining. All if this of course will remain impossible while we are limited to a single block-chain with highly competitive blocks.

__Looking further into the future.__
Lets face it, bitcoins are the new gold. Great for storing value but not really a 'currency' in the sense that they lack stability. But _Bitcoin_ != bitcoins, the Bitcoin protocol, if made extensible could be the basis of all future currency. Imagine if the federal reserve adopted a couple hundred addresses and then pegged the inflation rate through setting the acceptable reward level for blocks and requiring some cut of the first transaction of each block. Anyways this is all very exciting but we need some damn parallelism ASAP.

personalfinance,Paying off a high interest CC with a lower interest CC.,"I have two credit cards (both Wells Fargo visas), and across both of them I have about $3,800 in debt.

At this rate, I'm making a snail's pace at paying off the debt.

I spoke to my father about this, and he suggested that I apply for another credit card with a lower annual interest rate (being sure to read the fine print so as to make sure that it's not just a limited time lowered rate) and then paying off one of the cards with that. I would then cut up the card so as to make sure that I don't use it, and my payments would go to the new card with a lowered interest as opposed to one of my higher interest rate cards.

Bitcoin,letter to matt miller,"Doing it here and open so the community can comment.

--

Matt, I wasn't at first interested in the 12 days of bitcoin series because I expected a lot of noobery and didn't recognize how involved you were getting with the community.  After seeing some of your posts though I checked one out and was/am extremely intrigued; and now, I wait with bated breath for the next one to come out.

What turns out to be the most fascinating to me is your clear change in perception; from skeptical to clearly a bitcoin defender.  It may be early to call you an enthusiast(?) but seeing your visceral reaction and reasonable defenses against the knee-jerk negativity of the other.. do we call them anchors? is A+ entertainment from someone who used to get excited anytime bitcoin was even *mentioned* on the news.

The videos are sadly shorter than I would hope; always seeming to be cut off due to what I assume are network television constraints.  If it's at all within your pull, I highly encourage you to make web-only cuts a la the way the daily show deals with longer-form interviews.

I think your animations are hilariously terrible; but your target audience is not myself (nor most of the people here).

With all the intro out of the way, I want to say:

Wow dude, good fucking job.  I'm extremely impressed with your attitude, the things you say, and your tone with the others you are talking to.

I'd like to see, and would recommend a segment on 'real' bitcoin security.  You talk about how it's untouchable by governemnt, etc.. but how secure is your bitcoin stash.. how much third party risk are you exposed to.. how much third party risk do you *need* to be exposed to in order to use bitcoin.. how does this compare with a fiat bank?  Some bits on cold storage (why not put .1 btc away for retirement?) in paper wallets, electrum seeds, etc..

I'd *really* like to see more of a debate between you and one of the more skeptical hosts.

Something I keep seeing again and again, both in your segments and the media at large is this store-of-value vs means-of-transaction dichotomy.  I think it would serve you well to really grok the fact that bitcoin fundamentally cannot be a means-of-transaction without it being a store of value.  In the same way one of these alt-coins with tiny market caps cannot transmit significant amounts of value over their network without severely affecting exchange rate; bitcoin is limited in its ability to exchange value by it's total market cap.  Consider trying to exchange 15 billion dollars with bitcoin; to acquire/sell that much bitcoin is essentially impossible since it is bigger than the total market cap.  Thus, with a market cap of zero, you are limited to zero ability to transact.  Similarly, transactions in bitcoin are actually limited to a small (uncalculated afaik) fraction of total market cap of bitcoin to be considered useful.

That is not to say that bitcoin needs to be used as a store of value by everyone who wants to transact with it; just that bitcoin is only useful as a transactional mechanism if *someone* is storing value in it.  Conversely, bitcoin as a store of value is directly linked to it's use as a transactional mechanism.  Luckily the world seems to be full of people willing to speculate on / hold bitcoin for those who just want to use it to transmit.

When people say that bitcoin is a commodity and not a currency; logically bitch slap them and remind them that anything that acts like a currency is a currency.  Take a quick peak at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money and remind people that just because **they** don't want to use bitcoin as a currency doesn't mean that when I buy plane tickets / cars / food / drugs / electronics / services / hotel rooms / cocktails; I am not literally using bitcoin as a currency.  If you can spend something to buy something it is a currency; regardless of any old-paradigm-clinging pundit's notion of what the world ought to look like.  

You talk a lot about how the bitcoin community is different than wallstreet is trained to think; with people generously tipping you and others; I think a shout-out to Seans Outpost would be a good thing.. the way he/they have leveraged bitcoin to do insane amounts of good can maybe help some to get this bitcoin=drugs/child-porn/terrorism notion out of people's heads and into reality.  

Talk about remittances; m-pesa loaded with bitcoin as a concrete example, but also the general notion of wellsfargo fees compared with average remittance size; and how bitcoin can compete with that.

Maybe this isn't ready for bloomberg tv, but for yourself, consider the implications of cryptocurrency as an idea for the long term.  Consider the (extremely unfair?) divide that is created by those with access to essentially free federal reserve sourced capital and what it means for the world if the source of money is literally hashing power; what happens to the institutions what make up like 20% of GDP and 40% of all profits if this source of free capital dries up?  What happens to the world's ""have-nots"" if the parasitic version of the ""haves"" have less?

Those who have seen the light see that cryptocurrency (not necessarily bitcoin.. though it appears IMO to be a long-term player) will change the world as dramatically as electricity, combustion engines and the internet.  There are zero signs of decreased adoption; and looked at long term an S-curve adoption is all but imminent.  Do you see it yourself?  Do you see how this idea, a distributed proof of work, guaranteed-fair, block-chain ledger is just too-good and too obvious to EVER go away without something better coming along?  What you are reporting on now will almost certainly go down in history as one of the most fundamental changes in human society.  

That is not to say that fiat currencies will go away soon or ever; but bitcoin is a *new class of thing*; not to be compared as silver vs gold; but apples vs oranges.  Comparing gold to bitcoin or bitcoin to dollars is like comparing a Model-T with a horse-drawn buggy; or a wind-powered mill (windmill) vs AC power in general.  

Importantly, this same argument applies to the deflationary aspect of bitcoin. 

First and foremost, *bitcoin is still inflating*, how this point gets missed by all the nay-sayers (and advocates) is beyond me, but its important to note that over the next year ~1.3 million new bitcoin will be minted; a horrendously large &gt;10% rate of inflation!  

Secondly, and more to the point; every single anti-anti-inflation argument is tied up in the notion that the non-inflating currency is the only available currency.  There is no reason to think that this is, or ever will be, the case; or the goal.  Bitcoin can and will run in parallel with fiat currencies for a long, long time to come.  

And those who argue that people won't spend bitcoin because it's deflating, and is therefore useless.. push them to the logical extreme of the argument... if it's useless isn't it valued at 0?  

Wont it inevitably go to zero?  If it will inevitably go to zero, won't there be a period of time where it is going down in value?  Won't people then be encouraged to spend their bitcoin? 

Why do people buy cellphones *today* at 3x the cost of what they will cost them in 6 months?  

Why do people spend bitcoins *at all*, which they clearly do (100MM through bitpay alone).. if this infallible economic argument is accurate?  Push on them and see what they say.  If a physicist says that ""when i drop a ball it will fall at a certain rate"" and someone drops a ball and it falls at a different rate; the physicist has to change his underlying theory.  When an economist says ""people wont spend bitcoin"", and people actually *do* spend bitcoin, why are they not forced to change *their* underlying theory?",cryptocurrency,1386886873
personalfinance,Food For Thought On Annual Average Returns,"I am a little new here so I apologize if this is a tired topic and/or if I made a mistake here. 

Basically, I've always wondered how reliable those assumed annual average returns of x% EVEN IF you knew you were getting that annual average return of x%. 

I used this site: http://www.1stock1.com/1stock1_139.htm 
to find the Dow Jones returns for the past 35 years (1978-2012). I figured the average annual return to be 9.22% (I'd appreciate it someone would check my numbers on that). 

I then used this site: http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm 

and punched in the numbers of

* Current Principle: 0
* Annual Addition: $5,000
* Years To Grow: 35
* Interest Rate: 9.22%
* Compound: 1
* Make Additions: Start

According to that, I should have $1,238,299 dollars at the end of 35 years. 

I then ran the numbers using those historical Dow returns (-3.15, 4.19...) but randomly shuffled the years in which they happened. So the annual average return would always be 9.22% but the -3.15% year might happen in 1978 or it might happen in 2012 or anywhere in between. Here is what I found (ran it 100,000 times):

* Percent Of The Time I Did As Well Or Better Than $1,238,299: 17.5%
* Average Value Of Account After 35 Years: $1,028,000
* Best Possible Balance: ~$3,900,000
* Worst Possible Balance: ~408,000
* Balance If I Used The Actual Order: $932,330

To be honest I was a little surprised at the variance here. The actual balance is more than $300K short of what an the balance would be if the account did 9.22% a year. Which is about 25% of the value of the account. Ouch. The average account balance for random ordering is a little better than the actual performance, but it is still quite short of the annual 9.22% return. 

Anyway, just thought I would share that here.

Account info:

* Personal loan: current balance $8300, interest rate 14.45%, min monthly repayments **$305**.

* Credit card: current balance $14500, interest rate 13.49%, min monthly repayment 2.5% of balance/approx **$365**.

* Total min repayments **$670/month**. However I can afford to put an **additional $300** towards them, just not sure which one to focus on...

The loan has a fixed repayment amount but a lower balance, so if I focus as much $$ on it as possible, it would be paid off faster than the credit card, but the minimum monthly repayments would not change.

If I focus my money on paying back the credit card, it would take longer to pay off, but the minimum repayment would be reduced each month, as it's a percentage. This may be helpful later, if my income changes and I need to go back to paying just the minimum repayment on each..

Bitcoin,How I like to give people introductory explanations to Bitcoin,"I like to take a dollar bill out of my pocket and say ""it's this!"" emphasizing that it's money. Then I like to say ""and it's this!"" while I hand them the money. If I need to, I will repeat the motion and further clarify that it's at once a payment system and a currency, so that they see my motion depicts a transfer of wealth. Then I can continue my metaphor and point to the Federal Reserve Note text on the bill, while I explain to them Bitcoin's limited supply and immunity to inflation. Then, I point to the mint seal and tell them that people can serve as a Bitcoin mint and simultaneously secure Bitcoin to explain it's decentralized nature. Then I crumple up the bill and say, ""imagine I could throw this bill and have it land in anyone, anywhere in the world's pocket."" Then I slip the bill into my pocket and say ""nobody needs to know I have this dollar"" and start talking about the pseudo-anonymous nature of Bitcoin. If the person is reasonably savvy, I'll get into the nitty-gritty, but I think this serves as a good intro to people and puts it into terms where they already recognize and can relate to the value. I be sure to present the above first--which is Bitcoin's real value--before I tell them of any speculating or mining profit potential--which I consider to just be icing on the cake.

E.x.-  say I am currently investing $500 per month at 5% interest but haven't put anything in yet (balance 0).  Based on compound interest done once a year, it will take me 10 years to reach my 80k savings goal.    
  
BUT I really really want this $500 computer.    
  
In this case it's easy- since I have no balance yet, not putting that $500 in savings means adding one month to my working life (because I save $500 each month).  I am pushing back my retirement by 1 month.  
  
But once you have a balance, or change any of the factors, the compounding interest makes it much harder to figure out.  For example, if I wanted that computer 5 years from now, the compound interest lost is much less, meaning I push back retirement by less.  
  
Anyone know a way to figure this out?  I'm not so good with the maths.  
  
The ability to punch in the numbers and see ""This latte costs 3 hours of your retirement, are you sure you want it?"" would be so helpful for scaling back those impulse purchases.  
  
  
**EDIT I found something similar but in this case we know ""Total"" aka the amount you need to retire, and are looking for n or ""number"" of years.**  
  
Total = [ ( (1 + i)^n ) * PV ] + [ PMT * ( ( (1 + i)^n - 1) / i ) ]  
  
    PV = Present Value  
    PMT = Periodic Payment Amount  
    i = interest rate per period  
    n = number of periods

personalfinance,Pay off loans or save for down payment?,"I'm having a hard time understanding the benefits of either option and was hoping you guys could help give me some more context.

The details:

Loans total $32,000, from:

$16k @ 6.8% (Federal Student Loan)

$5k @ 3.4% (Federal Student Loan)

$11k @ 3% (Car Loan)

We have $12k in an emergency fund (3 months of typical spending) and $5k cash-on-hand.  We make about $1,200/month more than we spend, including the minimum loan payments, and have been putting all the extra towards the 6.8% loan.  Even with this we realize it will take almost 3 years to pay off the loans and at the end of it we will have nothing saved towards a house.  

Rent is very high in the SF Bay Area (we pay almost $2k for a 1-bedroom) and we are starting a family in the next year.  The cheapest houses are in the $500k range, so while I would love to put 20% down I know 10% is a more likely goal.  So we would need at least $50k, and if we saved for a house over paying down the loans we could have this in about 3 years.

I know I will save in the long run by paying down the loans, but if you asked me whether I would rather be debt free or in a house in three years, I would pick the house.  

So PF are you going to tell me to make minimum payments and go for my dreams, or buckle down and pay off the debt before I take the next step?",finance,1386824488

personalfinance,Retirement/Investment strategy... please critique!,"I currently make $8625 per month. I recently renegotiated my contract and in November of 2014, I will jump up to 10,400 a month with a guaranteed 5% increase for the following 5 years. 

Currently, I maximize my 401k at $1458 per month which is pre-tax. Insurance and parking are also taken out pre-ax. This leaves me with roughly $4450 a month after Federal and State income taxes and FICA. 

My company also has a very generous profit sharing plan that is 15% of gross salary. 

Finally, I contribute the maximum Roth IRA contribution I can, typically in January to maximize my return.  

These three together allow me to sock away roughly $38,000 into some form of retirement accounts, but I can't help but feel like I should/could be doing more. 

Currently the Profit Sharing Account has roughly $143,000 in it, the 401k has $40,000 in it and the Roth has $26,000 in it. 

What can I do to further limit my tax burden and sock away more money for the future?

I have no credit card or student loan debt left. That leaves me with a 15 year mortgage at 3.25% that comes in at roughly $1550 a month, a 48 month car loan at 2.34% that comes in at $315 a month, and a boat loan at 4.79% that comes in at $383 a month that also provides an interest tax deduction as it qualifies as a second home. 

Currently, I have accounts structured is such a way that I immediately place $500 into an emergency account at the beginning of every month and at the end of the month, any money I have left in my primary checking account is also swept into the emergency account. 

With the additional income in 2014, I'll start socking it away to get the Boat paid off and then my guess is continue to invest it independently.

personalfinance,Paycheck after-tax reimbursement/withholding help,"Hi /r/personalfinance! I'm doing a year-end review of my whole financial picture, and I could use some help on a few issues, starting with this one:

* Stats: age 24, single, great job security and potential for growth
* Base salary for most of 2013: $46,200 (recently raised to $54,400 + $5,000 bonus)
* Reimbursement for individual health insurance: $3,600/yr ($0 w/h, no FICA tax)
* Currently contributing 5% to Roth 401k ($10k balance)
* Employer contributes 3% to 401k as Safe Harbor contribution 
* Other 2013 contributions: $1,000 to IRA and $1,000 to Roth IRA

With the way that my reimbursement is setup, my employer is not withholding any taxes on the $3,600/yr. We've set it up this way on purpose because we each save the 6% on FICA. I have no other deductions over and above the standard deduction. I ran a tax projection and in April and I will owe ~$800 in Federal tax and some amount of state tax (7%).

I have enough in cash to pay the tax due, but I would rather put the money away for myself instead of paying the Feds. My solution for 2013 is to contribute another $3,500 to my IRA to take my additional tax owed to $0.

Is this a reasonable solution? At my age and relatively low tax bracket, I'd hate to put too much away in a Trad. IRA instead of taking advantage of the Roth. Should I just suck it up, pay the tax, and contribute the balance to the Roth?

Going forward, would it be a better idea to change my W-4 to have my employer withhold 25% Fed and 7% state on the reimbursement?

&gt; http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/12/casascius/

Combine this with:

&gt; Any person, whether or not licensed or required to be licensed, who engages as a business in accepting currency, or funds denominated in currency, and transmits the currency or funds, or **the value of the currency or funds, by any means** through a financial agency or institution, a Federal Reserve Bank or other facility of one or more Federal Reserve Banks, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or both, or an electronic funds transfer network

&gt; 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(5)(i)(A) http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1010.100

Now the reasoning here is that someone buying a Casascius bitcoin and having it shipped to some address may put Mike Caldwell in the position of ""Transmitting value"" from one person to another.  After all, how can you prove the person paying is exactly the same as the person that ends up receiving the coin through the mail?

Jennifer Shasky Calvery, Director of FinCEN said in her testimony several times that FinCEN doesn't need to know if Bitcoin is a currency or a commodity or something else.  That the fact that it has value is enough for them to regulate Bitcoin.

So if we are going to use their logic consistently, eBay without question must register as a Money Transmitting service.  They clearly and unambiguously act as a facilitating third party in the exchange ""value"" between individuals and/or entities.

Do they comply with all Know Your Customer (KYC) processes?  Does Amazon?  Does NewEgg?  

What about Walmart?  When someone pays for a product at even the brick and mortar store, how can Walmart be sure that the person carrying out the product was exactly the same person that paid?

How can anyone exchange anything of ""value"" without complying fully by registering as Money Transmitters and collecting and filing full KYC reports with the government?

In this Christmas season, Financial crime and the transmission of value between parties without full KYC reports is literally out of control...

personalfinance,Potential for FICO Score Improvement?,"So throughout most of my 20s, I was incredibly irresponsible and totally wrecked my credit. Now, thankfully, most of that bad debt has dropped off. I'm currently working on rebuilding my credit. I opened a Fingerhut account (ripoff pricing, I know, but it has done a lot for me so far), and after a few months of on-time, over-the-minimum payments, I have been able to secure three new credit cards for the first time in years. I am going to use these just as I use cash, and pay them off in full, every month. I had applied for a Discover card, and on that pull, I had a FICO score of 633 (up from ~595 in July).

Here's my question -- I am planning on moving out of state to the New England area in about 16 months, and want to work hard on my credit so I don't have to worry about being able to secure housing/getting a job. My goal is to get my FICO score up to 700 at least, but I have some unpaid medical bills in collections that are about 3 years old at this point. So 1) is it likely I can get my credit up to a 700 in that time frame if I'm religiously paying my credit card bills and keeping my credit utilization very low (~5%); and 2) would it be better if I tried to arrange a payment plan for the medical bills or let them age off? I'm currently in my final year of undergrad, and I don't really have the money to pay those bills, and I will have to start paying my federal loans soon. 

I want to be realistic about what I can achieve, but I also want to be pretty aggressive about getting my finances in order. My assumption is that it would be better to take care of my credit cards and student loans first, since they have a flawless payment history, and let the medical debt age off.

personalfinance,Pay off car at 2.5% or invest somewhere?,"Hi PersonalFinance. I have a bit of a quandary and would like an outside opinion:

I bought a rather expensive used car a few weeks ago with the intention of paying for it in cash. To make things easier, I decided to pick up a loan and pay it off when I got the first statement. Dealer quoted me 4.9% which seemed fine to me, I'd pay a few $ for convenience and pick it up on the first bill. 

Anyway, I just got the bill and I've managed to get 2.59% at a credit union. I am about ready to just pay it off in full, but was wondering if maybe at that rate it would be worth it to keep some of the cash liquid. My credit union offers 2% as long as I do 30 transactions/mo (which I do), so I'm out at worst .59% for the liquidity, or I could invest and probably make money. Even if I pay in full, I would still have a 4-5 month buffer. I make enough that I could theoretically invest the entire value of the car, make the monthly payments, still max my Roth/401k, and not really change my quality of life.

So the question is: do I just pay it off and get it done with? Or should I invest the cash and make payments at the low interest rate?",finance,1386902464

Right, in the example above, wouldn't the holder of that bond profit more than 12% by selling the bond today rather than holding it maturity?  Also, in a 0% interest world, where it's less likely that interest rates will fall further, shouldn't all bond holders sell their bonds rather than hold on to them?

Also, would the discount/premium of any t-bond (in a perfectly liquid market) that matures in 1 year have a yield equal to a 1 year treasury issued today?

Weekly USDCHF chart: 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/gCBWSz4U/
 
Daily DXY chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/FQvZqrjS/

What I'm looking for is a bearish turn in CHF. The weekly CHFJPY chart is closing in on a big 127% Fib extension at the same time the weekly USDCHF chart is hitting a 38% retracement at the same time the US Dollar index is making a bullish turn. The stars may be aligning. Or I just might be crazy.

My idea is that the USD bullishness will turn USDCHF higher off of its Fib level, which will cause CHFJPY to reverse at/near its 127% extension on the back of CHF weakness. Below .88 and the USDCHF trade is invalidated, and I would be willing to give the CHFJPY ~60 pips of wiggle room without letting it get too out of control. 

The biggest threat to the CHFJPY trade is the major strength of USDJPY, which is keeping the yen weak across all JPY crosses and may very well cause the pair to disregard any resistance levels. However, with DXY looking as bullish as it is, the long USDCHF trade should work out nicely, along with USD longs in other pairs.

We're also traveling back east for the holidays and while plane tickets are already purchased and most meals will likely be free, it's going to be an expensive month.

Bitcoin,Why I believe the dollar is actually more volatile than Bitcoin,"EDIT :- Maybe my choice of words was not appropriate. I think what I wanted to say was ""Why I believe the dollar is actually more *virtual* than Bitcoin"" but I ended up using the word volatile... I've edited my post replacing volatile with virtual. Also, added link at end to what got me thinking in the first place.

Bernanke was asked to define the dollar in 2009 by the House Budget Committee (I probably have the name of the committee mixed up, maybe it was the Banking Committee). He refused to answer but on being pressed repeatedly, he said ""The dollar is defined as the basket of commodities that you can buy with it"".

a.) That's a stupid ass definition and if that doesn't convince you that the dollar is imaginary/virtual, I don't know what will. e.g., since Starbucks sells a small coffee for 3$, that means a dollar is literally defined as one third of a small starbucks coffee. So what happens if starbucks raises prices to 4$? Does the coffee change? No! The dollar changes! Now the dollar is defined as 1/4th of a small starbucks coffee.

In fact, this also means that any time anyone changes any dollar-based price of any good/service, then the dollar itself changes fundamentally! So a dollar today is just not the same as a dollar tomorrow because somewhere someone has changed the price of a good/service meaning that ""the basket of goods/services you can buy with it"" has changed!

b.) This was not always the case. Back in day (before the 1930s) the dollar was defined as a certain amount of gold. So the dollar itself did not change from day to day. Gold is real and tangible. I can hold it, see it, taste it, bang it against something and hear it.

For anybody who is confusing the non-interest bearing federal reserve demand notes with dollars themselves, they are not. The notes (colloquially called as ""dollar bills"") entitle you to receive the dollar if you hand the note over to the government with the dollar being defined as a certain amount of gold.

Now, the dollar is simply defined as the basket of goods that you can buy with it! What that basically means is that you've taken all of the volatility in the dollar out of the definition of the dollar precisely because you can't even define the dollar exactly at any given point of time and the damn thing keeps changing every few seconds (assuming that someone somewhere on the earth is changing their dollar-price every few seconds)

c.) And then they say that bitcoin is *virtual* (edit from volatile)! At the very least I can define what a bitcoin is exactly, verify that it exists and the bitcoin itself won't change from day to day. And if I print it out, I can even hold it, see it and smell it.

So there ya go. That's my argument for why the dollar is more *virtual* (edit from volatile) than the bitcoin... 

**(EDIT) tl&amp;dr** :- Comparing the exchange rate of bitcoins and dollars is meaningless because the definition of the dollar itself changes from time to time (a dollar is defined as the basket of goods/services you can buy with it).

It's probably more meaningful to compare BTC/gold or some other constant commodity to compare the volatility of bitcoins.

Bitcoin,Is anyone in r/bitcoin interested in working to overthrow/abolish the tyrant federal governments instead of complying with them? Upvote if you are!,"I'm surprised there isn't more conversation about the possibilities of the political consequences of digital decentralized currencies. Large bitcoin related companies such as the major exchanges and those like bitpay have to comply with federal governments and regulations at least at the beginning for bitcoin to go mainstream and have the masses adopt cryptocurrencies, but I'm surprised there isn't more talk about the political possibilities that decentralized currencies can provide.  

I certainly can't be the only person that thinks that my federal government (U.S in my case) adds absolutely no value to my life. It's absurd to think that just because you were born in a certain geographical location you have to identify yourself with the ruling overlords. We live in a sort of caste system where we are born into a nation by default and die as citizens of that nation

I envision a system where we can change nationalities and instead of them being geographically based we are connected online with people that we can identify with. If you don't like your government you can change just like a job. We need to create a system where local municipal governments are empowered. We can live in a society where people of all nationalities based on those created and connected to online can live in a single city.

Countries should be created just like our decentralized digital currencies so that people that share similar ideas can create their own laws and decide how they want to regulate and govern themselves. I truly believe in order for mankind to continue evolving these overreaching, geographically based governments have to go and it's now possible with digital decentralized currencies.",cryptocurrency,1387009728

Currently, I maximize my 401k at $1458 per month which is pre-tax. Insurance and parking are also taken out pre-ax. This leaves me with roughly $4450 a month after Federal and State income taxes and FICA. 

My company also has a very generous profit sharing plan that is 15% of gross salary. 

Finally, I contribute the maximum Roth IRA contribution I can, typically in January to maximize my return.  

These three together allow me to sock away roughly $38,000 into some form of retirement accounts, but I can't help but feel like I should/could be doing more. 

Currently the Profit Sharing Account has roughly $143,000 in it, the 401k has $40,000 in it and the Roth has $26,000 in it. 

What can I do to further limit my tax burden and sock away more money for the future?

I have no credit card or student loan debt left. That leaves me with a 15 year mortgage at 3.25% that comes in at roughly $1550 a month, a 48 month car loan at 2.34% that comes in at $315 a month, and a boat loan at 4.79% that comes in at $383 a month that also provides an interest tax deduction as it qualifies as a second home. 

Currently, I have accounts structured is such a way that I immediately place $500 into an emergency account at the beginning of every month and at the end of the month, any money I have left in my primary checking account is also swept into the emergency account. 

With the additional income in 2014, I'll start socking it away to get the Boat paid off and then my guess is continue to invest it independently.

energy,Sen. Tom Coburn introduces bill to end corn ethanol mandate,"NewsOK
by Chris Casteel Published: December 12, 2013

WASHINGTON — Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Muskogee, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, introduced a bill Thursday to end the federal mandate requiring a certain amount of corn ethanol be blended in U.S. gasoline.

The bill has eight other cosponsors, mostly Republicans.

“The time to end the corn ethanol mandate has arrived,” Coburn said.

“This misguided policy has cost taxpayers billions of dollars, increased fuel prices and made our food more expensive. Eliminating this mandate will let market forces, rather than political and parochial forces, determine how to diversify fuel supplies in an ever-changing marketplace. I’m grateful my colleagues on both sides on the aisle are prepared to take this long-overdue step to protect consumers and taxpayers from artificially high fuel and food prices.”

The Renewable Fuels Standard requires increasing levels each year of biofuels be blended into gasoline refined in the United States. Most of the requirement —about 16 billion gallons this year— is met with corn ethanol, blended at 10 percent of the mix.

However, refiners have been nearing a “blend wall,” where the requirement is forcing them to use more than 10 percent of ethanol, despite warnings from some car makers and small engine makers.

The Environmental Protection Agency recently delayed a scheduled increase in the mandate.

Feinstein said, “I am pleased to join Senator Coburn and others on a bill to eliminate the federal corn ethanol mandate from the Renewable Fuel Standard, while maintaining provisions designed to grow the low-carbon biofuel industry. For more of the article use the link---&gt;",energy,1387076711
personalfinance,Looking at getting another credit card. (x-post from r/CRedit),"I posted this in r/CRedit before realizing that sub was pretty dead...  Hopefully this sub is the right place to look for advice on this because it is clearly much more active!


I'll start off with some background on my credit / finances.


I recently got a Discover card and they were nice enough to include a copy of my credit score along with my new cards.  According to Experian my score is currently 739.

I am the sole breadwinner for a family of four, income ~90k yearly.


A brief summary of my credit history:

* I have a Visa Credit Card that I got through my bank shortly after my 18th birthday.  ~12 years ago.  Paid in full every month.  Had a few late payments about 7 years ago, but otherwise no problems.
* Had two auto loans back to back (traded in the first vehicle to get the 2nd, was *not* underwater on my first, just needed a different vehicle).  Loans were 3 year term loans.  No late payments at any time.  Loans have been paid off in full.  2nd Loan was paid off early as I sold the vehicle to a private party and bought a vehicle I could afford outright with cash.
* Got married, added my wife to my visa credit card.  She had absolutely no credit history.  Apparently somehow this gave her a better credit score than me at the time. (lol, wat???)
* Bought a house 2.5 years ago.  Financed 175,000 on an FHA loan.  Made one late payment in the first year because I messed up my autopay in online banking.  Trying to chip away at this by putting an additional $80/month towards the principle with each payment.  Current balance is around ~162k.
* Got an American Express card in my name 2 years ago, with my wife as an authorized user.  I made 1 late payment (1 day late) due to negligence on my part last year.  Promptly set up an auto-pay.  Paid in full every month.
* About 1 year ago I got a 0% interest for 18/mo Visa card in my name, with my wife as an authorized user, to finance the renovation of our swimming pool.  ($7500)
* I have taken an increasing interest in ""cashback rewards"" shopping, and that is why I got the Discover card I mentioned in the beginning of my post.  Again in my name with my wife as an authorized user.  The Discover card also has a 0% promotional interest rate on purchases and balance transfers (no fee) for 12 months, so I transferred the remaining balance from the 0% Visa card onto the Discover (about $3500 remaining)


So what I'd like to do is get a different Visa card with a better reward program, probably a Chase freedom card.  I have a couple questions about the best way to do this.

* If I applied for this card right now and was accepted, that would bring me to 3 active Visa cards, that seems like massive overkill.  Can I safely cancel the 0% Visa Card we got for the pool renovation without incurring too bad of a credit hit?  Or I should I just leave the card alone and not use it?  There is no annual fee for the card so that's not an issue.
* Do I really need to keep the Visa card I have through my bank?  I've heard in the past that it's good to keep a card that you've had for a long time, and in this case I've had the card for about 12 years.  We virtually never use this card as it is, just for purchases where we can't use Amex or Discover (surprisingly fewer situations than I would have thought).
* If we do get a better rewards Visa or Mastercard, should we instead get it in my Wife's name with me as an authorized user?  I guess in some cases the fact that she is an authorized user on all of these other cards isn't doing anything for *her* score?
* Are there any other good tips I could benefit from to improve our credit score(s)?


I think that's it.

investing,"Couple of high yield dividend companies that interest me, your guys' thoughts?","PSEC - Prospect National Corporation (just under 12% a year, paid monthly). About as consistent as it gets (since march 2009, the stock has never been below 8/share, and stays around the high 10s/low 11s. Even during the worst of the recession it was still around 7 dollars). Solid diversity in its business (entering real estate now, which seems to be coming back a little). I read that they could actually benefit from the fed raising interest rates, which also intrigues me.

WIN - Winstream Holdings (a little over 12% a year, 8/share and divi is paid every 3 months). This one im a bit newer on. Was as high as 13/share about 2 years ago, but has fallen to 8 now. Has been very stable at 8 though, being around this share price all year now. Has paid a 25 cent dividend every quarter since 2006, which is pretty damn good. The short interest for this company is pretty high though, which is a major turn off.

By putting almost 50% of our income into student loans, we were able to pay off $21,000 in student loans (including interest) this year! We only have $3800 left, which the interest rate is .5% less than our mortgage.

I'm certain they have to convert to fiat before ordering textiles, thread, sewing needles, sewing machines, dyes, etc. If an upcoming electronics company wants to accept bitcoin, they'll still need to purchase metals, plastics, computers, chips, etc.

If raw materials industries begin accepting Bitcoin, then businesses will have an easier time accepting Bitcoin because they'll have somewhere to move it. This is why they need to convert to fiat. Why would they need to if they could buy with bitcoin? Money doesn't exist to hold onto, it exists to trade and facilitate trade.

Bitcoin,Ten Reasons Why Banks and Governments Can't Win A Messaging Campaign Against Bitcoin,"Here are ten reasons why banks and governments can't win a messaging campaign against Bitcoin: 

1) The GOP has campaigned on the devaluation of the dollar and End The Fed for years now. How do they reverse course now without losing the Libertarians in an election year? 

2) Many of the wealthiest and most successful individuals and corporations in the world routinely stash their cash overseas to avoid paying taxes, while the banks are popularly perceived to engage in money laundering, rate-fixing, price-fixing, and real estate fraud. ""It can be used for money laundering!"" is hardly a winning battle cry. 

3) The Russians just had their money stolen by European technocrats. The notion of Brussels taking steps to guarantee the sanctity of deposits is a ridiculous proposition for most Southern Europeans at this point.

4) The word “terrorism” elicits a universal eye-roll from anyone under the age of 35, and many older people as well.

5) The maximum amount of money that a Chinese national is allowed to take off the mainland is $3,500. There's over $3 Trillion that would like to have another option besides the casinos in Macau to wash their money.

6) Indians have been crushed by inflation for most of their adult lives. The majority consider Delhi to be little more than a den of thieves and the government's policies to be an unmitigated disaster. 

7) A decisive majority of Europeans now regret joining the euro, and I have yet to meet anyone who would raise their voice in defense of the European Central Bank. 

8) At $7.25 an hour, the minimum wage in the U.S. lags nearly every other developed country in a world. Par the national average, an hour's pay at minimum wage translates into a single pack of cigarettes or a little over two gallons of gas. No one is going to picket for the Dollar. 

9) Cockroaches are currently more popular than the U.S. Congress. 

10) The notion of “compassionate banking” is undermined every time a customer pays a $30 overdraft fee/NSF fee for a candy bar. 

TL;DR: Neither banks or governments currently possess the credibility to attack Bitcoin through the media due to their previous bad behavior, ergo they're attempting to strangle it with regulations in its crib. The Bitcoin community should engage the media by switching to a personal liberties narrative.",cryptocurrency,1387227026

State tax is ~7.5%. So, -$7,500

Other random 'routine' things. Things like a hair cut, soap, air filters, paper products, etc.. Are about $1,000 per year. So, -$1,000

$18,000

And I am, possibly incorrectly, using the term disposable income as: I could literally flush $18,000 down the drain and still keep the government happy, myself fed, and in my home/job.



So at this point I don't know if there are any other sizable things I have missed.

Bitcoin,Why you shouldn't lose sleep over the Satoshi shares,"It has been proposed on this subreddit, the main bitcoin forum, and subsequently in various news sources that the top 1000 bitcoin owners who own roughly 50% of all bitcoins pose a grave risk to the small bitcoin investors. According to these economists we are all “price takers” if we buy since a high net worth individual can crash the market with relative ease.

Lets for a moment ignore the obvious fact that only an idiot would sell over 1000 bitcoins during a single day, rather, a rational investor would need to sell them over time to maximize profit and minimize impact on the market. Lets instead assume that the owner of the Satoshi coins is malicious.

Would the sale of these shares crash the market? Probably yes, for a minute prices might reach below 50 or even below 1 USD. But the market would react incredibly quickly. Probably no human would see the price drop below 50 and it wouldn't surprise me if prices recovered to 40-70 percent of the previous maximum within a day. So clearly they could crash the market, sort of, but their impact would be muted by bullish investors. Furthermore it is entirely reasonable to expect a year or two of growth would erase any losses and lead to a more stable more distributed market (or maybe a decade of growth if this event happens to a more mature bitcoin market)

This contrasts central bank monetary policy in that it can happen a finite number of times (basically, count the number of accounts with over 50,000 bitcoins) whereas central bank policy can kill currencies a hundred times over with no check against their impact other than self-interested politicians.

I'm a typical post grad without a job who has student loan and credit card debt.
I have some bitcoin, and was hoping to use it to make purchases, but unfortunately the bills have come due.
I will need to use all of my bitcoin to make payments, but I really would like to avoid withdrawing the money and paying my bills in Federal Reserve Notes.
Does anyone here know of any ways in which I can spend my bitcoin to make these payments? All of the banks that hold my debt are ""big banks"" so I am hoping maybe there is a third party out there that has a system in place that works with these banks.

personalfinance,"Getting married, what to do about zombie debts?","My fiancee and I are getting married in July, and we were recently doing some planning and going over our finances. I have a few questions:

I have no debt, and am currently a full-time grad student making a $25k annual stipend. I intend to graduate in the next 2 years, and the median starting salary for someone with my degree at my level of education is ~$75k with room for future growth.

She makes $50k at her full-time job, and is working on a 3-year professional certification through her work that will substantially increase her earning potential (it commands a median salary of ~$125k). She currently has about $45k in student loans, making the minimum IBR payments on them for the time being. I'm not overly concerned about this, as, while challenging now, they seem manageable in the long run. 

The one concern I do have is that about 5 years ago, she made some young and rebellious decisions that resulted in a credit card debt of about $2500. She ignored it, and told the subsequent collectors to cease all communication. We looked at her creditkarma profile recently, and it turns out there is a court judgement from 2011 on there.

What does this mean? Is she really on the hook for for the $2500 plus whatever loanshark interest rates are attached to it? Is there a way to clear it for a lower cost since the original creditor wrote it off long ago for a fraction of the principal? Are my assets fair game if they go after her?

We have enough cash saved up that we can clear the principal or a lower settled amount, but if interest has been accruing at what I imagine is a nonsensically high rate, things are trickier. How do we proceed?

As an aside, I'm not looking for an editorial on our relationship or on the moral hazards of ignoring debts. The debt was an unfortunate mistake made long ago, and we want to clear it up as painlessly as possible and move on. All constructive advice is welcome.",finance,1387311578
personalfinance,"Got a job just out of school, trying to determine how much I should put in the 401k?","I'm a 22 year old gal who just got my first real-world job as a marine engineer. I make $50k/yr with great earning potential (my boss is pretty awesome). Currently, I've been working for 6 months and now qualify at my company for their 401k plans. I'm not well versed on the subject at all and have been trying to make sense of all the documents that have been thrown at me. While I am still in the process of figuring out what/where I want to put my money into, I am also debating how much I should be contributing?

My employer matches 50% up to 10% contributions. I'm assuming I should be going with that amount. But I have also tossed up the idea of starting out at 7-8% and upping it every year as I continue to get salary raises. However everyone I've talked to, aside from coworkers, have been trying to talk me out of it. My parents said people usually put 2-4% into their 401ks, which I know is by far not nearly enough. They think I won't be able to handle it financially, so I figured I'd see what you guys had to say about it.

Each month I bring in about $4160 ($3150 after taxes). I also get an extra $500/month for health insurance compensation (I am still on the parent's policy, rather than getting my own, so it's not costing me anything at the moment unless I go to the doctor - all copays/deductibles I incur I'm responsible for, especially bc I make more money than either parent. I just stash away that money every month). I have a lot of debt from student loans, albeit at a low interest rate, due to my family not being able to contribute at all to my education other than cosigning loans, which I am responsible for paying. Everything I have I have worked for since I was 16. I am young and single, so my monthly expenses aren't really that high. Here's a breakdown:

* rent - $500
* food -$200
* gas - $120-150 (usually closer to $120)
* car insurance - $80 (I own a 2002 Hyundai Accent I bought at 17, 161k miles on it now and it's on it's last year probably)
* utilities - $100 or less (it varies month to month and includes basic cable and interwebs)
* gym - $10
* student loans - $878
* cell phone - $60
* restaurants - $100
* bars/alcohol - $15-30
* other random expenses - $200 or less (again, it varies month to month)

**Total** ~ $2200/month

I try as hard as I can to stick to this budget each month, except Nov. &amp; Dec when I had to buy Christmas presents and bday present for the boyfriend. I have around $10500 in savings (I took a trip and bought a snowboard and a few other little luxuries I couldn't have before - otherwise I'd have more), and some in a checking account. I started out of school with almost nothing, $1500 in savings, because I was living paycheck to paycheck while in school, working just enough to pay the bills without sacrificing my grades. I have a credit card that I earn points on that I pay off the balance entirely each month, usually just put food, gas, restaurant and alcohol purchases on it.

I also have some goals I have for the next few years:

* CAR! I will need a car by the end of next year more than likely. Hyundai right now has a really attractive financing offer at 0% up to 72 months. I'm looking at buying a new Elantra GT for pretty cheap (relatively speaking for new cars) and putting $3500 down on it. But that's an entire other discussion. By doing that, the dealer and I figured I can keep my monthly payments under $200 and my car insurance will increase to $230/month (sigh - I'll miss that $80).
* HOUSE! I want a house before I'm 30. I know a lot of you will tell me to pay off those student loans ASAP, but by doing that I will have a small savings account by the time I'm 30. Saving for a house is more important to me than paying off those damn loans - it's not really a financial burden, it's just annoying as hell bc of my personal opinions about education costs.
* TRAVEL- Basically, I want to enjoy my 20's before I settle down, have kids, etc. The bf (who is also an engineer) feels the same way - we are currently planning a 10 day trip to Germany, staying with friends, for the end of April. I won't take more than one trip a year, except maybe little weekend  away camping close to where we live, and have a yearly budget I have in mind for that. &lt;$2k

SO I my question is, can I do that 10% without worry? And still be able to save a decent amount? While taking into consideration the costs of getting that new car in the nearish future? I figured out that after all is said and done I can save around $700/month with my current salary (which will go up every year supposedly) if I buy the new car next month and be strict with my budgets. Obviously much more if I don't. Is that a good amount for someone my age?? I want to set myself up well for retirement, even though I'm young and it's 40+ years away.

MachineLearning,Found a map through learning Data Science. HELP NEEDED.,"Hello everyone.  I recently discovered the world of data science and wish to self-educate myself.  I have found a lot of open-source materiel on various subjects but I needed a sort of curriculum to guide me.  I found this...
http://nirvacana.com/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/RoadToDataScientist1.png

It is a map of the steps progressing through the study of data science created by Swami Chandrasekaran.  
the general link is here
http://nirvacana.com/thoughts/becoming-a-data-scientist/

I am so thankful someone had the time and the kindness to create something like this to the completely lost individuals entering this field.

I have determined this is a great place for me to start.  

One problem...
not every individual point on this guide should be equally prioritized when it come to the depth of understanding in the subject matter.  

My study habits and personality, when unchecked, will fully engulf my time in the subject matter until I either have maximum understanding of the subject or informed that a maximum understanding is not necessary and a general understanding is more than adequate to fulfill the end goal.

In this case, the end goal is to have the knowledge to contribute in the world of Data Science under my own resources, and a secondary goal of furthering a career in Data Science where I would be compensated for my work in the field.

I would like help prioritizing the contents on this road map to achieve that end goal.

There are 2 criteria to be considered.

1.  The level of Importance -- Low to High
       This is a judgement of the synergistic qualities of the subject matter.  Example: How important is Fundamental Linear Algebra to the understanding of all the other subjects in the Data Science Tree? (I would presume HIGH since it is in the Fundamental Chapter)

2.  The level of understanding -- 0% - 100%
        This is how much of the subject matter must I fully understand and be able to apply.  Example: Linear Algebra - am I fine with just the fundamentals (about 40%) or should I learn all the way up to Pseudoinverses (about 90+%)?

These assessments can be applied simple to the Chapters on the map, Chapters 1-10.  More preferably, I am hoping for these assessment criteria to be applied to each individual point on the map.

My Apologies for the length, but I believe in being specific.  This, hopefully will help other entry level students of Data Science learn on their own and still be contributors in the field.  The transparency of information is paramount in the success of this field, and for the success of our species in general.

Thank You",technology,1387301039
Bitcoin,My Theory: The U.S. will use Bitcoin to it's advantage. Please read!,"Hi all,

It is my theory and belief that the US knows what it's doing with Bitcoin, and will use it to it's advantage.

There are a few things to look at:

1. The US budget ""deal"" is in talks now in regards to getting passed. It is an ABSOLUTE joke, aiming to cut a mere 23$ Billion over 10 YEARS. Think about that for a second.

2. Taking the above into consideration, this is finally going to get momentum moving in regards to the world not taking the US seriously when it comes to finances (if they don't already)

3. The Fed, by next year, will effectively own nearly HALF of US Treasuries. Do NOT disregard this, it is a complete disaster. Nobody wants our treasuries on the scale the US desires.

4. The 10 Year Treasury is nearly past the 3% mark. This is the most important number in the world. The Fed and US is STUCK. If they taper, rates will shoot up. If they stop tapering, the markets/economy goes to shit as well. They are STUCK. A mere doubling of this rate to 6% would mean the interest payments on US debt alone will be about $1 Trillion a YEAR.

This is the end game, friends, and the US knows this. This is why they've been warm to Bitcoin. They know they need every competitive advantage. They're not just sitting on the sidelines saying ""Oh gee golly, I sure hope that this dang there Bitcoin thang don't get too big. We'll keep watching it and after ""x"" amount of stores accept it, or the market cap becomes ""x"", then we'll fight it to the death.""

The US knows it's fucked. They know the East has all the Gold. They know Bitcoin is revolutionary. 

This is the end game friends, the next two years are going to SUCK. It's mathematics, just like Bitcoin.

They will use Bitcoin to try for an economic advantage (compared to some countries who fight it) because they know it's one of their only options.",cryptocurrency,1387297102

personalfinance,Paying off Debt vs Saving for an asset,"Hi guys,

Made a few mistakes along the way however there is only one that I wish for some advice on.

I currently owe about $42,000 on a car worth $35,000 - stupid depreciation. I pay an interest rate of 10% which is based entirely on what is owed (Ie I pay less interest as I pay off more of the loan).

THIS BEING SAID; I cannot save for Sh*T and have thus taken out a Government assisted bank savings scheme called a First Home Saver Account - this account LOCKS any money I save away and it can ONLY be withdrawn to put as a down payment on a property (or else it goes into Super - money accessible for when you are retired - im aussie btw).

I put $6k into this account each year to claim the Govs bonus $1400 contribution - and this account normally generated approx 5% interest. I have put in the necessary 6k for this year and am curious as to whether i should KEEP putting my excess money into this account (where I cannot touch it no matter what), or into paying off my car ASAP and thus reducing the amount of money i pay to other people.

IT should be clear cut - yeah pay off debt asap, then save for a house - only loan should be your house; but I am way too impulsive. This debt is whats stopping me trading my car away on other things, trying to up or downgrade or making any other stupid decisions.

Whats your advice on this? Should i keep paying interest (and putting money aside where I cannot touch it) or should I attempt to grow up and pay off my loan (and just put the minimum into this savings account to attract the biggest gov bonus each year).

- as an edit - I have recently been curious about trading my car in on a $28,000 car which is on a 0.9% payment deal.... this car would be awesome - but I would only get about $32,000 for my car as a trade in leaving me $10,000 out of pocket (which i can sell my motorbike to cover). Would i be financially better off taking this deal (assuming both cars are going to depreciate at 10% each year)?

Some additional notes:

**Fields with ""No Data""**: I continually refine my data recording. Back then I didn't have as much detail and these categories were lumped with others.

**Credit Cards**: Got a new card without foreign transaction fees for our vacation. From that card, got about $600 worth of hotel nights that don't show up under ""misc"" (but rather as a reduction in the vacation cost). Also recently started a new card with an annual fee for which we haven't yet got the sign-up bonus.

**Refinance**: We bought our home with a loan at 4% with 15% down. We had been paying down the loan aggressively to eliminate PMI, but when rates went down even further we refinanced and the appraisal came in way higher than we expected (15% appreciation in 6 months). We refinanced at 3.5%, eliminated PMI, and did a cash-out refi to stock the IRAs and pay off a lot of student loans. I had said that I would never do a cash-out refi, but since we weren't cashing out for more consumption (instead, we funded retirement and paid off student loans for a higher return) I didn't feel bad about it.

**IRAs**: Only one of us has a retirement plan available at work (actually, 3 retirement plans - pension, 401k, 457), and therefore can't deduct traditional IRA contributions due to our income. The other has no retirement plan and so contributes to a Traditional IRA. We failed to contribute in 2012 due to our home purchase, but contributed a lot in 2013.

**Home expenses**: In 2012, we spent a good amount on the new house, just on new house stuff (not to mention the downpayment).

**Phone**: Have been on Virgin Mobile with a dumbphone ($7/mo grandfathered from a very old plan) and a smartphone ($25 Beyond Talk, also grandfathered at old rate). Ordered a medium-dumbphone from Tracfone, expect costs for that one to be about $8/mo, and will drop the smartphone.

**Vacation**: Wife wanted to take a particular trip before we have kids.

**General thoughts**: Transportation is expensive. We're lucky to have generous employer-paid health plans. I'm worried about the cost of health insurance when my wife quits work (when we have a kid she's going to stay home for a few years).

##Net Worth Graph
Pretty picture to close out the data.

http://imgur.com/wZhiJmh

Our rate of increase has been slipping. It used to be at $200/day, but my memory is fuzzy and I suspect that was driven primarily by the home equity rise. Still, I feel like with as much money as we make now, compared to earlier, we should see more of a knee in that curve. I'm not sure why we don't, but I haven't really looked at it yet.

Priority for 2014 is to have a kid and switch to a single income.

My question: We are set to save an additional $24k for retirement in 2014. This will put us close to $100k in retirement savings at the age of 28 (neglecting market swings). Is it crazy to expect that this will meet all of our retirement needs starting at the age of 65? I've run a FIRE calculation at CFireSim and it hasn't failed. It's especially promising when including social security (at 2/3 of today's payout) and a pension (at $500/mo). I ask this because I really would like to think that whatever we save on top of it pushes retirement closer. Estimated CoL is $40k ($33k base plus buffer).",finance,1387253025
Bitcoin,My tale of unsuccessfully obtaining some Bitcoin,"So I'm trying to get a small amount of Bitcoin to complete a purchase but everywhere I turn I run into problems.

* First attempt - https://localbitcoins.com/

Initially very promising, slick website, built in escrow system, lots of people selling in my local currency.

Outcome: people charging outrageous prices, minimum purchase amounts and in no way convenient. To get the best rates I need to purchase at least double what I want, go into a physical bank and make a cash deposit over the counter or go meet some random person. Reminds me of the bad old days of eBay before Paypal where scams were everywhere. Pass.

* Second attempt: MtGox

Logged in, despite sending my verification details a month ago my account is still not verified and I'm stuffed. Noticed the exchange rate is getting low too.

* Third attempt: OKPAY

Initially also promising as a lot of people seem to use it here on /r/bitcoin. Sadly has the same type of verification process as MtGox that could take any amount of time and all the payment methods to get funds in are covered in warnings such as: 

""In accordance with AML policy and requirements of W1 payment system, subsequent transfer of the funds to e-currency exchangers are prohibited. In case of non compliance with the policy account may be blocked until further investigation.""

""ATTENTION: Due to the card issuer bank restrictions it is prohibited to pay for the OKPAY Card order and top-up by using the funds received from crypto-currency deposit or exchange.""

Yeah that's not really filling me with confidence.

* Fourth attempt: Coinbase

Hey this looks slick at least and they verify fairly quickly into an account that I can do stuff with. Their recent VC also gives me confidence. But to get funds in I have to link a bank account. Okay but I'm not one to trust my main savings account to such an activity which means I'll have to go down to my bank and open a new account up. Convenience factor just went way down and I'm not going to achieve my goal today with Coinbase.

* Fifth attempt: do some research.

So I stumbled upon a few websites:

http://www.weusecoins.com/en/getting-started 

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_Bitcoins_%28the_noob_version%29

etc..

Most of this information is either inaccurate or the websites they list have scam written all over them. Combine that will all the recent posts about scams, failed transfers, banks cracking down etc and I have to wonder why anyone bothers with cryptocurrencies aside from the recent hype.

The goal by the way was to purchase a game off someone. A transaction I can complete right now with any game shop dealing with USD in minutes. Two hours later and I'm still no closer to changing my cash into Bitcoin to make the transaction :(

I get why those who believe in Bitcoin do so, in many ways it reminds me of the Open Source/Free Software movement and if they do achieve their goals one day the world will be a better place. But the machine is never going to let this stuff fly beyond that of a hobby and I'm certain we are going to see tails of people getting seriously burnt in the next few months when the hype dies down and the man cracks down.

Can anyone point me to a serious, legitimate and convenient service to obtain Bitcoin that does not run a risk of simply losing my money without recourse before I get Bitcoin in my wallet? Something better then raise a ticket that may/may not get looked at anytime soon and may/may not result in a refund. All I seem to run into are scams and doom/gloom.

Edit: for those wondering, I'm outside the US. A large part of the problem seems to be the verification process, the reasonably (market) priced services all require verification and all have taken or take far to long to verify. The amount of info required is also concerning, I understand why they need it however the average joe who has heard about internet scams is very likely to be put off because of it.

What I believe is needed is a service not unlike Paypal. Fast and efficient, minimal info required, instant gratification and no need to get off my ass. I personally don't see the difference between spending a couple of hundred dollars online via Paypal vs any of these services despite how dodgy some of them appear.",cryptocurrency,1387251292
CryptoCurrency,Central Bank / Government Kansas City Shuffle? Tell me I'm an idiot.,"I actually posted this as comments to a couple people in random other threads, but the more I think about it, the more I really want to hear that I'm just a paranoid idiot.  
  
This is my theory and darkest nightmare:  
  
**TL;DR; Banks buy coins and make us rich, Governments switch to Bitcoin and leave us holding fiat.  Central Banks close Mints, open data centers and take control of the blockchain.  checkmate, return to status quo.**
    
Government let enough bitcoins spread out in to the hands of people who see them as speculative assets, or don't know what they are. By auditing the blockchain they can see the distribution of wealth in wallets, and combined with other surveillance technology, they can figure out when the wealth has spread to enough weak hands (speculators).  
  
The Big Banks then step in and drive the price out Bitcoin of the solar system. Everyone will think it's a big bubble and the sell off from those speculative holders will be over 95% since everyone will think they just hit the lottery and will assume they can just buy back in cheap when the crash comes after.  
  
The massive dump of fiat on everyone and the sudden reduction in Bitcoin supply coincides with a drop in the value of the USD and another economic that requires the immediate attention of Governments. BTC price remains high as Big Banks hold their coins and people desperately try to buy anything that might hold value.  
  
The Governments will acknowledge the failure of the fiat currency system and hail the ""beginning"" of the digital currency age with the signing of the Digital Currency Act of 2016, reinventing the Fed and the US Mint as the arbiters of the Bitcoin universal currency and outlawing all digital currencies in order as threats to economic stability (basically just put them in the same category as counterfeits).  
  
Massive server farms for the Fed will come online and connect to the Bitcoin network adding 50% more computing power instantly.  The other central banks around the world will follow suit, giving central banks control of more than 51% of the computing power of the network and full control of the blockchain.

With the Big Bank deposits of all the Bitcoins it purchased earlier and Central Bank computing power sufficient to ensure they will always be mining a majority of coins for the remainder of the mining period they, will be free to manipulate the money supply and the world will return to the current status quo.  
  
  
I genuinely hope someone here will call me an idiot and give really good economic/political/technological reasons why this couldn't work or ever happen.",cryptocurrency,1387250525

personalfinance,Paying Off Student Debt- Advice Please,"So today marked a depressing day in my life. I paid my first payment on my student loans. I currently have $26,872 in debt. The total amount of debt consist of multiple loans with different interest rates with the highest interest rate being 6.8%. My question is should I put all my efforts towards paying off this debt as soon as possible and forego contributing towards a retirement fund or just pay the minimum amount and continue to invest? Odds are I will make more money off the stock market than 6.8% so that is my reasoning. I currently make $60,000 and I have $7500 in my checking account and I was considering opening a vanguard fund soon. I also have $18,000 in company stock that will vest over the next 4 years every 6 months I will get 12.5% of that total $18,000. I was considering using that stock money to help pay the loans off some but I wasn't sure if that is a good idea or not either.

news,International Newport Group: Fremtidige valuta eller eiendel boble? Bitcoin kritikere komme høyere,"Når forbeholdt cyber geeks eller dodgy handelsmenn, virtuell valuta bitcoin kan nå ikke bare brukes til å kjøpe varer online men også betale for en grad ved Universitetet i Oslo.

Ennå kan nyvunne populariteten til valutaen, som var verdt nesten ingenting til April 2011 og som nå handler på rundt $1000, godt være dens angre.

Markedet overvåkere og regulatorer er oddsen over hvordan bitcoin skal håndteres, men som valuta gevinst prominence, stemme Advarsel mot bruken får høyere.

Frankrikes sentralbanken har slo det som ""svært spekulativ"" mens Kinas sa det ikke bør brukes som en valuta og utestengt bredden fra å tilby tjenester og produkter relatert til bitcoin.

EUs bank vaktbikkje også utstedt en advarsel til digital valutaen brukere, fortelle dem: ""Du bør være fullt klar over og forstår deres spesielle egenskaper"".

Selv om Federal Reserve sjef Ben Bernanke sa slike virtuelle valutaer ""hold langsiktige løfte"", kunne hans forgjenger Alan Greenspan ikke gi en iboende verdien til valuta.

Lansert i 2009 som oppfinnelsen av en mystisk datamaskin guru som går under pseudonymet Satoshi Nakamoto, er bitcoins skapt gjennom en komplisert matematisk formel.

I motsetning til hard valuta, er det ikke støttet opp av landets økonomisk aktivitet eller utstedt av en.

Bitcoins offisielle nettsted sa «alt som kreves for et skjema for å holde verdi er tillit og adopsjon».

""Når det gjelder Bitcoin, dette kan måles ved sin voksende base av brukere, selgere og startups. Som med alle valuta, bitcoin's verdi kommer bare og direkte fra folk villig til å akseptere dem som betaling,""sagt det.

Med rundt 12 millioner bitcoins i sirkulasjon i øyeblikket, børsverdi står på ca $10.57 milliarder. Formelen som brukes til å opprette den begrenser dens omløpet på 21 millioner bitcoins.

Tyskland besluttet å legalisere hverken det som valuta, så å kunne skatt, mens Bank of America's Merrill Lynch enhet spioneringen det som en betydelig verktøy for e-handel.

Tross alt, kan den digital valutaen overføres direkte mellom smartphones eller andre typer datamaskiner.

Men reiser dette også spørsmål at det ville bli brukt for kriminelle eller terrorister.

""Svært spekulativ"" valuta utgjør ""viss økonomisk risiko""

I September, valutaen kom under søkelyset etter amerikanske myndigheter nedlegge en website alarmert Silkeveien der narkotika og andre illegale varer ble handlet med bitcoins. Noen $3,6 millioner verdt bitcoins beslaglagt deretter.

Men den negative publisiteten førte også valutaen til seg oppmerksomheten til den virkelige verden.

Individuelle investorer interessert, hekta av eksempler som en norsk ung mann, som kjøpte $24 verdt av bitcoins fire år siden bare å innse at de er nå verdt $690,000 tilsvarende.

Kina ble den største markedet for valuta som investorer tiltrekkes til den over soaring verdien.

Men den kinesiske sentralbanken har flyttet å slå ned på det, utstede en sterk advarsel og innføre restriksjoner på hvordan de omsettes i landet.

""Bitcoin er en bestemt virtuell vare, ikke har samme juridiske status som valuta og ikke og bør ikke være sirkulert og på markedet som sådan, sa People's Bank of China (sentralbank) i en uttalelse i fellesskap med andre finansielle regulatorer.

Kinesisk banker og andre finansielle organisasjoner er utestengt fra å gi bitcoin-relaterte tjenester og produkter, sagt det.

Det kalles for forbedret kontroll av online trading plattformer for bitcoins å forsvare seg mot muligheten for hvitvasking og påpekt investeringsrisiko møtt av publikum.

Sentralbanken i Frankrike understreket også samme risiko, cautioning at ""svært spekulativ"" valutaen utgjør en ""viss økonomisk risiko"" for brukere.

""Selv om høy volatilitet i bitcoin av mulig interesse for personlige eller profesjonelle spekulanter, de bør være klar over risikoen de tar,"" sa banken.

Videre advart konverteringsmulighet av bitcoin ikke er tilgjengelig, og en investor kan ikke hans investeringer, det.

Sentralbanken bemerket at hvis en valuta som skal brukes som en modus for betaling, bør det oppfylle reglene mot hvitvasking av penger og dens garanti plattform bør overvåkes av sentralbanken i Frankrike.

Likevel banken har ingen oversikt over bitcoin, og oppfordret i stedet for å hindre at den virtuelle valutaen blir brukt i ulovlig transaksjoner.

Det pekte også på at sikkerheten for virtuelle treasuries for valutaen ikke er garantert med noen autoritet.

Sist onsdag, anerkjent et dansk selskap som spesialiserer seg på bitcoin betalinger at hackere hadde gjort unna med 1295 bitcoins verdt om lag en million dollar.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin isn't a commodity OR a currency -- it's both,"It's really interesting reading the news and the naysayers. First off, I find it interesting that all of the mainstream media outlets are reporting on this crash. The fact that they're reporting on the crash is more important than the crash itself. The value of bitcoin fluctuates wildly, and has from the beginning, in terms of percentage. Just because its now a big number of dollars doesn't mean that a swing of 50% is any larger or smaller, and the fact that its being reported on as if it were legitimate gives it legitimacy in itself.

Secondly, and more to the point of my title here, there are quite a few people criticizing bitcoin. Some people are calling it an ""unregulated currency"" (http://inthecapital.streetwise.co/2013/12/18/is-this-the-start-of-a-bitcoin-meltdown-or-just-a-rough-patch/) and other people are saying that its a commodity and deserves commodity prices (http://www.businessinsider.com/williams-bitcoin-meltdown-10-2013-12) (please note that while this guy is referred to as a ""Finance Professor"" in the headline, he's actually an ex-employee of the Fed).

So the arguments go against bitcoin, and some are valid. Some say that bitcoin will never be a currency or replace the USD, because, for one, retail transactions take place too quickly to get the confirmations from the blockchain. This is a criticism coming against a false consumption -- mainly that we expect bitcoin to be used in the checkout line at supermarkets.

Bitcoin isn't a currency, and I don't think bitcoin is intending to replace the USD in all the ways that the USD works. Bitcoins strength lies in that it is a hybrid. Its a store of wealth like a commodity (gold, silver, etc) however it is highly liquid and easily transferrable anywhere in the globe (like a currency, except even more transferrable than most currencies).

I think that criticism is good, and it allows us to see our faults. Its good to look at what enemies and opponents of bitcoin say. Its good to understand that we have problems with volatility, although I don't think this is volatility for volatility's sake, its volatility because it is growing and the world doesn't know what to do.

We didn't drop 50% on ""bad news"". We dropped 50% on China de-facto disallowing bitcoin trading. If China overnight stopped accepting the US Dollar, I think we'd see some ""volatility"" in the US Dollar as well.

Anyway, the news isn't good. I agree. And I sold all of my bitcoins the night before at $880 by luck, so I'm not sitting here praying for it to go back up because I lost money.

Anyway, I hope this helps clarify some of the issues and is a good response to some of the criticisms of bitcoin. Basically anyone who says Bitcoin won't be successful because its not a good currency, or anyone who says Bitcoin won't be successful because its not a good commodity is missing the point.",cryptocurrency,1387404166

Also put in a new battery this year, tires are newerish as well.  The car is worth somewhere between 2-3k on Edmunds.




I purchased the car in 2006 (it had about 30k miles on it and I believe it was owned by a rental car company).  I financed it then and my payments were $266/month for a 5 or 6 year loan (would have to check), but it has been paid off for over a year.  I have consistently maintained the car with oil changes and any work to keep it in proper running condition, but I wonder how much more I could end up spending on top of 2-3k repairs since it is going on 9 years old with 160k miles on it.  There are also some small issues with the car from general wear and tear, she's no spring chicken, but the driving has generally been very good.




**My finances**
I work full time and earn about $42k before taxes, my bi-weekly paycheck is generally around $1088 (so about $2176/ month) and that is after medical and 401k contributions.

I have around 8k in savings with some additional funds in checking that is usually in flux around 1-2k.  I have about 8k in my 401k.  I have a life insurance policy that I could cash out if I wanted to at a value around $2800-3k.  I also have around $500 in Canadian cash at my house.  My father recently passed away and there are some funds that will be split between my siblings, but he left antique items that will need to be sold/auctioned so I really don't have an idea of what I may or may not receive.



**Regular Expenses**

*Rent - $400, currently live with SO who owns the house, but not married.

*Phone - $45

*Internet - $22

*Utilities - vary by month and I don't get the direct bills, guessing it's probably $50-100 (winter higher) averaged
*Auto insurance - I just got my renewal which is up in January for my current car, it's about $700 for the year with high coverage for liability, but no replacement if I were to total my car.  Obviously with a newer car this would go up.

*Gas - $160-200, I commute to work about 23 miles each way on the freeway in California

*Dental - I paid for the year, but company is changing plan so that may be $38 out of my check per month if I decide to take the new type of coverage

*Life insurance is once every three months for $33

*Charity - $24 with some other donations here and there

*Student loans - I pay $250, the required payment is $193, there is about $8300 left on the loan, very low interest at a couple percent.

* Food - it's important to me and I eat well so I spend a good amount here.  We don't eat out all the time, I do all the cooking, but it includes a lot of fresh produce as well as organic items.  Because these expenses are split with spouse I'd have to really sit down to get the exact amount, but it's probably $300-400ish for groceries and eating out, maybe more (I do live in the Bay Area in California, so expect highish living expenses).  Maybe this is a high estimate, I will have to look closer to really know.




Obviously there are miscellaneous expenses as well such as gifts, travel, emergencies etc.  As you can see from these numbers I do have room to afford a payment, but obviously it would give me less savings opportunity and there would be interest if I were to do a loan.



My credit is okay, ranging from the 650-700ish (Credit Karma is currently 681) depending on which bureau it's from, but I have a major ding which is a bankruptcy from a couple years ago after a failed business venture.  I have been working to rebuild my score and currently have about 16k in available credit limits on credit cards (pay off cards every month).  In some ways having a revolving loan would be good for helping to rebuild my credit more, but I would also probably be subject to offers with higher interest rates and I'm still on the fence about having a payment versus getting a cheaper car option.




I'm 30 so at some point I would like kids in the general near future, so this would be something else to take into account.  




I'd probably want to stick with a sedan style vehicle if I get something, I would like it if I could do a hybrid, but that's not a must at this point and I understand that it will add to the cost.





So what would you do in my situation, pay for repairs, get an older car cheaper car, get a newer and potentially more reliable car?  Transportation is important to me because I also drive a few hours regularly to visit family in another city and for longer trips as well as commuting daily.  THANKS!",finance,1387402743

Bitcoin,"(Serious) Just so you all know, what happened today is the exact reason why we left the gold standard and formed a federal reserve to stabilize currency.","Just saying. 

Edit: Reading comments. Wow. You all understand very little about global finances. Good luck with the bitcoins. 

Typing on my cellphone at work so i'll have to keep this short. Central banks (such as the federal reserve) are formed so to prevent panic runs and sell offs at banks. What happens is a bank run starts and then everyone goes to the bank to pull out their money. But the bank has loaned out a large portion of that money to other businesses (thats how banks work) and so they only have a portion of their reserves on hand. There is a law that requires them to keep a certain minimum ammount on hand. Since people realize that not everyone will be able to pull their money out, the intensifies and becomes a self fulfilling prophecy, and the people at the end of the line are screwed. The market collapses. See history. That's why a central bank which can print as much money as it wants is so essential. Because it allows the banks that are being run on to give back the full ammount since they are backed by the central bank. This reducing the panic and stabilizing the currency. 

I strongly suggest you all read some hisory books before you invest your savings in a wildly volatile currency.",cryptocurrency,1387392819

economy,"Offerte tablet, le migliori sono quelle con inclusa la tariffa internet","Per avere un tablet top di gamma a Natale è possibile sfruttare le offerte in abbonamento che includono il device con una tariffa internet mobile.
A Natale, per avere un tablet top di gamma a prezzi convenienti, la cosa migliore da fare è comparare le migliori offerte di telefonia (http://telefonia.supermoney.eu/) e scegliere fra le proposte più vantaggiose delle compagnie che includono il device in un pacchetto tariffario per internet mobile.
A dirlo è l’ultima ricerca dell’Osservatorio SuperMoney, unico portale italiano accreditato dall'Agcom per il confronto delle tariffe di telefono e internet (http://telefonia.supermoney.eu/voce-e-internet-adsl/) , che ha comparato i piani tariffari delle compagnie per trovare il pacchetto più vantaggioso con incluso nell’offerta per internet mobile anche il tablet iPad Air di Apple o il Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.
I prezzi di listino di questi due tablet top di gamma, infatti, oggi sono ancora alti e i pacchetti in abbonamento di Tim, Wind o Vodafone, sono una buona soluzione per spalmare i costi su un contratto che prevede il pagamento in 24 o 30 mensilità. Per avere il tablet iPad Air o Galaxy Tab 3 incluso nel piano tariffario di internet mobile, in ogni caso, queste sono le migliori offerte.
Si parte necessariamente dalle tariffe con incluso il Galaxy Tab 3, il tablet più economico fra i due, e l’offerta più conveniente è risultata essere quella di Tim che, al prezzo di 22,4 euro al mese, offre il pacchetto Tutto Tablet Start. In seconda posizione, invece, c’è Wind che propone la tariffa Mega Tablet a 25,8 euro al mese (con 10 Gb a disposizione per la navigazione internet). Sull’ultimo gradino del podio Vodafone offre Tablet Fly a 29,1 euro al mese (con 7 Gb di internet inclusi).
Per acquistare il tablet Apple iPad Air in abbonamento, invece, i costi sono superiori. La proposta più economica, infatti, parte da 34,1 euro al mese ed appartiene a Tim con Tutto Tablet Start (2 Gb di traffico dati inclusi). Tim occupa anche la seconda posizione di questa speciale classifica con il piano tariffario Tutto Tablet Large a 39,1 euro al mese (con 5 Gb di internet). Ancora in terza posizione, invece, si colloca l’offerta di Vodafone con Tablet Internet 1 anno al prezzo di 43,3 euro al mese che comprende 3 Gb di navigazione.
La possibilità di acquistare un tablet Apple o Samsung con un piano tariffario è una buona idea, soprattutto sotto Natale, per rendere più sostenibili i costi. L’iPad Air, infatti, è venduto attualmente a 779 euro, mentre il Galaxy Tab 3 è prezzato 469 euro. Gli abbonamenti con tablet incluso, però, prevedono contratti di 24 o 30 mesi, quindi, bisogna riflettere bene se si tratta di un investimento conveniente per le nostre esigenze.
""Gli italiani hanno una spiccata passione per la tecnologia e hanno imparato ad approfittare di questi pacchetti per pagare a rate il tablet o lo smartphone – commenta Andrea Manfredi, Amministratore Delegato di SuperMoney – Non tutti ancora, però, hanno chiare le condizioni contrattuali: le compagnie chiedono ai clienti di restare fedeli per almeno 24 mesi, e spesso il pagamento è possibile solo con addebito diretto su carta di credito o conto corrente"".
""Visto che la scelta del tablet spesso non è solo legata al modello, ma soprattutto al prezzo – conclude Manfredi – il confronto delle tariffe si rivela l'arma più preziosa per i consumatori. Mettere un tablet sotto l'albero in questo Natale 2013, risparmiando sull'internet mobile anche nel corso del 2014, è possibile: basta scegliere con attenzione l'offerta"".",finance,1387390146
personalfinance,Enrolling part-time in community college to pay student loan principal? Evaluation request.,"I am starting to pay my student loans and would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Does this idea sound good? I am really keen on it because I would like to enter grad school when my wife finishes her MS in a few years. I was a business major and looking to get into a program that is programming and math based so I would be taking those types of classes e.g. Calculus and Java.

I had an opportunity to take a military officer specific student loan at a 2.99% interest rate which I took to lower our vehicles rate. Only thing with that is it is a 5 year loan so the payments cannot be income based. I know a popular opinion on many of these subs is to sell your car but this isn't going to happen for us. I need to be able to commute both for work and for the military so we need something reliable. The maintenance is quite minimal and I do most of it at home. We also carpool to work and school.

My idea is two classes at local community college per semester is roughly $800/ semester then books. This is part time and that is enough to put my loans back into deferment.

* Sallie Mae $4,550 at 6% minimum payment is ~$55

* ACS #1 $1,270 at 6.8% Avg payment $50

* ACS #2 $1,333 at 6.8% Avg Payment $50

* Great Lakes #1 $9,195 @ 3.4%

* Great Lakes #2 $3,490 @ 4.5%

* Great Lakes #3  $15,111 @ 6.8%
 
*Great lakes is under grace period until February. Before IRB it will be ~$ 350*

* Edfinancial #1 $4,397 @ 6.8%

* Edfinancial #2 $5,636 @ 6.8%

*Edfinancial payments ~$100 a month*

""Auto"" is $25,820 @ 2.99% Min payment is $470 a month but cannot be deferred due to the nature of the loan.

Thus, total payment that could be deferred is between $400-600 a month *(400 considering I remain on IBR and get it on the loan in grace period) 


***According to the above, to be in community college, part-time will cost about $2,000 a year plus time spent studying which will ultimately help me get into grad school. That subtracted from the $4,800 to 7,200 a year ""saved"" for not being obligated to make payments would save me between $2,800-$5,200 that can be used to pay down principal on the loans. I would tackle the two loans sitting around $1k each first, then divert that extra $100 to the higher balance/ higher interest rate loans.****  

Has anyone actually done something like this before or can anyone see any problems with it? I would take night or online classes so it doesn't interfere with work. When my wife gets a full time job, post-graduate school and can support us more, I would enroll full time and start taking the GI bill which will add extra income for school expenses.",finance,1387388509

personalfinance,Is this the right move?,"Hey everyone.  I'm looking for some feedback on if I'm making the right decision here.  Friends that I've mentioned this to have scoffed at the idea, but they're not the most financially sound folks I know.  So here's the current situation.

About 4 months ago I found out that my wife and I were going to have our first child.  In preparation for this, I traded in my 6 speed 2 door coupe for a 4 door automatic Volkswagen.  Through VW, we were able to get 0% financing and pay a monthly payment of $425.81.  We also own a 2008 Mazda 3 with a value of around $7500-8000.  This vehicle is paid off and is the main vehicle my wife uses.  This summer, I received a sizable increase in pay at work and decided I would fulfill a dream of mine and purchase my first Ducati.  Because of my less than stellar credit score along with $1000 rolled over into the loan from my old bike, I owe $15,425.13 at 13.378%.

So that being said, here's my thoughts.  The Mazda 3 is used primarily just to get my wife back and forth to work. Anytime we go anywhere, the VW is taken.  I'd like to sell the Mazda outright for at minimum $7,000.  My wife would get the VW and we would continue to use it as the family car.  Of that $7,000, I'd like to purchase a cheap ($2,000) used vehicle to get back and forth to work.  My work commute is less than 10 miles round trip, so it really doesn't need to be anything special or all that great.  With the remaining $5,000, I'd like to work on paying down the Ducati.  Getting the Ducati down to around $10,000 will put it around a value that I could break even in the event that I sell it.  With the addition of a child, owning the motorcycle is very low on my list of priorities.  We could also use the monthly payment of the bike to go towards paying down the car or getting closer to the 20% equity in the house to stop paying PMI.

So that's what I'm thinking, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something.  Is there some component to this that I'm forgetting or simply won't work?

Thanks in advance.",finance,1387383310

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is an excellent hedge against the coming bank deposit confiscations,"One of bitcoin's main charasteristics is the fact that it cannot be multiplied nor confiscated by a trusted party, such as a bank, holding your funds for you.

The FED (US), the ECB (EU), and the BOJ (JP) are no longer able to neutralize the growth in the money volume by selling bonds to the public. It is the central banks themselves that buy the government debt titles now. The Chinese and Japanese central banks have stopped buying US treasury notes. This means that government deficits now get translated directly in increases in the money supply. For example, since 2008 the amount of dollars circulating has been multiplied by at least five.

This excess liquidity must be eliminated, or else the system will collapse through hyperinflation. Since selling treasury notes no longer does the job, the IMF has proposed that the reduction in money supply shall be achieved by confiscating bank deposits.

Depending on how well you are politically connected, you may be able to avoid the confiscation or find a loophole. Everybody else won't.

personalfinance,Aggressively paying off student loans,"I've been in the workforce for a year and a half since college and I make about $83k before taxes. I'm 25 years old, and I'm moving back home with my Mom to face my debts as quickly as possible while also saving a moderate amount of money while I do it. I don't know how long I can make it in her house even though we mostly get along--if it's only for a month it'll be something, I'm currently thinking I should aim for 6 months, it'd be great if I can cope with it for a year.

**Debts**

* $51.8k in student loan debt

 * $6.3k in a private loan with Wells Fargo; 5.5%; min payment $58

 * $24.3k in federal loans; 6%; min payment $183

 * $21.1k in my Dad's name as a parent loan that I'm taking full responsibility for; 7.65%; min payment $273

* I've just completed paying off $10.3k in credit card debt

**Assets**

* $5k in savings

* $1k in a very slowly growing 401(k) to which I contribute 3% of my income and my company contributes ~6% of my income vesting over 4 years

* $4.5k Honda Civic

**Bills**

* $35 cellphone

* $45 insurance

* $35 gym

* $250 to Mum for rent

* As little as I can spend on food, alcohol, travel, and the rest of it

My salary is ~$4k a month after taxes and retirement and medical. I get bonuses the rest of the way, the sum of which have been going towards debts.

Among the few things I already know: don't spend money on frivolous things and vacations, have an emergency fund, and highest interest loans should be paid most rapidly. One wrinkle is that my highest loan is in my Dad's name, I will be minimum paying that until it's all that remains and he's aware of this. Another caveat is that paying off the smaller private loan first will be a psychological boost and will get rid of a minimum payment the quickest (albeit the smallest at $58). I'll say this: my debts have taken a large toll on my mind since I've graduated.

What I'm interested in learning about is at what rate I should be saving month-to-month as I try to aggressively improve my financial situation. One big goal is to buy a house as soon as possible, but I'm not willing to (and shouldn't) do that until I'm able to fork over $50k in cash and have $10k leftover. On the one hand I'm accruing interest every day, but on the other I can always transfer savings to debts. One argument is to only keep around $2k in cash and to use my money for nothing other than debt, another is to grow them together. Today I save around $600 a month, but the $1.2k in rent and utilities that I'm currently signed up for will soon be gone. Should I raise or lower my retirement contribution? What percentage makes the most sense for savings versus debts? Is there some outside the box approach that makes the most sense for my situation?

personalfinance,Should I consider bankruptcy?,"**About me:** 

I am 29 years old and I live in San Diego, California, I'm single (although considering getting married in the next 1-2 years).  My credit score is currently 599.  According to my Equifax credit report, I have 0 accounts in collections.  According to my Experian credit report, I have 1 account in collections for a past-due medical bill for $144 since 07/2012.


**My Income:** 

In the last 2 years my debt has significantly increased because for most of 2012 I was working part-time (due to medical issues) an supplementing my income with a meager disability stipend (which ran out in Dec 2012) and the first half of 2013 I was unemployed but receiving $200/week in unemployment.  I am currently underemployed working full-time (40 hours/wk) @ $14.25/hr ($29640/year).  


**My Monthly Non-Debt Expenses:**

Rent: $440 

(note: My half of the rent for our 2br1ba apartment should be $625 but my b/f is giving me a break on the rent since I'm making so little money.  When I was working part-time and then was unemployed, he let me live here for free so I owe him much more than I'm paying him)

Gas: $200 monthly (36 mile daily commute round trip, grocery shopping/errands, and we don't really use my car on the weekend)

Cell Phone: $62 (no other phone)

Medical Expenses: $150 (prescriptions, regular bimonthly doctor's visits)

Medical Insurance: $100 (subsidized by my work)  


**Monthly Debt Expenses:**  

Credit Cards:

Debt | Balance | Interest Rate | Min Payment
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
Card 1 | $2625 | 13.99% | $81.00
Card 2 | $2037 | 23.99% | $62.00
Card 3 | $3060 | 22.99% | $90.00
Card 4 | $1332 | 29.99% | $47.00
Card 5 | $2529 | 15.90% | $58.00
Card 6 | $485 | 24.90% | $25.00
Card 7 | $0 | 24.99% | $0
Card 8 | $450 | 24.99% | $20.00
Card 9 | $34 | 24.99% | $25.00

Total Credit Card Debt: $12308

Total monthly credit card payments (min payment only): $408

Note: with the exception of cards 7, 8, and 9, all of the cards are maxed out and what credit becomes available on them after making a payment is usually used up to pay for groceries or other expenses.


Student Loans: (yes, I know these cannot be discharged by bankruptcy)

~$18000 federal consolidated loan, 2% fixed interest rate, I'm currently not paying anything towards it because it is still on a financial hardship deferment until the end of the year.  Come January 2014, I've opted for one of the income based repayment options and my payment will be ~$40/month.  


**Assets:**

I own no property and I have no savings.  I do own my car (it was a college graduation gift).  It is a 2006 Hyundai Elantra and when I just did a Kelly Blue Book value on it, it's worth about $5600 (private party value).  From what I understand of bankruptcy law in CA, because of the wildcard exemption in bankruptcy option 2, I can use my leftover wildcard exemption to cover the value of my car and keep my car (considering I own nothing else of value).    


**Reasons why I'm considering bankruptcy:**

(note: I believe I qualify for chapter 7 bankruptcy in CA based solely on my income but I've also used a CA means-test calculator and it said I *should* still qualify for chapter 7 bankruptcy so that is the basis for my thoughts)  


1. Even though right now I can make my minimum monthly payment every month, I really can't increase what I'm paying toward my bills or even just stop using up my available credit as soon as I've made a payment.  You'll notice that no where in my monthly expenses is ""food"" listed.  That's usually because I pay everything I have to pay and whatever is left is what I have to make work for food.  I buy the majority of groceries for our household in trade off for paying reduced rent, not paying for internet or utilities.  Could I probably budget to save $20 here and there on groceries and food, yes, but I don't think $20 is going to get me out of this hole.  


2. I'm young enough that this might not ruin my life completely.  10 years is a long time, yes, but in the meantime I can use that 10 years to get married, and start a family without the angry credit card monster looming over me.  My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years so marriage is definitely on the table.  He has good credit and a $50k/yr job and is making it OK.  We've discussed that if I were to do something to spare my finances, it would probably be best to do it before we got married.  This is my mess and I don't even want there to be a possibility that creditors would come after any of his assets for my mistakes.  I do, however, realize that this will complicate buying house (should we be able to afford one) in the future.  


3. I've looked at debt consolidation or settlement (my mom did it a few years back) and it would seem that it would a.) likely ruin my credit just as much as bankruptcy and b.) take years to process which doesn't help my ""get it done before I get married"" plan.  My understanding of the settlement process is that I would go through an agency/lawyer and essentially stop paying my bills and this would be reported on my credit (which right now, I have all on-time payment history).  I would then make payments to the lawyer/agency and they would negotiate a settlement of my debt for pennies on the dollar.  Once I've paid into my agency ""account"" enough money to pay off that creditor, that account is paid and then closed.  I have also read that you don't have the same legal protections from collections harassment that filing for bankruptcy gives.  


4.  I've done credit modeling on creditkarma.com (I don't know /r/personalfinances 's opinion of credit karma but it was what I had access to) and even if I were to pay off all of my debt tomorrow, my credit score would go from 599 to 680.  While an increase, yes, I don't think it is by any means stellar credit.  Oddly, they don't have a ""declare bankruptcy"" simulation so I substituted ""Allow ALL Monthly Accounts to Become Past Due 90 days"" and my score went from 599 to 567.  Looking at this is one of the things that even made me look into bankruptcy in the first place.  It seems like my credit is already bad (yes, I know, I've seen worse too, but I still think it's pretty bad).  If declaring bankruptcy can't make it that much worse and it would let me start over clean slate knowing what I'm doing and not being an idiot 18 year old, I figured it was worth looking into.


**Reasons why I think bankruptcy might not be for me:**

1. Buying a house eventually.  I'm probably going to want to buy some sort of dwelling in the next 10 years and I know that having a bankruptcy on my record will significantly hinder that.  What I don't know is if going through debt settlement wouldn't do the same thing.  (if anyone knows the answer to this, please let me know).  


2. I am woefully underemployed (as are many other people out there).  I have a BS in Microbiology and an MS in Environmental Engineering and am working at a job that doesn't even require a bachelor's degree because a job is a job and it was what I could find.  I've been trying for 6 years to get a job in my field (talk about the wrong time to graduate from college).  The nagging thought in my head is that if I was making more along the lines of even what an entry-level environmental professional would make, I could probably pay off my debt in a few years.  Trouble is, there's no guarantee that's going to happen.



So that's it, that's me and my situation.  Any insight from finance people would be greatly appreciated.  I've tried to research at least the basics of bankruptcy before asking this question to you all but please ask questions if you think there's something I missed.  Thank you!!



**tl;dr: CA resident, 29yo, $29640/year income, $12308 credit card debt, $18000 student loan debt, no property, no savings, own car (worth ~$5600), 599 credit score, all on-time payment history.  Should I consider bankruptcy?**



Edit: $29640/year income is before taxes.  My take home pay is ~$1800/month give or take.  I can't say for sure because my health insurance won't kick in until Feb 17th.  I'm carrying at $10k cash accident policy ($55.95/mo) and paying cash for my prescriptions to get my through my 90 day waiting period at work for my full benefits so I can't just take that $100 and put it toward the credit cards.


Edit 2: I was also missing car insurance: $69/month.  I'm looking through my monthly statements now and figuring out where all the money is going, because you're right, I should have a couple hundred left over at the end of the month but I can assure you, I don't as the balance of my checking account before I was paid last week was $3.73.  I'll calculate more numbers and put them up here.


Edit 3: Expense numbers for Nov 2013 (I also compared to Oct 2013 to make sure they weren't skewed).  Pay: +$1740 -$476.67 Rent (I pay $100 one week and $120 the next and so on, $440 wasn't the most accurate calculation) -$200 gas -$186 medical -$62 cell phone -$69 car insurance -$408 credit cards -$410 food -$100 not food (household stuff and I think there was 1 movie ticket in there) for a grand total of -$171 (negative $171) which would make sense because I had to put money back on my credit cards to make it through the month.",finance,1387494592

My payments are regular full principal and interest payments.

No credit card/other debt 
(I have credit score around 720 so I don’t think I need a credit card right now)


I also co-own a media and design LLC but it’s very much part-time work and we take clients on an inconsistent basis. So every few months I’ll get $500-$1500 more to put in my saving or on loans or whatever, but I didn't factor this in because it’s not easy to quantify long-term.
 

Whatever is left at the end of the month goes into my savings.


I think my main concerns are:


-paying my debt off responsibly and quickly but also setting myself up so when it is paid off, I’m not flat broke at square one (because I will likely be in my 30’s by the time I get this all down). 


-I’d also like to set myself up with an “emergency” fund and then use extra money after that to put directly onto my loans. But I’m not sure how much that should be. Is $3k enough? 


-I don’t see any significant raises in the near future (I was bumped from my starting of $36k to $38k a few months ago). I think I have the potential to be earning more in my field (graphic/web design) but I like my job and I think staying here for a while longer to boost my resume would be the smarter move but I’m not sure…

Bitcoin,[Please Sticky] Sean's Outpost: The Bitcoin Angel Tree,"EDIT*** EVERYTHING IS FUNDED. TOOK LESS THAN 3 HOURS

Hey Everyone,

I’m not a religious person. But I do enjoy the opportunity to celebrate the holidays with my family. It’s a time of year to be thankful for all we have. Celebrate the people we hold dear to us. Eat, Drink, and be Merry. In the US it’s almost comical the displays of excess  everywhere. People overindulging in celebratory exuberance. It’s fun. 

But not for everyone.  

For a large portion of the population, December is a reminder of how little they have and how few people actually care. There are spikes in Depression and Suicide in December every year. For a reason.

Sean’s Outpost has been very fortunate this year. We have fed over 26,000 meals to the homeless in our area. But we know that man does not survive on food alone. Sometimes, all somebody needs is to know that someone else cares, just a little bit.

We thought it would be a good time to spread some cheer. So we have been asking people what they wanted for Christmas. The results are staggering. Most people were dumfounded. They hadn’t celebrated the holidays or even thought about the concept of receiving a gift in years. A lot of them cried. And most were at a loss for something to ask for, because so many of these people are so humble.

But we were able to compile the list. And I thought it would be cool to incorporate the concept of an “Angel Tree” with bitcoin. Not Angel with wings, Angel like investing. Because that’s what this is. This is investing in the mental wellbeing of another human.

We thought it would be fun. So here’s the list. If you want to sponsor a gift, I will edit the list and strike that thru. 

Tis the season. Thank you all for such a wonderful 2013.

electronics,Trying to build a frequency-sensitive LED milk crate wall in lieu of a drummer for my band.,"Hi all, this is my first time on this subreddit, any help would be MASSIVELY appreciated.

I play in a [live music duo](https://soundcloud.com/venom-elite) and currently gig without a drummer as we prefer electronic drum tones and the ability to throw in samples without the hassle of activation pads etc. 

The only problem is, the energy of the live set suffers due to the absence of a live drummer.

I've become kinda obsessed lately with the idea of building a wall out of 16 milk crates and filling each crate with a sheet of LED lights. These lights would then be fed to a laptop which breaks our drum track down into low, medium and high frequencies. These frequencies would then trigger different LED-rigged milk crates to create an energetic wall of light that syncs to the music.

In it's most basic form, the lower row of crates would represent the kick drum/floor toms/low frequency samples, medium row would be the snare/high toms/mid-range samples and the top row cymbals/high frequency samples.

I'd be so freaking grateful for any help or suggestions on how I might go about building this thing. I've already started nicking milk crates from the local grocery store. =)

I've drawn up a crude diagram [here](http://i.imgur.com/9XtXdbV.jpg).

Bitcoin,I'm one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world with 750BTC (AMA),"Hi Everyone,

Hope you're well and having a good day. I'm up late at night, a bit bored, and wanted people to see the perspective of someone who has a large position in BTC. I'm using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. If you wish you can ask questions.

So first off, I heard about Bitcoin in late summer of 2012. I read about it for a while, thought it was kinda neat (but confusing as hell), and then proceeded to download Bitcoin QT. After watching it download the ""blockchain"" for about 10 minutes I said **Fuck this** and proceeded to delete the program and forget about Bitcoin :)

Fast forward to March 2013 (or April, can't remember). I'm not sure how I heard of Bitcoin again, but I think it was on some mainstream news site (like CNBC or something). I saw that the price was rising and something ""clicked"" in my head (for better or worse)

I spent a few days reading/researching Bitcoin heavily. It became like a good drug. I was engrossed by the news in a good way. I really ""got"" Bitcoin by this point and what it could be. (keyword ""could"", not a guarantee)

As quickly as I felt comfortable, I began wiring a fuck load of USD to Mt.Gox. Looking back I don't know how on earth I had the courage to do this, but user testimonials of Mt.Gox doing well by people, and them being the most popular at the time, got me to do it.

I did about 4 or 5 wire transfers from my bank over the course of a month as I was able to movie money around. They began to ask questions of what I was doing. They were joking but a little serious when one said ""Man don't try to launder money over there."" I mentioned to them what I was doing (Bitcoin) and they didn't really understand/get it so I left it at that.

Around the $70-$100ish range I bought 528 BTC. When the price hit $266 or so and then crashed (because of Mt. Gox locking up) I was literally cracking up. :) I just found it so funny that people scare so easily.

When the summer came I kinda monitored Bitcoin, bought a little thing here and there, etc etc. 

When early fall came, I noticed that I was REALLY unhappy with some stock that I held and how the company was doing, so I sold the fuck out of it and brought my total to 750BTC. (poured $130k total into it for my BTC purchases)

It was really fun to see the price hit $1,200, but I decided not to sell any. My main fear being that what I think is a top really isn't, and it would leave me behind with fewer coins. I'm not very good at calling tops.

As the price last night fell to the upper $300's, I was awoken by my phone (price alert). I will admit I was a little worried as I'm human (thinking of potential sell strategies if need be), but when in a short amount of time it rocketed back up to $500 or so I said **fuck it** and went back to sleep calmer.

I don't really spend my BTC but I do purchase $75 worth of BTC every week to ""stimulate"" the BTC economy. I'll use that $75 on Christmas Gifts, Gyft cards, little tipping here and there.

At the moment there are only about 16,000 people in the world that can hold as many BTC as me, and I'm very proud of that. I feel that I'm on the forefront of something special, and am always trying to share it with friends. When friends freak out about crashes, I try to calm them down with common sense (yet I always make sure they know I don't have a crystal ball).

With Bitcoin I feel like the ""cat is out of the bag"" so to speak. It's out and can't be contained now. I feel countries are best to embrace it or they will have a competitive disadvantage. 

Also, the U.S. Fiscal situation is fucking terrible, and I believe BTC will be one of the many flights to safety in the years to come. Do **not** ignore the Fed's relation to the Bond market (let me know if you have questions about this topic)

So long story short, I could be wrong about Bitcoin and what happens to it someday, but I've done a lot of research and I feel comfortable with it. I don't know if I have a ""sell price"" so to speak, or if I'll choose to just hold the BTC and spend as necessary. I do know though that upon reaching the $10Kish mark I would like to do something simple like treat myself to a sports car (cliche, I know...but it is what it is)

Thank you for reading! It's fun to share this with people (even if strangers) because it's something I can't really talk about with people!",cryptocurrency,1387437017
Bitcoin,"I first heard about Bitcoin in 2009. I heard about some new millionaires last year. Two days ago I told a coworker ""it sounds like a ponzi scheme and I'm going to lol when it crashes"" Today, I am thinking about investing. Am I stupid?","I've been reading a bit about it now, [this](https://markopolojarvi.com/bitcoin.html?re) article caught my attention and I'm thinking seriously about it.

I don't understand stock markets and currencies and whatnot, I run a small business. A small business is easy, I can control basically everything, and I trust myself. Currency.. especially on the internet.. seems insane to me. Is this article a good place to start? I really don't want a circlejerk, I'm looking for honest information. I've always leaned toward the federal reserve which is why I rolled my eyes at this initially, but after following the news and reading all day my interest is peaked. Socially, I believe the world is coming together through the internet and a currency like this doesn't sound so crazy all of a sudden. The only thing that gives me faith is that there actually are merchants picking this up.

With essentially a days worth of knowledge, I'm thinking if the price drops below $250 it might be worth picking up. Where would be a good, honest place to learn more about this? I've browsed through the forums but all the emotional posts sort of scare me.

Sorry for the ramble, it's late and I can't stop reading. Thanks :)

personalfinance,I'm going to need a private loan to pay for my tuition/rent until September. Any advice or other options?,"I was denied federal grants this academic year and have been living off of government loans, my job and my mother. However, we both have been stressed ever since. I've taken out the max amount allowed for my loans, work the max hours at my job, and my mother gives me money. However, it still leaves me with almost nothing in my account after all the expenses are paid. Sometimes, my mother can't even give me money because she has her own stuff to pay. We believe if I take up a loan (she can't due to credit debt), it'll give us both some breathing room until September (which we'll be renewed for federal grants).

I was thinking about taking out a loan out of my [credit union](https://www.schoolsfirstfcu.org/unsecuredloans/personal.asp). Is there any other options I can look into or any advice when tackling these loans? How much should I take out?

dogecoin,The $.20 Dogecoin,"Ok, so I've been crunching some numbers based on the success of bitcoin. While it is still a very volatile. There are about 12.5 million BTC in circulation which means that there are only about 8 million BTC left to be mined. As we all know, it is exceedingly rare at this point to mine an actual full bitcoin.

At the height of the BTC valuation, BTC was around $1,200, the market cap for the entirety of BTC was about $14.5 billion. As of today December, 18th it's at $6.9 billion. This is not a traditional market correction as it was induced by a government decision in China. There was a change in demand induced by the loss of its utility. This would be the equivalent of the government banning the use of credit cards at restaurants which would cause the share prices of the credit card companies to tumble. The fundamental demand for the currency is still there. It's just that without legitimacy in the world's most populace country, the currency will suffer a real lack of demand pushing prices downwards. The speculation might drive the prices up but uncertainty about government regulation is having a much bigger effect pushing prices downwards. 

That being said, crypto-currencies will continue to grow. About 9/10 people I talk to have no idea what Bitcoin even is. While anecdotal evidence, I suspect this is true for most people outside of the tech world. What that means is that there are serious long term growth prospects as crypto-currencies gain not only legitimacy but every-day use by the populace. 

It's not hard to see bitcoin going back up to $1,000 in value  or beyond and being sustained at that price. Supply of bitcoins is diminishing faster than the acceptance and demand is increasing. Given that there are going to be 100 billion Dogecoins, what would happen if Dogecoin reached a market cap similar to bitcoin? Well at a ratio of 12.5 million BTC to the current 15 billion Dogecoins, at the $14.5 billion market cap, Dogecoins would have a value of about $.243. At the more reasonable $1,000 per BTC, Dogecoins would have a value of $.209.

Now, this may seem like a really far stretch to say that Dogecoin could achieve a $14 billion market cap and the influx of new coins would surely devalue the price of a Dogecoin. Which means that Dogecoin, in this scenario, would likely fall to about $.05 considering a 4x increase in supply due to mining. It's not, however, unfeasible for crypto-currencies in general to become at least a minor part of the world currency. As of 2008, there was over $4 trillion in circulation. If crypto-currencies become even 1% of the global market, that is a $40 billion market capitalization. Bitcoin only reached slightly more than a third of that in its height. This is a long term growth market that will continue to see more and more acceptance. 

Here's where I think Dogecoin has an advantage over bitcoin. At the price of $.20, it is what the name implies, a coin. It would almost be equivalent to a quarter in value. This could lead to more mass appeal than a $1,000 bitcoin. It seems almost like the case of Berkshire Hathaway's stock being valued at over $174,000 a share. It's fairly priced but no average consumer could even afford to buy just one. 

**Edit: Just had an interesting thought experiment in my head about pegging a crypto currency such as this to a fiat currency such as the dollar. The mining could still be done but the gains would be through transaction fees and through arbitrage when the value of the crypto-currency exceeds or  falls below the value of the pegged fiat currency. The central agent could just mint new coins when there's an excess of value and buy up coins when there is deficient value similar to how an ETF works, or in essence, the Fed. All in all, it would create an incentive to actually use the currency to buy stuff but would deter investors. It would probably steal away the Silk Road crowd since it would be a more practical currency**",cryptocurrency,1387421588
Bitcoin,"Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's a commodity.","I've been reading a lot of 'Bitcoin needs to die!' opinion pieces lately like this one http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/why-i-want-bitcoin-to-die-in-a.html and while I agree with the facts in the article, I don't agree with the reasoning. Because, I think we're all thinking about this the wrong way. Instead of comparing Bitcoin to the American Dollar, we should be comparing Bitcoin to Gold or Rhodium. Bitcoin is for trading, not spending.  

So, lets start with the big one, ""Bitcoin is deflationary."" Yes, there are a finite number of Bitcoins. There is also a finite amount of Iridium on the planet, and people exchange that for real money. Bitcoin is a ""hard money"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_money_(policy). Could we run America's current economy on Bitcoin? Hell no. (Insert snarky Federal Reserve comment here). But you know what I never hear anyone talk about? Each Bitcoin can be divided down to 8 decimal places (with the ability to modify the protocol to allow smaller amounts) which means there are currently 100 million units in each Bitcoin. Hypothetically, if each unit were valued at one penny, each Bitcoin would be worth one million dollars, which would make the total value of all Bitcoins to be created just over 21 trillion, which is still larger than the current U.S. national debt. Will it ever be worth this much? I don't know, probably not, but there sure is a lot of it. Scarcity is not an issue. If Bitcoin was evenly divided up and given to every single one of the 7 billion people on earth, we would all get 300,000 satoshi. That said, the fact that there are a finite number of Bitcoins coupled with demand gives Bitcoin its value, just like how the finite amount of gold on earth gives gold value. Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's a commodity. 

""Bitcoin is bad for the environment."" This is one of the saddest parts of Bitcoin in my opinion. We are burning a lot of natural commodities to create a virtual one. Eventually we will have to stop mining Bitcoin, or create more efficient ways to generate electricity. I'm pulling for the latter, and perhaps a rising price of Bitcoin will encourage people to do this sooner rather than later. We should all be against Bitcoin mining botnets, robbing the masses for the benefit of the few is not what Bitcoin stands for in my opinion, I think everyone would agree.

""You can buy kiddy-porn with Bitcoin!"" Black markets have always existed, and always will exist. As long as there are subversive people, people will do subversive things. I know these are tautologies but so is this argument against Bitcoin. 

Last and not least, ""Bitcoin wealth distribution is even worse than USD wealth distribution."" https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=51011.0. In my opinion, this, more than anything else, has the potential to kill Bitcoin. Some people are estimating that Satoshi has 1.5 million Bitcoins. Who is Satoshi? Nobody knows. What about the early adopters who have hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin? Nobody knows. People aren't spending Bitcoin, they are hoarding it like the kings of the great empires hoarded gold. What is going to happen? Again, I don't know, but I can give you two options. Option one is a massive voluntary redistribution, Rockefeller style. I can see a future where the original Bitcoin adopters change the future of humanity by trading micro units of Bitcoin for goods and services to redefine our infrastructure, improve health and well-being, and advance our species into the final frontier of space. Option two, somebody forks the open source protocol, starts Bitcoin 2.0, everybody and their mother starts mining from day one, and we're all on even footing. 

I think that as long as there is an internet as we know it, Bitcoin's public block chain will always have some value because of it's ability to record transactions. I think that a decentralized internet commodity has value because it facilitates trade in a way that breaks down historical barriers. Will Bitcoin crash and burn? I think that's up to the populism of the people who hold it.

personalfinance,Long time lurker needing your advice.,"I'm 21 years old, just starting out in life but was cursed by a nightmarish sickness when I was 18. I was in and out of the hospital several times with no insurance. I was an irresponsible teenager living with my very poor grandparents. I never made any attempts to pay these bills and now it's come back to bite me in the butt. I never get approved for any type of credit, I can't even get a bank account so I'm forced to use these prepaid paycheck cards which are riddled in fees. I'm living paycheck to paycheck and it's starting to drive me mad. I'm feeling so overwhelmed that I don't even know where to begin.


I'm seriously thinking of filing bankruptcy and just starting over. I currently owe around $4500 in medical bills (all of which are delinquent on my credit report.) I don't absolutely need the credit this minute but it's like a nail drilling in my head. What if the car breaks down and leaves me on the side of the road again? How am I going to pay for it this time? What if an emergency comes up and I have to pay for it? Obviously, I can't do any of this living paycheck to paycheck and I'm getting so unbelievably stressed. 

On top of that, since I didn't know I had so much in debt, I was in need of a washer and dryer which ended up costing me around $1500 to finance (from a second chance financer with an interest rate of 20%) so now on top of the $4500, I can add another $1500.

I will say that I am very fortunate to have a job that pays $13/hr but it's still not much where I live. In about 6-8 months I will be offered the job of my life which will lead to a pay increase of around 60% but as luck would have it, I was informed today that there would be a credit check. No matter what, I am screwed. I can't afford to pay my debt and I can't get a better paying job to be able to afford to pay my debt.

On top of that, I am providing for my wife and 3 mo. old daughter. My wife had to stop working to stay home with the baby since she was only making minimum wage and it didn't make sense for her to work since her entire checks would go towards child care anyway. I'm really freaking out right now and I don't have the heart to tell my wife that I can't even get a better paying job because of my terrible credit. Today on the drive home from work, I actually cried which makes me feel like a loser.

While I'm at my lowest point, I thought I had nothing to lose in asking complete strangers for advice on what to do. I have no assets to sell.

Bitcoin,How to break news to family that they have lost a substantial amount of money?,"Hi, I just want to say this is not an emotional post.  I'm just curious if anyone has any experience in dealing with this that they can help me with, since I know bitcoins have cycled a few times and I'm guessing my situation is not unique.

A lot of my family members heard about the bitcoin rise about a month ago and got pretty interested in it as a way to safeguard their life savings from the current inflationary fed policies.  I'm the most technical person in my family, so they asked me to look into it and invest their money if it looked good.

I told them that bitcoin has a strong history of value increases, and that it was increasingly becoming accepted as a payment method across the world.  After discussing the issue, and the fact that there was some risk my two aunts, parents, and one of my grandmothers decided to invest the entirety of their savings.  

Again, I'm the only tech savvy individual in my family, so they transferred the money to me and I made the purchases/agreed to manage the money for a small yearly fee.

Unfortunately, they bought in at $950/btc, and if they sell today they stand to collectively lose $600k, which halves most of their life savings and probably puts my grandma in a bad financial position.

Now, I didn't put any of my money in, and I told them there was some risk in investing in bitcoins.  Still, I'm not really sure if I should tell them to continue to hold on to the bitcoins, or to sell at this point.  But regardless of what I tell them to do, I'm not really sure how to break the news to them, especially my grandma.  Also, if people think that bitcoins are going to go back up I've also considered just not telling them and hoping they don't see a news article about this while bitcoin's value rises back to/above where it used to be.

I would appreciate it if anyone has any advice on either of those two points, or any stories of how they have informed family of significant losses before and how it ended up turning out.

personalfinance,Interest rate reduction vs. bifurcated payments: how to calculate which is better.,"I have significant federal student loans.
    
My lender currently offers me an incentive of a 0.25% interest rate reduction if I sign up for automatic payments through their website. These payments MUST be at least the minimum monthly amount.
    
I want to figure out if it would be cheaper for me to make two payments per month, each roughly half my minimum monthly payment, rather than receive the automatic interest rate reduction. However, I am not sure how to calculate this.
    
E.g., let's say that $50k of my loans are at 8.50% interest over 10 years. With the lender's incentive (8.25%), I would have automatic payments of $613.26 once per month. Would it be cheaper to pay $310 on the 1st and 15th of each month (monthly minimum is ~$620 per month at 8.50%)?
    
Some type of formula would be best as I have numerous student loans, each of different amounts and with different interest rates.
    
Also, I can set up automatic payments through my bank. In this fashion, I would not have to worry about remembering to make both payments. However, I would not be eligible for the incentive.
    
I am fairly certain that the double payments would be cheaper, but I want to do the math before I commit.",finance,1387569110

Right now it will take me 7.5 years to pay off my student loans at my current payment, interest rate, and loan amount. However, I would like to get a bit more aggressive on this to get out of debt sooner. My idea was to cut back to 6% (company match) on my ROTH 401k and stop contributing to the stock purchasing program until the loan is paid off. Then take the 4% difference from the ROTH 401k contribution and 3% stock purchasing plan contribution and put that amount towards my loans. This would drop the payment period down to 2.5 years without leaving ""free"" money on the table from the ROTH 401k contribution.

dogecoin,If the goal is to expand dogecoin's value why is it so easy to mine?,"From what I've seen dogecoin supporters have been doing a good job of expanding demand for DOGE, but supply looks like it's through the roof Heck, you even got me interested and mining (although with a 9400M I'm not getting anything worthwhile). 

Now, I admittedly know virtually nothing about cryptocurrency, but it seems to me to function like any other currency at its basics. So its price is based on both supply and demand. From what I've been observing the supply seems to be vastly outstripping the demand for the currency. 

Now for my real questions:

1)
What makes a cryptocurrency harder or easier to mine? There seems to be no definable limit to the quantity available so how do you make it harder or less hard to find blocks to mine from?

2)
Do people expect currency currently mined to fall out of circulation (i.e. people hoard it)? That would certainly make value rise, but I don't know how much weight that assumption has unless people have documented this in cryptocurrencies before. 

3)
Without there being a Fed for DOGE so to speak how will the ""printing"" of new DOGE be restricted and how will money supply be controlled in general? Or do DOGE supporters just have to hope demand keeps up with supply?

investing,A few questions about bonds and preferred stocks,"I have few questions on each that I haven't been able to find the answers and I have looked.  First how in the hell can a bond fund lose money?  Do that many places default on payments?  The USA treasury issues bonds as we all know and the 30 year are at ~3.8.  How does VGIT have a negative return right now?  How come the divided is zero?

Aren't there funds that just invest in 30 year T bills?  They should never pay a negative return right?

Also why can't I buy bonds like stocks.  I hear Sprint issued 6.5 million in corporate bonds.  Why can't I buy them?

Preferred stocks is my next question.  Sometimes I can find a symbol.  Then when I try to buy the stock or look at it in sharebuilder it shows up but I can't buy it.  For example COF-PRP isn't listed in sharebuilder but WFC-PRJ is listed and I can buy it. The other wells fargo preferred stocks aren't listed.

So my question then becomes this with wells fargo:  If I can get a 7% rate of return on my preferred stock with a call in value of basically what I paid for the stock if they call it in why doesn't everyone buy these things?  I guess for example lets say I had a home equity loan or school loans fixed at 4.5%.  If I bought preferred stocks that paid a $0.50 dividend (equaling 7% at time of investment) how do I not basically make a virtually guaranteed 2.5% with someone else's money.

I get interest rates might go up and drop the value of the preferred stock.  But if it always pays a 0.50 dividend why do I care?  Eventually I would pay off my loan with the dividends.

I'm sorry if these are dumb questions but I can't seem to find an answer.  I've got a long time until retirement and I am giving it a try myself but more than likely will go the index route in the near future.  

I just don't quite grasp bond funds with negative returns and the preferred stocks.

finance,Why the national debt is toxic. Senior (mini) Thesis,"Preface: This paper is an in-depth look at the relationship between the effect that national and worldwide public debt has on factors that affect capital markets. Some factors related to debt levels are things such as consumer confidence, private investments, inflation, and GDP growth. 

As I currently write this, the United States national debt is roughly $16.8 trillion. This works out to $148,000 of debt per taxpayer [1]. It should be noted that not all of the national debt is owned by foreign entities. When the national debt is broken down; 33.5% of the debt is held by foreign entities, 30.4% is held by government trust funds such as social security, 10.8% is held by the federal reserve which is increase due to quarterly quantitative easing, and the rest is held by the private sector [2]. Debt only is a problem when it continues to increase, thus increasing the interest payments. In the United State’s 2012 fiscal year, the government spent 360 billion on interest payments relating to the national debt [3].  National debt is not a problem by itself for capital markets, but rather the consequences from things like interest rates and credit ratings to a firm’s ability to generate capital and to provide a return that justifies investing. 
	Before discussing the direct impact the US national debt has on Capital Market factors, it is worth noting the worldwide debt trends. The trend for worldwide debt is disturbing to say the least. Between roughly 195 countries, the combined governments of those countries own an astonishing amount of debt that totals more than $50 trillion USD4. The worldwide debt is roughly 61% of the worldwide gross domestic product[ 5]. 
	Another thing that should be discussed is; why is there so much debt? There are several different economic theories on debt that lead some economist to believe that the only way to grow GDP are to keep government spending up. Others believe that there is a certain threshold of debt that can be reached. The rest think that the government should do its best to avoid debt. 
	As the most powerful economic engine in the world, the United States is still seen as a safe haven for investments. A credit rating is an estimate of an entity’s ability to make good on their debt and not surprisingly the US has an enormous capacity for debt. The U.S has historically maintained an “AAA” credit rating. However, on August 11th, 2011, the U.S was downgraded by Standard and poor’s [6]. The downgrade of the United States rating in 2011 sent a signal to the rest of the world that the United States is facing a major debt problem and will struggle to pay off its debts. Additionally, downgrades erodes investors confidence which will limit the amount of capital being invested in the United States from foreign countries and will hurt consumer confidence at home as well. 
Empirical evidence has shown that there is historically weak positive correlation of .10 between the consumer confidence index and stock returns. However, the data suggest that as time goes on, investors are becoming increasingly sensitive to the consumer confidence index as the 10-year correlation shows a weak to moderate positive correlation of .39. When the data set is shrunk to five years, it shows a strong positive correlation of .81. (See Appendix A for calculation) It is worth noting that while consumer confidence is based on several things; mainly political events, however credit rating downgrades for the United States have a definitive effect on consumer confidence. In the four months immediately following the credit rating downgrade, the consumer confidence index dropped 30.9%. The primary reason for the downgrade was because congress failed to raise the debt ceiling and did not come up with a credible plan to tackle the nations long-term debt [6]. 
Consumer confidence is only one of many factors related to national debt. In addition to nationals debt affect on consumer confidence, it also affects the United State’s ability to grow. In a 2012 study lead by Carmen Reinhart, countries with no public debt overhang grew on average 3.5% while countries with 90% debt-to-gdp grew at 2.3%. Countries with 120% debt-to-gdp grew on average 1.2% [7]. When the researchers looked at historical situations were debt-to-gdp was above 90% for a prolonged period, they discovered that the majority of these situations started out with a small event, but knee jerk reactions and over calculations led to years of negative effects. These prolonged effects come in the flavors of higher interest rates, higher inflation, and crowding out private investments [7].
One negative consequence of taking on more debt that we already are realizing is higher interest rates. In finance there is always that basic principle; return has to outweigh risk. When the United States was downgraded it signaled the world that it needed to demand more return as a result of the more risky investment of investing in the US. The United States spent $454 billion on servicing the national debt in 2011 and $359 billion in 2012 [8]. Currently the US is able to take on debt on extraordinary low rates. This allows the Federal Reserve rate to stay low which in turn lowers interest rates on everything from mortgages to student loans to car loans. Lower interest rates help spur the economy as people can take on debt cheaply which enhances their discretionary income. However, if interest rates rise, borrowers will spend a great chunk of their income on servicing debts and if they borrowed too much, they will be forced to default. As a result, security prices in the financial sector exposed to massive amounts of consumer loans will suffer as investors realize that Tier one capital ratios will not be sufficient. This in-turn will lead to decreased investor confidence and theoretically people will reign in their spending and keep money on the sideline. 
A second and equally negative effect of a high debt-to-gdp ratio is inflation. In this situation the government would monetize its debt, thus devaluing its currency to pay off the debt, which would lead to inflation. Inflation, simply defined, is rising prices and a fall in purchasing power. For example, $1 in 1999 bought a soda, but that same soda in 2013 cost $1.59. Since the same soda went to $1.59 from $1, there was inflation of 59%. Why is inflation bad? Well it isn’t really unless wages don’t rise. Inflation is particularly bad on those living on fixed incomes. Older generations relying on fixed incomes would exhaust their savings more quickly and become completely reliant on social security. Additionally inflation will hurt stock valuations, as more money is required for the basics. With rising cost of living expenses along with supporting parents, middle aged Americans will have very little income to invest and to spend on discretionary items which will lead to negative revenue growth for corporations. Thus, resulting in lower security prices. An additional consequence of monetizing the debt is hyperinflation, which can be explained by the quantity theory of money, but is beyond the scope of this paper. 
The third major impact of high debt-to-gdp ratio is that it crowds out private investment [7]. As the government continues to maintain a high debt-to-gdp ratio, there will be less money to invest into private companies. This in turn will hurt the innovative spirit of America, which will hurt economic growth. Less economic growth will lead to fewer opportunities and hurt America’s competitiveness in the world.  

Conclusions: What can [Redacted for Privacy] Learn?
	In conclusion there are several things that can be taken away from this to improve the [Redacted for privacy]. First, we must pay close attention to the consumer confidence index level. Historically it has a weak correlation, but in these changing and rapidly evolving markets, the correlation has grown dramatically. Second, we must keep an eye on the interest rates. High interest rates on massive amounts of debt can hamper prospective house and car buyers. Just look at a recent college graduate starting with a relatively low salary and high amounts of student debts. In a lot of cases it will be years of servicing student loan debts before they can afford a mortgage. Until then the economy will suffer. The financial sector should pay extremely close attention to banks with high exposure to consumer loans, as interest rates will have a major impact on the default rates. Lastly, on an investor level, I think that keeping debt as low as possible will help the individual out as well as the economy. As for solutions to solving the national debt there is really only one sensible option; cut spending below government revenue levels.

personalfinance,"PF gurus, this a good idea or wishful thinking?","so after finally getting done with my credit card debt, looking forward to 2014 came up with a brainstorming idea and wondering what other think.

have a bank of america better balance rewards credit card with a 14.xx interest rate (now that it is paid off, use it to pay for bjj every month then pay it off) and a discover it card (16.24% rate).

now 2 months ago had to get a new toolbox at my job (mechanic) so got a loan through snap on for 3500 (traded in my old box to bring the price down) and right now after fees and such sits at about 3600 at 18% interest that I pay 75 a week on (min is 45).

now I can pay however I want, credit card, debit, etx. I usually just use my debit card every week but got to thinking of another idea.

The BoA credit card has a credit transfer promo for either 0% for 6 months or 1.9% for 12, then my normal interest rate applies (along with a 4% transaction fee). This offer expires mid january. I will be moving into an apartment hopefully in the first two months of next year however if I can get a lease signed before then may be able make this work.

The idea is to pay off snap on with the discover card, make the 1% cash back on it hopefully use that to pay some down (not much but helps) then get a balance transfer onto the BoA card. While the 4% will hurt at first I think I can pay it off in a year (signed up for a 2 year loan woth snap on in case I hit trouble). The pros I see in this is the toolbox is then paid off so it can't be repo'ed in case I hit bad times, and will hopefully save money overall (interest rate on my card is lower on my cards than the loan, but is variable). Con's is they make not take the transfer and I will be stuck at a higher interest rate card or to get it all through the system that the promo offer may end first. After I sign the lease I am not too worried about my credit score.

So this a good idea or bad?

I had all my money in a target date fund aimed at 2040. However, bonds were doing so crappily this year (the only fund we can buy that actually went down this year) that I transferred the money to my own mix that mimicked the target fund but moved all the bond money to the G-fund, which is a special type of short term treasury security that is guaranteed to go up by the USG, right now at about 2% per year, and rarely more than 4% historically.

It's not that big of a deal since safer investments make up only about 15% of the portfolio (they're all pretty safe really; the riskiest thing we can buy is a small to medium cap index fund).

personalfinance,Confused about EV tax credits?,"Hi everyone! I searched and checked the sidebar, but I couldn't find any info about my question, so hopefully I'm not screwing anything up.

I'm not quite sure how federal/state tax credits work when purchasing electric vehicles.  Let's take two examples, one where I am a single person making $40k/yr and one where I make $80k/yr.  I understand that there is a federal credit of $7500 available.  

Now, if I make $40k/yr (and I can claim 1 exemption), I will have an effective income tax of about $4k for the year.  Since I have a $7500 credit from the Fed for buying the EV, would that mean I get all of that $4k of taxes back at tax time?  This would make my total federal income tax rate 0% for the year?

Now, the same idea, but making $80k per year.  At $80k, I would owe about $13.5k in taxes for the year.  After the 7500 credit, I would only owe $6k, correct?  Then my effective rate would be 7.5% for the year?

dogecoin,Merry Christmas my Doge Friends,"Twas the night before Doge, when all through the site
Not a creature was interested, not even /r/kites.
The wallets were hung on the desktops with care,
In hopes that St Doge soon would be there.

The users were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of Dogecoins danced in their heads.
And mamma in her ‘kerchief, and I in my hat,
fedora by the way, on my head it did sat

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my fapping to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like the night,
Then forgot that our basement had no window in sight

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
I could not even see I was too far below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a winter steam sale on my pc was near.

With an outdated system and a card that was shat .
I knew it was pointless to entertain that
So upstairs I went in search of good news,
And then I saw Doge, How could I lose? 

""Now Reddit! now, Bitcoin! now, DogeDice and Coinbeg!
On, Mining! On, market Let doge hump your leg!
To the top of the moon! to the top of it all!
Now stash away! stash away! stash away all!""

As doge appeared I knew I could fly,
The moon was so near so I took to the sky.
I invested in doge I learned what I can,
I made what I could .

i'm too drunk to try to rhyme anymore but I 
was going to get into how I was screwed out 
of doge and scammed on the market and lost everything but whats the point

Ennå kan nyvunne populariteten til valutaen, som var verdt nesten ingenting til April 2011 og som nå handler på rundt $1000, godt være dens angre.

Markedet overvåkere og regulatorer er oddsen over hvordan bitcoin skal håndteres, men som valuta gevinst prominence, stemme Advarsel mot bruken får høyere.

Frankrikes sentralbanken har slo det som ""svært spekulativ"" mens Kinas sa det ikke bør brukes som en valuta og utestengt bredden fra å tilby tjenester og produkter relatert til bitcoin.

EUs bank vaktbikkje også utstedt en advarsel til digital valutaen brukere, fortelle dem: ""Du bør være fullt klar over og forstår deres spesielle egenskaper"".

Selv om Federal Reserve sjef Ben Bernanke sa slike virtuelle valutaer ""hold langsiktige løfte"", kunne hans forgjenger Alan Greenspan ikke gi en iboende verdien til valuta.

Lansert i 2009 som oppfinnelsen av en mystisk datamaskin guru som går under pseudonymet Satoshi Nakamoto, er bitcoins skapt gjennom en komplisert matematisk formel.

I motsetning til hard valuta, er det ikke støttet opp av landets økonomisk aktivitet eller utstedt av en.

Bitcoins offisielle nettsted sa «alt som kreves for et skjema for å holde verdi er tillit og adopsjon».

""Når det gjelder Bitcoin, dette kan måles ved sin voksende base av brukere, selgere og startups. Som med alle valuta, bitcoin's verdi kommer bare og direkte fra folk villig til å akseptere dem som betaling,""sagt det.

Med rundt 12 millioner bitcoins i sirkulasjon i øyeblikket, børsverdi står på ca $10.57 milliarder. Formelen som brukes til å opprette den begrenser dens omløpet på 21 millioner bitcoins.

Tyskland besluttet å legalisere hverken det som valuta, så å kunne skatt, mens Bank of America's Merrill Lynch enhet spioneringen det som en betydelig verktøy for e-handel.

Tross alt, kan den digital valutaen overføres direkte mellom smartphones eller andre typer datamaskiner.

Men reiser dette også spørsmål at det ville bli brukt for kriminelle eller terrorister.

""Svært spekulativ"" valuta utgjør ""viss økonomisk risiko""

I September, valutaen kom under søkelyset etter amerikanske myndigheter nedlegge en website alarmert Silkeveien der narkotika og andre illegale varer ble handlet med bitcoins. Noen $3,6 millioner verdt bitcoins beslaglagt deretter.

Men den negative publisiteten førte også valutaen til seg oppmerksomheten til den virkelige verden.

Individuelle investorer interessert, hekta av eksempler som en norsk ung mann, som kjøpte $24 verdt av bitcoins fire år siden bare å innse at de er nå verdt $690,000 tilsvarende.

Kina ble den største markedet for valuta som investorer tiltrekkes til den over soaring verdien.

Men den kinesiske sentralbanken har flyttet å slå ned på det, utstede en sterk advarsel og innføre restriksjoner på hvordan de omsettes i landet.

""Bitcoin er en bestemt virtuell vare, ikke har samme juridiske status som valuta og ikke og bør ikke være sirkulert og på markedet som sådan, sa People's Bank of China (sentralbank) i en uttalelse i fellesskap med andre finansielle regulatorer.

Kinesisk banker og andre finansielle organisasjoner er utestengt fra å gi bitcoin-relaterte tjenester og produkter, sagt det.

Det kalles for forbedret kontroll av online trading plattformer for bitcoins å forsvare seg mot muligheten for hvitvasking og påpekt investeringsrisiko møtt av publikum.

Sentralbanken i Frankrike understreket også samme risiko, cautioning at ""svært spekulativ"" valutaen utgjør en ""viss økonomisk risiko"" for brukere.

""Selv om høy volatilitet i bitcoin av mulig interesse for personlige eller profesjonelle spekulanter, de bør være klar over risikoen de tar,"" sa banken.

Videre advart konverteringsmulighet av bitcoin ikke er tilgjengelig, og en investor kan ikke hans investeringer, det.

Sentralbanken bemerket at hvis en valuta som skal brukes som en modus for betaling, bør det oppfylle reglene mot hvitvasking av penger og dens garanti plattform bør overvåkes av sentralbanken i Frankrike.

Likevel banken har ingen oversikt over bitcoin, og oppfordret i stedet for å hindre at den virtuelle valutaen blir brukt i ulovlig transaksjoner.

Det pekte også på at sikkerheten for virtuelle treasuries for valutaen ikke er garantert med noen autoritet.

Sist onsdag, anerkjent et dansk selskap som spesialiserer seg på bitcoin betalinger at hackere hadde gjort unna med 1295 bitcoins verdt om lag en million dollar.

Og kinesiske kunder en Hong Kong-baserte elektroniske plattform mistet tilsvarende 2,43 millioner euro i bitcoins, når firmaet plutselig opphørte handel.

Likevel, leder av BTCChina, landets største Bitcoin trading plattformen, sier e-penger tilbyr en ny investering alternativet for kinesisk-en nasjon av savers.

When politicians err in US and elsewhere (Democratic bills failed to end Big Oil subsidies because of opposition from Republicans ► goo.gl/uOJC8M; more info ► goo.gl/9q9dSJ), we the people - regardless of political orientation - can create the smog-free future thru our next car purchase and choosing to install solar panels where we can.

reasons for buying your next car electric:

1.  help humanity since you no longer generate carcinogenic exhaust, otherwise known as smog, which kills millions of people each year ► goo.gl/jDj0hI and leads to lower IQ ► goo.gl/alNQIk and autism ► goo.gl/66nqwr.  Oil smog speeds up the arrival of all the main diseases ► http://www.ehhi.org/reports/exhaust/summary.shtml.

2.  save lives since you reduce heart attacks caused by traffic noise ►  goo.gl/Fuhvn.   Electric cars are much quieter, so you will be safer and protect your ears. Enjoy listening to music without damaging your ears.

3.   save humanity from oil wars that destroy the environment and kill countless civilians.  Iraq war trillions could have powered all US with solar/wind ► goo.gl/ZqN47.  

4.  you no longer have to change oil or spark plugs; no more smog check either; electric cars have 60% less parts, so you will go for repairs much less.

5.  bring the end of gas stations that poison the water wells with MTBE or other compounds leading to billions of dollars wasted in cleaning up the well water (example:  $0.4 billion settlement ► goo.gl/eKasZD)

6.  save money as you spend 4 times less money on fuel, since electricity is 4 times cheaper than gasoline as a fuel.  If you have enough solar panels,  you get free CLEAN fuel for life, since you charge at home and utilities pay you for energy you put on the grid.  Likewise, Tesla Motors offers free solar ☼ charging for life ► Tesla Motors Supercharger Event?  

7. 100% electricity from renewable sources is a reality in many areas of the planet and the more we demand electric cars, the faster we shift towards clean energy and away from fossil fuels. The sun can power the whole world with clean energy ►   https://plus.google.com/110265788529286523789/posts/R7ddJPExiz5.    On October 3rd 2013, Germany produced 60% of energy from solar and wind ► goo.gl/AS2zuj.    

8.  save money for noble purposes because electric cars are cheaper than many oil cars after the federal and state rebates:  in Colorado, you can buy a Nissan Leaf for only 15, 000, while in most other states for 18-21, 000.   ► http://www.evworld.com/news.cfm?rssid=31881. ﻿",energy,1387820895

personalfinance,A quick way to multiply your money this decade.,"*Hi everyone! This is a blogpost from my site Investing Noob, I wanted to share it in here as I've seen positive response from the links I placed (my bad, I know the norms now), and I wanted to share this with you in here in the right way for the sub forum, hope you can get something useful from it =)*

Some times over history, many times actually, there is the chance for people who is well informed to multiply their money, those are called market crashes, and we are heading into one, soon, and not any market crash, **A BIG ONE.**

**Currency Crash**

Every 40 or so years, the world experience a change of power when it comes to money, it happened to the athenians, to the romans, to the British Empire, and it is going to happen to the US Dollar, in fact, is already happening.

I hate to sound like the doomsday guy, but this is important, data says that the Dollar is going to crash, and is going to do it soon, the FED haven’t really done anything, Obamacare is a big scam for many many people, and I’m not saying they believe it is, they may or nor believe it, but they’re being scammed either way. and the US debt coupled with the debasement of the currencies **all over the world**, are creating a perfect financial storm, and won’t be pretty, many will suffer.

**Never let a good crisis go to waste**

Have you heard of Sir Winston Churchill? He was the one who said that, if you are a Hardcore History Podcast fan as I am, you may already know where I’m going.

Crisis are bad, are awful and no one wants them to happen, ok, some people may want them to happen, but we good hearted people don’t want them to, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t take advantage on them if we are informed enough to know they are coming, as I’ve said, some times over history, smart people have a chance to multiply their money, the ugly part is that your extra wealth is coming from people who is going to suffer, the ugliest part is that if you don’t capitalize on it, you will suffer as well, and you will help no one.

Think of this as an opportunity not only to help yourself, to provide for your family and to improve your life, but also as a chance to help those you love, in my case, I’m going to do as much as possible so that at the end of the incoming crisis, I can buy a house for my wife’s mother, and also help my parents and my brother to go trough it, you can do that as well, all you need is to be informed

**Never let a good crisis go to waste.**
- Sir Winston Churchill

**The best Investment you can make is education**

And that’s even more true when it comes to educate yourself about Investing, remember, you need to give your investments **direction and time**, but when it comes to something as complicated as timing a crisis, and knowing what is going to happen and when, well, that requires you to know. Yeah, you can go and buy Gold and Silver, you may even take a credit to buy commodities and consider that a “good credit” situation, and while those are good ideas, think of this:

* How do you know when to sell your commodities?
* Are you going to sell for a currency? Which one? How do you determine the right value?
* How do you know where to place your money in case of deflation? And in case of an hyper inflation?
* How do you time your credit so that you won’t go broke to the point you have to sell your gold at a lose and retain some debt?

It isn’t that simple, in fact it’s kind of challenging, but don’t fear, it isn’t really that hard, there is a lot of people out there doing their research, and you can actually know who of them will get it more or less right, because well, they have done it in the past.

**If you want to take advantage of what is happening right now**, you have to act first, and your first act isn’t to go buy gold, your first action should be to go out and read, there is no other way, unless you want to gamble!

Sounds like a lot of work? Well, there are people who thinks certain commodities like gold and silver will raise its purchasing value over 25 times, and some of this people know what they do, you have to ask yourself, is it worth to know enough to get into the train and multiply an investment 25 times this decade? That’s 25,000 for every 1,000 isn’t it? Well, I’ll do it for sure, and I hope you want to do it too.",finance,1387781391
personalfinance,"Hoping to get some ideas for how to proceed - late in life graduate, lots of written off debt, chance to jump on tuition reimbursement for masters... thoughts?","Hello!  I hope to get some advice from some wise minds here.

I'm 27 and I recently graduated with my bachelors.  My finances look as follows:

**Income**

$700 every 2 weeks (After tax, insurance, maxing employer 401K match, and auto deposit into parents account to help with house) - $18,000/yr

$900 on the last day of every month (Commission, after tax) - $10,800

*total income - $28,800*

Notes:  I rounded down a little bit just for the sake of simplicity.  My commission is on the low end, basically only if I do the minimum amount of work necessary.

--------------------------------------

**Total outstanding payable debts:**

* Credit Card - $625
* Federal Student Loan 1 - $1,370.35
* Federal Student Loan 2 - $2,735.96
* Federal Student Loan 3 - $4,013.36
* Federal Student Loan 4 - $4,759.20
* Federal Student Loan 5 - $5,795.36

*(Total Student Loan - $18,674.23)*

--------------------------------------


**Total written off debts** $17,000 (i.e. reposession, unpaid CC, being a basic asshole with credit)


---------------------------

Sorry if the formatting is hard to read, I'm trying to make it easy to follow.  I've been trying the ""snowball"" technique with my credit card, and should have it paid off hopefully if not on Dec 31 than it'll be January 3rd and it'll be paid off.

My student loans begin a repayment of $121.84 beginning January 6th.

With all that said, I'm wondering what I should do:

* I have some debts that are written off, but I feel pretty bad about that.  Should I go about getting the debts verified and then entering a repayment with them?

* I have the opportunity to take advantage of a loan reimbursement program through my work.  Should I enter an MBA program or continue my education and make use of it?  I really want to use it to seek out an education in another area of the country that my job said I could continue my role in.  I don't want to continue to have these student loans pile up though.

* I recently opened up a savings account, and I want to automatically deposit 10% into there as a cushion.  I also want to separate my personal spending from my debt payoff.  Would having a savings account, and a second checking account that receives money for things like food, gas, and personal entertainment?  That would be a total of three bank accounts, plus one credit card account (until it's paid off)

What do yall think?  I have a pretty good grasp of what to do/how long it would take but I'm most concerned about the written off debts and student loan repayments.

personalfinance,Protip: I Bonds for Emergency Funds &amp; More,"I find myself mentioning I Bonds (US Series I Savings Bonds) a lot both here and in /r/portfolios ([I cross-posted this there as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/portfolios/comments/1thoi3/protip_consider_i_bonds_for_emergency_savings_and/)) so I thought it worth making a little post about them. Here are some of the benefits:

* They match or exceed inflation in their returns, at least before taxes, which is better than a lot of bond funds these days and without the interest rate risk

* They can effectively expand your tax-deferred space since taxes do not come due until you cash them in - good for someone who wants to do long-term savings beyond their retirement allocation (and/or you can cash them in during low-income years to save on taxes)

* They can be cashed in any time after a year (with a 3-month interest penalty - 5 years with no penalty) so if something better comes along you can always switch things up without taking a big hit

* Related to the previous point: since they are liquid after one year, you can ultimately shift some emergency funds into I Bond form and beat CD and savings account rates (as long as you do the shift slowly so you always have enough liquid for emergencies without running into the 1-year minimum)

They aren't for everyone, but they have a lot of neat features including the above - if anyone has critiques or something to add, please feel free!

**Bonus Tip:** I Bonds are limited to 10K per person per year, so for anyone who wants to and can buy more than that now is the time (you can buy 10K for 2013 before the year ends, then 10K again on the 1st)",finance,1387770926

personalfinance,"[Long] PF please help me! Severely depressed in a job I was forced to take to help put myself through school. Schoolwork, sanity, mental health now suffering. Could this be the 1 exception to taking out a student loan to help with living expenses? Job details, monthly expenses, debts, listed in post","This is a throwaway. I am at my mental, emotional, and physical breaking point with a job I have been at for over 4 months that I felt forced to take in order to make my monthly expenses. I am severely depressed, cry to and from work every day and often lock myself in the bathroom and cry as well. The demanding nature and hours of this job has every other part of my life suffering, including school. I know I need a new job but my limited schedule, high monthly expenses, leave me feeling really stuck. I need help, advice, anything.

**Background**: I am early 20s, live at home with my parents in a suburb of NYC (high cost of living here, some of the highest taxes in the country), still in school. I do not pay rent. 

**School**: Finishing up BA degree, graduating in June. I go to school at night, 3 nights a week in NYC. 45min commute each way that is down from 1.5 hours each way when I was taking mass transit. Our program is cross registered with another college where we take classes with both schools throughout the trimester. Typical trimester is about 18 credits. We have a federal grant that pays tuition for the school in NYC but the cost of tuition rose and there was a gap, so it is now all of the student's responsibility to pay the difference. Financial aid is not offered to us. If we want/need it, we would have to take out personal student loans. A certain number of internship hours are required each trimester so one workday a week is recommended to dedicate to that. I am only available to work 4 days during the work week because of that. Sundays I have another job. Come the spring our internship hours required are doubling so I fear I will have to dedicate yet ANOTHER day during the workweek to internship hours which will be a huge hit in pay.

**Jobs**: Worked as a nanny for a few families over the course of a bout 4 years. Recently worked for a family for a year, was supposed t to continue, but the mom's schedule changed suddenly and because of my school hours, it was physically impossible for me to work for them. I was forced to look for a new job in August. I also have a part time job as a waitress that I work at on Sundays. I have been there for over 5 years and keep 1 shift a week so I can make extra cash. There are no extra shifts available there for me to pick up. After I lost my job in August I was frantic to find another nanny job. I applied to over 60 nanny postings over the course of 2 weeks, went on many interviews, etc. I accepted a job with a family to have them ""retract"" the job 2 days later because their nanny for 2 years ago said she wanted it instead. Ok. Start the process over. It was getting down to the wire and bills were piling up. I was offered a job from a family that was extremely un-ideal. 4 days a week, 10 hours a day (615am-430pm), nanny cams, a child who is extremely difficult (how the parents described the child), they want me to be a pre-school teacher basically. No tv except at meal time. VERY underpaid - paying me $10/hour, going rate in this area is $15/hour. I work on a teacher's schedule. When the parents are off, so am I, but I do not get paid. Because of this, it is hard to budget money when it's not consistent.

This job is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I wake up at 515am in the mornings, leave my house at 6am, work for 10 hours, then go to school for 3 hours. I get home at 10pm at night. By the time I shower, get my things ready for the next day and do a bit of reading for school, I get about 5-5.5 hours of sleep a night. I have gained about 15lbs, I am severely depressed, I cry all day, my school is severely suffering because I have decreasing time to do my work and my mental alertness is now complete shit because I am so exhausted and depressed all the time. I have grown resentful of the children I care for and am no longer a good nanny. All I care about is passing the time as quickly as possible and biding my time until it's nap time and I get a minor reprieve. After being a nanny for over 4 families and always loving my job, this particular child has completely broken my spirit and I feel like a part of me has really died. I no longer want children and I now understand why parents of difficult children sink into deep depressions and become unable to competently care for children. Sleep deprivation and feeling hopeless are very strong emotions/experiences and can affect you in ways you could never imagine.

**Debt**

- Immediate: $2k in credit card debt. Appx. $1k on 2 cards. 0%APR. Most of this is from Time Payment Plans for school. 
- Long Term: Student loans. Been in school for over 5 years. $50-$70k. Deferred until graduation. All will be eligible for loan forgiveness after 10 years, so I will have to make the minimum payments and that's it (please correct me if I have the loan forgiveness info wrong).

**Monthly Expenses**:

- Car payment: $200
- Gas: Varies. Anywhere from $50-$100. 
- Insurance/phone: $100
- Credit Card: $200 ($100 each. Would like to increase this as much as possible to pay this debt down faster)
- Time Payment Plans: $400 ($200 to each school)
- Groceries: varies depending on coupons/deals/produce that is in season. Typically around $50-$125

**Monthly Medical Expenses**: I am on my parents insurance. My medications are extremely high in copays. Trust me, this is a rough bullet to take each month. I have been on about 7 kinds of birth control over the past 8 years and all of them have negatively affected my body (not just weight gain, actually negative side effects) and this is the only one that has not. Same for depression meds. Only one that has not negatively affected me. I am on birth control to manage PCOS that I was diagnosed with at 15. Therapy is at a community counseling center and much cheaper than most other options available to me. 

- Birth control: $75 (copay)
- Anxiety/depression medication: $75 (copay)
- Therapy/counseling: $72 (copay)
- Metformin: $15

**Not Consistent Monthly Expenses**:

- EZ Pass: $40. My boyfriend is long distance and I visit him about once a month. The $40 is for round trip. I understand this is a luxury and many people would suggest cutting this out. Please understand this is the one thing that brings me happiness and the only thing I allow myself to ""splurge"" on. I love my boyfriend and our visits are the only things that get me through my shitty days at work.
- This is also why my gas payments vary. Obviously more when I drive to see him. Cost to take amtrak is slightly more than the gas it takes me to get there + tolls

**Options**

The fact that my school work is suffering is the biggest red flag to me. I can be exhausted, overweight, and depressed but if I fail out of school I truly have hit rock bottom and everything I worked for is for naught. Staying in school is so important. I am very worried about how to make this work. It is obvious I need a new job. What I'm stuck on is this: I can only work 3-4 days during the workweek because of my internship hours requirement and weekends I already am committed to another job on Sundays so that leaves Saturdays open if necessary. As seen from my monthly expense list, I have a high list of monthly expenses.

To preemptively answer a few suggestions I feel the community will make. **In regards to the car payment** I took mass transit to school for all of last year. Monthly train pass + monthly subway card came out to appx. $325. My commute was 1.5 hours each way. Not having a car really limited potential jobs I could get because I was limited to my area (public transportation where I live not in NYC is not only unreliable but insanely inefficient and not designed with the commuter in mind). Also, the costs of taking trains to see my boyfriend were expensive. I leased a car so I don't have to pay maintenance and I knew it was reliable. So my car payment, insurance, and gas is less than what I was paying and has also cut down on my commute time (very important for an extra 15 mins of sleep at night) and given me more freedom as far as jobs I can work/apply to.

I read this sub every day. I am aware this sub advocates avoiding student and personal loans at almost any and all costs. I tend to agree with this information because student loans truly fuck you dry up the ass especially if they are personal and not government student loans. This is also because I already have a high amount of student loans already. Could  this be the 1 time where it could be OK to take out a small student loan at a low interest rate to cover costs of living while in school? Just to minimally sustain me so I can quit this nanny job, pay off immediate debts, get myself back to a positive and functioning state of mind, catch up to schoolwork, etc? Then after 2 months find a new job that fits my lifestyle better. I get this still sounds crazy but I feel like I need help somewhere.",finance,1387766728

I've recently come across a duplex for sale at $285,000 that I am very interested in buying. The duplex is very nice and well maintained, and located in the nicest part of town. It has 3 bedrooms per unit, hardwood floors, spacious kitchen and living areas, stone counter tops, fireplace, etc. Basically, I believe the unit to be of sound structure and significantly undervalued for its amenities and location.

The question is: Should I make a hardship withdrawal on my 401k to pay for the down payment?

Here's the pro's and con's I see so far:

Pros:

* Unit appears to be undervalued and seems like a good investment. Would expect units similar in size, condition, and location to go for $350,000+. Unit was last sold in May 2007 for $406,000!
* Would be able to rent out the other side for approx. $1200 per month. If I took that money and also contributed $900 of my own money and made mortgage payments of $2100 every month, I could pay off a $265,000 mortgage in 11 years.
* Owning a duplex in full at the age of 35 would be amazing!
* Interest rates remain low at the time of this writing, but are almost certain to rise soon. With my credit score, I expect to be able to get a highly favorable rate of approx. 5%.
* The rental market in my town (Portland, OR) is extremely in favor of landlords right now. More people looking to rent than units are available. Expect to have very little trouble finding suitable tenants. Very good likelihood of being able to raise rent to $1600 in a couple of years.
* I am a strong young man who is handy with tools. I have no problems with installing appliances, unclogging toilets, scrubbing mold, or cleaning carpets.
* Ownership of the unit provides a safe haven to live at if I ever experience adverse economic events in the future. I can rely mostly on the tenants rent to pay the mortgage if needed. Conversely, if the secondary unit remains un-rented, I could cover the entire cost of the mortgage payment myself (at my current salary).

Cons:

* Hardship withdrawal on 401k is subject to taxes. Unsure of impact.
* If I empty my 401k completely and start over, I will lose about $1,000,000 of potential 401k earnings over the course of my lifetime (assuming a 10% avg. return) 
* Currently locked into an apartment lease with an early termination fee of approx. $2500. Unsure how to pay for this if I decide to move ahead with the plan.
* Responsible for all expenses associated with plumbing &amp; electrical repairs, appliance repairs, carpet cleaning, tenant screening, insurance, etc.
* I know next to nothing about the home buying process.

personalfinance,Looking for suggestions on how to better invest and save...,"Hi r/personalfinance

I’m looking for opinions on how to invest my savings and suggestions with my current financial situation.  I can't really be an ""active"" investor - I don't have a lot of time.  I would like to put my $$ somewhere and leave it, but also want to make sure I am maximizing my potential to make my money work for me.


Almost 27 years old, make $75k/yr

12% of paycheck is allocated to Roth 401k

Of the actual paycheck I get minus Roth 401k contribution:

15% into savings (house/investments)

35% for “wants” (going out, buying non necessities, gym, travel)

50% for “needs” (rent, car insurance, groceries, etc)


My money is allocated as follows:

- In savings accounts earning 0.05% APY:

Emergency fund: $10,266

Other savings: $23,125 (house and/or investments)

- Roth IRA: $36,895 in “Moderate Aggressive” mutual funds

- Roth 401k (current job): $5,895 in aggressive target date funds - currently not getting any match but will start in a few months, 100% maxed at 6% of income

- 401k from previous job: $6,902 - I believe a moderate aggressive portfolio, don’t remember

- Other savings accounts earning 0.75% APY: $3,911 (vacation, car repairs, gifts, miscellaneous savings)

- No debt

Why do I have savings accounts at two banks - before anyone asks - the one earning 0.05% I wanted as a “do not touch under any circumstances” (out of sight out of mind), and the other earning 0.75% is savings that I would spend in the short term, also linked to my checking.

(now that I type this out I didn’t realize how low the interest rate is on the first savings account listed...must have gone down a lot without me realizing since I first opened it.  I should probably move that to a higher yield savings account)

Questions:

- Looking to buy an apartment in about a year.  I have been looking at the $350k range (live in NYC, gets you a tiny one bedroom at most).  Down payment - Parents will lend ~$100k + any $ I can put down.  I don’t want to live in the city forever and figured I could buy a place for now, a few years, then rent it out when I want to move.

- Is there a better place to put my $ to buy a place?  It seems the best I can do is a high yield savings since I’m looking to use it in a year.

- Is there a better place to put my $ for the emergency fund?

- Am I saving too little/much?  

- Should I put all the $$ I can towards a down payment, or should I save some $$ to invest in other things (and what other things)?

- Any suggestions on how to better invest/allocate my money?

Thanks!",finance,1387922937

I took the advice of this sub and looked at CUStudentLoans to consolidate. Unfortunately, I got turned down due to my cosigner having too high a debt to income ratio. 

I make enough to qualify for the loan on my own, but my credit isn't great either (high 600s.) I don't know anyone else who would be willing to cosign for me. 

Looks like there's only one option for me to bring down that 11+%, and that's to bring up my credit score. Do the counseling agencies help? If so, does anyone know where I can go to get a honest and reputable one? If not, anyone aware of other options outside of CUStudentLoans for private loan consolidation?",finance,1387912606

investing,Why are Bond ETF's returns so terrible?,"Why would you ever invest in a US treasury ETF when you could get a much better return by just investing directly in US debt?

TLT, for example, is a ""20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF"". It has returned -15% YTD. Were you to outright buy US Bonds (30 Yr) intending to hold them to maturity, you would have made nearly 3% YTD. Why wouldn't you do this?

I'm not as ignorant as this question might make me sound - I understand that these funds have internal turn-over that makes them sensitive to changes in interest rates, and that now is a particularly bad time to invest in anything that profits from falling interest rates. But looking at historical returns of others such as GOVT or SCHR, I don't understand why you would ever want to use these. The ETF is more liquid, but liquidity isn't worth a -15% return, is it? And you can buy US debt in increments of $100, so that's not a concern here either...

dogecoin,St. Shibe's thing for Christmas,"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all throughout /r/dogecoin

Not a creature was stirring, not even bitcoin

_

The stockings were hung by this subreddit with care,

in hopes that St. Doge would soon be there

_

The shibes were nestled all snug in their beds

While all their visions danced in their heads;

_

And St. Doge in his garment, and I in my fedora

Had just settled down to light his Menorah

_

While out on the web there arose such a clatter,

I sprang from the subreddit to see what was the matter!

_

Away to the homepage I flew like a flash

Tore open the frontpage and opened a new tab with a crash.

_

The redditors dance with their newlyfound altcoins,

Drawing ire from them bursting forth from the seams,

_

When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,

But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny Coindeer

_

With a little old driver; nimble as a rogue

I knew in a moment must be St. Doge

_

More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,

And he whistled, and barked and called them by name;

_

""Now Peercoin! Now Litecoin! now Feathercoin and Stablecoin!

On, Quarkcoin! on Peercoin! on Namecoin and Ripple!

_

To the top of the charts! To the top of the moon!

Now pump away! pump away! pump away all!

_

As hasherates that before a cgminer fly,

When they meet with a train, bound for the sky

_

So up to the front page the cryptos they flew

With the sleigh full of dreams, and St. Doge too.

_

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof

The prancing and pawing of each little hoof

_

As I drew in my head, and was turning around,

Down the reply box St. Doge came with a bound.

_

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his toe,

And his clothes were all tarnished with litecoiners and co;

_

A bundle of coins he had flung on his back,

And he looked like a merchant just opening his pack.

_

His eyes-- how they twinkled! His whiskers how merry!

His cheeks were like pillows, his body so hairy!

_

His droll little mouth was drawn up in surprise,

And the look on his face, who knows what implies;

_

The stump of a bitcoin he held tight in his mouth,

And the value it rose despite the Chinese going south;

_

He has a broad snout and a furry soft belly.

That shook, when he laughed after a mention on the telly.

_

He was fuzzy and plump, a right jolly old dog,

And I laughed when I saw him, partly due to my home made grog;

_

A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,

Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;

_

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,

And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk

_

And laying his paw aside of his nose,

And giving a nod, up the catalog he rose;

_

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,

And away they all flew like the down of a thistle

_

But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,

Bitcoin,My story. And what I think of Bitcoin...,"*TL;DR at the bottom. I'm not seeking attention or sympathy. Please keep this in mind!*  
  
 
Take a look at this chart.  
http://imgur.com/6vbQGhk  
  
*You may notice that this isn't a Bitcoin chart.*  
This is my grandparents' home in which they bought 13 years ago. This is also my home.  
  
The economy was practically booming here in Dalton, GA around the time they look the loan out for this place. Grandma worked, grandpa worked a lot. It was awesome. I moved in after a fallout with my dad. I honestly felt like I was livin' the good life. Cause this house was awesome. It isn't too big. But, it's way better than everywhere else I've lived.  
Damn, in retrospect, my grandparents are awesome. Anyways...  
  
Then **BOOM!**  
Two-thousand-mofn-8. Economy becomes shat upon. Our particular area being hit slightly harder than others... since Dalton is widely known as the ""Carpet Capitol"" of the world.  
  
People lost their houses, banks took their houses, cut eachothers throats on *selling the houses*, so everyone quit making houses.  
In order for carpet to be sold in orderly fashion, houses need to be made, right?!  
  
  
This area basically turned into pure chaos. Grandparents were able to keep their jobs... *for about a year*. Then, a year after the job losses, they filed Chapter (something) *bankruptcy* , where they kept the car, the house, and just had to get caught up. 
  
Back to the chart! This entire time they've been paying the oh-so-lovely mortgage interest, while the value of the house kept dropping. I believe they had to get a second mortgage over time. Or something like that. We lasted a couple years as we still owe more than what the house is worth...
  
Till last Friday. They talked to the bankruptcy lawyer and found out they would be losing this house which they busted their awesome-asses for.   We're losing the place I've called home for more than half my life.  
  
  
**TL;DR**  
I am now 22 years old and I believe we would still have this house and Dalton would be in better shape had Bitcoin showed up earlier to beat the shit out of these wretched banks.  Why?  
Because, I know Bitcoin is the messiah to our country's economy. Maybe not 5 years from now, maybe not 10, but it will take it's place... eventually.  **People like my family and I... your average Americans... will soon be free of the economical bondage that is the federal reserve.**",cryptocurrency,1387892113

Bitcoin,It's so unfair: the rich get richer...,"**...until they don't.**

The first part (title) is what I used to think. Taking a systematic view, I thought due to interest money must concentrate in the hands of a few given enough time... the rich get richer. I thought this was hugely unjust and I still do.

**Except: it's not the case when sound money is used.**

Why not? Well, because of risk. When you lend out money or invest it, there is always risk involved. Risk of total or partial loss. You can fuck up and lose money. With no ""lender of last resort"", you're screwed. Your money is irreplacably gone, no matter how too big to fail you are.

**Then why *do* the rich get richer?**

Because of the bad kind of money we use. It can be printed and it will be printed to bail out the rich in case they screw up with their ""investments"" (bets or gambles would be a better word). 

*They don't have to suffer the consequences of their actions* and that's neither the basis for a well-functioning economy nor the basis for a level playingfield. In addition, the way the money is injected into ""the economy"" (or not) leads to gross capital misallocations: all kinds of shit is done that wouldn't otherwise be done because it just doesn't make any sense and noone demands it. Also the function of saving is destroyed due to distorted interest rates. The price signals simply don't work efficiently.

**...until they don't**

Thanks to Bitcoin we (the people) now have a tool to make these parasites suffer the consequences of their actions in the future. All we have to do is use sound money, like gold, silver and of course crypto.

This is the single most compelling reason for me to devote myself to making cryptocurrency a reality: a better world, more just towards the people and less exploitative towards mother earth.

I know some find this romantic or unrealistic. I don't. We have a chance here, a big one. Using sound money solves so many problems in such an easy all-encompassing way it's a chance too good to let go of on grounds of cynicism, fear, lack of imagination or enviousness.

* It seems that mutual funds that invest in bonds right now will likely lose money in the short term as interest rates rise

personalfinance,Help. Drowning in Student Loan Debt. 100k,"Hello. I recently graduated with my M.B.A. I was lucky to find work right out of college (mind you after countless interviews with employers who expected me to have 8 years of experience right out of the gate and wanted to pay me a fraction of that, thousands of hours filling out information that was readily available on submitted resumes, and , really the mind numbing reality that I wouldn't be able to afford a family or anything really for nearly half a decade if not longer,) and even luckier to get a better offer three months after working for the Feds.

I currently make 48,313, but also as part of my current job I am given 20,000 (10k/year paid biweekly ~ 386 each pmt,) incentive in terms of student loan repayment. Effectively, this pushes my income to 58,313 as the 10k/year is reported at wages (which is really shitty, but, what am I going to do, say no?)
I have a guaranteed promotion coming up in September that would effectively put my non adj AGI to 68,404 a year including the final installment of 10k a year.

The third year, I gain another promotion that effectively amounts what will likely be a 3-4 thousand dollar increase from the previous amount, so we'll say 71,500 / year (but no more Student loan repayment.) From there it's roughly three years before I can expect another promotion of roughly 12-13,000, with annual increases likely not exceeding 1-3% in that time.

So, this story all begins when I was 18 and like everyone and their mother was told I had to go to college in order to make something of myself. I went to a 4 year school, roughly an hour away and lived on campus all four years. The bill for that was roughly 80k. Add in the M.B.A. for another 20k, and I started off September with ~ 108k in student loan debt.

Yes, I know, it's all my fault for not knowing that I was committing myself to indentured slavery and for not having parents who had any semblance of financial background. It's my fault the great recession garnished wages to comparative levels not seen since the great depression, and made the minimum wage job I worked in grad school feel like a five star job when nothing else was hiring, I know this, but fear not -- I'm responsible.

I had to move quick when I got the new position. Basically wiped out my savings. I then made a huge payment on one of my loans.

Here are my current loans:
Discover - 12824 (8.875% Shoot me in the face god damn it.) min 147.36 Citi - 11565 (5.25%) min 78.09 Fraternity Loan - 11834 (4.25%) min 100.40 Discover again - 6219 (3.62%) min 36.76 Sallie mae - 1700 (3.25) min 50

The rest are federal loans Acct 1 is 34415, acct 2 is 8075, acct 3 is 7211, Acct 4 is ~9200 perkins at 1700.
My current game plan is to knock down the highest interest rate first. Unfortunately the Student loan repayment only can be attributed to federal loans, which is a sizeable chunk of my income (Earning 48313, being taxed as earning 58313.) I qualified and signed up for the IBR and pay 0 pmt on the federal loans. I imagine I will be able to distribute the Student Loan Repayment to cover federal min payments at the very least and then assail high interest stafford loans as a priority. My current game plan is to continue utilizing IBR and continue to pray that the Student Loan Fairness act knocks down Public Student Loan Forgiveness to 5 years, while going after those high interest rates one at a time. By the time I eliminate the Discover Loan (I estimate roughly a year and some odd months,) I will have a decision to make on whether to continue paying the minimum payments for highest interest rates (private OR federal,) or whether to bet on being employed for five/ten years and hoping it's forgiven and just pay min payments on fed loans.
All told, including the SLRepayment I am on track to pay 18500 or so in year one, and intend on lowering that to 17200 (god forbid I take one vacation in seven years.) in year two, and then 20,000 from there on out until completion.

Given that equates to ~ 710 out of my pocket every month (SLR = 760 a month for a total of 1470/month lmfao, i'm paying a mortgage on an invisible mansion,) from bringing home roughly 2120, after food, rent, gas, basic supplies...shit's tight. Anyone have any obscure practices they know of, such as finding a low interest loan to payoff the high interest student loan -- or any good tips on surviving on dirt poor budget without wanting to kill your best friend who took 5.5 years to graduate with an undergrad in bullshit and now works for his family, the girl who only has 25k in loans because her family wasn't broken and she had time to devote / was taught the importance of obtaining scholarships / had everything handed to them, or people on their 4-5th vacation in two years, three kids, et al?
Aside from indenturing myself further by finding a second job (lmfao at reasonable employment expectations even with an M.B.A. for a second shift job where I reside,) pretending that starting a business with massive startups is a viable solution to massive crippling debt, or ending myself -- what can I really do here?

Also, fight the power.
I always see the average student loan debt and wonder if these people graduated college from the local community college, or simply failed out after one semester at basically any public/private university. I know if I'm having trouble -- there are many, many more out there who have it far worse...and I just don't get how this isn't going to explode.",finance,1387872012

personalfinance,Is it worth it for me to consolidate my student loans?,"Hi all, I'm going to keep this as basic as I can, but please let me know if you need more detail to help me make a decision.

I have approximately $56k total  in student loan debt.

$26k in Chase Private Loans (Variable Rates)

* 5k at 5%
* $5.5k at 5.75%
* $5k at 6.5%
* $5.5k at 6.6%
* $5k at 6.75%
* $500 at 7.25%

$7k in Federal Perkins Loans (Fixed Rate) 

* $7k at 5% 

$23k in Federal Stafford Loans (Fixed Rate)

* $5k at 4.5%
* $2k at 5.6% 
* $5k at 6%
* $11k at 6.8%

I have an offer from SoFi to consolidate all of my student loans in either:

* 10-Year variable rate starting at 3.92%
* 5-Year fixed rate at 5.625%

I am not sure what to do. I think these are my options, I'd like some advice on which one to choose.

1. Put all $56k into the 10-Year Variable (Risky, but best potential value)
2. Put only the loans with interest rates &gt; 5.625% into the 5-Year Fixed rate ~$37k (Safe, best safe value)
3. Put all of my private variable rate loans and only the fixed rate loans &gt; 5.625% into the 5-Year fixed rate ~$42k (Safest, but might not be the best value)
4. Put all $56k into the 5-Year Fixed (Simplicity, worst value)

Are there any options I'm missing out on here? I have a pretty good credit score (~760-770) and I can afford putting about $1000 into my student loans every month. Is a 5.625% fixed rate a good fixed rate or do you think I can do better elsewhere? 

**TLDR: I have a 3.9% variable or a 5.6% fixed consolidation offer on the table. $37k of my $56k loans are above the 5.6% rate and about half are variable rates. Should I consolidate my loans? If so, what's the best strategy?**

personalfinance,Help me get my life together?,"So I think I may be in a pickle here Reddit. 

I am going to lay it all out on line, judge me all you want for my past choices (ALL OF WHICH HAVE ALL BEEN HORRIBLE) but I need some help. 

This upcoming semester is my last semester of school. I have been going on and off for the past 7 years, and I am finally going to be done.  I am going to be getting a Bachelor’s Degree, major is Sociology and minor is Religious Studies; basically the most in demand degree in the world. I am going to get any job I want. 

Here is the story; I have 40K in a bank student loan that is maxed out. I live in Canada and have about 13K in Canada Student Loans. I have a credit card at 11% interest rate with 11K maxed out. I have a car loan that is almost paid off, less than 3.4K owing. Total debt: a massive 68K. 

I have a job with a crown corporation, which is great while I am still in school, except I am a casual employee and only guaranteed 12 hours a week, and I try to pick up as many shifts as I can. But I work in a call center and the hours vary, I could work 8-2 one day and then 2-8 the next. I make a good wage; $23/hour so I don’t want to give it up and it has great opportunities for full time employment after I am done school. 

My pay cheques vary each pay period because my hours vary and it makes it hard to stay on a budget. Right now I get between $600 and $900 every 2 weeks. 

These are my monthly payments:
Rent - $550
Utilities - $120
Loan - $210
Credit Card Min Payment - $230
Student Loan Interest - $150
Registration for car - $63
Gym Membership - $40
Bank Fees - $10
This doesn’t include things like food, gas, etc. 

I have made STUPID money decisions including: using student loan money to go on a trip, buying concert tickets, buying dumb shit, etc. Really nothing of substance and I am regretting it. 

Right now, I cannot afford to live. My parents are helping a lot but I CANNOT ASK THEM FOR MORE MONEY. Another problem, I have to pay around $2000 in tuition for next semester and have no idea how I am going to do it. 

As a student, and with my job deducting a lot of income tax, I should get a fair amount back by end of February. However tuition is due on Feb 1, and I am just planning on paying it late. 

This is basically consuming all of my life and I am not sure what to do. I have a second job that I work on Sundays and make $11/hr. I usually work 3 Sundays a month, so that basically covers my interest for my student loans.

Bitcoin,"Thanks to r/bitcoin and BC, I bootstrapped my business!","**Back Story:** Against the judgement of my inner circle, I bought about 1k worth of bitcoins during Summer 2012. I was working at a start up at the time, but felt that after 6 years of working corporate gigs, it was time for an exit plan. I didn't think of bitcoins as a crazy get rich scheme, just a bit of diversity in my current portfolio and I've been a big [Shadowrun enthusiast](http://www.shadowruntabletop.com/) forever, so owning real life versions nuyen/credsticks would be awesome.

**Fast forward to October 2013:** I'm laid off from said start up. No love lost. I get a letter in the mail saying that I qualify for [SEAP](http://www.esd.wa.gov/uibenefits/specialservices/training/self-employment-assistance-program.php) (I live in Seattle, btw). 

**What Exactly Is SEAP**; the US  federal government/ state government give you UI benefits while you build a business. Downsides, that you have to pay for business courses, government paperwork(trademarks, LLC, etc), store fronts and the like out of your own pocket. Shit be expensive; especially if you are manufacturing things. In my case, it's [body and hair care](http://glattapapa.com/) for interracial couples and families.

**So where does bitcoin come in?** Well, I'm a black American woman and when you're starting a business, [you can get loans](http://newsone.com/2672818/black-women-have-better-chances-of-getting-loans-study-says/), but there is a caveat. What is conveniently ignored about Black women getting business loans is even if you have excellent credit, the interest rates are higher than most...exorbitantly high in fact. So when the BC market was high, I got a kooky idea and sold half of my small amount of bitcoin, tucking the other half away for safe keeping. 

Needless to say, my very first venture is completely bootstrapped and debt free; bitcoin was my 'angel investor' when all typical financial institutions wanted me in debt for damn near eternity.

So again, thank you [r/bitcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/) for providing so much information on what trading houses to use, minting, other vendors who accept BC and how it worked for them. I know there are lot of articles about how bitcoin is the new ['tulip'](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/bitcoins-the-new-tulip-bulb-bubble/article16059126/) or lucky individuals who are ['BC rich'](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-10/meet-the-bitcoin-millionaires), but there are little guys like me out there who use BC as a great tool and I would certainly recommend it for the aspiring entrepreneurs who don't want to be bogged down by loans.

I'm a college student, and this isn't my only credit card (about $1800 combined in others to date) but it is my highest APR. I currently have cards with Chase, Citi, Discover, Regions and CapitalOne. I have tried to apply for other cards with the same financial institutions and am always denied (even from prequalified offers... go figure) because I already have a card with those companies. I have good credit, never miss payments and almost always pay more than the minimum balances pending my income. I have a few ideas in mind and would like some help resolving this financial burden.

Is there any other company that would offer me a lower interest rate / free balance transfer?

Is there a way to get my interest rate lowered with Chase?

With my good credit, is there any way to get a loan to pay off these cards? Anything under 18% seems grand right now, and my student loans (very little, don't worry) are only at 3-5%. All things considered, I'm not totally concerned about the debt because I'm aware I haven't been in a career or much in the way of investment opportunities (due to being almost non-liquid), but I really would like to get some experienced insight into how to handle this situation most effectively.

Context: I've recently landed my first real job, making $54k/yr at 24 years old. Could be worse. I'm in the process of finally setting up my banking accounts the way I want them, as well as putting money away for an emergency fund. No consumer debt of any kind, large student loan debt with low interest rates (paying the minimums and looking forward to Public Service Loan Forgiveness after 120 payments). I think I'm doing a decent job building credit and increasing my credit score.

As I learn more and begin my foray into investing for retirement, my question is this: my employer offers a 401(k) program, but no employer match. With that in mind, which would be a better place for me to put my currently precious dollars: the 401(k) without the employer match/contribution, or a Roth IRA? As I understand it, contributions to the 401(k) are pre-tax, and disbursements are taxable, whereas in the Roth IRA, contributions are post-tax, and disbursements are not taxable. Is this correct?

If the answer for choosing between the two is simple, would you mind explaining it as well, not only for my benefit, but for the benefit of other readers?

2011 was closer to 50k.

2013 I hit the bitcoin jackpot; while also traveling about half the year, and working on a startup the other half.

My income for 2013 including capital gains will be something like 45k.

Bitcoin,"Having doubts about Bitcoin - I don't think it's going to fail, I'm worried it will succeed.","Hello, guys. I've been a lurker on this board for about a year and a half, but haven't posted until now.

I have, for about a year, been a user and advocate of Bitcoin. I've made more than a few purchases with Bitcoin, have used it to send money to friends overseas, and I operate a 7.5 gH/s miner that I have seen return on investment with. I've also sorta evangelized Bitcoin in my social sphere and several of my friends actually use Bitcoin as well due to me.

I'm not a pillar of the Bitcoin community, but I say this because I want to stress I'm not some uneducated troll, either.

Here's the thing, though: I'm starting to have doubts about the wisdom of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has some very important qualities and uses that I think the world needs - most notably, the ability to move money easily/cheaply, and the ability to send money across borders. Frankly, I think that up to this point, Bitcoin has been a net plus in the world.

However, I worry about the future, because if Bitcoin does wind up replacing the Dollar, the Euro, etc, as so many Bitcoiners say is its destiny, then... well, in my opinion, the global economy is going to have problems.

Some of the more libertarian types here may disagree, but it is widely agreed on fact that *government manipulation of the currency, if done in a responsible fashion, makes the economy more stable*. There's good reason to believe this - both theoretical, mathematical, and most of all historical. I can debate this if you like, but...

So if Bitcoin grows to ever-wider acceptance, pushing out or at least seriously competing with traditional currencies, the Federal Reserve, the ECB, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and so forth will have a much harder time managing interest rates and the economy. This leads to more volatile markets, more economic inefficiency... less growth and more poverty.

More immediately, it's becoming clear that large corporations and investment banks have begun utilizing Bitcoin as a new and untraceable store of value. Bitcoin is a huge opportunity for tax evasion. 

Isn't that problematic?",cryptocurrency,1388085507

Forex,AUD/CAD Technical Analysis. Potential for a long term set up.,"AUD/CAD's recently caught my attention, for a few reasons. Going to attempt some fundies, and then look at some tech for setups.

**The Loonie**

- CAD has taken a thrashing in the last few months, making it the standout in terms of low correlation with just about anything. This is due mostly to Mark Carney's departure and the BOC changing its stance on interest rates from hawkish to neutral. This selling might be overdone.
- This breakdown in correlation is a symptom of a much larger issue - the divorce of price action from risk trends. The weakening in CAD is mostly a result of large funds and corporates deleveraging, and getting rid of their Loonies as quickly as possible to avoid fallout from the above.
- The Loonie is, however, correlated with oil prices
- Goldman Sachs have called for CAD weakness in 2014. [Adam button thinks they're wrong](http://www.forexlive.com/blog/2013/12/23/four-things-the-overwhelming-consensus-believes-in-2014-3-lousy-loonie/) - worth a read if you're trading CAD.

USOil, D1

Looks pretty bullish to me. Any serious crisis could spark a lot of volatility, pushing price through the 110 ceiling. It's unlikely, granted, but it's difficult to see a drastic fall in oil demand any time soon. 

**On the other hand, we have the Australian dollar**

- I'm very bearish, but I know the selling is overdone.
- AUD/USD has lost a lot of its correlation with Gold lately, but it still correlates reasonably well to any decent commodities index:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/m6y9Vz7b/

That's not a great chart, but you can clearly see what's happening there. Generally in a downward trending range, which looks rather overbought at the moment. A break to the upside would be extremely bullish for the Aussie, but that's not very likely given rumours of slowing demand from China and a declining gold price.

I know there are a few gold bugs lurking in this sub who are going to argue with me, but I'm pretty bearish on Gold as well.

- I did a [detailed analysis on AUD/USD](http://www.forexlive.com/blog/2013/12/21/the-most-dangerous-game/comment-page-1/#comment-876200) on ForexLive, which explains why I'm so bearish. I'd love to hear your opinions


**So in a nutshell my bias could be summed up as neutral to bullish CAD, neutral to bearish AUD.**

Here's the AUD/CAD daily:

http://i.imgur.com/y5acVLB.png

The top pink rectangle is an absolutely pivotal supply/demand area that has long since been breached. We're currently within a downward channel (much cleaner than AUD/USD's) after failing above the 50% retracement of the year's decline and an attempt to clear this zone. 

The orange line is the 100 Month moving average, but don't get too excited - it hasn't done a great job of providing major support or resistance for as long as I have chart data.

The current channel, if it continues, will bring us very neatly to the rising line connecting the July 2010 and July 2013 lows, as well as a strong demand area, and roughly the 0.382 retracement of the move from 2010 to 2013.

This area is the last chance for bulls. At the point marked with a green circle on my chart I'll be watching price action very carefully. It might take a few days to play out, or it could happen very quickly, but price will probably give us an indication of where it will be heading in 2014 if it gets to that level.

There are two trades:

1. A bounce. I prefer this from a technical perspective, but it doesn't align with my fundamental bias. I'll trade what I see though and if a spike low is formed around this area I will enter long with a stop below that spike, and targeting 0.9700, parity and 1.0500.

2. A break of the 0.9250 area and retest and failure at this level opens up a lot of downside targets - noted in green as fibonacci extensions. If this happens, the challenge will be judging if there is sufficient volatility to give the move continuation, and finding a suitable level to trade against. Downside targets are 0.900, 0.8800 and 0.8600",finance,1388078692
personalfinance,"Mother argues ""pay toward debt with smallest balance, not highest interest""","Currently having a post-Christmas debate with my mother. 

She insists I should be putting any extra loan payments toward loans with the smallest balance, not with the highest interest, because ""then it's paid off faster and you can put that money toward loans with higher balances and create a 'debt snowball effect' that gets you out of debt faster."" She's getting this idea from some ""financial advisor"" on satellite radio that she listens to.

I insist that it's more important to put extra payments toward the loan with the highest interest rate, because the goal should be to pay as little interest as possible while paying off quickly.

personalfinance,USDA seeking to foreclose on my in-law's house because of what seems like a technicality... please help!,"My in-laws purchased a house 30 years ago in Rhode Island and took out a USDA Farmer's loan. At some times during the course of the loan there were late payments which caused a clause in their contract to be activated that made every future payment apply only toward the interest and not the principle... at this point, they have paid 30 years worth of mortgage payments and have now received this information from the USDA:

The maturity date was corrected to 11/2013 on this loan. Unfortunately, the borrower still has a $33,000 plus balance because the account is a Daily Simple Interest loan not an Amortized loan. The principal balance is due in full on the maturity date. If it is not paid off, we can foreclose on the property. The borrower’s best bet would to be to try to refinance with another lender to pay us off.

Daily Simple Interest is calculated according to the principal balance after the last payment made, the interest rate, and the number of days between payments as opposed to Amortized loans which just calculate interest based on the principal balance and interest rate.

Look at the payment on 04/08/2010. The payment before that was received on 02/26/2010. Principal balance was $33864.85 after the February payment. $33864.85 x .12 (int rate) x 41 (days between payments from 2/26 to 4/8)/365 = $456.48 owed in interest on that payment. The payment of $664.46 plus $124.66 subsidy was applied as $446.12 to escrow and $343 to interest with $113.48 being added as uncollected interest. None of the payment went to reduce the principal as there was nothing left. For a DSI loan to pay off on time, all the payments must be made 30 days apart and this borrower often skipped months of payments.

Do they have any recourse? They say that they were not informed of any of this until now.",finance,1388074712
personalfinance,Quick question on my personal ability to get a private student loan.,"I would appreciate any input. I tried searching for some clue, but the only answers I got were quite vague.

A bit about me-I'm 20 years old, have had a credit card since 2011 and student loans were taken out in the fall of 2012.

Credit score: 744

Credit cards: I have three open accounts. One from my bank, which is my primary card, one from Citibank which I use only for emergencies, car repairs, or around the holidays, and one department store card that never has a balance. They are paid in full at the end of every month.

Loans: I previously had a Sallie Mae student loan for $9,000 that was paid off when I took some time off from college to work. I have an unsubsidized $5600 one from federal aid  which I would have begun payments on in January if I hadn't gone back to school.


Starting in january, I work full time and go to school full time as well. Since I transferred to a school closer to home,  don't need to take any loans out (yay!). In a year or two though, I want to study abroad. I will have some savings, but will need another private loan (which my parents will not cosign) to cover the rest.

dogecoin,CAUTION to all pool admins!,"There are people in the wild who hate Dogecoin and are trying to mess with the pools. They are exploiting pools with various attacks. We've encountered DOS attacks (not DDOS) on Apache server and were able to solve them. Since I like Dogecoin community, such awesome ppl, I'm giving back, here's a short ""how to"" prevent such attacks.

**Attack technique used:** Resource exhaustion. They keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible. It accomplishes this by opening connections to the target web server and sending a partial request. Periodically, it will send subsequent HTTP headers, adding to but never completing the request. Affected servers will keep these connections open, filling their maximum concurrent connection pool, eventually denying additional connection attempts from clients.

**Attack symptoms:** Page doesn't load, page is loading very slowly, high CPU and memory usage on server

**How to detect the attack?**

1. In Ubuntu, open Apache2 error log file (**/var/log/apache2/error.log**) and check for unusual errors. In our case we had:

        [Thu Dec 26 06:21:00 2013] [error] [client 198.27.66.43] request failed: error reading the headers
        [Thu Dec 26 06:21:01 2013] [error] [client 198.27.66.43] request failed: error reading the headers
        [Thu Dec 26 06:21:02 2013] [error] [client 198.27.66.43] request failed: error reading the headers
        [Thu Dec 26 06:21:05 2013] [error] [client 198.27.66.43] request failed: error reading the headers
    
2. Check if there are a lot of connections from a single IP:

        netstat -anp |grep 'tcp\|udp' | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

This will list you a lot of IPs with number of established connections. If there is an IP with a lot of connections, you've found an attacker (IPs can be spoofed). Check the last IP (844 connections).

    4 99.194.xx.59           
    5 101.162.xx.226    
    5 107.196.xx.41    
    5 122.49.xx.162    
    5 173.81.xx.93    
    5 209.207.xx.201    
    5 213.93.xx.229    
    5 24.11.xx.40    
    5 24.119.xx.14   
    328 127.0.0.1    
    844 198.27.66.43

You could basically just drop the IP with firewall but that would be just a temporary solution, since attackers can use other IPs to attack you.

**- Install mod-evasive (Prevents some DDOS attacks)**  
    
        sudo apt-get -y install libapache2-mod-evasive

dogecoin,"Pat yourselves on the back, fellow shibes; our community is one of the strongest.","I was browsing /g/ on 4chan a while back, right when they created Fedoracoin. For the uninitiated, fedoracoin is another cryptocurrency that was created after the initial dogecoin boom. They expected to ride the coattails of dogecoin to achieve a somewhat meme-propagated currency, similar to what we have. Perhaps their objective was to emulate dogecoin in a different way - or start a trend of meme induced currencies. Their idea is based off the fedoratip craze that started about the same time as dogecoin, with jokes about euphoria and the typical 4chan/reddit atheist circlejerk. However, just take a look at /r/fedoracoin and look at their community. It's barren, almost festering. They don't have a booming dogemarket, with jokes few and far between. Definitely not like ours.

I'm not saying we should mock them, that's not a very shibe thing to do, after all. We shouldn't pity them or laugh at them, but we should turn the focus onto ourselves. Our community, with everyone from the creators to our doge-illionaires to every poor shibe in our doge-pack; we've all accomplished something no one thought was possible. We may or may not have started the trend of meme currencies, but one thing's for sure; Doge is here to stay.

personalfinance,London rents are so high it is cheaper to commute from… Barcelona,"I read an article recently in the Daily Mail that covered the story of a young professional who ran the numbers and concluded it was cheaper for him to live in sunny Barcelona and take a FLIGHT to work four days a week than it was to rent a one bed flat in London!
 
That person compared a 1 bed flat in West Hampstead plus council tax, to a 3 bed in Les Corts, a nice neighborhood of Barcelona. Why the numbers seem reasonable, they were only calculated for November, so I can see a few flaws, mainly that he is flying Ryanair, and Ryanair does not always have cheap flights.
 
Airplane
courtesy of freedigitalphotos.net
If you book 6-8 weeks in advance, you may score a good deal, that is not guaranteed, unlike the price of a rail ticket. So comes December, when air traffic increases as workers are going home for Christmas, so will the fares. Will it still be sustainable to commute by plane then? Let’s not even talk about the summer days, when flights are expensive from mid June to September.
 
The second flaw I see to this system is Ryanair is one of the worst companies to fly with, and they are often late, or very late. When I used to travel almost every weekend overseas, I flew Ryanair a great deal. Generally, the first flight of the morning leaves on schedule, and then delays cramp up as the day goes by. So while he could get to work on time, he could also get home two or three hours later than expected, meaning a lot of stress, having to buy food at the airport that is bad and expensive, and little rest once you get to your Spanish pied-a-terre.
 
Then, while it may be fun to say your live in Barcelona when you get to the office in the morning, it has to get exhausting very fast. How long can you endure that routine, the airport checks, the train back to the city… ? I know people with long commutes, in Surrey, if you commute from Guildford, you have a 36 minute train ride to Waterloo, and it will cost you around £300 per month, which is crazy high if you ask me. Well, when that train gets to Guildford it is already almost full… with people commuting from Portsmouth and all the towns in the middle. But at least, they just take one train. This guy takes the bus to go to the airport, then the plane, then a train, then a tube, then does it again on the way back. You can’t crack open a book and just wait to get to your destination.
 
In this example, the worker is commuting four times a week to London. He must have a cool boss who doesn’t mind him working from home once a week. If you crunch the number for a fifth flight per week, staying in London is less expensive.
 
Another interesting study that I have seen was about people fed up with their commute times. Obviously, this guy doesn’t value his time much, or he’d rather pay the extra £200 he is saving on rent by living in BCN and have five hours of free time EVERY DAY instead of flying back and forth.
 
Well the people in the other study have taken into consideration their time, but also the money they spend on commuting. Back to Guildford and the £300 monthly train pass, you can rent a 1 bed flat for £900-£1,100 over there. But if you lived in central London and had no train pass, you could spend £1,200-£1,400 on rent, which should get you a similar property. And save you two hours a day.
Even better, if you have a mortgage in the city, that is £300 going to equity building toward your mortgage, instead of the train company. £600 if you are a couple. People often look at the cost of rent/mortgage as the main factor when deciding to relocate somewhere but the cost of transportation and time lost should also be of importance.
 
Back to Barcelona, in my humble opinion, it would be worth it if the guy was not obliged to commute four days a week. Say once a week to attend meetings and meet clients, in a world with Skype, Hangouts and so on, it shouldn’t be so hard to convince your company to accept. Or, since the main thing seems to be spending weekends in Barcelona, live close to work in cramped quarters Monday/Thursday and fly on Thursday to your cool Spanish place, work from the sunny balcony on Friday and fly back Monday morning.

Low and behole, today on Xmas, I go down and under the tree is a card. I think ""finally she did something right"" but when I ripped it, it was Old Navy. I didn't even know what to say and she looked at me and said ""This is better because you're 38 and you need better clothes for work.""

That's when the straw broke the camo's back and I threw the Old Navy card on the pile of wrapping, because it's trash to me, I don't need new clothes and if my boss at work gets mad I'll just quit anyway. She started crying and I said ""I wish I could wipe your tears but I can't afford it because I got zero BTC for Christmas."" Then she just got up and went to her room.

She has been in there about 8 hours and I want to explain to her that (1) bitcoin is for people of all ages, it's not just for kids (2) if I ask for something that means it's important to me. Also if there is a way to work the Federal Reserve into that I want to use that too because I hate it.

Also if anyone wants to buy an Old Navy for BTC I dug it out of the trash. So just PM or write here.

EDIT: I just checked and she is asleep or dead so I have plenty of time to figure out what to say to her about BTC tomorrow. If she is dead then RIP, but hopefully I can convince my brother to help me use her left over money to buy BTC.",cryptocurrency,1388017695
Bitcoin,WAVES COFFEE HOUSE BITCOIN ATM A TOTAL DISASTER,"I have been moved to open a reddit account today to report my first-hand experiences at the Waves Bitcoin ATM. In light of the positive postings on reddit, I deposited &gt;$200 CAD via the Bitcoiniac-run ATM service. That was over 90 minutes ago. Not only can I not locate my money, but also, I cannot locate the supposed transaction on Blockchain. In addition to the 5% fee deducted by the ATM, I have spent $4 on parking so far, and have spent about $20 on coffee for myself and family while we wait for they money to show up in my virtual wallet. Honestly, I think the banks are doing a much better job of providing transparent, customer-friendly service. This technology is not ready for use, and is likely to hurt Bitcoin adoption. Non-enthusiasts of Bitcoin will expect an ATM to work in seconds, not hours and hours. By the way, still no Bitcoin in my virtual wallet. Going to put more money in my parking meter. 

EDIT: My BTC finally arrived 36 hours after cash was fed into the Bitcoiniac Robocoin ATM machine at the Waves Coffee House. In summary, this experience was unsatisfactory for the following reasons:

1) There was no BTC being held by Bitcoiniacs or Robocoin to actually dispense to customers, thus making it a no-risk proposition for Bitcoiniacs and Robocoin. The risk of exchange failure was off-loaded entirely onto the customer. 

2) There was no disclosure of this risk or of the potential significant delay prior to ""purchasing"" the BTC at the ATM. The explanation offered by the on-site Bitcoiniac representative was inaccurate and incomplete. The explanation ultimately offered by the owner of the machine was that he is not responsible for the way Robocoin, the machine manufacturer, codes the software, and that he is not responsible for the way the Bitstamp exchange operates. 

3) There was no disclosure of the commission fee of 5% up front. The commission was included in the adjusted exchange rate and was explained to me by the on-site representative *after* I had completed my transaction.",cryptocurrency,1388186003

personalfinance,"New Graduate, Financial Plan Critique Requested – Want to start off on the right foot!","Hi r/PersonalFinance! 

I'm a new graduate who will begin working at a technology company in March of
2014. Hoping to get some advice on investment strategy, allocating a 'fun'
budget, and retirement planning. I've been extremely fortunate (*‚ô™ Wonder of
wonders, miracle of miracles‚Äì ‚ô™*) and want to be sure I make the most of it.

## The Job

- $110,000 Salary
- 10-20% Yearly Bonus, based on individual performance
- $55,000 Signing Bonus, disbursed over two years
- $75,000 of Stock Vesting over three years
- 401(k)+Matching: 50% match for up to 6% of eligible compensation.
- Employee Stock Purchase (ESPP): Can purchase company stock at a 10% discount from
  market price at select times during each quarter.

## Current Financial Condition

- $25,000 of cash in checking/savings. Interest rate is negligible (with BoA)
- Roughly USD 3,500 at current exchange rate of foreign currencies; I will
  probably use about half of this for visiting family and friends
  in Europe.
- No outstanding debt, student loans, etc. Scholarships, freelancing, and
  internships paid for tuition and living expenses.
- A CC, also with BoA. I've had this since 2012 but only started using it in the
  past three months. I use it for day-to-day expenses and pay it off
  in full at the end of each month.

## Predicted Expenses

- $1750 Rent: Living alone, near to the office, in a building with attractive
  architecture is something I'm willing to pay a premium for. I realise the
  rational course of action is finding a roommate or two and going in on a
  townhouse, but it's not something I'm willing to compromise on (at least for
  the first year or two)
- $40 Cell Phone
- $60 Internet
- $200 Utilities (TBD)
- $500 Groceries, Going Out
- $600 Misc. Spending, Shopping

- Subtotal: ~$3150/mo 

## Predicted Planning, Pre-Advice:

- Move all of my existing cash into emergency fund, utilise signing bonus for
  furnishing new apartment, and living expenses going forwards.
- Immediately allocate 6% of income to 401(k)
- Move 5-10% of post-tax income towards ESPP, reinvesting proceeds in the
  stock market.
- Save all remaining income to go towards purchase of a home, car, etc.

## Long-Term Financial Goals

While I love my career and the opportunities it affords me, being an architect
was always a dream. Since I don't get to design/plan cool buildings all day,
living in one will have to suffice. With the way the housing market in the areas
I can work in are trending, I'm afraid to think how much this may cost.

Additionally, my family is spread across the globe, and I've discussed pitching
in with my father to purchase a second home where we could all summer together.
This would likely happen within the next 5-8 years, and being able to contribute
150k+ to that would be a wonderful gift for their anniversary that year. 

These two goals are my highest priorities, with the family home coming first. A
spouse, compounding raises, and prayer is the current plan for my own
residence.

## Questions

1. I'll be ineligible for a Roth IRA, correct? The signing bonus and stock
   vesting both seem to count against the $110,000 maximum income. En lieu of
   this, is the best tax advantaged investment vehicle my company 401(k)?

2. How much should I allocate for future health care expenses? I have no
   pre-existing conditions and will likely remain on my parents healthcare until
   I turn 26. Should I start putting away some small amount of cash, say
   $1,000/yr into an HSA?

3. In order to have the cash on hand for a family home in eight years, it looks
   like it would take ~$1200/mo compounding over that same period at 7%. The
   $1,200 is doable, especially one you factor in stock and bonus compensation,
   but finding a long term 7% return, while not out of line with historical
   stock market performance, still strikes me as risky. Are there any
   alternatives I might consider?

4. With current savings I more or less have an emergency fund accounted for.
   What should I do with future lump sums such as yearly bonuses and stock
   grants?

4. Have I glossed over something, overlooked potential major expenses, or
   otherwise made a dumb mistake? Please point it out! I'm a total novice to the
   realities of financial planning, and it's certainly an endeavour where
   getting it right the first time is important!


Again, I realise I'm in a very fortunate position, and want to be sure I can do
right by the family and friends who got me here.  Thanks in advance, and sorry
for the long-winded post!

I'm in the process of applying now with CUstudent loans.

personalfinance,Equivalent APR of paying lump-sum to eliminate PMI,"Am I analyzing this ""investment option"" right?

(Example input numbers)

House Appraised Value: $175,000

Mortgage Principal: $147,500

Mortgage Interest Rate: %4.5

Assume 30% Tax Bracket

PMI (monthly): $87.5

~10 more years of PMI left


Calculations:

80% LTV for $175k house: 0.8x175000=140000

Principal to reduce mortgage to $140k: 147,500-140,000 = $7,500

Post-tax monthly return on $7.5k investment = PMI + post-tax Interest savings = $87.5 + 0.045 * 7500/12*(1-.3) = $107

Equivalent post-tax APR: 107/7500 * 12 = 14.3%

Conclusion: This option is a guaranteed 14.3% post-tax return on this $7,500 investment for the next ~10 years. After then, the return drops to %4.5 pre-tax.

Really??? That sounds almost too good to be true.

personalfinance,I'm debating between retirement savings and paying down my mortgage. Any thoughts?,"Our family has hit a couple of financial milestones, and we are now faced with the exciting/daunting task of deciding how to use our extra money.  Here's the info that I think would be relevant:

* I'm 31 and my wife is 30.  We have 3 girls ages 6, 4, and 11 months.  I am the sole income provider and my wife is at home with our daughters.
* ~$70K US take home pay after taxes (I should get about a $2K tax return)
* No debt of any kind except our mortgage
* We owe ~$210K on the house - about $90K in equity.  Our monthly payment is about $1,300.00 including property tax/insurance.  We've owned the house for about 3 years and it's on a 30 year fixed loan at 4.25%
* We have a paid-off 2010 Honda Oddysey and a paid-off 2001 Honda Accord (the accord should last another 3-4 years and the oddysey much longer)
* We have ~$30K in savings
* I have a 20 year term $500K life policy and my wife has a $250K policy
* We don't have anything (under $5K) saved for retirement/weddings/collage etc.
* We have about $1,200 per month in our budget that we can dedicate to some long-term financial goal

Up to this point, we've been throwing all of our extra money, minus a little for our savings, at debt.  We've paid off the school and car loans now, which feels **amazing**!  We love our home, and plan on staying there for the long haul, so paying it off quickly seems to make a lot of sense, especially given the abysmal interest rates that are currently available with most savings vehicles.  If we really buckle down, we could probably pay the house off in about 8 years.  We are concerned, however, with our lack of retirement savings.  The company that I work for does not have a 401K option, and doesn't do any sort of savings matching, so we are on our own as far as where to put our retirement savings.

So, should we pay down the house, beef up the retirement, or do a little bit of both?",finance,1388167070
personalfinance,Student Loans - Level vs. Graduated Payments,"Been lurking on this sub (and Reddit as a whole) for a while, first time posting. Apologies for any formatting issues.

Just a little background, I am 25 years old, living in NYC on ~$44K pre-tax. Bring home $2,423 a month. Required monthly expenses are as follows:
Rent: $700
Utilities: fluctuates between $60-$100/month (right now on the lower end since I don't pay for heat)
Cell phone: $90
Student loan minimum: $191

After that, I don't track my expenses nearly as much as I should - I just know over the past three months, I have comfortably paid for holiday travel/gifts, saving up a $1K emergency fund and paying off $1K of credit card debt, and still gone out with friends and had fun. It is a goal of mine in 2014 to track more carefully and see where to cut back.

I have a federal loan with a current balance of $20,159.36 @6.8%. I am currently doing a graduated repayment plan, where my payments increase over time. Monthly payment right now is $191.

I have a little under 8 years to go on this loan, assuming I don't pay it down faster. However, I would really, really like to pay it off within the next 2-3 years. After I pay off my credit card in two weeks, it is my only debt.

My plan is this: after the credit card is paid, re-start contributing to 401k to get the company match, which will bring me down to about $2,300/month take-home. Spend a couple of months building up a cash emergency fund. Maybe $2-$3K. I know this is not much, especially for where I live, but I am young, healthy, stable in my job and on my parents' great health insurance until next October. And I know this is awful, but my parents are very well-off. If anything ever went horribly wrong, they would help. It's a button I've never pressed, but it is there in case of catastrophe.

After building an emergency fund, I want to start paying aggressively on the loan, maybe an extra $500-$700/month in addition to the $191 I pay now. So here's my question: should I switch to the level payment plan, which would up my requirement to $275/month? If I stick with the graduated, my next step (which would kick in Jan. 2015) would be $228, followed by an increase to $271 in Jan. 2017. 

My loan site (Great Lakes) shows that by switching to the level payment plan, I pay a little over $1K less in interest during the life of the loan. But would this matter if I am set up to pay a lower minimum for the next 5 years, by which time I want to have it paid off anyway? This assumes that if my minimum goes up, they will put more of that toward interest than I would by paying the same amount as ""extra"" on top of my minimum. And yes, I know that in order to pay down effectively, I need to pay the minimum and then send a separate payment clearly marked for the principal.

Sorry if this was long-winded or unclear, and please ask if you need clarification on anything. Thanks in advance for anyone's help.",finance,1388167020

**The Coin**  
The Ravenbit physical bitcoin's composition is approximately 85% copper/15% zinc, commonly referred to as Goldine. It weighs in at 27 grams and has a diameter of 39mm. Each of the 1,000 coins, in this limited edition first batch, is individually numbered.

[**Each kit includes:**](https://ravenbit.com/features/)

**What makes Ravenbit's physical bitcoin different from all of the other physical bitcoins?**  


1. **We don't generate, store or otherwise have access to your private key**  
    We provide you with custom label sheets, a custom tamper evident hologram and a client-side javascript [label template generator](https://ravenbit.com/labels.html). You generate your keys with your preferred bitcoin wallet generator (we like bitaddress.org), paste the keys into our template generator, and then print to the included label sheets. No longer do you have to place your trust in the issuer or the issuer's processes. (p.s. we encourage you to examine the label generator's code)  
2. **We don't denominate our coins**  
    You get to decide how much, or how little bitcoin you want to load onto your coin.  
3. **We don't load bitcoin onto our coins**  
    Sending the denominated value to the issuer, so the issuer can load the bitcoin after the coin is delivered puts the issuer at risk of regulatory action and again, requires the buyer to place his or her trust in the issuer. It also adds a significant up front cost for the buyer.  

*****

**What does the coin cost?**  
One (1) Ravenbit physical bitcoin kit is currently on sale for **$29 (+ shipping)**. If you are interested in just the coin and hologram, I'm selling a coin, 2 holograms and air-tite capsule for $19.

**Which payment methods do we accept?**  

Only accepting bitcoin, at the moment.

*****

**Where do we ship and which shipping providers do we offer?**   
We ship worldwide via Fedex or DHL  and domestically (U.S.) via USPS.      


Due to the high costs of shipping internationally we are actively searching for buyers with access to major international markets interested in purchasing further discounted bulk orders.

personalfinance,Does anyone have tips to increase the credit score of someone who has no need for credit right now?,"I am new to r/personalfinance. In fact, this is my first time posting anything to Reddit. I did not find a particular answer to my question in the resources in the sidebar.

I want to know how to improve my credit score in spite of the fact that I do not need credit now. I would appreciate any feedback.

I have always been hesitant to have any debt, so the only debt I've had was a car loan and student loans--I paid both of those off early. Now I am looking to possibly purchase a house, but my credit score seemed low (640) until I became a co-signor on my wife's credit card, which we got in order to improve my credit score. She and I also own a rental property free and clear.

Right now, my credit score is 712 or 784, according to Credit Karma and Credit.com respectively. I'd like to improve my credit in order to get a better interest rate on a mortgage in about two years when I plan to buy a home.

According to what I can find, it seems that it would behoove me to 1) get access to more credit; 2) keep my credit utilization low; and 3) get my credit diversified. 

I would like to know if I should get another credit card or take out a home equity line of credit and make occasional draws on it to improve my credit score. It seems like another credit card and a HELOC would be the cheapest ways to improve my credit score. Are there differences between types of credit cards (insofar as they affect my credit score)?

Would applying for a credit card hurt my score more than the increase in credit would help it?

Thank you in advance.",finance,1388106553
personalfinance,"25f, $81,094.29 in student loan debt, looking for options/help/advice!!","I'm 25 and graduated in 2011. I'm currently working full time as a graphic designer and have a part time job as at a restaurant. 

**Monthly Income (after taxes)**: ~$1,800.00

**Rent/Bills/Living Expenses**: ~$750.00

**Total Student Loan Debt**: $81,094.29 (income based repayment for those that can be)

**Monthly Student Loan Payment Total**: ~$500

So, I feel like I'm in a little over my head with my student loan debt. It's really the only debt I have and even though I have the minimum payments under control each month, I noticed that I am really only covering interest on these loans. I don't know ANYTHING about finances or what options I may have, and thought I should ask here. Here's the back story if it matters or helps at all:
While enrolled in my junior year of college, my father passed away, and he was the one who made most of the money in my family. Unfortunately, my mother was the co-signer and organizer of all of my loans, which I think is the main reason that I'm hurting so badly from this (she is of no financial help). Since my father was not the signer, I know that none of the loans could be ""deleted"" due to his passing. However, I seem to be one of the only people I know with this amount of debt, given my family's middle to lower middle class status (dad was an iron worker and my mom painted nails for a living).

Here's the all the info on my loans if that helps:

**NelNet**

Total Balance: 34,720.58 (Made up of 10 different loans with varying interest rates)

     1. Stafford Loan, 6.000% interest, balance: 4,627.51
     2. Stafford Loan, 6.800% interest, balance: 8,322.13
     3. Direct Subsidized, 5.6% interest, balance: 3,610.98
     4. Direct Subsidized, 4.5% interest, balance: 2,808.31
     5. Direct Unsubsidized, 6.8% interest, balance: 5,210.67
     6. Direct Unsubsidized, 6.8% interest, balance: 1,246.47
     7. Direct Subsidized, 4.5% interest, balance: 2,808.31
     8. Direct Unsubsidized, 6.8% interest, balance: 455.69
     9. Direct Consolidated, 6.55% interest, balance: 3186.90
     10. Direct Consolidated, 6.55% interest, balance: 2,443.59

**ACS Education/MEFA**

Total Balance: 8,936.30 @ 7.69% (fixed)

**Chase Student Loans**

Total Balance: 19,670.86 (made up of four loans (I think? transfers and consolidation))

     1. Domestic Undergraduate, 7.25% interest, principal balance: 9,806.19
     2. Domestic Undergraduate, 10.5% interest, principal balance: 9,864.67
     3. Stafford Loan, 6% interest, original amount: $4,500 (listed as transferred)
     4. Stafford Loan, 6.8% interest, original amount: 6,000 (listed as transferred)

**Sallie Mae**

Loan Balance, 17,819.50 @ 5.25% variable unsubsidized interest rate



I forgot to mention that I used http://www.loanconsolidation.ed.gov/ to consolidate some of these loans - I'm not sure if that's important or not. I'm pretty sure that the NelNet loans are the only federal loans, all others are private.

investing,Short term travel fund investing help/ideas!,"Hey guys I was hoping you guys could throw some advice at me!

I just turned 24 and have had a Roth IRA for two years for all my long term investing. However, I intend to move abroad to work and travel in about one year. I have opened an account with Schwab to utilize their unlimited worldwide ATM reimbursement policy (would have saved me hundreds in transaction fees last time). It is linked to a brokerage account and I'd like to put it to use since I've read they sometimes cancel the accounts on people who don't use it. Plus I might be able to earn better than .1% by letting it sit in the bank.

I have a couple grand and will be putting aside $500 every two weeks just for my travel money. How would you guys recommend investing this? Capital preservation is a necessity, it wouldn't be good to dip 20% when I need to start using it etc etc. I was looking at etfs like target date bonds 2014 and 2015 (its unlikely interest rates will get out of hand in just a few months), large cap funds, dividend paying etfs..

Any idea are greatly appreciated or percentages to divy investments up at! Thanks!",finance,1388274793

investing,Looking for dissenting opinions to my plan of sending money back home from the U.S. to Australia in 2014,"Hi /r/Investing,

I'm looking for dissenting opinions on why I shouldn't go through with my plan to send money back home to Aus. Please keep in mind that I wish to move back to Australia in the next 5-10 and *most definitely* want to retire there.

Currently, the Australian dollar is trading at a US$0.886, a [~12.7% gain](http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&amp;to=AUD) and it is anticipated that it will fall to about US$0.85 (17.65% gain) or lower by the end of 2014 (at least, that's what the analysts are saying and the RBA, our Fed equivalent, wants it at that level). Obviously there will be fees involved but, for the amounts I'm going to be sending home, this is negligible (&lt;0.1% of the amount). Further, I have an [offset mortgage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_loan_(finance\)) in Australia that is currently charging 5.85% p.a. that will be offset by the money I send back but, by the nature of the offset mortgage, keeps it liquid if I need the money in a hurry.

Looking at this, I see a current minimum 18.55% total ROI, for the first year, on any money I send back home with little to no risk. If the rate drops even further, then it'll just be a case of dollar cost averaging for a better return. I have an emergency fund and will continue to max out my retirement accounts here in the U.S. so it's not like I'm throwing everything at it.

So, /r/Investing, my plan is to throw every cent I have *extra* back home for 2014 unless circumstances change. My question to you is: What am I missing? Is there some weird opportunity cost that's in my blind spot? Further, if this is as good as I think it is, can you suggest other ways I may maximize the amount I can send back home?

personalfinance,Advice for buying a car?,"My girlfriend and I split last week, leaving me with a rather pressing need for a car... I am able to take a bus to work, but that's about it. I need to be able to get to the grocery store, vet, laundromat, and occasionally family (~3 hours away), in addition to other various driving a 23yo male would want to do. In addition, I never have owned my own car, and honestly am just tired of relying on my friends/girlfriend/whoever to run me around. Anyway, here is my current monthly budget and overall financial situation:  

Income: $3800  
Rent: $1200 (currently looking for a roommate to bring this down to $650, but want to look at worst-case scenario)
Food: $400 (includes groceries, home supplies, and eating out)  
Student Loans: $1200 ($300 is the minimum, but this is the amount I contribute to ensure my loans are paid off in 2 years at most)  
Renter's Insurance: $16  
Pet Expenses: $50  
Cable/Internet: $105  
Phone: $75  
Membership (Various) Fees: $15  
Alcohol/Bars: $75  
Laundry: $20  
Miscellaneous/Unplanned Expenses: $100  

This leaves me with roughly **$550/mo in my budget** for insurance, maintenance, gas, and a car payment (if I do go this route). My rent will go down assuming that I can find a roommate, but again I want to look at worst-case scenario here - that extra $650 would just allow me to pay everything off that much faster. I should add that I have $17K in savings, so based on my current job security and marketability (engineer), I would be comfortable putting about $5K of that into a car and leaving the remaining $12K as my emergency fund. I live in New England, so in addition to registration, etc., I will want to put a little of that $5K into snow tires if the car doesn't have them already.  

I know there is somewhat of a stigma against financing vehicles around here, but I would like to get a newer car if the price, interest rate, and monthly payment are reasonable. I'm the kind of person who would drive it 'til it dies, for whatever that's worth, and wouldn't finance unless the loan could be paid off in 2-3 years at most. My FICO score was a 730 as of August 2013, and I have no blemishes whatsoever on my report, so I should be able to get a decent interest rate.  

So I guess my biggest question is - am I being an idiot? Would it would be totally unreasonable to buy/finance a new-ish car? If I were to finance a car, how much of that $550/mo would be reasonable to put towards the payment? I am thinking a vehicle on the order of $12-15K wouldn't be outrageous, so maybe a Corolla, Focus, etc. I would like to hear other opinions and suggestions, though. Please advise!

Bitcoin,Bitcoin banks are essential for mass adoption,"I know many bitcoiners hate banks. Here's why I think banks will actually be essential for mass-adoption of bitcoin:

**Fact number 1:**
The majority of human beings are not ready for securely protecting their private keys. It's too difficult and stressful for them. The learning curve is too steep for any non-techie.

**Solution:**
Bitcoin banks will print redeemable paper vouchers that require only physical security, just like traditional cash. 


**Fact number 2:**
Many people object to bitcoin, because it's nothing physical they ""can hold in their hands"".

**Solution:**
Look at previous solution.


**Fact number 3:**
Mainstream economists fear a currency that can't be inflated.

**Solution:**
Banks will be able to do some fractional reserve banking based on bitcoins, just like they used to do with gold. Banks will be more transparent about their fractional reserves and competition will be hard. The banks that have small reserves will need to use higher interest rates to stay in business. This will bring natural and free market  based competition to the banking system.

dogecoin,[How To] create an offline wallet for cold storage,"Since I've seen a few people asking about offline wallets, I thought I'd share my recent explanation of how I created my cold storage wallet based on my research and reading from the past month. This is for long-term offline storage, and not a wallet you will ever intend on accessing much, if at all. Think of it more like a safe-deposit box and not a checking or savings account.

I used a spare/old laptop and a fresh windows 7 install with no network connection. You *can* do this on an existing machine, but it weakens the intent of the security. You are trying to create an ""air gap"" of your wallet/key file from the internet so it can never be used until wanted. If you have any malware or other malicious software, or leave any traces of this process on the machine that could be recovered later, there is a *potential* (I know, slim, but this is money shibes!) that the wallet could be compromised and you would lose all your precious doge.

**What you need:**

* A usb stick or cd/dvd for the dogecoin-qt/truecrypt software
* **AT LEAST TWO** (preferably three!) USB sticks for storage. Preferably new/unused.
* A laptop/desktop you can install a fresh copy of windows onto.
* A copy of windows.
* the latest version of [dogecoin-qt](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/download/v1.3/dogecoin-qt-v13-Win.zip)
* A copy of [Truecrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads)

**Now do this:**

* Create a fresh windows install with no connection to the internet.
* Connect usb drive (or cd/dvd) that contains qt and truecrypt installs.
* Run truecrypt and create an encryption container for your wallet. Be sure to use a strong password and by all means make sure you remember it!
* Mount tc container (It just mounts as a new drive letter you specify).
* Unpack dogecoin wallet qt and run it. (You do not need to download blockchain)
* Encrypt the wallet if you can.
* Copy the newly generated Address from the ""Much Receive"" tab and paste into text file and copy back to usb with the software on it (or write down, you'll need this to send coins to from your main address).
* Copy wallet.dat from C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\DogeCoin to the truecrypt container **and rename wallet.dat.bak**
* Copy wallet.dat to truecrypt container again. You should now have two copies of the wallet in the tc container.
* Unmount tc container.
* Connect the first new/unused usb drive and copy over tc container you created that contains the wallet files.
* Do that again on another usb drive.
* Do that again on another usb drive. (reccommended)
* Test all usb sticks by plugging back into the newly installed windows machine, mounting the container, then copying the wallet.dat back over to the Dogecoin folder and opening qt. You should see the address matching with what you wrote down or copied to text. (Do the same with the .bak file, being sure to rename it)
* Send a small amount of coin to this new address and make sure the transaction goes through. You can check the balance of *any* dogecoin address at http://dogechain.info/address/(your_new_wallet_address). Once you've confirmed the transfer and your coins have made it, you can start banking more coins there safely and then wait for moon landing.
* Destroy laptop with fire. (Or just wipe the windows install). If you want to be a thorough shibe, consider running a [DBAN](http://www.dban.org/download) DOD wipe.

Now I have my wallet (and a backup) on three thumb drives. One is in the home safe, the other two are in an off-site location (locked work desk or bank safe deposit).


**Drawbacks:**

* Password complexity is important, but you *really* need to ensure you'll remember them! Just think if in two years you found out doge hit moon and you dont know your trucecrypt or wallet password because it was written down, on another machine that died, etc.. 
* Hardware breaks. USB sticks are really cheap nowadays. And that's not always a good thing. That's why you want multiple copies in case you lose, break, burn, eat, one or more! Having copies offsite will mitigate against any natural disasters (Climate change!) More copies, more security against loss/destruction.
* Nothing is 100% Safe, but this is pretty close. Shit **CAN** and does happen. but you can try and mitigate the damage that shit causes with multiple redundant backups!

Disclaimer: This is not perfect, and I am not responsible for any of your doge if you screw up! Please let me know if there are any glaring errors and I'll correct them when I can.

You are trying to create an ""air gap"" of your wallet/key file from the internet so it can never be used until wanted. If you have any malware or other malicious software, or leave any traces of this process on the machine that could be recovered later, there is a *potential* (I know, slim, but this is money shibes!) that the wallet could be compromised and you would lose all your precious doge.

**What you need:**

* A usb stick or cd/dvd for the dogecoin-qt/truecrypt software
* **AT LEAST TWO** (preferably three!) USB sticks for storage. Preferably new/unused.
* A laptop/desktop you can install a fresh copy of windows onto.
* A copy of windows.
* the latest version of [dogecoin-qt](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/download/v1.3/dogecoin-qt-v13-Win.zip)
* A copy of [Truecrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads)

**Now do this:**

* Create a fresh windows install with no connection to the internet.
* Connect usb drive (or cd/dvd) that contains qt and truecrypt installs.
* Run truecrypt and create an encryption container for your wallet. Be sure to use a strong password and by all means make sure you remember it!
* Mount tc container (It just mounts as a new drive letter you specify).
* Unpack dogecoin wallet qt and run it. (You do not need to download blockchain)
* Encrypt the wallet if you can.
* Copy the newly generated Address from the ""Much Receive"" tab and paste into text file and copy back to usb with the software on it (or write down, you'll need this to send coins to from your main address).
* Copy wallet.dat from C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\DogeCoin to the truecrypt container **and rename wallet.dat.bak**
* Copy wallet.dat to truecrypt container again. You should now have two copies of the wallet in the tc container.
* Unmount tc container.
* Connect the first new/unused usb drive and copy over tc container you created that contains the wallet files.
* Do that again on another usb drive.
* Do that again on another usb drive. (reccommended)
* Test all usb sticks by plugging back into the newly installed windows machine, mounting the container, then copying the wallet.dat back over to the Dogecoin folder and opening qt. You should see the address matching with what you wrote down or copied to text. (Do the same with the .bak file, being sure to rename it)
* Send a small amount of coin to this new address and make sure the transaction goes through. You can check the balance of *any* dogecoin address at http://dogechain.info/address/(your_new_wallet_address). Once you've confirmed the transfer and your coins have made it, you can start banking more coins there safely and then wait for moon landing.
* Destroy laptop with fire. (Or just wipe the windows install). If you want to be a thorough shibe, consider running a [DBAN](http://www.dban.org/download) DOD wipe.

Now I have my wallet (and a backup) on three thumb drives. One is in the home safe, the other two are in an off-site location (locked work desk or bank safe deposit).


**Drawbacks:**

* Password complexity is important, but you *really* need to ensure you'll remember them! Just think if in two years you found out doge hit moon and you dont know your trucecrypt or wallet password because it was written down, on another machine that died, etc.. 
* Hardware breaks. USB sticks are really cheap nowadays. And that's not always a good thing. That's why you want multiple copies in case you lose, break, burn, eat, one or more! Having copies offsite will mitigate against any natural disasters (Climate change!) More copies, more security against loss/destruction.
* Nothing is 100% Safe, but this is pretty close. Shit **CAN** and does happen. but you can try and mitigate the damage that shit causes with multiple redundant backups!

Disclaimer: This is not perfect, and I am not responsible for any of your doge if you screw up! Please let me know if there are any glaring errors and I'll correct them when I can.

INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Orb Deluxe Economics. I've been studying business cycle theory since 1987, when Black Monday piqued the interest of a young man soon to enter the labor market. How could otherwise robust economies yield such wild swings in markets? In 2008 I began to devise a real business cycle theory based on what I saw as an oversight: the labor market had been considered a lagging indicator but my research showed it was also a leading indicator. My research quickly became Boom Wave Theory, and to validate the theory I moved on to build model portfolios which I have also been investing on and tracking since 2009.

Boom Wave Theory appears to straddle the economy and the markets right at the point where business cycles drive booms and busts. In the Boom Wave Cycle model, each year is rated for its cyclicality, so ultimately the model seeks to account for the stochastic movements that have kept real business cycle theorists -- and real businesspeople -- on their toes for so many years.

OK, let's descend back to Earth from the 30,000 foot theoretical view. I've also been recording annual Boom Wave Theory bullet points since 2011 in anticipation of writing a newsletter. This year I've decided to get to work and start writing. Further background on the theory plus some charts have been available on my site since 2011: see orbdeluxe.com/econ

LOOKING BACK: A BOOM WAVE BULL RUN

In September 2012 I wrote that ""if Boom Wave theory holds up the Dow and other cyclical indexes should make a moderate to strong move up over the 15 months beginning Q4 2012"". That certainly did come to pass as the price level of the Dow is up around 22% in that time. Cyclicals had a great year, as did the broader US market. 

By contrast, Emerging Markets, one of the rotation selections for 2013 as well as a component of the equity allocation model portfolio, had a rough year. My personal portfolio was holding International Growth as a proxy, which did somewhat better.

The tendency for an up market in the late stage of a Boom Wave is historically very strong. This recent 15 month run ranks only 6th out of 9 historically among Boom Waves tracked by the model (assuming no major price swings in the last two trading days of the year). From Q4 1954 through Q4 1955, the Dow rose over 50%!

Personally I took profits on about half of my equity holdings in early August and the other half in recent days. The August trade was a good sleep-at-night trade which I don't regret as it came near a temporary market top. Still, I was a little surprised by the market's recent push to new highs. As of this writing, the Schiller P/E 10 ratio sits at a rather pricy 26. My August and December trades closed positions originally taken in October of 2011 when the P/E 10 was around 21.

One somber note, for both the economy and for me personally, is the unemployment rate. While there are signs that the recovery is finally beginning to feed on itself and accelerate (as forecast by the labor market trend indicator), the process has been nerve-wrackingly slow. 

My regular work as a marketing database guy, usually a veritable flood, came as something more like rivulets in 2013. Part of that is due to task automation, which I had a hand in. I had also been urging a client to push harder into Chinese markets, which he began doing. 

It may take a few years for those investments to pay off and in the meantime budgets are tighter. So my personal experience is very much in line with my macro understanding of the current issues and trends: it may take some time before current investments make it back into the broader US economy, but when they do we will probably be surprised at the economic surge that results. I remain optimistic about long-term prospects for the US and global economies and only slightly less optimistic for the average worker, who will continue to face challenges from automation and regional economic dislocations. In the next section I'll look at the short-term forecast.

LOOKING AHEAD: BLOW-OFF MARKET TOP POSSIBLE

Coming off a long bull market as forecast by Boom Wave Theory, 2014 enters looking like a typical late blow-off phase where the market tops dramatically and then either corrects or trades choppily sideways for much of the year. I can't be as confident of that forecast as I was of the recent bull market, but the 6 comparable periods in market history range from tepid to scary. January appears likely to see a big move to either the upside or downside, which I interpret as either a blow-off top or a correction (or perhaps both).

Despite still-low rates, fixed income vehicles (funds, ETFs) could benefit in the short term from flight-to-quality market action in Q1 and Q2. There remains risk of a swift interest rate hike pulling down values of fixed-income vehicles. While the model deems a dramatic rate hike in that time frame somewhat unlikely, and the Fed has indicated that will happen only when the unemployment rate drops to 6.5%, the prudent might prefer to stay partly in cash. It would be idle money waiting for the next ride to bull territory. A few years ago, my brother described the way the system trades as a ""cash ratchet"" and I can't improve on that wording. 

The model, which can give preliminary readings years in advance, will call to re-enter the market in late 2014 and hold through most or all of 2015. Regarding the ""art of the trade"" I'll be looking for the first day after September 1st, 2014 where the 50 day moving average of the Dow shows an upward slope, and move to an equity allocation of 80%. As the unemployment rate crosses below 6.5% , expect the Fed to begin taking upward interest rate actions. On the other hand, a period of moderate unemployment will help clear excess supply in the labor market, and those clearing periods are central to Boom Wave Theory. Such inflection points have tended to signal multi-year bull markets in cyclical stocks.

As for the long term, I've observed that bull markets tend to come in the form of alternating research booms and export booms. During research booms, investments are made in technical niches and a disproportionate share of the benefits go to the technically skilled. During export booms, the broader economy benefits as technical innovations spreads throughout all sectors and industries, often in surprising fashion. 

For instance, the 1990s were a research boom when the internet blossomed and the 2000s were an export boom when web-based tools were applied to disparate markets (most notably the real estate market). The recent boom followed this trend and was a narrow research-based boom concentrated in energy innovation, social media and mobile devices. The next leg up will likely be larger and broader-based as those innovations find novel application in US and global markets.

I might look to move a small slice of my personal investments into the relatively volatile rotation selections of REIT and Small Cap Value. Preliminary thoughts on timing would be to grab an REIT slice immediately to see if it might be a safe haven in a rough market, but save Small Cap Value investing for later in the year when the next big run-up appears imminent (perhaps after a correction, capitulation and base-making series of chart events).

Personally I'll try to stay adaptable to changing conditions and redeploy my personal capital. In 2014 I plan to dust off my accounting skills and learn QuickBooks as I have an A/R job in my queue.

BEHIND THE SCENES

While the core Boom Wave models are very stable, I'm continually looking for ways to improve my personal portfolio performance. I may add some momentum strategies to my own trades, as swapping underperforming funds for outperformers early in a bull market appears to have significant potential. I'll have to keep in mind that additional trading means additional fees. I'd also like to have a more comprehensive understanding of the bond market. While I have some understanding of yield curves, I haven't internalized that knowledge as thoroughly as I have on the equity side.

I'll also be looking at ways to gradually publicize and monetize Boom Wave Theory and the associated portfolios, other than by trading in my own modest portfolio. I can see various possibilities: finding a partner for academic work, founding a hedge fund, taking this newsletter into broader distribution and a subscription model, hosting a web forum and selling ads, etc. Or perhaps some enterprising young research analyst would like to spend part of their bonus to buy the whole thing part and parcel (consulting services included). In any case I hope to continue providing some form of free economic information.

DISCLAIMER

This bulletin is intended for informational purposes only and is not an offer or inducement to trade securities. Research suggests that a diversified buy-and-hold portfolio is the best strategy for most individual investors. The Bogleheads Wiki at bogleheads.org/wiki is a good place to get started with a buy-and-hold strategy.

NOTES

special note to /r/investing -- Thanks for a year of interesting submissions and lively discussions. I've learned a lot from some of the investors here. If you've read this far, thanks a million for checking out my first newsletter.

Rotation picks should be considered speculative. Rotation selection portfolio returns tend to be more volatile than allocation model returns in backtesting and out-of-sample real world returns. However, a blended portfolio of 85% allocation model and 15% rotation selections appears to be less volatile than either alone. In practice I've stuck solely to the allocation model percentages but might dip my toes into the rotation picks in 2014.

Fixed income is 100% US intermediate-term treasuries in the model portfolio. In practice I've substituted high grade corporate bonds and cash.

Equities in the allocation model portfolio are a fairly even mix of Large Cap Value, Mid Cap Blend and Emerging Markets. In practice I've invested in International Growth as a proxy for Emerging Markets.

For charting I usually to just look at the Dow, although any cyclical index should be fine. Other cyclical indexes include the Hang Seng and the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index.

I was raised frugally and always did my best to save every dime. I was proud of the money I have been saving, but the problem is I let it just sit in the bank accumulating a sweet 1% interest rate this whole time.

Investments and finance isn't a topic of discussion at work, home, or with friends so when I stumbled across this subreddit, I can't help but feel like a fool for letting myself neglect this situation for so long.  

After reading /personalfinance, /business, and /investments for the last several weeks I decided to focus on splitting the money between the stock market and s &amp; p 500 index with Vanguard (https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0040&amp;FundIntExt=INT#tab=0).  

My main question is how should I allocate my funds?

Money in stock: ~$25,000
Roth IRA: ~$20,000
Retirement fund: ~$50,000

personalfinance,"Aggressively pay down high interest, or do a balance transfer?","I have a lot of credit card debt and I have been up to this point aggressively paying down one of the highest interest card which is also the highest balance, while paying the minimums on the rest. I believe this is called the avalanche method. One of my credit cards has a zero fee balance transfer option and is at a lower rate(8%) than my high rate(15.65%) card that i've been attacking. That card has a balance on it as well and my question is, should I aggressively pay the 8% card down so that I can do a balance transfer from the higher interest rate, or is it smarter to stay the path with the avalanche method?

Also, debt calculators have shown me that I pay the least interest when I pay off the highest interest rate first. I have a banana republic card that is at 23%, but im only paying around $6 interest on it while all of my other debt is at a lower interest rate, but paying more dollars each month. Why does it save money to pay the highest interest rate which is the lowest interest in terms of dollars?

I input the deposit address in my address book as the dogetipbot deposit.

I sent a withdraw command to the bot, and withdrew all my doges to the address that the program gave me, and it reflects that in the dogechain.info website. I'm still syncing with the network, so I don't see the coins in the Wow tab.

Just to make sure I understand this.

The address the **bot** sent me, is used as a tipping wallet? (separate from my address the **program** gave me)

So if I want to tip people, I'll have to send doges to the **bot address**.

If I want to withdraw doges that I received, I send the bot the address that the **program** generated for me?

personalfinance,Need help understanding closing costs and whether or not you can include them in your loan,"So I plan on purchasing my first home within the next 6 months. I make a pretty decent income for my age (135k) and have about 180k in student loans. The way it is staggered I only owe 542 a month until next December at which point it doubles. I have no other debts and my credit score is above 740. 

Due to how everything is working out, I have two dogs, a serious gf of 8 years (She is a teacher and will be splitting nearly half the mortgage as rent until we get married at which point, we will get her added to the note or I will assign her half the equity via contract) I want to buy a property by June-July of this year. I will probably only have about 15-20k in savings for a down payment at that point because I have only been out of school for about 6 months. Best case scenario my gf will lend me or give me an additional 5k for the down payment possibly more. So I am looking at a down payment of anywhere between 15-30k. I would like to purchase a home between 200-300k.

I don't think I will have an enormous problem securing financing for a mortgage at my income and credit level, but an issue for me will definitely be the closing costs. 

So my question is, can you include the closing costs into the mortgage so that my down payment, initial pmi premium, upfront real estate taxes, etc are all included? If so, is this pretty standard? Any questions or comments welcome.

PS In case anyone is wondering I have to move within that 6 month time period so I can have room for a family member, also in the market I live in housing prices have literally increased as much as 30% or more in some neighborhoods so I don't really feel comfortable waiting any longer, plus interest rates.",finance,1388445115
investing,Anybody have a good suggestion for low risk investments?,"Hey Guys,

Quick question about low risk investments. I have the misfortune of badly timing a lot of my fixed income investments to expire around Jan 1st. I'll be sitting on a very large sum of cash and am wondering how to best allocate it. 

With interest rates on the rise I'm hesitant to invest in long term fixed income solutions but I'm also not willing to risk to much of this capital. I have about 40% of my cash in the market right now (ETF, stocks) and don't think increasing that position is a good idea. Any suggestions that I should look at or are bonds really my only safe bet. 

I should mention I have about 20% in blue chip preferred stocks and I know preferred are consider fixed income but that part of my portfolio is just getting spanked so adding more to it seems painful (even though there are some good deals to be had).

Both of us are (crossing fingers) in the public loan service forgiveness plan on IBR loans and trying to ride out the 10 years (about 2 in).

After spending some time looking at the advantages of the government TSP plan and my own option for my company's 403(b) plan, I was thinking of trying to maximize every available deduction as a way to both grow our retirement AND keep our gross income down so as to try and keep a lid on the yearly payment increases.

e.g.
Maximum contribution to TSP: $17,500/yr.
Maximum contribution to 403(b): $17,500/yr.
If annual salary thresholds are met, maximum contribution to traditional IRA: $5,500.

I plan to put $40K toward loans this year in 2014. $20K toward rent, internet, cell phone, transportation, and utilities. That leaves about $25K left over for ""other"" (personal expenditures) and an emergency fund. How much should I keep in an emergency fund?

Should I invest in a type of retirement account? I'm currently 26. My company does not match for 401(k), so is there a point in doing that? I've heard people mention Roth on here-- is that worth doing? Vanguard? I know nothing about any of this.

I'd also like to do some investing. Having extra money sitting in a savings account doing nothing seems useless, so I'd liek to invest some of it and see it grow even if it grows very little each year. Maybe $5K (4K in an index fund, and 1K in some stocks). 

Just looking for some general advice! Thanks!

CryptoCurrency,Lobby and Representation for CryptoCurrencies,"I realize the heart behind crypto currencies (when taken back to the root and not to the quick buck crowd) is decentralization and being able to liberate from the federal governments monopolies.  However, having seen crypto currencies brought up more and more in the news and seeing Congress and the Treasury discussing it, I've begun to wonder whether if we have representation in DC for our cause.  

Does anyone know if there is someone out there focused on furthering our cause in DC and protecting it as well.  I feel the protection side of things is much more important as we'd like to remain as unencumbered by federal governments as possible.

Do you have an opinion on what laws would further the crypto currency world and which laws you fear coming into place?

## This is my estimated budget.
It has me living a depressingly spartan lifestyle.    
This forecast does not include any unnecessary expenditures except for a Roth IRA.

I live in north-central NJ, cost of living is relatively high.    
The ""Extra Money/year"" cell would be what luxury expenses cut into (new computer, TV, eating outside the house, day trips, occasional alcohol).

*edit: the 25% tax estimate is based on ALL taxes taken out of my last 5 pay stubs - it's actually 25.6% average.* Federal income, state income, federal social, state social taxes equate to 25% combined taxes.

## My short term ambition is to own/mortgage a home rather than rent.
$175,000 seems to be the minimum for a home in central/north NJ that would not qualify as a money-pit. 20% downpayment on 175k is $35k. *Saving $35k would take me 10 years!*    

*If I do not put any money towards retirement*, the time would be reduced to 5 years. *Still living like I am in poverty in that time.*

$45k/year is my 1st job, a salaried 40 hour/week job. I work 25-30 hours in a second job at night, but that is only at $9.90/hour - it brings in an additional $11k/year pretax.

2nd job cuts my downpayment saving time to 3 years.

## I question whether it's worth working 70 hours/week for about $60,000 gross income a year because I am miserable 80% of the time.

I have no time to spend with the few people who are important in my life. I have no family and only 2 friends, and those relationships are stressed by my limited free time. 

I don't ever go out to eat, even with friends. I take a day trip maybe 3 times a year. I stay home with my free time.

I am a huge DIY person, and it makes it me happy to learn how things work and to build or fix things. I have degree in Computer Science, which started as teaching myself - school was a breeze. I taught myself car maintenance in order to save money - it's 13 years old. Owning a home would allow me to experiment and generally pursue my interests in life.

I am in excellent health.

Bitcoin,"Krugman, trolls: to support your claim of deflation being bad in the context of bitcoin, please explain how we will see deflationary spirals like the Great Depression or 90s Japan if there is no bitcoin-denominated debt/wages/prices? If you don't, then stop using it as a handwaving argument plz thx.","Beyond using ""deflation"" as a simple boogeyman, I've never heard someone explain why this would be a systemically catastrophic as it has been in well known cases (US Great Depression, Japan's Lost Decade, etc.). 

In those well-known cases the main problem, basically, was the deflationary spiral caused by the real value of the debt increasing, thus exacerbating the vicious cycle of lower output leading to lower wages, lower investment, lower spending, lower output, etc. 

However, how does this apply to Bitcoin? 

1. How much debt is there denominated in bitcoins? **Almost none**. 
2. How many people have their wages denominated in bitcoin (not just paid in bitcoin, but set in bitcoin)? **Almost none**, and even if some do, it's probably readjusted to the dollar exchange rate every month or two or three. 
3. How many people set prices for their products in bitcoins? Besides the Bitcoin Trezor pre-order experiment, **almost none**, unless it's a trivial amount *(for example, the price of embedding a hash of a document in the blockchain at www.proofofexistence.com)* or temporary *(for example, a price for a drink special at happy hour, as was the case in Miami yesterday)*.

*""That describes the current state of the 'Bitcoin economy'""*, the skeptic/critic might say, *""what about the future? One day there might be a lot of bitcoin-denominated debt, what then when those people can't pay it back when the value of the currency deflates?""*

It's not that simple; the world is dynamic so we can't just imagine that suddenly people have bitcoin-denominated debt-- they actually have to take it on. Will they? 

As our esteemed sage says in page 410 of his book Economics (Krugman, Wells, 2006), there's a difference between expected and unexpected deflation. He mentions it in the context of a liquidity trap and the inability of monetary policy to stimulate the economy due to the fact that nominal interest rates are zero bound (they can't go below zero). However, I'll use the distinction in the context of bitcoin to argue that we might never see a significant amount of lending denominated in bitcoin because agents *expect* deflation. Thus in only the most extreme cases, where a borrower knows that the investment they seek to finance is guaranteed to have a healthy ROI in bitcoin, will that borrower take out a loan in bitcoin at a &gt;0% rate. 

Now, perhaps these skeptics/critics might say they actually want a world with high amounts of debt, not low-debt as I've described. Fine, I'll concede that mass adoption of bitcoin as a currency might reduce the level of debt in society. (*Though, I'll be happy to take that to the masses and see which side of the more-debt/less-debt argument most people fall under.*) 

*But what I don't think they can casually say is that bitcoin adoption will lead to deflationary spirals.* I'm all ears, though, if you have a more drawn out argument. 

**tl;dr Deflation was bad in during the Great Depression and Japan in the 1990's mainly because it was unexpected and, most importantly, debt was denominated in dollars and yen (respectively) and created a deflationary spiral. I reject the handwaving argument that ""bitcoin is bad because it's deflationary"", if critics/skeptics don't acknowledge that we are unlikely to see much if any bitcoin-denominated debt (nor bitcoin-denominated wages/prices.)**",cryptocurrency,1388375943

personalfinance,Texas--25yr/old--student loans with money in the bank. Looking for advice..,"I already graduated with a degree. I do have significant amount of student loans, but I have money saved up and just currently fell into some additional cash. I'm struggling to decide what the smartest decision would be is.

My car I did not want a loan payment on, but I knew the dealer and got a sweet deal so I said screw it. I got a 2012 Ford Fusion with only 17,000 miles. Got it $3,500 under market value. Great on gas. 

I have company 401k 3.5% match. 

My details:

Salary: $31,536/yr after taxes ($657/week)

Savings: $25,000
Checkings: $1,300
New Cash: $35,000

Auto Loan: 
$13,700
257.14/mo
2.8% fixed

Student Loans:
Fed1 -- unsub
Princ--$21,532.35 ($278.29/mo)
7.9% fixed

Fed2 -- unsub
Princ--$13,122 ($169.58/mo)
7.9% fixed

Private1 -- unsub
Princ--$35,298 (236.84)
4.67% Stnd Var

Private2 -- unsub
Princ--$7,717 ($94.32/mo)
6.8% fixed

Currently I have the full amount of the loan auto debiting to build some credit. My thought is to blast the 'Private1' loan.

Anyway, I'm single with no kids. I am qualified for a promotion which will put me at 65k before taxes, I don't get it until a position opens up that I want. That will be 4 months max so since I'm not making that yet, I obviously am not factoring that in...

If there's any additional info that'd help, let me know. I'm looking for advice, preferably with an explanation :)",finance,1388517969
Bitcoin,A few observations from an outside observer,"I'm fairly familiar with bitcoin and economics and there are a few things that trouble me about the bitcoin community in general and this subreddit in particular:

* Price fluctuations make bitcoin unattractive for use as a day-to-day currency
* Price fluctuations make bitcoin unattractive for investment and lending
* Bitcoins are basically backed by dollars (or other fiat currencies)
* And most importantly, the cheerleaders here don't seem to recognize any of this.

And by the way, this is all coming from someone who would love to see bitcoin succeed as a stable currency.

The promise of bitcoin seems to be two pronged; first, it's like cash that's better than cash. There are no middle men, no (low) transaction fees, no delays, and no chargebacks, but it's secure and works across the globe. Second, it's libertarian friendly because it's free from direct government or corporate regulation or manipulation. However, the community that espouses these promises, doesn't seem to really believe in them when it comes down to brass tacks.

**Use as Day-to-Day Currency**

Bitcoin booms and busts are not good for bitcoin adoption. Wild fluctuations in price are not a good quality to have in a currency. Even strong increases, without later busts, are not good for bitcoin-as-a-currency. People want a currency to be boring and stable. However many people here cheer wildly and become incredibly smug about bitcoin's ""success"" when the price soars. This forum doesn't seem to value bitcoin-as-a-currency, it values bitcoin-as-a-speculative-commodity.

I decided to checkout [BitcoinStore](https://www.bitcoinstore.com) to see what shopping with bitcoins would be like. I checked out the price of two different goods there and at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com). The first was a [Pentax MX-1 12 MP Black Digital Camera](https://www.bitcoinstore.com/mx-1-black-classic-12mp-4xopt.html). At BitcoinStore it was 0.4773 BTC / $348.89. [At Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B46A1A8) it was $263.99. So not only is it cheaper at Amazon, but I don't have to go through the hassle of converting my USD into BTC to get it. How much will it cost me in fees just to make the conversion? The second item was a [Fellowes 55-Piece Computer Tool Kit](https://www.bitcoinstore.com/fellowes-55-piece-computer-maintenance-tool-kit.html). At BitcoinStore it was 0.0574 BTC / $41.78, and [at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Fellowes-55-Piece-Computer-Black-49106/dp/B00006HPZN) it was $36.99. Why would someone go through the hassle and cost of converting USD into BTC just to pay higher prices?

But, the higher prices weren't the primary the issue. While shopping, the price per BTC changed from $730.91 to $727.90, and the price of the camera went from 0.4773 BTC to 0.4793 BTC... While I was shopping! Can you imaging wheeling your shopping cart around the grocery store, putting things in your cart at one price, and by the time you get to the checkout, it's a different price? And not because the inherent price of the things you're buying changed, but because of your own currency's fluctuations? That's crazy. For bitcoin merchants this happens of course because everything is really priced in dollars, but more on that later.

**Use as Investment/Lending**

Obviously, there can be utility in investing *in bitcoins*, lot's of people are speculating on bitcoin. However, investing *with bitcoins* is another matter. Let's say I lend you $1000 and expect $1100 back from you in one year. That could be a good deal for both of us. Or, you know, if I don't think you're great with money, maybe I'd say that's a bad deal. Either way, we have a stable currency with which to value the transaction. With bitcoin I can't see how either the lender/investor nor the borrower would be able to accept that deal since neither has any idea what the value of bitcoins will be at the end of the year. The price could change so much that the 10% in interest charged could be meaningless in the face of the value change. This reminds me of the situation we were in when the government was trying to buy toxic assets. The market was frozen because no one knew what a good price should be. It wasn't just that they were valued very low, at least then people could agree on a price, it was that no one had any idea what the value was so no one wanted to buy or sell.

**Backed By USD**

Before my shopping experiment at BitcoinStore I honestly didn't know how they priced their goods. I didn't know whether the prices were in BTC (and the equivalent prices in USD fluctuated), or whether they really priced their goods in USD and the price in BTC fluctuated. After seeing the price of the camera fluctuate in order to keep the price the same in dollars it became obvious that bitcoins only have value right now because they're backed by the dollar. The only reason they're worth anything to anyone is because someone somewhere can get dollars back out. Otherwise the stores wouldn't peg their prices in USD, they would price them in BTC. But of course they can't do that because of the wild price fluctuations, who's going to buy a 5BTC consumer camera at this point? Interestingly, the shipping cost is quoted directly in USD in their FAQ without even the pretension of pricing in bitcoins. The fact that they (and I assume all other merchants) are really pricing in USD should tell you something. 

How much commerce do you think could happen in a world where one day a six pack of beer costs $10, then the next it's $1? The reason this happens in the bitcoin world is that bitcoins are actually backed by dollars! Everyone is always converting their prices to and from dollars to figure out how many BTC to charge. For all the talk of an anarcho capatilist crypto currency that's free of Fed manipulation, it seems awfully strange that every transaction is truly thought of in terms of dollars. This reminds me of an episode of Planet Money where they go to a libertarian free market utopia meetup where you can buy and sell unregulated beer and bacon with gold. Except everyone's constantly checking the price of gold to adjust their prices to make sure they're still getting the same price in dollars. Because everyone, even these anarcho-capatilist-fed-hating-libertarians, trust the value of dollars more than the value of gold. Just like every merchant that accepts bitcoins trusts dollars more than they trust bitcoins. So much for being free of manipulation. Maybe bitcoin's slogan should be, ""Bitcoins, backed by the full faith and credit of the US dollar.""

**Speculation Delusion**

Among those who only care about bitcoin as an investment opportunity, and don't care about its use to buy and sell actual things, there seems to be a lot of self and communal delusion. This is what you read on reddit when the price goes up:

&gt; That's the reason this ""bubble"" will never pop. Nobody will sell for chump change, when they know they can just wait for a few months and get dat profit.
 
&gt; So is everyone else, that's why it can't go down. Better buy now, until it goes even higher.
 
&gt; Hahah, I know that special bitcoin feeling :) Don't be afraid to jump in, water is really warm here

And this is what you read when the price goes down:

&gt; I bought in March. After it crashed I was laughing and bought more. This recent crash I wasn't able to buy more, but I would if I could. Welcome to Bitcoin.

Think about these reactions... So it's always good news no matter what the price does? Here's another way to think about it: redditors seem to like theories to be falsifiable and mock beliefs that aren't. I'm assuming bitcoin investors believe their investments to be sound and logical. This would require some model of the real world that suggests the price of bitcoin will go up. To be a good model, it must be falsifiable, right? So what would falsify this model? What series of events would be necessary to make these investors believe bitcoin isn't a smart investment? Neither the price going way up nor crashing seem to do so.

**Final Thoughts**

Again, I want bitcoin to succeed... as an awesome, hyper-liquid, international currency that's free from bank and exchange fees. I want to be able to buy anything anywhere in the world without worrying if it's going to be accepted or if there's a fee. I travel a lot and I've had so many annoyances with exchanging currencies and sending money to people abroad that I'm just sick of it. I've been hit with so many exchange fees and foreign transaction fees. I've had to use western union to send money to someone to rent an apartment. I mean, WESTERN UNION?! What century am I living in? I've arranged a multi-day tour for which I had to pay around $1000 in cash when I got there. My debit card limits wouldn't allow for that, and I wasn't going to do a cash advance on my credit card. So I thought the safest and easiest way to bring that money over was in travelers checks. Of course, upon arriving, I found that no bank in that country would cash travelers checks any more (I don't blame them, but I thought like western union, this might still be something that people do). Luckily the tour guide had a friend with a store that took credit cards so the friend charged my card and would give the tour guide the money when it came in from the credit card company minus the transaction fee. That means the tour guide paid the card processing fee and had to wait up to a month to get his money, I had to pay a foreign transaction fee, and I paid a fee to buy the useless travelers checks that I ended up depositing back into my checking account upon returning home. And this was only because we were lucky enough to have a guy so flexible and helpful about the payment.

So please don't think I'm just being a detractor and pooh-poohing on something that could be great. It's just that I see the ""community"" as being highly anti-productive.

personalfinance,"Reviewing finances, planning for 2014 and maybe buying a house?!","I am looking for an overall review of my finances and some guidance. I am 25 years old and not married, and have no debt.

* Salary = 75k per year, with ~ 10% raise and 10% bonus coming in two months. This trend will continue for several years.
* After deductions and taxes, my current takehome pay is around 4000 per month
* Expenses are roughly 1600-1800 per month
* $35,500 in online savings account @ .75%
* $1,000 in checking
* $4,500 in health savings account
* $47,000 in online brokerage account, invested ~75% in stocks and 25% equity mutual funds
* $46,500 in 401k
* $21,500 in Roth IRA

Retirement and Healthcare stuff:

* Maxed my Roth IRA for the past 3 years and would like to do the same for 2014
* Currently contributing 10% of my gross pay to my 401k, which my employer matches up to 4%
* I am currently contributing nothing to my HSA, but my employer puts in $1000 per year into it.

I am considering buying a house in the next 6 months. It's not 100% certain, but it is likely. I am looking in the 175k-250k range depending on a variety of factors (still trying to decide exactly what I want). I would like to be able to put 20% down on the house to avoid PMI, so there's that. My FICO score is somewhere around 785.

Questions:

* Roth IRA for 2014: The past 3 years I have put put in money on the first of the year to maximize time in the market. Or should I DCA it for this year so I have more money on hand for a down payment? Or just wait 'til after the house is settled and deal with it then?
* 401k Contribution: Should I try to up my contribution percentage? I could easily contribute way more, even max it out, but then I would have less liquid cash for down payment.
* HSA: Should I start contributing to this? I believe the max I can do is 2300 per year, since my employer puts in 1000. So that would be around 200 per month. Again, I could do this, but it means less cash sitting around for down payment.
* Is 35k too much to have in my savings account right now? Should I switch some of that into my online brokerage and invest it? Assuming I would keep it relatively liquid so I could tap into it if needed for downpayment.
* Part of the reason I want to buy a house is that I know home prices and interest rates are going to continue to climb. How much would I actually be screwing myself if I waited until June 2015, rather than June 2014, to buy a place?

Added: additional **1,000,000Ɖ** for interview. 

------------------------
*Rules:*

1.  The sign must say dogecoin.com with an easy to read emphasis on the 'dogecoin'.  The reason for this is to ingrain the important dogecoin message but also lead proactive viewers to the site rather than the double effort of googling.
2.  We must see your face for payout.
3.  Get evidence you were there with the sign.  Personal photos of your face and the sign and the environment will later allow an easy payout when you claim it.
4.  The sign must be clearly visible on the broadcasted show.  If it's too far in the background and just a speck on the screen, unfortunately this can't count toward payout.  The reddit users will have consensus on what was eligible.  If the dogecoin url is easy to read and visible long enough for the common viewer to read-- even for two seconds-- that is without a doubt eligible.
5.  If multiple people get eligible exposure for their signs, payout will be equally split regardless of who had more airtime.
6.  Get creative!  The dogecoin logo is very interesting and eye-catching but also remember to include dogecoin.com in bold lettering!
7.  I can't watch every second of the show but I'm dvr'ing it and will scan through.  If you held a sign, you should also check a recording afterward and comment in this thread.  I'm sure fellow redditors will see you as well.

personalfinance,From -$80k to +$65k in four and a half years. What now?,"I finished school in summer 2009 with no savings, $60k in student loans (the program cost more than $200k in tuition and fees, the rest was scholarships and paid from working during school). I also had a personal loan for $5k and a car loan of $15k.

**summer 2009 net worth: -$80k**

I took a job straight out of school at $60k and worked at the company for a year. I got a raise around six months in to $85k. I lived in a big city so my cost of living was high. I didn't save any money, but sold the car to recoup what I owed on it.

**summer 2010 net worth: -$65k**

I was unhappy with the company so I started applying for new jobs shortly after the sixth month, I applied at a ton of places and was rejected many times. Finally I found a new job and got a salary bump to $95k. At my departure, I purchased my vested stock options. Still no savings, but I paid towards the principal of my highest interest student loans (&gt;6%) over the next year. I continued to rent in a high cost city where I really enjoyed living.

**summer 2011 net worth: -$50k**

Again, I continued working in the job for a year. I had an opportunity to try and make a side project into full time work so I quit my steady job to take a chance following a dream. I again purchased my vested stock options. I continued to earn $95k while I tried to turn my side project into a real venture. I stopped living in a high cost city and traveled around the world since I could work independent of location. Still no savings, but I continued to pay down principal on my highest interest rate student loans.

**summer 2012 net worth: -$35k**

My risky side project didn't work out, so I started looking for a job again and found one pretty easily thanks to the newly acquired skills from my previous jobs and entrepreneurial pursuit. Since it was my own project I didn't end up with any equity (or rather, the equity worked out to be worthless). I still work remotely and I got a salary bump to $120k. The company also offers 401k matching up to 4% of salary and fully funds an HSA account up to the limit. I continued to pay my highest interest student loans first and decided to start saving in my 401k up to the maximum that earns me employer matching.

**summer 2013 net worth: -$25k**

I was given a pay raise to $126k at my one year anniversary and I began to vest my stock option grant from my current employer. I contributed $12k to my 401k and $5.5k to my Roth 401k to reach the maximum allowed. My employer also fully funded my HSA account again this year. I put $4k into a brokerage account and bought a few stocks that I want to hold for the long term.

I decided to make a balance sheet like a company to outline my assets and liabilities to calculate my current net worth. Things are a lot more complicated this year, here's the summary:

*Assets +$94k*

* Cash $15k
* Retirement $37k
* Stocks $4k
* Employee equity $38k

*Liabilities -$29k*

* Student loans $29k (2% interest)

**Net worth: +$65k**

I'm planning to save as much as possible in 2014 and I'm currently working on an allocation strategy. I'd love advice from you all on how to allocate and in which types of accounts.

Here's my current plan of additions for 2014

Simple 80/20 stocks/bonds using low cost index tracking

* $17,500 in 401k (not sure how to split into roth)
* $5,500 in Roth IRA (if I'm eligible)
* $3,250 into the HSA by my employer
* $25k+ somewhere else?

**Questions:**

* How do I decide how much to put into the employer Roth vs standard 401k? My earnings are right on the cusp of being able to have a Roth IRA due to income limits. Does it make sense to contribute enough to the 401k so that I'm under the income limit for the Roth IRA? This will lead to a larger total savings, but less in a Roth account.
* How should I handle allocations and rebalancing across accounts? In 2014 I could potentially have the employer account, HSA, a separate Roth IRA, and then a taxable account. Each account would have access to different funds. Does it make sense to have each account split according to my desired asset allocation or should I just look at the whole picture and do what has the least fees? What if that puts me in a situation where I can't easily rebalance between stocks/bonds?
* Where would you recommend I put the additional savings that I can't get into a tax advantaged account? Does it make sense to make my taxed savings represent the stock or bond portion of the portfolio for tax reasons?
* I'm considering purchasing a property with two houses/apartments in the next 2-3 years so that I can do a live/rent combo. How would you recommend saving for that?
* Do you recommend paying off the low interest student loans in full, or riding them out for a while?

dogecoin,Buy mining rigs or dogecoin directly ?,"Previously posted at /r/dogemining, but since there's a lot more activity here, I just thought to ask for a second opinion. Sorry if it's again the rule or something.

I'm currently mining a bit on my laptop at 40kh/s, and I don't even dare to push it that much for fear of overheating. Feeling quite fed up of the situation now. I have about $1000 to spare and I'm thinking about using that to buy a nicer mining rig with R9 280x graphic card, which I believe can do 600kh/s from what I read. Going by online calculator, this should pull about 18k doges each day. 

Do you think this is a better deal as opposed to just directly buying dogecoins from the market bit by bit each month (say $100 or $200 worth of doges per month). I heard that the difficulty is going to double within a month or so, and mining is not going to be profitable anymore by then ? But at least, in case dogecoin crashes and fails to take off to the moon then at least I would be left with a nice desktop that I can use for other purposes. 

Tl;dr: have $1000. Buy mining rig or buy doges ?

Please up vote if you like this. I'm sure a lot of newbies Shibe are also in the same dilemma !

personalfinance,Sudden windfall. Company got acquired. What do I do now?,"I'm in my early 40s.  Ever since I started my career I've always been well compensated.  I have two technical degrees and 15+ years experience as an engineer.  About 7 years ago I left the big corporate world and joined a start up.  Well it just paid off.  We got acquired.

A little history: I've been maxing out my 401k ( no match ), contributing to two 529c ( $300 / mo each ) for the kids education and saving a ( very ) little on the side and growing equity in the home, but in reality my expenses have pretty much kept up with my income.  House, two kids, two cars, student loans, etc.   I made a decent amount $145k + 10% bonus, but it always felt like I was treading water.  That was until last week.

So here's the pay day:

We got acquired by a big publicly traded company.  After months of dilligence the deal closed and the first checks were cut.

My vested options are worth just a hair over $1 million.  After taxes this turned into $450k ( options get taxed as regular income and the dollar amount is so high that it's the top tax bracket so 56% taxes ) which got paid out and the check cleared last week.  Merry Christmas to me and fuck you to the government.  If you haven't been taxed at over 50% I don't recommend it.  It hurts.

I have another $1.4 million in options that will vest over the course of the next three years and half years.  These options converted to options in the acquiring company which is publicly traded.  If the company does well I stand to make more and if they don't I stand to lose quite a bit.  Each month roughly 2-3% of the option grant vests.  So I have almost $30k / month coming to me for the next three years plus years.

$312k is being held in escrow to cover any unanticipated costs the acquirer has pay out.  This is just my share.  There is actually $20-30 million held in escrow.  What doesn't get spent goes back to the share holders.  They are saying in a typical acquisition less 30% gets spent so I should get about $220k back at the end of two years.

In addition my income has taken quite a jump.  I went from $145k + $14,500 ( 10% bonus ) to $260k + $65k ( 25% bonus ).  The acquiring company also granted me $650k worth of restricted stock.  This grant vests 25% a year for the next four years.

They also said if the acquisition goes well I should get a $400k restricted stock grant at my one year anniversary.

So what the fuck should I do?  I did all the normal stuff.  I paid off my high interest debt and student loans.  My mortgage is 3.65% and doesn't seem worth paying down.  My car loan is even lower at 1.71%.

Savings accounts and CDs are paying total shit interest rates %0.05.  A ten year TIPS is %0.6 which hardly seems worth it.  Put everything in equities? Index mutual funds with low fees?  Wealth management people have been hounding me, but honestly they just seem like fee taking middle men.  I had a Merrill Lynch financial advisor ten years ago and he charged me really high fees and gave generally shitty advice.  I opened a Schwab account and have been generally happy with dong this self-service.  I'll be damned if I pay someone to lose my money.  I'll lose it myself thank you very much.

One of the co-founders, my boss, friend and mentor has done this before and gave me the following advice, ""Do not change your lifestyle for at least one year.  Get accustomed to the new wealth before you change how you live.""  He is basically the only one I can talk about this with, but his time is very hard to come by and I don't feel it's appropriate to bug him with my problems.  My family and friends never had money, or at least not like this.  They thought I was rich at $140k.  

TL;DR I came into a bunch of money with even more on the way.  I don't know what to do with it and there is no one to talk to.",finance,1388463280

personalfinance,"Pay off 3.12% student loan quickly, or put money into 401(k) and pay student loan slowly?","Facts --

* My savings ability is $1500/mo
* My student loan balance is $54,000
* My student loan interest rate is 3.12%
* I have $14k in the bank ($8.5k is dedicated emergency fund; I need $18k dedicated for it to be a 6 month fund)
* Employer does not match 401(k) contributions and 401(k) is empty.
* My age is 31.

Question: Given the absurdly low interest rate on my student loan, once I get my emergency fund up to a 6-month fund (which I will be able to do within the next year), would it not make more sense to put any 'extra' money into my 401(k) than to put extra money into the loan principal?  As far as I know, 401(k)s and Stafford loans are more or less immune to bankruptcy, and Stafford loans vanish when you die (explicitly).  Also, if my income drops to a certain level I can start on a 25-year forgiveness program which could result in paying significantly less than the full amount of the loan.

Alternately, I could pay the loan off as quickly as possible, and then put my former loan payment + my current savings ability into the 401(k), but years later.  I'm already maxing out HSA.

So, recommendations?

EDIT: Doing some of my own research I just noticed that if I put a bunch of money into 401(k), my adjusted gross income goes down and I could potentially qualify for income based repayment much sooner.",finance,1388460897

personalfinance,Am I on the right track?,"Hi, I've been lurking this subreddit for a bit time, and decided to create an account to see what you guys think of my situation: 

I'm 25, having finished grad school a year and a half ago.  Currently, I'm working in a residency-type position, where I'm making about $68.5k a year.  My training will be done at the end of June, and I'll have to find a permanent position elsewhere then.  In my field, I am fairly positive I'll be able to find a job before I finish or maybe a few months thereafter (I already have a lead or two).  Once I get a permanent position, I will start off making $120k +/- $20k.   

I left school with $27.5k in federal loans (the ""sticker price"" for the 6 years at my private university was ~$300k, so I feel okay with that) at an interest rate of 6.55%, and have whittled that down to $19.7k as of today (paying $800/month).  Also, I recently purchased a new car after my old beater died on me; I owe $20.5k (paying $500/month, 0.9% interest rate).  I have a few credit cards, but never carry a balance on them (mostly for churning/sign up bonuses/etc.).

I've come up with the following break down of my monthly expenses: [here](http://imgur.com/5SJnCyb)

These are conservative figures, so I would say that I can expect to have at least an extra $650/month.  

A few other things to note: I have $3k as an emergency fund in an Ally savings account.  Also, I just started a Roth IRA with Vanguard...I put $4k into the Target Retirement 2055 Fund (I figured, worst-case-scenario, I could withdrawal my contributions if it takes me longer than expected to find a job).  My employer offers a 403b savings plan, but I'm not contributing to that since there is no sort of employer match; do let me know if you think I should.  

Any idea of what I should do with the rest of my money each month?  Add another $1500 to max out the Roth IRA?  Keep it in my savings account?  403b?  Any other help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.",finance,1388458277

personalfinance,Court Summons &amp; Filing Bankruptcy,"There's quite the history to my financial hot mess, so I'll try to keep it concise. About an hour ago I got hit with a summons and complaint small claims. I have a court date on the 9th. I'm not 100% sure what it entails. One bank is suing me for about $2073. It's the first one I've gotten so far. Otherwise, I get letters and phone calls.

Short-ish version: I'm 26, got caught in about $20,000 worth amount of credit card debt, but haven't been able to pay it since I have student loans in repayment. I had enrolled in a debt management plan for 12 months, was doing really well paying everything, and then about $500 of private loans went into repayment.  I stopped paying all but 1 credit card in September 2012. I have one year of school left. I have roughly $800 take home, and after all my private loans and rent to my mom, I have $100 to my name. After years of compound interest and trying to defer my loans, my combined private and federal loans total somewhere around $115,000. I have no more deferment or forbearance options on any of them because it's been over 5 years. 

I live at home, I do not own a car, I do not have health insurance, and I don't really have anything of value to my name. My father is deceased, my mother is disabled, so there's nowhere to get money from. I get food stamps because my income is so low. My cell phone is a tracfone because I can't afford a monthly plan.

I plan on filing bankruptcy at some point in 2014- my parents did a few years ago, my brother is in the process now. 

So, advice? I go to the court date and say what? When do I get a lawyer and start filing? Thanks in advance.

Added: I pulled up a report through Experian. It seems like a lot of stuff has been charged off,  one sold to another lender, and only one bothered to go to collections, which is the bank suing me. I've got about $15,000 in past due combined. A few have been charged off without anything due. Do I still owe those? This is overall kind of confusing. 

Edit: added some more info",finance,1388448571
